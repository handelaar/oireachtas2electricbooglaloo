    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the commission of inquiry is independent and does not report to me. The timescale for completion of the report is a matter for Mr. Justice Barron. I am hopeful that he will be able to complete his report as soon as possible, but that will be influenced by the amount of material he receives from the British authorities. Mr. Justice Barron had a useful meeting with the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, on 17 January and outlined his requirements. Dr. Reid promised that material would be provided within weeks. In addition, Mr. Justice Barron recently met representatives of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and material is also expected from that source.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Barron has agreed that his report into the bombings will reflect his consideration of other cases, including the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Castleblaney bombing of 1976, the case of John Francis Green, and the case of Bríd Carr. I am very grateful for his work to date and for agreeing to report on these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is no doubt aware of the disappointment expressed, in particular by the families of the 33 victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, whom he has met, as have I. They expressed strong disappointment with the meeting between the Secretary of State, Dr. Reid, and Mr. Justice Barron. Can the Taoiseach tell us what transcribed at that meeting and what commitment was given? Has any of the documentation requested been provided to date and what are the Taoiseach's expectations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Barron does not report to me, but the report which he has passed on states he had a very good meeting with Dr. Reid. Dr. Reid was very forthcoming, took careful note of the files and the information required by Mr. Justice Barron and both he and his officials undertook to research and provide them. I understand from officials working with Mr. Justice Barron that Dr. Reid and his colleagues asked for a number of weeks to prepare what was sought. It is now three weeks since the meeting. It was not expected to have the information by <Col N="203" /> now as Dr. Reid's officials requested that they be allowed until March to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The content of the Taoiseach's reply poses the question: why has the British Government not been forthcoming before now? How can it promise to make this information available within weeks, when it is over a year since it was first asked for it and nothing was forthcoming then? The Taoiseach stated the timescale for the inquiry is a matter for Mr. Justice Barron, but I am sure he believes that he has a commitment to the relatives to conclude it before the life of this Dáil ends. If that is not possible, will an interim report be made available before the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been gravely disappointing that the British authorities have not been able to provide this information more quickly. The Deputy is totally correct in that. We have pressed them very hard to do so and it was only after direct meetings with the British Prime Minister regarding the matter that he agreed to set up the meetings. The question now is whether the British authorities have this information. Mr. Justice Barron has established what it is he requires and, while I am not privy to it, I sense that he, and before him the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, pieced together an enormous amount of information. They have established what to look for, but whether what is sought exists, I do not know. I hope it does. Mr. Justice Barron at least felt at the end of his meeting, as has been reported to me, that it was a good meeting and that he believed there would be a genuine search and retrieval system put in place to try to fill in this information, although it has taken a year as the Deputy stated.</P>
      <P>On the second matter, as Mr. Justice Barron has gone through it, they have documented all the information that they have over the past two years or so. It really depends on the extent of the information they receive from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and from the British authorities, the NIO or wherever else. That really will determine the information that they have.</P>
      <P>The other cases that I mentioned are ones which Mr. Justice Barron has agreed to deal with, but his work to date has crossed many of these cases anyway and therefore I do not think that will create any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the meeting which Dr. John Reid had with Mr. Justice Barron, apart from being a good meeting and the Secretary of State being very forthcoming, included anything by way of an agreement to hand over information or a timescale for the implementation of such an agreement, which would be of some succour to the victims and their families? Will he give an opinion on their own view, that essentially what is needed is the establishment of a cross-jurisdictional tri<Col N="204" /> bunal of inquiry, which they believe &ndash; they have legal advice on this &ndash; could be done under the 1920 UK tribunals Act? If that is not possible, will the Taoiseach indicate whether a public tribunal of inquiry is to be set up as the next best option, which is their view? As they have legal advice, can I ask the Taoiseach to investigate further the veracity of that legal advice, which indicates the 1920 UK tribunals Act might be a basis for a cross-jurisdictional tribunal of inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given all the information I have about that meeting with Dr. John Reid. As I said, the tribunal is independent but they have given me that information for use in the House. Dr. Reid promised that material would be provided within weeks and I think there was an understanding between Dr. Reid and Mr. Justice Barron about what &ldquo;within weeks&rdquo; meant, but that is an understanding between them.</P>
      <P>On the other matter, the Deputy is ranging into another area. What we had agreed with the families, the relatives, their spokespersons and their legal representatives was that this process would be undertaken by Mr. Justice Hamilton, now deceased, and Mr. Justice Barron who kindly took up the brief. Both of them put an enormous amount of work into it. At the end of that process it will be reported to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, as we agreed here, and then we will have to see where we will go from there. Until this stage is finished, however, we should not get into looking at any other stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to put to the Taoiseach arising from the replies he has given to the House. Do I take it that Mr. Justice Barron has now identified fairly concisely the areas around which he is seeking information from the British authorities and that therefore the massive trawl through reams of files is not necessary in that they have been pinpointed? The Taoiseach seemed to indicate that when he replied on 13 November. If that is the case, whatever is in those files, they ought to be located fairly soon. Would that be correct?</P>
      <P>If I am correct in assuming that in order to facilitate co-operation between the British and Irish Governments the Taoiseach gave the impression in Donegal recently that, in so far as the Irish Government had any documentation that would be of interest to the Saville inquiry, documentation in the hands of the security authorities south of the Border relating to Bloody Sunday and the events surrounding Bloody Sunday, would be made available to the British authorities in general and to the Saville inquiry in particular, can the Taoiseach confirm whether information under the control of the Irish authorities, including the Government, has been made available to the Saville inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's first question, Mr. Justice Barron and his team have <Col N="205" /> identified their requirements and have pieced together the sequence as they believe it. I said that any records or information we had should be made available but that was a long time ago and I honestly do not know if the offer was taken up. I can check if the Deputy wishes. I do not know if they asked for it but I certainly made that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the key issue in making requests to the British Government has always been to establish if it had information about any possible participation by people associated with it in the bombing incidents. That is what we are all dancing around. Apart from asking for such files, what particular requests has Mr. Justice Barron made to confine information to more specific areas? Was there any reluctance on the part of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Reid, to provide access to the files of the British army, RUC or intelligence agencies based in the United Kingdom, in addition to normal departmental files which may contain reports on what happened on that awful day in Dublin and Monaghan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that Mr. Justice Barron is independent. I do not have the list of questions he put. As I already told Deputy Quinn, the commission is very clear about what it wishes to obtain. The information I have is that Mr. Justice Barron believes his meeting with Dr. Reid was useful and that Dr. Reid was forthcoming. Some questions remain. Does that information still exist? If it does, to what extent does it exist and what help will be files in the Northern Ireland Office or elsewhere? I do not know if those records exist or what contacts or relationships there are with either the British army or other intelligence agencies. Mr. Justice Barron is very clear about the information he is seeking and has focused in on what he believes the facts to be but it is a question of how much information remains. Mr. Justice Barron is adamant that information must be available in some form, as was Mr. Justice Hamilton before him. During the investigations, people who helped from outside have seen reports, which I believe to be correct, in which people provided names, facts and circumstances. All of those have been followed through. We must await the report for the quantification of those facts and to find out whether these people are real and what their relationships and involvement were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that helpful reply. While we acknowledge that Dr. Reid was trying to be helpful, did he actually confirm the existence of files which might be of help to Mr. Justice Barron or did he simply repeat the commitment given by the British Government on a number of occasions to be helpful if such files existed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Reid indicated that <Col N="206" /> material would be made available. It took quite a long time to arrange the meeting and it is clear from our exchanges here what they focused on. I would be surprised, although perhaps I should not, had the existence of information not been checked. Time will tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the significant investment in resources and the enormity of the crimes committed, has the Taoiseach given any thought to the possibility of advertisements being placed in prominent international newspapers offering a reward to those who may be able to provide useful information? Has he given any thought to using the mechanism of the Good Friday Agreement to highlight where the information sought by the commission is not forthcoming from the British Government? Will the Taoiseach clarify if the Attorney General can say whether the State has any right under international law to demand the co-operation being sought by the Barron commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the final question, the information has been promised. The issue of the Attorney General seeking international powers should not arise.</P>
      <P>The issue of advertisements was raised by the relatives at an early stage and it was agreed that advertisements would be placed in all the Irish national newspapers and the main ones in Northern Ireland. That was done and there was no request to go further. Those advertisements were reported extensively in newspapers in America and the United Kingdom. They received broad circulation and I understand they also received publicity on the Internet. They were publicised widely.</P>
      <P>I do not have any proposal to offer a reward. I understand some people outside both jurisdictions who would have been involved at the time have come forward. This has been reported in the media. I hope it will not be necessary to resort to offering a reward. We continue to communicate with the families and to keep open the lines of co-operation with them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>It is two years last month since the commission was established and 12 months since the first formal request to the British Government for information and documents was made. Does it strike the Taoiseach that the actions of that Government are those of one anxious to assist in getting to the truth of the atrocities of Dublin and Monaghan? Does it not rather strengthen the suspicion that the British Government's security service is deliberately dragging its heels because it has something to hide? What does the Taoiseach make of this inordinate delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has requested the commission to investigate another series of atrocities and unsolved events which require investigation. Has he discussed with Mr. Justice Barron if it is his intention to investigate everything before <Col N="207" /> reporting or to report first on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the initial reason for the commission's establishment? In this regard, does the Taoiseach believe it would be a good idea that an interim report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings would come before the Dáil before it is dissolved in a few months' time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see the report as soon as possible. That is my clear position, although it is perhaps a new Dáil which will examine it in committee and decide on further action.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the cases I mentioned will not delay the commission. Mr. Justice Barron has read himself through the entire period and all the information we have. The other cases I have mentioned fall into his work and form part of it. He has read and, I think, reached conclusions on these cases. Mr. Justice Barron and his officials have gone back to the late 1960s and early 1970s and have gone through everything in the past 30 years or more. These cases have been worked through in the overall Dublin-Monaghan investigation and they will not delay matters. The families of those involved in those cases are concerned that we reach a conclusion so they do not cause a difficulty.</P>
      <P>There is one other case which I have not mentioned and on which a conclusion has not yet been reached. Talks are ongoing with the family in this case and it is not certain if the family will agree. The bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973, in both of which incidents people were killed, the case of John Francis Greene who was killed in Monaghan and Bríd Clarke who was killed outside Lifford are longstanding cases and have created difficulties locally. However, these cases will not delay the work.</P>
      <P>I cannot add anything to what I have said. We have put a great deal of pressure on the British Government at every level. We have now at least been granted meetings with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who know what Mr. Justice Barron and his team are seeking to do and appreciate his concerns regarding linkages and contacts in the PSNI, the Northern Ireland Office or other arms of the administration in Northern Ireland which he believes could be helpful. I hope useful information will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I do not believe an interim report would be useful until this information is received. As Mr. Justice Barron and his colleagues have gone through the work in the past two years they have been weighing up the facts and the documents. They are not waiting until all information has been collated before starting to work on the facts.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>In view of the scale of the massacre of innocent people in Dublin and Monaghan, does the Taoiseach agree the construction of a commemorative monument would be appropriate to preserve the memory of those who were killed in 1974? Their families feel aggrieved and <Col N="208" /> forgotten and such a gesture would at least preserve the memory of those who died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a monument in Dublin. I am in favour of helping the families in whatever way we can. I hope they do not feel as forgotten as they did because we have spent much time and effort working with them. I know they have worked particularly well with Mr. Justice Barron, as they did with Mr. Justice Hamilton. There is an annual commemorative Mass which many Members from all sides of the House regularly attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the process which has informed the House's search for clarity and truth and notwithstanding his recently expressed views about the value of an interim report, does the Taoiseach agree Mr. Justice Barron has done all he can, and had reached this stage more than a year ago? I was informed of this by the members of the Justice for the Forgotten group whom I met last autumn. Mr. Justice Barron has identified the questions to which he requires responses from the British Government. If he does not get these responses by the end of this month will the Taoiseach ask him to publish an interim report to the House? The House will probably not return after the Easter break if the general election is to take place in May. It is necessary not only for justice to be done but to be seen to be done. A report, which may not be conclusive but which points to a conclusion, would be better than no report at all.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will make that judgment when the information is available. It will be a number of weeks before the data are available. It is not true to say he did nothing else all last year other than wait for the British. I did not wish to give that impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He has. He has also painstakingly gone through Garda records and other data, which is the reason the other cases are easier for him to deal with. It all focuses on the operation behind the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, which is what people have been suspicious about for the past 28 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach now has a commitment from Mr. Justice Barron and Dr. Reid that the required information will be forthcoming within a matter of weeks. If it is not, what action will he take? If it is, will a decision be made at that stage to either go ahead with an interim report, if appropriate, or a final report before the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally in the hands of Mr. Justice Barron. General elections may come and go, but finding the truth in regard to an issue which is 28 years old will be more important for <Col N="209" /> the families. Mr. Justice Barron or his team will not go away, therefore the date does not matter. What matters is that Mr. Justice Barron will get as much of the truth as possible. According to officials, it really depends on how much information can be obtained and how long it will take. If Mr. Justice Barron gets nothing, I am sure he will take one view and if he receives an enormous amount of information, he will have to sift through it. It is an impossible question to answer at this stage. There is no argument that everyone in this House wishes to see the report completed. It is in the hands of a good person and team and we must wait for it to be concluded. If for some reason the British authorities refuse to co-operate, that is a different matter. However, that is not the position as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Newspaper reports on the meeting of 19 January between Mr. Justice Barron and Dr. Reid suggest that documents emanating from RUC files and the forensic services of Northern Ireland would be available. However, there was a doubt cast on whether documents from Whitehall or security sources in London would be available. Will the Taoiseach clarify the issue? Second, if Mr. Justice Barron is dissatisfied with progress in providing information or with the information provided, will the Taoiseach undertake to report to the House and make a full statement as soon as he receives the information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second question is yes, if Mr. Justice Barron reports to me. Last year we were advised to exert pressure to obtain the information. I will do the same now if that is his judgment. To reiterate what I said, Mr. Justice Barron has asked for all the information he needs in order to best identify the facts and circumstances. I have no information that any of the information will not be given other than that they will co-operate to the best of their ability. He had separate meetings with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I believe an assistant commissioner dealt with him on the issue. It was very forthcoming in endeavouring to be helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nally report contained two recommendations relating to the re-organisation of the Chief State Solicitor's office. The first recommended that, subject to agreement on adequate staffing <Col N="210" /> levels and appropriate staff structures, the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office be transferred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to form a unit headed by a solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation is that responsibility for the State solicitors be transferred from the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions, with legislative provision to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to delegate to them.</P>
    <P>The first of these recommendations has now been fully implemented. The formal transfer of responsibility for criminal prosecution work to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions took place on 3 December 2001. The transfer of personnel from the Chief State Solicitor's office to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions also took place on that date.</P>
    <P>The transfer of responsibility for the State solicitor service, which will require legislation, is currently under consideration. Proposals are being developed with regard to how the State solicitor service will be managed by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The proposals will be discussed with the State Solicitors' Association as part of the arrangements for the formal transfer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm if a prosecution solicitor has been appointed at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions? If so, what are the functions of this person? If not, what functions are envisaged once such a person is appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That person has been appointed. He was appointed earlier on in the process so he could organise the changes that were envisaged in the Nally report. This involved working to develop a common pool of staff, developing the new structures in compliance with the 1974 Act, and handling all the arrangements that were put in place. The individual concerned, who has a prosecution role, reports directly to the DPP, is responsible to the DPP and acts in his capacity as solicitor to the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions arise from the Taoiseach's reply. On 14 November 2001, the Taoiseach indicated there would be an increase of 75 staff, approximately 66 of whom would be in the professional and technical complements. Will he indicate what the present level of staffing is and whether all the additional professionals have, in fact, been recruited? Secondly, will he indicate what the position is with regard to the new premises which were acquired in Abbey Street and were expected to be ready for occupation by the end of January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The new premises on Abbey Street were occupied on 25 or 28 January &ndash; the last week in January. The figures pertaining to the DPP &ndash; not the Chief State Solicitor's office <Col N="211" />&ndash; are 55 and 20. Of the 55 additional posts in the legal-administrative grades &ndash; 29 posts in the professional, legal and technical areas &ndash; 17 have been filled. Eight remain to be filled and four remain to be filled in the legal-technical field. The interviews have taken place for those. Further progress may have been made in the past few days. The only delay was in terms of office accommodation and this was due to interviewing and filling posts at the same time. There were 21 posts in the administrative areas, seven of which have been filled with four at interview stage. Of three posts in the IT area, two have been filled and one is waiting to be filled. The two library posts have been filled. The clerical staff are now being recruited by the Civil Service Commission. The office has just advertised for technical staff and a recruitment campaign for its main professional staff either has, or is about to, commence.</P>

      <P>The projected total cost of the communications unit for this year is &euro;237,158. This figure includes salaries, shift allowances and the operational costs of the unit. Also included in the figure are the salaries of the five staff that are on secondment to the unit from other Departments. Approximately &euro;80,842 of the projected cost is appropriate to my Department's Vote, with on average &euro;31,263 being the projected cost to each of the other five Department's involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering the last question on this matter the Taoiseach gave the cost of his Department at around £55,000. He subsequently wrote to me giving the costs to line Departments of the seconded staff, which came to £200,000. Has the Taoiseach employed any additional staff in the unit since then? Does he intend expanding the staff on the run-in to the general election? Does he agree that because this unit services Ministers rather than any other Deputy, it confers on Ministers an unfair advantage, not only over the Opposition, but also over Deputies in their own parties who might be their running mates? Would he agree to stand down the unit in the run-in to the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the staff have reduced by one member who has been promoted. There are no extra staff and there are no proposals to extend their number. I have no intention of standing the unit down because it has nothing to do with a general election. It merely gathers information that is in the public domain and transfers it to several hundred individuals across Departments, of whom Ministers and Ministers of <Col N="212" /> State would make up only a small proportion. It, therefore, saves significant costs and makes the service more efficient. It is not in any way propping up any political office.</P>

We would all know what he is concerned about, if it is not a political monitoring system.</P>

      <P>It is not political. It merely reports and gives the ministerial and Civil Service system the news of the day and reports on what is happening daily.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That happened on one occasion several years ago. No more than any of our press offices do at a political level, the unit supplies straightforward headlines and information to the Civil Service. It does not put any spin or twist on it. It merely contains straightforward civil servants who are doing a job as they would in any other Department of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the suspicious origins of the unit and the fact that it was run in a very political way by its original director, Marty Whelan, can we not all test the accuracy of the Taoiseach's protestations by making the documentation available to every elected Member of the House? We would all then be aware of the concerns of the monitoring system.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been made available to several people under freedom of information requests in the recent past. Only one request several years ago was refused. People can see it is no more than a report on the day's headlines and events updated on an hourly basis. Like any other service within it, it is totally run and organised by the Civil Service and in no way influenced by the political system.</P>

      <P>I want to be clear on what the unit does. Would it supply a tape of a programme such as &ldquo;Questions and Answers,&rdquo; shown last night, to Departments for viewing by officials or Ministers? If, for example, Deputy Jim Higgins was interviewed on Lite FM, would it provide transcripts of the interview? Would it do so without comments or advice? Does it supply transcripts of the more lurid interviews of the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan?</P>

      <P>It does not do programmes like that unless requested, but it has the capability to do so. We bought in such programmes from outside the Department for many years which was a costly system. Such programmes are provided without comment. I assure Deputy Higgins that any transcript provided would be given without comment, reflect only what a person said and not contain any spins or anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department, I met the chairman of Aer Rianta on 16 January 2002. We discussed the chairman's written response by letter of 11 January 2002 to my request for full particulars of the circumstances surrounding transit of the person referred to through Dublin Airport on his return <Col N="215" /> from the US after Christmas on 29 December 2001.</P>
      <P>The essential factors, as reported by the chairman and discussed between us, were that Mr. Dermot O'Leary, a member of the board of Aer Rianta, on foot of a request on 28 December from the family of the person referred to asked the duty manager at Dublin Airport if anything could be done on compassionate grounds to facilitate the person's smooth arrival as his wife was very upset at the prospect of the return to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The duty manager undertook to facilitate the request in so far as he could and, on leaving his duty, said he would advise the incoming duty manager of the position. The duty manager then contacted the airport director, Mr. Dermot O'Leary, to advise that the family could be facilitated strictly on the basis that the person in question presented himself to immigration and customs in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The person referred to arrived on 29 December and cleared immigration in the ordinary way. The duty sergeant then spoke to the customs officer on duty who consented to the family not walking through customs in the ordinary way. They collected their baggage from the conveyor belt in the ordinary way and then, accompanied by the duty sergeant, exited the baggage hall through the nearby staff entrance and not through the normal public entrance. They then walked directly across the public arrivals area and onto the public street to their car.</P>
      <P>This facility, not available in the normal course of events, was afforded on compassionate grounds for the wife of the person referred to. It appears that nothing illegal was done in this procedure.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I subsequently received on 16 January 2002 an unreserved apology from Dermot O'Leary in relation to his involvement in this matter and I accepted his apology. I subsequently briefed the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The matter of the appropriate protocol to be adopted in future in relation to the transit of high profile people through Dublin Airport is under active consideration by Aer Rianta.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's policy in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann and Iarnród Éireann's business plan for the rail freight sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been assured by the chairman that CIE has no intention of closing down any part of the rail network. This is in line with a Government decision of March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A business strategy in relation to rail freight was submitted to the board of CIE for consideration. Having considered the business strategy, I have been advised that the board decided that Iarnród Éireann should continue to operate rail <Col N="217" /> freight services and investment was approved by the board to provide freight handling facilities in the North Wall area in Dublin.</P>
    <P>On 28 January 2002 I announced I would shortly commission a strategic rail study. This is intended to provide a blueprint for the future development of the railways for the next 20 years. The study will examine both passenger and freight operations. It is envisaged that this study will provide a strategic framework for future Government decisions on rail development and will identify priorities for investment.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised that where freight only lines have recently lost their traffic to road transport, Iarnród Éireann continues to maintain these lines in working order, in the event of freight business returning to them. Iarnród Éireann informs me that in the particular case of the Foynes line, work is being done by Limerick County Council on a level crossing at Foynes harbour. While this work is being carried out, for safety reasons, control of the line has been placed with the permanent way inspector at Limerick. In the case of the Ennis/Athenry/Claremorris line, maintenance work is currently being undertaken along the route and again control of the line rests with the permanent way inspector responsible for the area. The future development of this route will be considered as part of the strategic rail study I mentioned earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I know. They cannot be grouped because it is a priority question. On the last occasion we raised this issue with the Minister we referred to the Kingscourt line. It was either closed or mothballed but it is no longer in use. We pointed out our concern that 48% of the total freight carried by CIE is being transferred to the roads. Despite the Minister's assurances to the House, which I accept were genuine, will she accept that CIE or Iarnród Éireann has by stealth implemented its original policy, ensuring through new contracts to their customers for freight that the customers will no longer use rail? As a result, the cement facility in Wexford station, which has been there for 50 years, has been closed down.</P>
      <P>I am not sure the Minister is getting the full story with regard to the Limerick to Foynes line. Arising from the Foynes decision, does the Minister agree that it will be impossible for the Foynes port development that is planned to go ahead? Is the Minister aware that since she said the policy of carrying freight on rail would continue, CIE and Iarnród Éireann have greatly reduced the volume of freight carried by rail? The specific example is Wexford where, after 50 years, 300 tonnes of cement per week will now be moved by road rather than by rail.</P>

      <P>I will have to find out the exact situation with regard to Wexford. I do not have full details on it. I accept I made a public statement in the Dáil and that my statement was followed up by the Taoiseach a week later in answer to a question on the Order of Business. I said it was preferable to have bulk goods carried by rail than having them carried on the road, simply because of the traffic and the fact that rail travel keeps such goods off the public roads and carries them safely.</P>
      <P>I can only go on the information I receive. With regard to the Foynes line, work is being done by Limerick County Council on a level crossing at Foynes harbour. I have met the chairman of CIE on this issue and I told him that, while there was no Cabinet decision on the matter because it was not brought to Cabinet, there was general agreement that it is better to carry goods by rail than by road. I told him that was my opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said on the last occasion when we raised the issue of State incentives, which are the norm in other European countries to encourage freighters to move from road to rail, that an amount of money was provided to CIE which it could use as it wished. Would she agree that the amount required to provide the infrastructure and to provide such encouragement could be taken and ring-fenced for that purpose from that subsidy? Will she speak to Iarnród Éireann about that and prevent the 1.25 million tonnes of freight being moved from the rail lines to the road system, which is incapable of taking that freight?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the action she intends to take to address the lack of accessibility and competition in the broadband sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which the companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has been an important objective of telecommunications policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-99, &euro;26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Support was given to 13 projects which rolled out broadband nationwide and which are now completed. These entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and west region <Col N="220" /> and the south and east region by Eircom, HEAnet, Esat, Chorus and NTL.</P>
    <P>The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 to &euro;200 million. Two thirds of this will be spent in the Border, midlands and west region and a third in the other region. A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and, on foot of submissions I received, I signed nine contracts for grant assistance of &euro;55 million at the beginning of 2001, which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects will be completed over the next two years and entail overall investment of &euro;160 million. Additional services involving a number of broadband technologies will be provided throughout the regions by Esat, Chorus, Nevadatele, Crossan Cable and ESB Telecom.</P>
    <P>I ran a second call for proposals last year with a submission deadline of the end of October 2001. This call allowed for submissions by local authorities as well to provide open-access telecommunications infrastructure. A total of 31 proposals was received from the private and public sectors and were evaluated independently. As a result, some local authorities were asked to commence non-binding procurement processes. It is likely that a number of private sector submissions to the second call will also be supported. The local authorities in question will be made public within three weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Ireland is ranked 27 out of the 28 OECD countries for the provision of broadband services, behind even Mexico and Portugal. In light of that and the fact that 40% of the funding for the first call was returned, is there not a lack of competition within the sector which is delaying the provision of investment outside Dublin? There is regulatory uncertainty over the communications legislation and difficulty in obtaining planning permission. The inconsistency throughout the country in planning permission is creating difficulty in the roll-out of broadband technology. What does the Minister intend to do? It is not just an issue for the companies involved; the Government must step in because the only access available is ISDN which is marketed incorrectly as high speed but which is only less slow than the ordinary copper cable.</P>

      <P>I accept that, in the earlier call, some companies did not take up their contracts because it coincided with a dip in the technological sector. Some companies went out of business at that difficult time. The current call, involving local authorities, which the independent group is assessing, will be significant because local authorities dig up roads and so have the engineering experience. There is 90% grant aid available to them, including to Roscommon, and this will make a difference. I hope to make the formal announcement soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive air services to and from Ireland. The operation of air services within Europe has been totally liberalised by the EU and EU policy and provisions do not distinguish or discriminate between traditional carriers and low cost operators.</P>
      <P>Liberalisation of the European air transport sector has ensured that fares, routes and frequency of services operated by carriers, including Irish carriers, are entirely commercial decisions for each company. Increased competition between air carriers has resulted in cheaper air fares and more choice, which Members will agree is good news for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Doganis report on aviation and tourism issues which was published last week suggested that airport managements must welcome low cost airlines as an essential and integral part of an airport's business. The Deputy will be aware that <Col N="222" /> the Government has considered and noted the principal conclusions and recommendations of the Doganis report and agreed that Aer Rianta should be asked to proceed immediately with the provision of a rapid turn-around facility at Dublin Airport to meet the specific needs of all carriers operating at the lower fares end of the market.

      <P>Regarding facilities at Cork and Shannon, the final planning permission has come through for Cork Airport, which clears the way for the investment of approximately &euro;100 million for development work.

      <P>The reason for the Dublin proposal is Dublin is the capital and is crowded. I know Cork people like to say Cork is the capital, though I do not know where that leaves us in the midlands. Dublin is the capital and therefore more people will go there than to Cork. Cork did well last year, despite the downturn in September; traffic there rose by 3% or 4%, which was remarkable in the circumstances. However, I take the Deputy's point and I will ask Aer Rianta if it plans the same type of facility.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the consultants employed gave an interview to Joe Humphreys of <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 January 2000 in which they said there was a need for a new control centre, which would cost a lot of money, and a five year training programme for staff in all Departments which might be affected? When does the Minister of State expect the control centre the consultants stated was essential to be available? When will the training start? Does he agree that, regarding the five year programme, the matter is urgent and could be an issue beyond training at that stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very fair comment. The control centre we used for the test of the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents was totally inadequate. I went to see it on the day for myself. I am not at all surprised to see that proposal from the consultants and we are looking very seriously at it.</P>
      <P>We do not have the report in full yet &ndash; we have a preliminary draft &ndash; which will contain a recommendation on training. I agree with the Deputy that in the context of what happened on 11 September, five years is far too long. The Government is taking a very serious view of the whole area of emergency planning, not just nuclear emergency planning, and it has put a task force in place which has met about a dozen times. It is headed by the Minister for Defence and the relevant Ministers are all involved, as are the security institutions of the State in the form of senior Garda and Army personnel. That will be part of their discussions. I agree that five years is far too long.</P>

      <P>When will we have sight of the information pack the Minister of State promised to deliver to each house? When will iodine tablets, which are an antidote to certain forms of radioactivity, be available nationally to individual households? While I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to answer this on the hoof, will he establish the amount of radioactivity against which iodine would be an effective antidote? Does he agree that isotopes are the main risk from Sellafield because they are not iodine sensitive, in other words the thyroid gland is not directly affected by them? It is misleading to say <Col N="225" /> that iodine would cure the effects of radioactivity as a result of an accident at Sellafield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue got me into trouble some time ago. The answer to the Deputy's question is twofold. The events of 11 September gave this issue a new perspective. Heretofore, our emergency planning was for a nuclear accident. There has been a rethink since 11 September and we are now talking and thinking about the possibility of a terrorist attack. The emergency task force, which is made up of experts, was put in place to discuss the issue and that has contributed to a certain delay. As regards the timescale, we underestimated the logistics and the difficulties in putting together the printing and tendering process. The Government has now approved the plan, which will be put in place. An information leaflet will also be distributed to every household, but I will not give the Deputy a date.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Stagg's question about iodine tablets, iodine tablets and medication are not matters for me but for the Department of Health. However, they are an integral part of the plan. It is the type, not the amount, of radioactivity which would emanate from a specific accident or incident at a nuclear plant, such as Sellafield, which is important. As the Deputy indicated, iodine would not be helpful for some types of radioactivity. However, it has been established by the experts that iodine tablets would be helpful for some types of radioactivity. That will be established at an early stage. The Minister for Health and Children will have supplies of up to date tablets and will distribute them to every household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" />As regards advice to the public, the plan is <i>in situ</i>. I cannot take any credit for the plan which has been in place since before 1992. The present emergency plan has been in place since 1992. It is institutional in nature in that the relevant institutions will be called upon when necessary. Awareness has been substantially raised through the work of the task force on emergency planning which communicates with the State institutions, including the Civil Defence, the local authorities, the fire service, etc.</P>

Work on renewal of track on the line is on schedule for completion this year, with the exception of some track at stations.</P>
      <P>Over the first three years of the railway safety programme, that is, from 1999 to 2001, a total of 22.5 miles of track were renewed between Cherryville Junction and Waterford. Iarnród Éireann expects to renew a further 8.5 miles of track this year. Other works on the Waterford line over the past three years have included the permanent closure or upgrading of 23 level crossings, the erection of 8.5 miles of fencing, the upgrading of seven safety critical buildings, such as relay rooms, and the renewal of three major bridges. In addition, Carlow and Kilkenny stations were upgraded. The cost of investment on the Cherryville Junction to Waterford line in the first three years of the railway safety programme was &euro;19.8 million. A further &euro;8.5 million is expected to be invested in this line in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 78 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the Retired Aviation Staff Association about pension increases from the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme. Over the past two years or so I have responded to numerous representations in relation to the concerns of the retirees' association about the Irish airlines scheme. I have also met representatives from the association and senior officials from my Department met with the association on a number of occasions last year. In addition, the association has also met senior management representatives from Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta in relation to their concerns.</P>
      <P>I have not received any request for a further meeting with the association. As Deputies will be aware, I committed the case made by the retired aviation staff association for enhanced pension increases for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners to my colleague Deputy McCreevy, the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for pensions in the public sector. I received a reply from him last September, the contents of which have been communicated to the retirees' association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance does not consider that it would be appropriate to accede to the <Col N="229" /> request from the Retired Aviation Staff Association for an Exchequer injection into the pension fund and that there must be continued adherence to the long-standing policy in this area, namely that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, are a matter for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the companies involved. As regards pension enhancements to benefit both serving staff and existing pensioners going forward, I have been advised that there is no provision in the Aer Lingus survival plan for any extra costs in relation to pensions.</P>
    <P>In so far as Aer Rianta is concerned, I understand that the company, in consultation with staff interests, is in the process of establishing its own separate pension scheme in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Is that the definitive reply from the Minister? Is the book firmly closed in regard to giving these people any joy? Does the Minister not accept that this is a small dwindling number of ex-employees who stood Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta in good stead during their developing phases? They now have a genuine grievance in regard to their level of pension. Whatever new pension scheme is put in place for the existing employees will not matter one whit to these people. They are a special case with a legitimate claim which should be addressed. What cash figure has been indicated in terms of satisfying the demands of the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that these ex-employees contributed very strongly to the growth and prosperity of the companies concerned. They gave immeasurably of their work, spirit and enthusiasm. Let us bear in mind the view of the Department of Finance which deals with public service pensions, that the pension entitlements for commercial semi-State bodies are a matter for the trustees, the members of the relevant schemes and the companies involved.</P>
      <P>The pensioners suggested that the costs associated with their proposal would be £33 million which could be funded on an annual basis by the companies from operating revenue. That is their computation of what the amount might be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has brought this matter to a conclusion because she has been dilly dallying around it for two years. Does the Minister agree that it was most unfair to the 4,500 pensioners involved in this case to lead them astray to the degree they were led astray by both the Minister and the Department who clearly indicated to them that they would be assisted in their case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I raised this matter was 20 June 2000. I asked if the Minister would be the association's advocate with the Minister for Finance and she agreed to this even though it is not in the record. Does the Minister agree that she was a <Col N="230" /> very poor advocate? The Minister for Finance said what Ministers for Finance always say when there is no pressure on them &ndash;&ldquo;No&rdquo;. Will the Minister confirm that the Minister for Finance with whom she has joint Cabinet responsibility is saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to these people?</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility to ensure the safety of its passengers. It is therefore a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety. I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that between 1994 and 2001 passenger numbers on InterCity services increased from 7.8 million to an estimated 11.3 million and on suburban services from 18.8 million to an estimated 22.7 million. I am fully aware that this has led to overcrowding at peak times.</P>
      <P>In order to address this problem significant funding continues to be made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, to increase the physical capacity of the system and to improve the quality, reliability and speed of services. Over the past two years 26 new DART cars were brought into service and a further 12 DART cars delivered in 2001 will go into service in the coming months. In 2002, 20 diesel railcars were delivered for use on the upgraded Maynooth line. These new railcars have increased the capacity of the Maynooth line by 100% at peak times. A further 80 diesel railcars are on order for delivery in 2002-03. In relation to InterCity services, I understand that Iarnród Éireann is currently evaluating tenders for the purchase of 67 new main-line rail carriages and Deputy Stanton has put down a question on that matter. The ongoing delivery of the new rolling stock will increase the available capacity at peak times and should help to alleviate the present overcrowding difficulties. In the meantime, the three inspectors from the railway inspectorate of my Department continue to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains and keep me informed on the matter. The inspectorate has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions to draw its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The chief railway inspecting officer has also raised particular aspects of crowding on rail services with Iarnród Éireann. Iarnród Éireann responded on 24 December last and advised that the recommendations made by its consultants in 2001 to alleviate crowding on services in the Dublin area are being implemented by the company. In regard to InterCity services, Iarnród Éireann stated that it is considering expanding the pre-booking system using modern ticket reservation technology. Furthermore, Iarnród Éireann advised that its emergency plans, which include plans for evacuation of trains, are being updated. This update will also focus on issues relevant to <Col N="232" /> the safety of crowded trains such as luggage storage and passengers standing in vestibules and gangways. Iarnród Éireann has assured the chief railway inspecting officer that every effort continues to be made to control the problem of crowding and that it is being managed by the company in a proactive manner.</P>
    <P>I have advised the House on several occasions previously that there are no quantitative safety standards in place at present in relation to maximum number of passengers permitted on trains, either in this country or at EU level. The Railway Safety Bill, 2001, which I published last December, will require all railway undertakings, including Iarnród Éireann, to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called a safety case. The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its strategy for managing crowded trains. The railway safety commission to be established under the Bill will need to be satisfied that the proposed strategy is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers.</P>

      <P>In several conversations and meetings that I have had from time to time with the railway inspectorate, these issues have been discussed. In the meantime the inspectorate continues to monitor developments. It has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann and the chief railway inspecting officer has raised the matter of particular aspects of crowding on rail services with it. Iarnród Éireann responded to the chief railway inspector on Christmas Eve and advised that the recommendations made by consultants for alleviating crowding on services in the Dublin area are now being implemented by the company. There is a whole lot of other things being done in regard to InterCity services. The railway inspectorate, Department officials and I frequently talk about this issue and have been in touch with Iarnród Éireann who responded on 24 December.</P>

      <P>At long last the Government has decided to have a judicial inquiry to examine the allegations made about the behaviour of certain gardaí in County Donegal. The bulk of the evidence which would have led to a judicial inquiry was available to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform three years ago. It was certainly all available to him when he voted down a motion in the House in November and inveigled the two Independent Deputies from Donegal to vote with him. A senior counsel, Mr. Shane Murphy, reviewed all the documents available to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Was it that the Minister was incompetent or did Mr. Murphy discover some new information which was not available to the Minister? I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been grossly negligent and incompetent, that he has allowed allegations made about gardaí to stand without proper investigation and that public confidence in the Garda has been reduced somewhat because of the Minister's failure to deal with these allegations as he now purports to deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has debated this matter before and the Taoiseach will be aware of the widespread concern in my party about this very disturbing set of events which took place in Donegal. I ask the Taoiseach in his reply to give a clear commitment to publish forthwith the report of Mr. Shane Murphy SC and, as has been the practice in the past, to also give an undertaking that this House and the leaders of the various parties in it will be consulted with regard to the terms of reference of any motion to establish a tribunal since it will be established by this House and not by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I can confirm to the <Col N="236" /> House that today the Government gave approval in principle to the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry into allegations of misconduct on the part of certain members of the Garda Síochána in Donegal. A public statement was issued a short time ago by the Minister. The Deputies may not have had an opportunity of seeing that statement. For the record, apart from announcing the decision in principle to set up the tribunal, it stated that the Government's agreement was obtained to have amending legislation drafted as a matter of priority so as to enable the tribunal to conduct its inquiry without prejudicing various civil and criminal proceedings which have already been instituted in relation to alleged misconduct. The heads of the Bill, on which the amending legislation will be based, were approved by the Government today also.</P>
      <P>I reject, of course, what Deputy Noonan said about the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. Consistently when dealing with this matter, with parliamentary questions and motions regarding the alleged misconduct by gardaí in Donegal, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform make it clear that he was not opposed to the holding of a public inquiry. The record of the House clearly confirms this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General, on the basis of the information then available, advised that the holding of such an inquiry at that time would prejudice civil and criminal proceedings which had been instituted as a result of the alleged misconduct. Of course a Minister could not ignore that clear advice at that time but he did go ahead with a range of other investigations and co-operated with the Garda over a period.</P>
      <P>The former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Frederick Morris, has agreed to chair the tribunal. A motion will be brought before the House immediately following enactment of legislation for the holding of a public inquiry taking account, amongst other things, of the terms of the legislation and the debate in the House in the course of the passage of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's two specific questions as regards the publication of the Murphy report, I am advised that, having regard to the content of the report which goes into some considerable detail, parties to proceedings already in being would be able to make the case that publication was prejudicial to those proceedings. It would be contradictory, having introduced legislation for the precise purpose of ensuring that the tribunal does not prejudice civil and criminal proceedings, to proceed at the same time with the publication of a report which would carry exactly the same risks. The report will, accordingly, be made available in the first instance to the tribunal chairman who will be in a position to determine what and when material should be put into the <Col N="237" /> public domain in relation to the matters under inquiry.</P>
    <P>The answer to his second question, regarding co-operation and consultation with the Opposition, is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that the only documents available to Mr. Shane Murphy SC were the files in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about this matter and the files in the possession of the Garda Síochána. Therefore everything Mr. Shane Murphy examined had been available to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, yet on the presentation made by the Minister the Attorney General said it was inappropriate to have a judicial inquiry and on the basis of the same information presented by Mr. Shane Murphy the Attorney General said it was appropriate to have a judicial inquiry. Does this not suggest incompetence on the part of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that he operated in a rather slip-shod manner? Will the Taoiseach give a commitment in the House that, whatever the terms of reference when they are promulgated, one term of reference will be to examine the Minister's conduct in this affair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's conduct in this affair, no doubt it will show that he acted absolutely correctly throughout. That is my belief and I said this from day one when we started. Mr. Justice Frederick Morris and everybody else in the tribunal will be able to examine that in due course and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is very happy that that will be the case.</P>

      <P>Ten years ago today the Taoiseach and some of his colleagues beside him were celebrating their re-appointment to the Cabinet under the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. On the same day on which <i>The Irish Times</i> front page carried the composition of office holders in the new Cabinet there was a story at the bottom of the page which stated that the State was attempting to stop a girl's abortion. That was the first time, ten years ago today, that a baffled and horrified nation was made aware that the State was attempting to stop a young girl, who had become pregnant as a result of rape by a person known to her &ndash; she was 14 at the time &ndash; from having an abortion. Ten years on, why is the Taoiseach persisting in his efforts to remove the <Col N="239" /> legal protection which the Supreme Court gave to young women such as the girl in the X case in this forthcoming referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised at the Taoiseach's comments over the past few days, which are alarmist and scaremongering. He said that if the referendum was not passed, the floodgates to abortion on demand would open. I put it to the Taoiseach that the real position is that if the referendum is rejected, the <i>status quo</i> will prevail. If the Taoiseach checks the record he will find that since the X case first came to public attention ten years ago, there has been no other case of a pregnancy being terminated in Ireland on the grounds that a woman was suicidal. I would like the Taoiseach to confirm that. The only similar case was the C case where a young girl in the care of the State was allowed travel to the UK and have her expenses paid by the appropriate health board. The Minister for Health and Children, in a piece of outstanding hypocrisy, has already confirmed that the State will continue to pay for the travel and other expenses of underage girls in the care of the State who may become pregnant as a result of rape or incest.</P>
      <P>How will the floodgates open if the referendum is rejected when there is no evidence of much happening in this jurisdiction as a consequence of the X case?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am on the public record about what I said ten years ago but I am certainly on it for what I said six or seven years ago. I promised that Fianna Fáil in Government would hold a referendum on the question of abortion. I had come to that conclusion in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment and the views expressed by its members about what the Legislature should do. When in opposition, I co-operated fully with the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, when he established a constitutional review group which outlined its views on this matter very clearly.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the Supreme Court judgment, I concluded that there was unfinished business, a view shared by Mr. Whitaker and many others. I was fully aware that it would be a difficult and complex issue but I set about dealing with it. We did not rush to put the issue to the people but gave ample time for debate and undertook the widest level of consultation ever undertaken before framing the legislation. We formulated our proposals in the genuine belief that the vast majority of people in the country do not want to see abortion legalised here. We knew that people wanted to protect the life of the unborn but equally, we knew that people wanted to ensure that women had their right to life protected.</P>
      <P>We proposed, for the first ever time, to give statutory protection to the lives of pregnant women. It is the first time in 150 years that we have had such legislation in this jurisdiction&mdash;</P>

We did not rule out suicide as a reason to legislate for abortion because we are insensitive to women or as some people, including Deputy Quinn, have suggested, we did not trust them. We did so because the evidence provided to the all-party committee and made available during the preparation of the Green Paper showed that where termination is allowed on the basis of psychiatric considerations, the numbers seeking abortion rise rapidly.</P>

      <P>Regarding the Deputy's concerns, the years covered by the report, 1994 to 1998, pre-date the significant investment made in cancer services, especially by the Government, since the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997. As Dr. Harry Comber, director of the National Cancer Registry Board pointed out at the launch of the report last week, it will obviously take time for this investment to be reflected in cancer treatment services, particularly in relation to such statistics as five year survival rates.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting that the report states there was no significant change in the risk of developing or dying from cancer between 1994 and 1998. Cancer incidence in Ireland was similar to that in neighbouring countries. Overall, and for most common cancers, cancer rates were lower than in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, higher than in England and close to EU averages. Exceptions were breast cancer, where our risk was lower than that of the neighbouring countries, and lung cancer in women, for which our risk was well above the EU average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1997 to date, more than &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 62 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff throughout the country. This includes approval which has been given for eight new consultant <Col N="247" /> surgeon posts with a special interest in breast surgery.</P>
    <P>This level of funding far exceeds the £25 million which was initially envisaged in 1996 and is a clear indication of the Government's continued commitment to the development of co-ordinated and patient-focused cancer treatment in line with the recommendations of the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>Under the national cancer strategy, the national cancer forum was established to advise on appropriate developments and structures in the area of cancer. The term of office of the first forum expired in 2000 and I subsequently appointed Professor Paul Redmond as chairman of the second national cancer forum. The forum is representative of the medical, the palliative and the voluntary organisations involved in cancer services and continues to play a very important role in the provision of quality services to people with cancer.</P>
    <P>Regional directors of cancer services have also been appointed in each of the health boards to oversee and co-ordinate the development of cancer services in their respective areas in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards. These posts are proving to be of great benefit in assisting in the development of appropriate future cancer services.</P>
    <P>In 2000, national screening programmes for both breast and cervical cancer were initiated on a phased basis. BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group, 50 to 64 years of age. BreastCheck, as with many other sectors of the health services has found it difficult to recruit specialised radiographers. This shortage of staff has meant the programme has been unable to screen women as quickly as anticipated. BreastCheck recognised this difficulty some time ago and took a number of initiatives to address this shortage, including running both national and international recruitment campaigns. This has resulted in the recruitment of additional radiographers to the programme, and of BreastCheck's total number of 18 radiographer posts, 15.5 are currently filled. BreastCheck continues to explore other recruitment possibilities and reports that the targets achieved in all other areas are exemplary in comparison with breast screening programmes in Holland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, more than 50,000 women have been called for screening and more than 34,000 women have been screened. This represents a 70% uptake.</P>
    <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme was launched in October 2000 covering the Mid-Western Health Board area. Under <Col N="248" /> phase one, cervical screening is being offered free of charge, to approximately 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group at five yearly intervals.</P>
    <P>The provision of screening programmes, underpinned by international quality assurance criteria and best practice, is a key objective and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of these programmes countrywide. Both BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, and the national cervical screening programme are currently in discussion with health boards concerning expansion of the programmes nationwide.</P>
    <P>The report identifies that incidence rates for prostate cancer in men in all age groups showed statistically significant increases. Incidence rates in men under 65 years increased by 8.2%. Mortality rates showed no evidence of an upward or downward trend. The evidence of a divergence between incidence and mortality rates may be due to better case-finding, more incidental diagnoses or a genuine increase in survival.</P>
    <P>In December 2001, &euro;320,000 was announced by my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for the Irish Cancer Society to support a study of prostate cancer, including diagnosis. A sub-group of the national cancer forum has recently been established on generic screening. This group, which is chaired by Mr. Michael Lyons, chief executive officer, East Coast Area Health Board, will review all issues relating to screening, including looking at specific diseases such as colorectal and prostate cancer. Their recommendations will help to inform policy developments in this area on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry Board's report shows clear evidence of a divergence between female incidence and mortality rates in relation to breast cancer, with a statistically significant upward trend in breast cancer incidence in women under 65 years and downward trends in mortality rates in all age groups combined. This divergence in trends is expected to continue as a result of continuing improvements in treatments and as a result of the BreastCheck screening programme.</P>
    <P>A sub-committee of the national cancer forum was established to report and make recommendations on the development of symptomatic breast disease services nationally. Its report, which was published in March 2000, provides a comprehensive plan for the co-ordination and best delivery of symptomatic breast disease services nationwide.</P>
    <P>I set particular emphasis on the central recommendations of this report. As breast cancer remains a major public health issue, it is vitally important that quality services are developed for symptomatic breast disease. It is generally accepted that women with breast disease are best served by a team of specialists working together and that women experience better outcomes if their cancer is managed in centres developed <Col N="249" /> along the lines recommended in the sub-group report.</P>
    <P>I am glad to confirm that during the past year, there have been extensive consultations between my Department and the health boards on the best way forward for the development of symptomatic breast disease services in their functional areas. More than 12 months ago I gave financial approval to the boards on condition that they would operate to agreed protocols and standards of care in accordance with national guidelines and quality assurance arrangements to ensure compliance with best international practice and to achieve optimum outcomes. The boards deliberated for some time before coming forward with the best solutions for their particular areas.</P>
    <P>As well as investing funding in the delivery of services to people with cancer and in developing</P>
    <P>screening services for particular cancers, I have also complemented these actions by initiatives in the field of health promotion. The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives that have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. These include mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The unit also provides funding to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives including the yearly Europe against cancer campaign.</P>
    <P>The statistics on lung cancer published in the report reaffirm the need for comprehensive, strengthened legislative measures to tackle tobacco use in this country. The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001 raised the age limit at which tobacco products could legally be sold to young persons from 16 years to 18 years with effect from 1 August last year. The House will also be aware that I advised the tobacco industry here that no further advertising or sponsorship, other than limited retail and trade advertising, would be allowed after 1 July 2000. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill will now be enacted and implemented as a matter of urgency and a reduction in smoking will continue to be targeted through Government fiscal policies. The Bill confers enabling powers on the Minister for Health and Children to extend environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and public facilities not already covered by existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill include the establishment of the Office of Tobacco Control on a statutory basis; a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and on all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry; a system of retail registration and fees to be administered by the Office of Tobacco Control; a ban on the sale of packets of less than 20 cigarettes and restrictions on self service; full disclosure to the public on all aspects of tobacco; improved protection for people against passive smoking; and much tougher enforcement.</P>
    <P>Health information is fundamental to assessing and implementing quality programmes. It is also <Col N="250" /> vital to the wider areas of value for money, information for management, information for the public, knowledge management systems and knowledge bases. The national health strategy provides for the establishment of an independent health information and quality authority to lead the development of health information to support these requirements. The soon to be published national health information strategy will provide the context for future development in this area.</P>
    <P>In the context of the national health strategy, I will continue to be advised by the National Cancer Forum on the planning, development and implementation of cancer services for the country. It is currently examining a number of issues of tremendous importance to the effective progression of the development of cancer services in this country. Areas such as protocols for the care and treatment of cancer patients, information requirements, audit and evaluation of our services, genetics issues and further screening programmes are important component parts of the appropriate future development of cancer service and the forum, as the established expert advisory body will report to me on these issues.</P>
    <P>The Government is constantly striving to provide the best and most appropriate cancer services for the country. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of 2002 of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. This plan will be prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services in the next seven years. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert group on radiotherapy services. The work of that group is ongoing and I am awaiting the final draft report.</P>
    <P>The work of the National Cancer Registry Board provides a vital contribution to informing the ongoing implementation of the national cancer strategy in terms of directing the way in which investment takes place, ensuring integration of services and that the objectives of the national cancer strategy are realised. The health strategy provides a significant opportunity for the forum to shape its work. It is also intended that the National Cancer Forum will work with the National Hospitals Agency and the Health Information and Quality Authority to ensure service, quality, accessibility and responsiveness. Furthermore, under the Ireland-Northern Ireland National Cancer Institute Cancer Consortium initiative, a research programme has been launched. This will allow hospitals throughout Ireland to participate in high quality clinical trials of new therapies for cancer, helping to ensure new and effective treatments are made available more quickly.</P>
    <P>The developments I have outlined here today <Col N="251" /> describe an overall framework through which cancer services can be developed and provided in a co-ordinated and effective manner. The Government is committed to ensuring a cancer strategy will form an integral part of the implementation of the overall health strategy which is aimed at ensuring quality and fairness in the provision of services to all. I look forward to ongoing reports from the National Cancer Registry Board, particularly in the years ahead, which should reflect the success and impact of the level of investment which has taken place since 1997 in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to committees, consortia, review groups, health boards and agencies. There are so many groups, agencies, health boards, committees, reviews and commissions that the Minister does not even know their number. He could not tell me their number in a parliamentary reply.</P>
      <P>My family has been devastated by cancer. My father died from cancer before my sixth birthday. My brother died on Christmas Day, my sister who had just turned 43 died and my other brother had a transplant because of cancer. Unfortunately, this is not unusual. The statistics in the Minister's report give the figures as a percentage of the EU average, which is below the Canadian average. If one were to compare the average rate of cancer deaths in Ireland to Canada, it would be even worse than those in the report. For example, in the case of lung cancer among males, the percentage is in the region of 160% or 165% of the EU average. The one cancer which is well below the EU average is lung cancer among women. Given that we do not have a child cancer strategy, as recommended in the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Tobacco written by myself, and the fact that young girls are smoking more, I predict, as sure as night follows day, those cancer statistics for females will not only not decline but they will increase. The incidence of melanoma among males is approximately 152% of the European average and for females it is approximately 120%. The incidence of prostate cancer is approximately 120% of the European average. The incidence of bladder cancer among males is approximately 110% of the European average. All cancers, apart from skin cancer among males, is approximately 120% of the European average, which is well below the Canadian average.</P>
      <P>I estimate that if we took a similar population to Ireland in France, approximately 3.8 million people, they would live collectively 13 million years longer than Irish people. That is an extraordinary figure. Why is it that people in Canada live to be 78 years of age on average? In parts of Europe people live to be 75 and 76 on average. Why is the death rate among Irish people, not just from cancer but heart diseases and other illnesses, so high? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to divorce public health from health. <Col N="252" /> Would it not be a good idea to redesign the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation? Perhaps tourism could be included with transport and there could be a Minister for transport and tourism. This would take all the transport issues away from the environment and the other Departments. The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation could then become the Department of public health, recreation and sport, dealing with food safety and preventative measures in regard to the environment. There is a case to be made for divorcing public health issues from health issues. The Minister is only toying with a solution. There is no point trying to shore up everything by having 60 or 70 different consortia, committees, review groups and so on. We need to take this issue more seriously. The approach to TB taken by Noel Browne needs to be taken to cancer and other serious illnesses. There is no evidence of this in the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>Of all those who die in Ireland under the age of 65, one third die from cancer. We have the third highest death rate from cancer in Europe and many of those who die are awaiting so-called elective treatment. The chief medical officer informed us in his 1999 annual report that one third of cancers are preventable and one third are potentially curable. He also stated that good palliative care can provide significant improvements in quality of life. The appalling reality is that in a society awash with money the Government has failed to give priority to cancer services which could see more people survive cancer and enjoy many more years with their loved ones.</P>
    <P>At the launch of Daffodil Day 2000, a consultant radiotherapist at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, painted a very unacceptable picture on the availability of radiotherapy services in Ireland. On average only 16% of cancer patients receive radiotherapy, despite the fact that up to 50% of patients could benefit from it. It was pointed out that up to 1,000 people per annum people are dying because of inadequate treatment. While 16% of Irish cancer patients receive radiotherapy, an average of 66% of patients receive such treatment in the EU. Could this relate to the statistics I have just quoted?</P>
    <P>An eminent oncologist, Dr. John Crown, writing in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> in February last stated:</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Strategy which emerged . . . undoubtedly led to service improvements. However, by the time the civil servants were finished with it, it contained some awful clangers, principally its total failure to address the hopelessly fractioned Dublin set-up, and its determination that Galway would become the world's only radiotherapy-less comprehensive cancer centre.</P>
    <P>In truth, what was the worst cancer treatment system in Europe is better, but is still the worst cancer treatment system in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to blame civil servants because they cannot answer for themselves, but Ministers can. <Col N="253" /> I ask the Minister to respond to this point when concluding the debate. The verdict of professionals such as these and the fact that two major hospitals in Dublin had to postpone potentially life-saving treatments for cancer patients to make way for non-cancer emergency admissions, at a time of unprecedented wealth, huge budget surpluses and unprecedented amounts of taxpayers' money being made available by the Dáil to the Minister for Health and Children, give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>Last year, one mother who needed chemotherapy for a cancerous lump on her neck said she had her life-saving treatment cancelled each day for almost two weeks. She is reported as saying that the stress was so great that she telephoned twice daily, but every day the queue was getting longer. The Minister was quoted as describing these developments as &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;, as if he was somehow a disinterested and unconnected commentator. Would any of us like that treatment for our wives, daughters or mothers? We would not. I am not referring to a statistic, but a woman who went to the hospital.</P>
    <P>We ask why the system is not working. All the review groups, committees etc. will not do the job. If the Minister stopped running around attending the opening of every envelope but started doing his job as Minister and concentrated his efforts, it would be helpful. Perhaps he should pick one area of health and say, &ldquo;I will be like Noel Browne. I will bring imagination to bear on the issue and I will deal with it.&rdquo; Perhaps then we could come to terms with some of the problems that the lady I mentioned faced. She faced these problems despite the launching of a national strategy on cancer in 1996 and the announcement on an implementation strategy in 1997.</P>
    <P>The effect of cancer on society is now devastating. If one third of all deaths of those aged under 65 are cancer-related, it means that 7,500 persons per year die from cancer in Ireland. This constitutes one quarter of all deaths every year and this figure has remained at that level for almost ten years. In 1995, the number of persons dying from ischaemic heart disease was 7,926 and this declined in 1999 to 6,876. There was no such decline in cancer deaths in the same period.</P>
    <P>An average of 18,000 new cases of cancer are recorded annually and, on the basis of epidemiological data available, there are regional disparities in both the death rate and incidence, i.e., new cases of cancer, even after taking differences of age profile into account. Death rates from cancer are significantly higher in what was then the Eastern Health Board area than in the rest of the country. Death rates from cancer are significantly lower in the Southern, Western and North Western Health Board areas. Death rates for the major types of cancer show statistically significant variations between regions, but this has not given rise to strategies to combat those variations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" />In the five years covered by this report, there were almost 20,000 new cases of cancer each year and 7,500 cancer deaths occurred annually. One in four deaths was due to cancer and in women under 65 almost half of the deaths that occurred were cancer-related. The report shows that there was no significant change in the risk of developing or dying from cancer, despite a strategy in 1996 and an implementation programme announced in 1997. It should be a matter of comfort that this is so, but it is not. Despite advances in medical treatment and technology and despite unprecedented resources being available to the Government, there has been a major systems failure, tantamount to an administrative paralysis in respect of cancer treatment.</P>
    <P>Ireland's mortality rate from cancer compares unfavourably with the EU average. While our death rate from cancer has declined by almost 10% in the under 65 age group since 1970, it is still above the EU average and our mortality rate for the overall population, including those aged over 65, has been rising significantly since the late 1970s.</P>
    <P>The Government's long-delayed health strategy was unveiled with a great fanfare late last year. In respect of cancer services, it leaves much to be desired, and holds out little hope that the next five-year report of the national cancer registry will show much improvement. While many of the aspirations in the plan are worthy, the Government's incompetence will prove its undoing. Many of the action points are nothing more than extensions of existing targets. For instance, agreement on cancer services will not be reached before 2003, despite the fact that the national cancer strategy was in place before this Government took office.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to publish tables showing progress to date in meeting the targets set and his forecasts for the coming years. There is strong evidence that lifestyle and environmental factors play an important role. It is estimated that tobacco, alcohol and diet, the three major lifestyle risk factors, contribute to two thirds of all cancers in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government's health strategy promises that programmes for breast and cervical cancer screening will be extended nationally, but no target dates have been given. Currently, BreastCheck is only available in three out of eight health board areas and, by June 2001, only one third of the eligible women had been screened because of the lack of available staff. There are not enough radiographers to carry out the screening and a new course for radiographers is having difficulty because there are not enough lecturers to teach the students.</P>
    <P>Women who present for breast screening under BreastCheck are guaranteed timeframes within which they will receive treatment should they require it. Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff at breast disease clinics in many of our major hospitals, women who already have <Col N="255" /> breast cancer symptoms can receive no such service guarantees.</P>
    <P>The cancer strategy launched in 1996 by the previous Administration stated the obvious in showing the number of people that cancer kills. That strategy set the objective of reducing cancer among the under 65 age group by 15% in the ten years to 2004. Will these targets be met? I am sceptical about the announcements being made. For example, about 900 people per year die from secondary smoking, that is inhaling other people's smoke, particularly in public houses. I do not believe we have been strong enough in our willingness to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minster will take into account the issues I have raised. I hope we will see targets, dates and percentages set for a reduction in our cancer rates to below the European Union average and, I hope, below the Canadian average. There is no reason why we should not be able to achieve such objectives.</P>

      <P>When we look at this report, it is important to consider the experience of cancer patients during the stewardship of this particular Minister for Health and Children and this Government. A unique and certainly unprecedented event took place during that period. A woman was forced to go to court to gain access to cancer treatment that she was entitled to have, but was unable to access. Her name was Janet Byrne. She was able, primarily, to receive life-saving chemotherapy after the High Court heard she had been treated in the Mater Private Hospital. This was a case in which a woman desperately needed chemotherapy. The case was resolved by the hospital in question providing private care for the public patient. It shows the extent to which services to patients &ndash; citizens of this State &ndash; have been overstretched and under-resourced, to a point where a sick woman was forced to go to the court to avail of treatment that, under successive Governments, she has been entitled to receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another example of the direct experience of individuals seeking cancer treatment occurred this year. Several Dublin hospitals had to cancel emergency cancer treatment as problems in the health system worsened. The Mater Hospital, for example, had to cancel cancer treatments for patients because there were so many emergencies in the accident and emergency unit that it did not <Col N="256" /> have enough beds. This is a new phenomenon. In the past, cancer patients would have expected to have priority and be able to get access to specialists and hospital care. There is now a new phenomenon where they are either delayed or denied access to such treatment.</P>
    <P>In April, there was a report in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of a 39 year old mother whose chemotherapy treatment for a cancerous lump in her neck at the Mater Hospital was cancelled each day for almost two weeks. She eventually secured a bed for the fifth of her seven life saving treatments late last week. She is quoted as saying: &ldquo;The stress was so great I telephoned twice daily but every day the queue was getting longer.&rdquo;  That is the kind of issue we must address. At a time of unprecedented prosperity, the Government has failed to meet the needs of the sickest in our society.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary statement was made by Mr. Séamus Ó Cathail, consultant radiotherapist at Cork University Hospital, who said that as many as 1,000 Irish people are dying unnecessarily of cancer every year because of inadequate treatment facilities, especially in the field of radiography. That is an issue that has not been resolved. There are major staff shortages in radiography which have not been addressed. That is a failure of preparation, planning and foresight by the Department and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The analysis in this report is of great significance and is a welcome addition to the information already available. Those who prepared it deserve our thanks. The lack of information of the incidence, mortality, treatment and survival of major diseases is clearly an obstacle to devising effective strategies to combat them. I would like the Minister to clarify the accuracy of the figures. The report points out there are difficulties in documenting accurate figures. There are difficulties in starting up this kind of registry, of over-reporting of death certificates and also in terms of comparing ourselves with other countries. The registry adopted a measurement recommended by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which, in terms of how it is used to measure cancers, shows a 5% reduction. It is obviously the recommended approach and means that multiple cancers are not itemised individually so that only one cancer is considered when suffered by one person. When we compare ourselves with other countries, we should be comparing like with like. We need to be sure of having that kind of accuracy.</P>
    <P>One of the features of this report is a paradox. Where more screening is done, there is more evidence of the incidence of disease. Given that the levels of screening are remarkably low when compared to other European Union countries, how can we claim that the incidence of cancers is on a par with other countries? As screening picks up hidden levels of cancer, we cannot claim to have the knowledge of other countries with much better detection and screening. We have a partial breast screening programme, which is limited in <Col N="257" /> that it is only carried out by a small number of health boards. Even in those health board regions, this excellent programme has been delayed because of a lack of foresight and planning in terms of staffing. No woman in my constituency of County Wicklow has yet been called under the BreastCheck programme. This is truly remarkable, considering the importance given to it by the Government.</P>
    <P>The increased levels of prostate cancer indicate that we must have a screening programme for this cancer. The Minister talks about having a programme, but he should outline a target date for its commencement. The manner in which the programme, which should be a national one, is to be carried out must be defined. In yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Mr. John Stratton, consultant gynaecological oncologist and obstetrician, is quoted as saying that the cervical cancer screening programme is still on a pilot basis. This is scandalous. Screening for this cancer is relatively easy and very effective. He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. No one should get it. They have halved the incidence of it in the UK by screening; in the United States they have reduced it by 80%. Why are they putting in a pilot project when it has been of proven benefit wherever it is set up properly?</P>
    <P>This is a question the Minister must answer. Why can a woman not be screened unless she can afford to pay her general practitioner for it? This is a very simple early detection preventative measure the Minister could introduce. Does the Government simply not want to spend the money? It has a glitzy health strategy, but it cannot increase the number of medical cards for poor people and it will not allow women to avail of screening for cervical cancer. This is a serious issue that should be top of the priorities when the changes regarding cancer treatment are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important report which presents its analysis in a typically dry and bureaucratic way. In view of the cancer epidemic we are facing, I want to look at the root causes. The report does not go as far as I would like. I have often quoted the statistic from the World Health Organisation that 80% of cancers are environmentally linked. That is a fact. It relates to the chemicals we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink, chemicals in our clothes and radiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The toxicity of chemicals is measured by their effect on the average human being. From studies into genetic engineering, we are discovering there is no such thing as an average human being. We all have varying genetic predispositions. Deputy Gay Mitchell mentioned his family and how prone they are to cancer. Each of us reacts differently to chemicals. One person might breathe in a particle of benzene with no effect, but it could cause cancer in another. That sort of analysis is missing. We now have the wherewithal to find out <Col N="258" /> what is causing cancer in human beings and this must be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of health promotion, which is vital in relation to our lifestyles, the amount we drink and smoke, etc. All of these activities clearly contribute to the increase in cancer. However there are cars on our streets emitting benzene, PM10s, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known mutagens and carcinogens. That mix is quite complex. We also talk about the increase in the incidence of melanoma. What is causing that? We know that the erosion of the ozone layer has led to more UV radiation coming through to which those of us with fair skin are more susceptible. That has caused a major increase in the incidence of cancer.</P>
    <P>More information is emerging daily on the increase in the incidence of breast cancer. It can be caused by the hormones in food which can account for a hormonal imbalance in human beings. Anti-perspirants that are dermally absorbed can also cause it. These are complex issues but they are not addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I may disagree about the impact of the presence of fluoride in water. Fluoride is a toxic substance which we all absorb all the time. According to the measurements of fluoride in studies carried out by Dr. Mansfield, in the case of most people, the measurements are way above the safe threshold. Not only do we absorb it when we drink water and consume food, but we dermally absorb it when taking a shower. Irrespective of what the Minister's mandarins tell him, I urge him to be cautious about this. Having examined the relevant data, I have no doubt that fluoride is something of which we need to be wary. I am certainly convinced it should not be in our drinking water.</P>
    <P>We are absorbing a mix of chemicals to which we are exposed every day. They are contributing to the major increase in the incidence of cancer. The National Cancer Registry examines that development, but it does not properly examine the causes of it. For example, in Ringsend I am aware anecdotally of an increase in the incidences of severe thyroid problems and asthma, which are above the national average. We need to find out why this is the case. There has also been a major increase in the incidence of brain haemorrhages &ndash; I have raised this matter in the House. We need to investigate why there has been a major increase in those illnesses in that pocket? I have no doubt it is due to the large amount of industrial activity there and, above all else, to the city dump having been located there. Those who live close to old landfill sites that were not regulated were exposed to chemicals as a result of which they suffered and will continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a question on 20 March 2001 concerning a set of endocrine disrupting chemicals, PCBs, dioxins etc. Pesticides have also caused major damage. The small bird population has fallen greatly, which is a good bio-marker of the effectiveness of those chemicals. They are <Col N="259" /> killing all around them. If they are causing trouble for the small bird population, they are also causing trouble for human beings. We need to examine this matter much more carefully.</P>
    <P>A report such as this can be produced and some people would immediately say that the findings of it must have something to do with Sellafield. Radiation from Sellafield is an issue affecting the east coast despite it having been denied time and again, but one development that has not been examined is the incidence of cobalt lodging in the sediment, which will come to the fore shortly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the root causes of the increases in the incidence of cancer. We have a cancer culture not only here but throughout the west. It is a disease of affluence and will increase as we industrialise more. I ask the Minister to examine this matter more carefully.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a woman from Waterford who has asked that we forget about the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; and raise the level of our cancer services to that of the best in Europe in order to save lives. That should be the aspiration of the Government, not the building of a stadium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the National Cancer Registry's report as it relates to people over the age of 65. The report, which covers the years 1994 to 1998, finds that older people were much more likely to develop cancer, with the risk doubling in every successive decade of life. Some 60% of patients were aged over 65 at the time of diagnosis and the majority of cancer deaths, 72%, also occurred in those over the age of 65. The largest number of reported cases of cancer were in the 70 to 74 age group and the largest number of cancer deaths were also within that same age group. This age group accounts for 20% of all lung cancer cases and deaths and the largest number of prostate cancer cases, the second most common cancer is men. The report also finds, however, that over the five years covered only small changes in cancer incidence and mortality rates were recorded in the population aged 65 and over, one of which was statistically significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report's findings that age at diagnosis has an impact on the cancer treatment provided was of very real interest to me. Older patients were less likely to receive cancer-specific treatment and when treated were less likely to receive surgery or combination therapy. The report recommends that these findings should be treated with caution, advising the possibility that higher levels of intercurrent illnesses and reduced physiological capacity associated with old age are discouraging clinicians from recommending aggressive treatment regimes to older people. Another possibility identified in the report is that some older people may themselves decide not to have certain treatment because of concerns about side effects or perceived lack of benefit. We must also <Col N="260" /> acknowledge that in certain parts of the country some people do not present themselves at an early stage. The findings of the report in relation to treatment of the elderly are similar to findings reported from studies undertaken elsewhere in Europe and the US.</P>
    <P>While the possible causes for the differing cancer treatment regimes based on age can be interpreted in a number of different ways, the report recommends that a better understanding of mechanisms underlying clinical decision making with regard to cancer treatment is required. To improve the quality of care for elderly patients, clinical guidelines and treatment protocols targeting elderly cancer patients should be developed and updated regularly.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government's initiatives on a range of issues will have a significant impact on these statistics over the coming years. The publication of the national cancer strategy in November 1996 gave a focus for the development of an integrated, co-ordinated and patient focused cancer service throughout the country. Since 1997, funding of &euro;103 million has been invested, primarily by the Government, for the implementation of the recommendations of this strategy. We will probably see no improvements from that investment before the next report.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the national cancer strategy, structures have been put in place at national and regional level to ensure that we develop the range of cancer services of a standard and quality which ensures the best service delivery possible. At national level, the National Cancer Forum continues to provide invaluable advice on how best to implement the recommendations of the strategy. At local level, regional directors of cancer services have been appointed in all health boards. These regional directors oversee the development of cancer services in their areas and are responsible for the preparation of regional cancer plans. The work of the regional directors is proving invaluable to the work of the National Cancer Forum and the ongoing implementation of the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>The report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care identified that over 95% of all patients availing of specialist palliative care services suffer from cancer and that the mortality rate is expected to rise in future years due to the ageing population. The report also identified that the number of people living with cancer is expected to rise as a result of earlier diagnosis, improved treatment and longer survival. Additional funding was provided in 2001 and 2002 to commence the implementation of the recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>A National Council for Specialist Palliative Care, representative of statutory and voluntary agencies, will be established to offer advice on the ongoing development and implementation of a national policy. As also recommended in the report, regional development committees for specialist palliative care are in the process of being established in each health board to prepare <Col N="261" /> development plans for palliative care services in their area. As with the national council, these regional committees are fully representative of the appropriate statutory and voluntary agencies providing specialist palliative care services.</P>
    <P>Cancer is not only being tackled at the diagnostic and treatment stages. This Government has identified a range of initiatives to tackle probable causes of incidence of cancer. This willingness to address the issue of cancer in the broadest sense will show demonstrable improvements in the incidence of cancer in the future. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, for example, which extends environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and public facilities not already covered by existing legislation, will impact on the incidence of lung cancer in the future. In this regard, the health strategy identifies a range of initiatives for the promotion of health and well-being, including enhanced health promotion initiatives aimed at addressing the risk factors associated with cancers, such as smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise.</P>
    <P>The importance of the development of cancer services has been identified in the health strategy and a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy will be developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the national cancer forum for publication by the end of this year. Of the subgroups recently established by the forum to look at specific issues, I am particularly interested in the work of the subgroup on evidence based medicine and the subgroup on genetic screening. The subgroup on evidence based medicine is being asked to develop proposals to bring about rationalisation and standardisation of clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with cancer for discussion by the forum. In the course of its work, this group will review all issues in relation to standards of treatment afforded to patients with cancer. The subgroup on genetic screening will review all issues in relation to screening, including screening for prostate cancer.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a member of a Government that is taking all measures necessary to ensure the development of the structures and services necessary to address the issue of cancer in a meaningful and significant manner. I am sure that in the next report we will see an amelioration in the situation regarding cancers in general.</P>

      <P>Of all the people who die in Ireland aged less than 65 years, one third die from cancer. We have the third highest cancer rate in Europe. Many of those who die are awaiting so-called elective treatment. Of those who die, one third have cancers which are preventable and one third have cancers which can be cured. It is an <Col N="262" /> indictment of our system that two thirds of those who die from cancer could be saved.</P>
      <P>Only 16% of cancer patients are receiving radiotherapy, while 50% could benefit from it. In the European Union, 66% of cancer patients have radiotherapy. One thousand people die each year due to inadequate treatment. There is extreme concern about this issue in my constituency. Representations have been made and meetings have taken place with the Minister for Health and Children about the Cappagh, Askeaton and Croagh area, where there is concern about the high level of cancers. The Mid-Western Health Board is examining the matter. Perhaps the Minister would outline the up to date position regarding the finalising of its report, which is due about now. It is feared there is a link between the incidence of cancer in that area and the animal health problems over a number of years in Askeaton and surrounding areas. There was a report on those problems by the environmental health agency which was not acceptable to the local people so it was referred abroad for analysis.</P>
      <P>The professor of surgery in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, Dr. Niall O'Higgins, told a conference on women and cancer in Dublin that 43% of women who develop breast cancer will die, compared to an EU average of 37%. Some EU countries have a breast cancer mortality rate of less than 30%. Still the Minister has not bitten the bullet on the need for rationalisation of breast cancer services. Like everything else, he has referred the report to one committee or another to examine.</P>
      <P>Cervical cancer screening is available in only one health board area. In June last year in the Southern Health Board area, GPs could not carry out routine smear testing because the test kits were not available. The Government's health strategy states, in relation to the national cancer strategy, that services at local, regional and national levels will be agreed by the end of 2003. The national cancer strategy implementation plan was launched in 1997 but, due to Government inaction, patients will have to wait another two years before there is agreement on services. How much longer after that will it be before services are provided? In the meantime, cancer patients must undertake 400 mile round trips for radiotherapy.</P>
      <P>The health strategy promised that a revised implementation plan would be published by the end of 2002. This is code for changing the goalposts because the original goals set in 1997 were not reached. The Minister for Health and Children launched the report of the national cancer registry and lauded the appointment of additional consultants and more spending. However, the cancer strategy launched in 1996 by the previous Administration stated that cancer kills about 7,500 people per year and an average of 18,000 new cases of cancer are recorded annually. That strategy set the objective of reducing cancer among those under 65 years by 15% by 2004. The question is whether these targets will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" />I am sceptical of the Minister's bland announcement and I believe the targets are not being met. Approximately 900 people per year die from secondary smoking, that is, inhaling somebody else's smoke. Why is this allowed to continue? The Government launches its reports, initiatives and studies with great fanfare but where is the follow through? In the document, &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;, endorsed by the Government, it was proposed that tobacco be removed from the consumer price index to avoid a situation where increases in the price of cigarettes, necessary from a public health point of view, are vetoed because of their potential impact on the inflation figures. The Minister, Deputy Martin, advocates this change but his colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, veto it. So much for discouraging smoking. Instead of real action, we get sponsorship of snooker tournaments with funds from the Department of Health of Children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue. My only complaint is that there is such a short period to debate a major issue of national concern. It concerns, in the most personal way, thousands of people and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>It is about 15 years since I first promoted the notion of a national cancer registry and the need to provide adequate funding so it could identify the statistics necessary to put the spotlight on sensitive areas and come up with a plan to deal with them. I was interested in the contribution made by Deputy Gormley. He referred to the various environmental problems and the implications of toxins, dioxins and so forth. It was most interesting. The only way we can put hard statistics together, however, is by carrying out a comprehensive survey of a region and comparing it with another. The comparison should then be extended to the countries with the best record of controlling, combating and treating cancer and those with the lowest incidence of cancer. There probably are genetic reasons but with the correct statistics to hand we could isolate that element and get further information. The resources available to the national cancer registry at present are inadequate to do the type of job required.</P>
      <P>In order to evaluate and combat a situation properly, it is necessary to put the statistics together in such a way that they can be generated immediately on a screen so a decision can be made on how to deal with it. That is also important for identifying causes. There are many locations here where people have concerns about the annual incidence of various cancers. To deal with that, we must give adequate resources to the national cancer registry to enable it to produce the statistics. The Minister will say, quite correctly, that extra resources have been provided, which is welcome, but not enough to make a real impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are places in the world with extremely <Col N="264" /> low incidence. The cause of this is either genetic or otherwise, and if we know the causes we can compare the statistics. The incidence of cancer in the Dublin area is higher than elsewhere. No one knows for certain the reasons for this. It might be that there is more assessment or earlier identification. It again comes down to how the national cancer registry can conduct research and publish the results to enable comparison. We will have achieved much in the fight against cancer if that we do that.</P>
    <P>Air pollution is greater in urban areas than rural. Yet, in the previous report &ndash; I have not had the opportunity to study the present one &ndash; Donegal and Kildare had similar incidences of cancer and populations and age profiles. We will only achieve results by comparing different counties. Tipperary North Riding and Tipperary South Riding have populations similar to north and south Kildare. However, the nearer to Dublin the greater the incidence.</P>
    <P>I am sorry there is so little time to debate this subject as it merits longer discussion and Members could make valuable contributions. I call for increased resources for the registry so that it can better do its job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have even a brief opportunity to discuss this report. My father contracted cancer, which may be the reason I am in the House, but it is why I am interested in this subject. Every Deputy believes that his or her area has the highest rate of incidence of any particular cancer, but we begin to question that when we have more information. Therefore, I welcome the report but regret that it only covers 1994 to 1998 and hope that we may get more up to date reports. It is important that it covers the time trends, variations in cancer risks, geographic differences, treatment and survival, as well as new and old cancers.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the major investment in cancer services by the Government since the implementation of the cancer strategy in 1997. Over &euro;103 million was invested since 1997 in the development of appropriate services for treatment and care of people with cancer. This enabled the funding of 62 additional consultant posts with support staff throughout the country, including eight additional consultant surgeons with a special interest in breast surgery. Having worked with Europa Donna, I know that this is very important to it and to Irish women.</P>
      <P>The national cancer registry report shows a clear divergence between female incidence and mortality rates in relation to breast cancer with a statistically significant upward trend in its incidence under 65 years and downward trend in mortality rates in all age groups combined. As the Minister stated, this divergence is expected to continue as a result of the continued improvement in treatment and the work of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the national cancer forum sub-group on the development of services for sympto<Col N="265" /> matic breast disease was published in March 2000. The Minister reported on the extensive consultations which took place in the past year between his Department and the health boards on the best way to develop symptomatic breast disease services in their functional areas. As others have said, this is difficult to resolve as everyone wants the best service in his or her own area. However, we must consider not the area but what is best for the woman concerned, and in light of that hard decisions must be taken.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board's proposals, in line with the recommendations of the sub-group's report, include the appointment of a consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery at Letterkenny with a sessional commitment to Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. This is unique as it is the first time that a surgeon will be appointed with North-South sessional commitments, which is an important aspect of the Good Friday Agreement. I am glad that financial clearance has issued for this post with seven sessions in Letterkenny and four in Altnagelvin The latter sessions will include two triple assessment clinics, one operating session and one follow-up session.</P>
    <P>The board will also develop at Letterkenny a fully equipped breast unit which will include stereotactile mammography and local laboratory facilities, which will enable triple assessment to take place there. It is important that radiology services are provided on both sites and protocols and standards of care will be cross-Border to ensure the best international standards, alongside developing auditing and evaluation mechanisms. This is a very exciting development for women in the north-west and I compliment the Minister on advancing it.</P>
    <P>These initiatives will be complemented by other North-South initiatives, particularly on cancer research. Under an October 1999 memorandum of understanding with the US national cancer institute, a cancer consortium was established representing the NCI and the health Departments, North and South, with the objectives of creating an all-Ireland infrastructure for cancer research and clinical cancer investigations, to formalise and facilitate intersections with Irish cancer research communities and to develop joint programmes in and to enhance the infrastructure for clinical cancer research with the anticipated outcome of improved patient care. Among the key areas for development are co-operation between the cancer registries, the establishment of a robust clinical trials network linking the three participants, the creation of communication links by way of Telesynergy links and support for a scholar exchange programme.</P>
    <P>On 1 May 2001 the two cancer registries published the first all-Ireland cancer incidence and mortality report. This is particularly important to my constituency in the north west region, where Donegal is north of the North. Regular meetings take place to standardise data collection between registries to facilitate other projects throughout <Col N="266" /> the island. Offering patients access to new treatments for cancer is increasingly seen as a guarantee of high quality treatment. Participation in high quality clinical trials is a characteristic of the world's leading cancer centres. Ireland as a whole is an attractive place to conduct these as the population is genetically homogenous and there is a good information base within extended families. Stimulated by the cancer consortium, consideration is being given to the most appropriate models for the development of a clinical trials infrastructure here, given the multiplicity of cancer treatment units and the requirement to co-ordinate activities in them. The intention is to fund some centres to conduct such trials at the level already achieved in Belfast City Hospital and to fund an all-Ireland group to co-ordinate the trial activity. Four awards were announced under this initiative by the health research board in November 2001 to St. Vincent's and St. Luke's in Dublin, UCH Galway, Cork University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. Two planning grants were awarded to the Mater Hospital, Dublin, and Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>Telesynergy is an advanced video conferencing facility which enables clinicians, researchers and educators to communicate in real time over long distances, which is of great relevance to my constituency and to the cases cited by Deputy Durkan, where people must make round trips of 400 miles. Telesynergy will be of great use in supporting clinical trial activity, in consulting on rare or difficult cancers and in postgraduate medical training through its rapid data transmission and high resolution imaging transfer of pathological material. Funding for the facility has been provided in St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, and Belfast City Hospital.</P>
    <P>A further essential part of developing a proper research capacity of international standard involves the need to develop in-staff development. A scholar exchange programme was outlined in the memorandum of understanding. The consortium is focused on short-term visits of professionals working in cancer and longer-term fellowships for those wishing to become professional leaders in their fields. The Government will continue to strive to ensure the provision of appropriate standards of treatment and care to patients with cancer. I join my colleagues in welcoming the fifth report of the National Cancer Registry. It will be invaluable to the Department of Health and Children and the National Cancer Forum in their report on the revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy, as set out in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>As a convenor of the Oireachtas committee on health, I could continue for the rest of the day on the issue of cancer. Our committee is working on the causes of lung cancer with respect to the tobacco issue and I had a chance to outline our concerns on Second Stage of the Tobacco Bill. I compliment the Minister on this motion and on the fact that we are to take Report and Final Stages <Col N="267" /> of the Tobacco Bill. That will bring in stringent controls on the sale of tobacco and in other areas.</P>
    <P>At the time of the first cancer strategy in 1996 there was a north-south divide along a line from Dublin to Galway. I felt very annoyed by that and expressed my views here about it. I am delighted that links with the north-west and the Administration and Executive in the North have ensured that real, substantive movement has occurred to develop cancer services. People from the north-west are now truly getting the advantages of the services they need.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the North-Western Health Board on assisting those with cancer who must travel to Dublin for treatment by subsidising flights from Carrickfinn and Derry to Dublin. The Friends of Letterkenny General Hospital have also done great work by fundraising for a bus service, which gives a little comfort to people who badly need it and who must make long treks to Dublin because we lack facilities in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a critical debate because there is widespread fear and anxiety throughout the country among young and old about the ravaging effects of cancer. I do not always agree with Deputy Gormley but he made a valid point about trying to identify some of the sources and causes of cancer. One is the high radon level in our national schools. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has surveyed 4,000 schools and some work has been done to remedy the effects of radon gas in schools. There is a recognised method of dealing with it which costs money. However, not only are there high levels of radon in schools and other institutions, there is a high level of radon in some domestic dwellings. The difficulty is that insufficient effort is being made by both the Department of the Environment and Local Government and, presumably, the RPII to deal with the issue effectively once and for all.</P>
      <P>There is no question about the link between cancers and radon levels. For that reason I emphasise for the Minister of State and the Department how vitally important it is to deal with this. I and other Deputies have raised it constantly over the years &ndash; we are weary of doing so. It is particularly bad in some parts of Clare, such as the national schools in the Burren area. Some but not all have been dealt with and there is now an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise the valuable work being done by some of the voluntary organisations. I was involved in a campaign a weekend ago with Dr. Willie Walsh, the Bishop of Killaloe, and the West Clare Cancer Support Group. It is organised by a young man whose friend suffered a tragedy due to cancer, Willie McGrath of Kilkee, and he has organised a huge number of events, collecting &euro;100,000 in one afternoon to help provide facilities for those suffering from cancer. I do not need to tell the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the effects cancer can have on families and the <Col N="268" /> depression it can cause across communities. In dealing with the symptoms and effects of some of the causes of cancer and in dealing with the problems the strategy has identified, it is vitally important that the main focus from the research point of view must be directed at establishing the links between radon and cancer, for example, and dealing with those so that effective remedies can be found.</P>
    <P>If one cannot deal with the national schools, attended by young people, which have high levels of radon that may inflict cancer on those children in later life, the strategy, no matter how it is presented, will be a failure. We have many statistics and facts and much valuable work is being done by professionals, but there has to be more partnership between local voluntary organisations and the professionals providing services so they can all be in a position to make life easier for those suffering from cancer. We must find ways to deal with these matters, which are causing widespread anxiety and concern in every constituency.</P>
    <P>We in Ennis were concerned by the decision not to renew the mammography equipment in Ennis General Hospital, which was mainly provided by voluntary effort from the local communities. The health board has responded and I record our appreciation of the Minister, his staff and the Mid-Western Health Board for their investment in that unit in Ennis. There is a need to proceed urgently with the centres of excellence suggested by the committee set up to examine these matters, particularly when dealing with breast, lung and prostate cancer. These are causing widespread dismay in communities and every possible effort must be made, particularly in funding research and applying EU directives which have not been implemented in Irish law. There is a raft of legislation at EU level dealing with patients receiving treatment which may affect their physical well-being.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the necessity to deal with the causes of cancers, which are not being dealt with effectively. There must be better co-operation between voluntary organisations, people who work in cancer support groups, the Department and the health boards to provide badly needed services for people who suffer from cancer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and other Deputies who spoke on this debate in welcoming the publication of the fifth report of the National Cancer Registry. The report marks a significant milestone in cancer surveillance in Ireland. It presents comprehensive data in treatment and survival patterns nationally between 1994 and 1998. However, it is important to reiterate that the data presented refers to a period which predates the significant investment made in cancer services, particularly by the Government, since the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997. The initial investment in cancer <Col N="269" /> services focused on the development of structures and processes required to improve the delivery of services to patients with cancer. It takes time for these structures to be developed and for the investment to be reflected in cancer treatment services. The data reported in the National Cancer Registry's report reflects only one year since investment under the national cancer strategy and a three year period prior to that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the report identifies that there was no significant change in the risk of developing or dying from cancer between 1994 and 1998. The incidence of cancer in Ireland was similar to that in England, but below that in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Most cancers had an incidence close to the European average. As regards treatment, the report states that most patients received cancer specific treatment. Cancer survival five years after diagnosis was 43%. Diagnosis at a younger age for all cancers conferred survival advantage for both men and women, although the magnitude of the advantage varied with the cancer type. One of the most important factors influencing survival was the stage of the cancer, that is, how advanced the cancer was when detected.</P>
      <P>The Minister reported today on the major developments in the treatment and care of patients with cancer which have taken place since the launch in November 1996 of the national cancer strategy. The principal objectives of the strategy are to take all measures to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer and to ensure that those who develop the disease receive the most effective treatment and care. The commitments in the action plan of March 1997 have been funded and have either been implemented or are in the course of implementation.</P>
      <P>From 1997 to date more than &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. That includes the provision of &euro;23.5 million this year which was allocated between all health boards for the continuing development of oncology and haematology services, for oncology drug treatments and for the continuing development of symptomatic breast disease services. As the Minister reported, this funding has enabled the appointment of 62 additional consultant posts in key areas together with support staff, including eight additional consultant surgeon posts with a special interest in breast surgery. In 2000, national screening programmes for both breast and cervical cancer were initiated on a phased basis and both BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, and the national cervical screening programme are currently in discussion with health boards concerning expansion of the programmes nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has identified the need for comprehensive and strengthened legislative measures to tackle tobacco use as his number one public health priority. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill was introduced in the Oireachtas last December and the target date for its enactment is Easter <Col N="270" /> 2002. The Bill confers enabling powers on the Minister for Health and Children to extend environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and facilities not already covered by existing legislation. The Ireland-Northern Ireland US National Cancer Institute Consortium, established in October 1999, has resulted in the development of joint cancer research projects, scholar exchange programmes and a range of other collaborative activities.</P>
    <P>In the context of the national health strategy, the National Cancer Forum continues to play an important role in relation to the planning, development and implementation of cancer services for the country. Areas such as protocols for the care and treatment of cancer patients, information requirements, audit and evaluation of our services, genetic issues and further screening programmes, are important component parts of the appropriate future development of cancer services. The forum, as the established expert advisory body, will report to the Minister on these issues. To facilitate the process, forum sub-groups have recently been established on generic screening, generic symptomatic disease, genetics, evaluation and outcomes and evidence based medicine.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy identifies a range of specific cancer-related actions to be achieved over the next seven years. Actions on major lifestyle factors targeted in the national cancer strategy will be enhanced. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill will be enacted and implemented as a matter of urgency. A reduction in smoking will continue to be targeted through Government fiscal policies. The programmes of screening for breast and cervical cancer will be extended nationally. A national palliative care service will be developed. The strategy has also identified the need for the preparation by the end of 2002 of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. The plan will be prepared by the Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert group on radiotherapy services.</P>
    <P>As regards the sub-groups of the forum, the proposed implementation plan for the national cancer strategy will set out the structures in terms of how the National Cancer Forum will support the strategy and give a focus to the work of the sub-groups. Their overall purpose will be to support the Department in framing the implementation plan in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum. Following publication of the national plan, individual health boards, in consultation with the National Cancer Forum, will develop new regional cancer plans which will identify additional requirements for the development of <Col N="271" /> integrated evidence based treatment and palliative services for people with cancer.</P>
    <P>As regards directing the way in which investment takes place, ensuring integration of services and that the objectives of the cancer strategy are realised, the health strategy provides a significant opportunity for the forum to shape its work. It is also intended that the National Cancer Forum will work with the national hospitals agency and the health information and quality authority to ensure service quality, accessibility and responsiveness.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of the effect cancer has on our family members. We have also lost Members of this House to cancer in recent years. It is a commitment of both the Opposition and of Government to constantly strive to ensure quality services for cancer in this country. The framework set out in the health strategy will ensure we are successful in our endeavours to provide the necessary information and the co-ordinated services to ensure positive results in our ongoing campaign against cancer.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the amount of time that people serve on the board. We had a similar set of amendments in regard to the Railway Procurement Agency. Currently the amount of time a member can serve on the board is quite long. We would prefer a situation whereby the Minister would have the wherewithal to change that after a period of time if he so wishes. The time is the same but there is a division in the middle of it where it is broken into two five-year terms. Members will not be allowed to serve more than two consecutive terms, each of five years. It gives the Minister an opportunity to make changes to the board if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage and I thought we had reached agreement. As I stated on Committee Stage, I feel this is too constraining. The provisions of subsections (7), (8), (9), and (10) are a package designed to meet the objectives of both continuity and change. I believe those provisions meet that which the Deputy aspires to. They ensure continuity and allow for the possibility of re-appointing a member to a second term if the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance feels the board would benefit by that second term. At the same time the provisions allow for new blood to come on to the board.</P>
      <P>Any change to this package could render these subsections inoperable. I am anxious to keep the package intact. I understood that the Deputy very kindly acceded to my demand for this package to remain unchanged. To allay any concerns that colleagues may have in regard to the ten-year period, I wish to assure them that there is no automatic right to re-appointment.</P>

      <P>This came out of Committee proceedings and we decided to put it forward again to have another discussion on it. It is very subjective that a member of the board may be removed at any time if in the Minister's opinion the member has become incapable through ill-health and so on. The phrase &ldquo;in the Minister's opinion&rdquo; is unnecessary. If the person has become incapable through ill-health then that is a fact and the Minister's opinion should not really come into it. Objective evidence should be produced rather than leaving it to the subjective view of the Minister of the day whether or not a person is capable of performing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The current wording in the Bill is important and must be retained. I accept that the removal of a board member is a very serious step. However, it could very well be necessary if a member of the board becomes incapacitated. Before a Minister would remove a board member in such circumstance he must form an opinion that a board member is ill or unable to fulfil their duties. In forming an opinion the Minister would, of course, consult the appropriate people, including medical people if health issues are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any board member removed in this way who feels aggrieved and thinks the Minster may have acted unreasonably may seek judicial review of the Minister's decision in the courts. As Deputies are aware, such provisions are standard in many Acts setting up bodies to which appointments are made, including one brought forward by my <Col N="274" /> Department, the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001, as well as the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998, the Comhairle Act, 2000 and the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the position with regard to that issue. It is a serious matter if someone is removed from a board and obviously it would not be taken lightly.

      <P>In page 7, lines 44 and 45, to delete &ldquo;have regard to the objective&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;comply with the requirement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The issue here is one of gender balance on the board. The section as drafted states that the Minister shall have regard to the objective of there being not less than four members who are women and not less than four who are men. That is a watery and a pathetically weak way to implement a clearly stated Government policy. The Government has a clear policy on the matter and I ask the Minister of State to implement it, rather than pay distant lip service to it by saying it will &ldquo;have regard to the objective&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I know what &ldquo;having regard to&rdquo; means. I know of a case taken by a county medical officer against a county manager where the county manager had to &ldquo;have regard&rdquo; to the county medical officer's opinion in the allocation of housing. The matter went to the Supreme Court, which said all that was required of the county manager was to be aware of and to have read the report of the county medical officer. Having had regard to it, the county manager could then ignore it, though he had to be conscious of what was in it before making a decision. The same thing is being said here. The phrase &ldquo;having regard to the objective&rdquo; is weak given the strength of the Government's policy on the matter. I ask that the words be taken out and the phrase &ldquo;comply with the requirement&rdquo; inserted. Even if the phrase &ldquo;comply with Government policy&rdquo; were substituted, I would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>Colleagues may be aware that I pro<Col N="275" /> posed the wording in section 10(17) by way of ministerial amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad. The provision, as it now stands, reflects Government policy on the principle of equality regarding appointments to the boards of State bodies. The wording, as it now stands, places a moral obligation on Ministers appointing board members to appoint at least four females and at least four males. Ministers take Government policy in this area very seriously and strive to fulfil the quota of female board members. As 11 members will be appointed by the Minister &ndash; the chief executive will be an <i>ex-officio</i> member &ndash; four members will correspond to roughly 40% of the appointees. I am satisfied the wording is sufficiently strong to ensure Government policy is fulfilled. This formulation has met with Oireachtas approval in the Comhairle Act, 2000, and I hope it meets the Deputy's requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. This Government has a dismal record of implementing its policy in the matter of gender balance. That is true of all Ministers and even Deputy Jacob's senior at the Department of Public Enterprise has a very bad record in the matter of appointing women, despite being a woman herself. I would not have expected the need to apply moral pressure in her case. Moral pressure is not working; what is needed is legal sanction on the Minister requiring him or her to implement Government policy. I will be disappointed if this amendment is not accepted. I am sure the moral pressure this section puts on someone as highly moralistic as the Minister of State is sufficient, but others may not be as perfect as him. Therefore, to ensure his successors comply with this policy, I strongly suggest that at a minimum we state that Government policy is to be implemented. This is to be permanent legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9)&nbsp;(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;Where the office of Chief Executive is vacant the Board may designate a member of the staff of the Authority to perform the functions of the Chief Executive which designation shall continue in force for no longer than the period of the vacancy in that office.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;The Board may revoke or alter a designation made under <i>paragraph (a)</i> at any time.</P>
      <P>(10)&nbsp;(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;Where the Chief Executive is absent from duty and no member of the staff of the Authority has been assigned by the Chief Executive to perform the duties of the Chief Executive in his or her absence the  Board may designate a member of the staff of the Authority to perform  the functions of the Chief Executive which designation shall continue in  force for no longer than the period of the absence of the Chief Executive.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;The Board may revoke or alter a designation made under paragraph (<i>a</i>) at any time.</P>
      <P>(11)&nbsp;Nothing in <i>subsections (9)</i> or <i>(10)</i> shall entitle a person designated to perform functions of the Chief Executive to be a member of the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question of appointing someone to carry out the functions of the chief executive in his or her absence, or when the post is vacant, is one I promised to come back to on Report Stage. This is the subject of amendments Nos. 32 and 34. It is a matter to which I have given much thought as it is not as simple as it initially appears. I had a few problems with the wording of amendment No. 34 when it was proposed on Committee Stage and I have, therefore, brought forward an amendment of my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three contingencies must be provided for. The chief executive may be away on business or on holiday and in such circumstances he or she would normally designate another member of staff to carry out his or her duties. This circumstance is covered by section 16(5) of the Bill. The second contingency involves a vacancy arising in the post, due to the retirement, resignation, dismissal or death of a chief executive. Pending the appointment of a successor the board may wish to designate someone to carry out the functions of chief executive. The third contingency is the most difficult to provide for. What happens if a <Col N="277" /> chief executive is hospitalised for some unforeseen reason such as a heart attack or an accident? He or she will have been unable to designate someone to carry out his or her duties. If the absence is likely to be prolonged, the board may wish to appoint someone to carry out the functions of chief executive until that officer returns. The amendment I propose is designed to meet the contingency of a vacancy arising due to the unforeseen absence of a chief executive. It avoids the danger of cutting across the contract of employment between the chief executive and the authority and meets the concerns of the Deputies proposing amendment No. 34. For that reason, they will perhaps accept it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 was discussed on Committee Stage and Deputies accepted the strength of the argument I made for rejecting it. The amendment's proposals are covered by section 16(5). It is clearly a matter for the chief executive to ensure the functions of the authority, as well as his or her own, are carried out properly and adequately. The chief executive must make all necessary arrangements for that and ensuring he or she does will form an important part of the contract of employment with the board. I fear providing that the consent of the board be required in this instance could constrain the effective operation of the authority.</P>

      <P>We felt this was a rather important area because we are dealing with energy and at some stage there will be potential conflicts of interests, possibly where there are very large sums of money involved. We know energy can be a pretty lucrative area. We wanted to ensure that if somebody had a potential conflict of interest, he or she would make it known at least and would not pursue an interest which he or she knew to be in conflict with the workings of the authority. The amendment would strengthen the provisions already in the Bill. The Minister of State has had an opportunity to examine this proposal and I look forward to hearing what he has to say on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Stanton withdrew this amendment on Committee Stage. I am satisfied that the concern behind the amendment is already covered to a large extent by the existing text. In addition the Department of Finance's new code of practice for the governance of State bodies provides that all State bodies should have written codes of business conduct for directors and employees. Appendix B of the Department of Finance's code contains the framework for a code of business conduct. One of the items in this embraces the issue of conflicts of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment is strange. It deals with potential conflicts of interest or circum<Col N="279" /> stances where a person has a doubt about whether he or she has conflicted. I remain of the view that either there is a conflict of interest or there is not. The inclusion of &ldquo;a potential conflict of interest&rdquo; would involve a substantial broadening of the provision. Where a person has any doubt in regard to a conflict of interest, then of course he or she is required to go and establish the fact or otherwise of a conflict.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy is proposing in relation to a potential conflict and doubt about a conflict gives rise to concern. The Deputy suggests that the person be required to desist from pursuing an interest which gives rise to the conflict. This again seems to go far beyond anything this House has contemplated before. Where a conflict exists, the action a person must take is set down in section 18(1) of the Bill. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister correctly pointed out, there are two parts to this proposal. The first part has to do with a potential conflict of interest where the board member would be obliged to notify the board of the potential conflict. If the person was concerned, he or she would go to the board and say that there may be a conflict of interest here, ask advice and let them know about it at least. The second part is very clear, that if somebody has a conflict of interest, he or she would desist from pursuing that. I think that is accepted by everybody.</P>
      <P>Similar amendments have appeared in other legislation from the Minister of State's Department. While the Minister stated that the amendment is strange, I can point out the Acts in which there are similar provisions. That said, I am satisfied that the Minister of State has given us an assurance that it is already covered in the Bill and he has examined it closely with his officials, and I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>When I was welcoming the Minister's decision to include this body under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, seemingly I was misheard by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who was listening to his monitor. He thought I was saying that this was the first amendment of mine accepted in five years. That was not the case. I have tabled similar amendments to practically every Bill. This is the <Col N="280" /> first time for such amendment to be accepted and I thank the Minister of State for accepting it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 7 to 10, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;Dáil&rdquo; in line 7 down to and including &ldquo;General&rdquo; in line 10 and substitute &ldquo;either or both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill seems to confine the democratic accountability of the body to the Committee of Public Accounts because no other committee fits the description in this section. It would mean that the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, which is the primary committee dealing with this body, could not call the chief executive before it.</P>
      <P>I expected the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport would be the primary committee in this matter, would deal with the policy issues and would be the committee before which the chief executive would appear. The Bill states, however, the chief executive shall give evidence to &ldquo;a Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rdquo;, that is, the Committee of Public Accounts and not any other committee.</P>
      <P>I presume this is a mistake and that the Minister does not mean to confine the democratic accountability of this body to the Committee of Public Accounts. I am sure the spokespersons from all parties would be amazed to find that the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport would not also have the right to summon the chief executive and have him before them on a regular basis to advise and inform them about what was happening. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with these amendments, mainly because I believe I have already catered for what the Deputy is seeking. I ask the Deputy to read sections 24 and 25 together. In both sections there is a requirement on the chief executive to appear before Oireachtas committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 24, which deals with the report and accounts of the authority, the chief executive, by virtue of subsection (4), is required to appear before a Dáil committee examining the appropriation accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Examination of and reporting to the Dáil on the appropriation accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a specific function of the Dáil <Col N="281" /> and, therefore, of a Dáil committee. In effect, we are referring here to the Committee of Public Accounts and the chief executive is required to give evidence to that committee on all matters pertaining to the expenditure of the authority.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the Deputy looks at section 25(5), it can be seen that the chief executive is required to appear before a committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas to account for the performance of the functions of the authority. In those circumstances I am satisfied that the intent of the Deputy's amendment is provided for when we look at the requirements contained in sections 24 and 25 together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>Can I take it then, from what the Minister of State stated, that subsections 24(4) and 25(5) have equal status, that the Committee of Public Accounts has a clear right and that the other committee will also be able to do what I suggested? My legal advice is that section 24(4) supersedes that because of the specified nature of the committee, but my legal advice could be wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister shall make information on the finances and operation of the agency available to Dáil Members in response to Parliamentary Questions and the Authority shall co-operate in the matter when requested to do so by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the last amendments with which we will be dealing. It relates to a matter that is raised here again and again, namely, the accountability of authorities such as this to this House, especially at Question Time. We have endeavoured to make it possible for the incumbent Minister to give information on the workings and finances of such authorities to Deputies by way of parliamentary questions. This is what we think democracy is about and it should be possible. We agree the Minister should not interfere in the day to day running of such agencies, authorities or bodies. While we acknowledge that such bodies and their chief executives can be brought before committees of this House, we note it can happen only rarely and maybe only once per year. Because of the extra work in which the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport was involved this year, it was unable to carry out many of its functions. Many of the agencies and bodies under the remit of that committee, such as An Post, Aer Lingus, the ESB and others, were not invited to give an account of their stewardship. Deputies have been unable to get infor<Col N="282" /> mation in the House or hold anyone to account. If the work of the committees is stymied there is no way the citizens, through their Deputies, can hold these public money spending agencies to account.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides one way in which this could be done. We have acknowledged that both the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, have done their best to make available such information when asked to do so by way of parliamentary questions. However, that is not always the case. Many Ministers have said they are not accountable to the Dáil on certain matters and do not give any information. The amendment makes it possible for Deputies to get information on the workings and finances of this body through parliamentary questions without holding the Minister to account for its day to day operation. It is something we should incorporate in all legislation and I know they do so in other jurisdictions. I hope the Minister has considered this since Committee Stage and will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. It is very much along the lines of an argument I have made for a considerable time about the diminution of democracy by moving authority from this Chamber to outside bodies and quangos. While most Members agree that is the case, there is no agreement on how we should tackle it, what the alternative is or how we should ensure responsibility remains in the House. I am a member of the Dáil Reform Committee. It had a very strong proposal that Ministers should do what this amendment proposes. The permanent government in the Civil Service kicked up hell, it could not be described as anything else. They got the Ministers to put pressure on the committee to dilute that recommendation. There is a diluted form in the Dáil reform package which will come before us &ndash; hopefully &ndash; at some time in the near future.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is adjudged not to be responsible to the House on a matter, the Ceann Comhairle is obliged to disallow questions. That happens on a regular basis. From my limited time in a Department I am aware of what happens when a question arrives there. The Department first seeks to establish if it is a repeat question. It can be thrown out on that basis. It next checks to see if it is the responsibility of another Minister but the main one used is the issue of accountability &ndash; the Minister has no responsibility to the House. The Ceann Comhairle will then write to tell the Member the question is disallowed. If it is found to be a question that the Minister has to answer, one could write a book on the procedure used. I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendment but it is something the House needs to address. Power is being moved from it all the time.</P>

      <P>This amendment hits a raw nerve in many of us. It is a common practice to be told <Col N="283" /> the matter being raised is a matter for an agency and not the Minister. I hope this amendment can be accepted in some form so that counter measures can be put in place to ensure we do not get letters like that when we seek information about the work, operation or finances of the sustainable energy authority. As things stand, many questions will be put to the Minister which will refer to the authority. Given that the Minister will retain responsibility, I want the Minister of State to assure me that those questions will be answered. To what extent does the Minister of State believe questions will be answered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In matters such as this the answer normally is that the Minister is not responsible for the day to day running of semi-State bodies or boards and is responsible only for policy. Let us consider what is currently happening with An Post. There is widespread concern over the threatened closure of 800 to 1,000 post offices. It is a matter we should be able to discuss in this House. This is a practical example of what we are speaking about and is something which affects many people across the country.</P>
      <P>The Bill will have considerable impact on the midlands. In the event of it affecting Shannonbridge or Lanesboro, either by policy made by the sustainable energy authority or the Government, we should be able to discuss it here. Rhode power station is closing down while Ferbane has already been closed. I am prevented from asking a Minister a specific question about why Rhode was closed when it should have been kept open. The Minister will tell me that is a matter for the day-to-day workings of the board and she has no power in that regard. There is a duty imposed on Members by the people they represent to ascertain what is happening. We are prevented from doing so. In 1972, when the health boards were being established, I recall a row that ran for two weeks because questions or discussions regarding health boards were not going to be allowed. We are very restricted on what questions we can ask about health issues.</P>
      <P>We have a duty and a right to air our views. This Bill has given us some opportunity to discuss what is happening in the midlands. Many people have been hurt by the closure of Ferbane and Rhode power stations. I am delighted Lanesboro power station has been approved by An Bord Pleanála and I am also pleased the Environmental Protection Agency has given it an integrated pollution control licence. I also await a decision on planning permission for Shannonbridge which I expect in the next few days.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Bill and hope all Stages are dealt with this evening, the amendment is a good one and I recommend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>While I empathise with the sentiments expressed by all four colleagues and contained in Deputy Stanton's amendment, I do not <Col N="284" /> see how the matter can be rectified in one Bill or through one authority or State agency. We have already had a good discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage. Under Dáil Standing Orders, parliamentary questions may be asked of the Minister relating to Government policy concerning any State body under his or her aegis. However, we have all seen that happen to which Members referred.</P>
      <P>If there is to be any change in this regard, it would be more appropriately made to the Standing Orders of this House. It would be inappropriate to have inconsistency in the requirements for answering parliamentary questions, which would be the outcome of the acceptance of the amendment. Clearly there cannot be different sets of rules for different State bodies in this area. I do not oppose the spirit of what the Deputy seeks to do with the support of his colleagues. However, this is not the appropriate vehicle for it. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Stagg, I did not expect the Minister of State to accept the amendment, but it gave us an opportunity to voice our opinion on this strange development where authority is transferred from Ministers to an increasing number of bodies. For example, the Bill states that its purpose is to move authority from the Minister to the Sustainable Energy Authority.</P>
      <P>I am sure there will not be a problem with the management of the authority in the sense that, if any of us seek information from it, we will probably receive it. However, in two, three or ten years' time, with changes in personnel, it may not continue to supply information to Members who seek it. I am sure the Minister of State knows there are State agencies, which have been mentioned before in this regard, which neither respond to Members who voice the legitimate concerns of their constituents nor supply information. One may receive a curt response to the effect that the matter is being examined or has been referred somewhere else. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>We bemoan the fact that increasing numbers of people do not vote or are apathetic about politics. I put it to the Minister of State that this development is one of the reasons. Members feel increasingly helpless and powerless. The only people who have power are Ministers. That is not right and is dangerous. If we cannot obtain information, then the only people with power are Ministers.</P>
      <P>Even committees of the House are not given the resources to investigate and ask questions. I already cited the example of the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport which was starved of resources as officials attached to it worked night and day on the sub-committee inquiry. This meant the committee proper was not able to perform its functions. Why have committees in that case? Why not abolish them and establish a commissar to run the show?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers probably want all the power for themselves. Some of them complain about all the <Col N="285" /> hard work they must do. If they shared it a little, they might have less work.</P>

It would not have been earth-shattering and he agreed with the intent of the amendment in any event. While he said he did not oppose it, he does not want to accept it, probably because he does not have the courage to take it on board. He could accept the amendment and no one could stop him from doing so. We would certainly agree with and support him in doing so. This is one of the few remaining amendments to a Bill on which we have worked very hard. The Minister of State should take his courage in his hands and make a name for himself by accepting the amendment. I am sure the sky will not fall in nor will there be an earthquake if he does so.</P>

      <P>I have never seen or read about a group of people who had power and gave it up without a struggle. Members vote power away every day and we will soon be worse than a county council. We will not even have a county manager. This is all in the name of what is called &ldquo;independence&rdquo;. This appears to mean not having anything to do with people who are elected. If a person is elected, he or she is a type of leper or criminal who cannot be trusted. Everything about him or her is bad. However, a person is fine if he or she is not elected. In fact, some failed electoral candidates become independent controllers and, apparently, are paragons of virtue. They are untouchable and pure. However, if a person has the misfortune to manage to get 8,000 people to vote for him or her, then he or she cannot be allowed to be in control of anything. It would be political, as if some form of leprosy were attached&mdash;</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill. The Minister of State met many of the requirements of the Opposition, which is welcome. Great efforts are being made by the ESB and Bord na Móna with regard to energy production in respect of which the new stations being built are 35% more efficient. They are also cleaner while their dust emissions have been drastically reduced. I am pleased that a full licence and planning permission have been granted to the station at Lanesboro. I hope we will hear within the next week that An Bord Pleanála has granted planning permission to the station at Shannonbridge. The Environmental Protection Agency has been very helpful with regard to Lanesboro and I hope it will be equally helpful with regard to Shannonbridge.</P>
      <P>The public service obligation is extremely important for the ESB and Bord na Móna in the midlands. I cannot over emphasise the importance of this Bill in ensuring employment is provided in the midland counties of Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. People in the midlands are fully supportive of the Bill because of the major importance of Bord na Móna and the ESB.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to do everything possible to have the Bill debated in Seanad Éireann tomorrow. I stress the urgency of having it enacted soon.</P>

      <P>The Green Party welcomes the establishment of the Sustainable Energy Authority and the passing of this Bill, in so far as it relates to enabling the authority to do its work, based on the scientific information it will need, the important message it must get across and the recommendations it must make. It is a matter of some sadness that the Bill is somewhat spoiled by having matters included in it which should be debated in their own right. To put them into a sustainable energy Bill does not help to state the exact purpose of the Sustainable Energy Authority, but rather muddies the waters.</P>

    <P>The PSO addresses the needs of communities and the economic basis on which they depend, but it is a challenge for us to resolve the contradiction of trying to benefit communities while encouraging the continuing use of a finite and increasingly rare resource. Not only are we paying for this PSO, but we will also be paying for the problems associated with our Kyoto Protocol obligations which we are failing to meet. <Col N="292" /> Insurance companies will make us pay all the more for the flooding and storm damage which climate change is bringing about.</P>
    <P>We must accept the need for triple taxation. We must conserve energy and build a lean economy. I tried to have this issue debated and included in this Bill, but my proposals were not accepted. I ask the Minister of State to keep this problem at the forefront of his mind. If we do not do this, we will be forced to face the problem one way or the other.</P>

      <P>The Bill is not perfect. I had hoped some Opposition amendments would have been accepted. However, I know the Minister of State has done his best to accept many of our amendments and appreciate his efforts in doing so.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that a large number of amendments were not tabled until Report Stage. I would have preferred them to be debated on Committee Stage. I am assured this was absolutely necessary on this occasion, but the practice is not desirable and should be avoided.</P>
      <P>I wish the new authority and those working in it well. Until now it has been constrained by budgetary provisions, but it will now have the resources and authority to develop sustainable energy to its maximum. We have the capacity to be a world leader in the field of sustainable energy. Much work has been done in the development of wind energy and much could be done in the development of wave and solar energy and in insulation and energy conservation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State allowed a full debate on every stage of the Bill for which I am grateful. The Bill is merely the first step in developing the area of sustainable energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time we have had a Private Members' motion on this issue, or the second or third, but it is probably the last time in the lifetime of this Government that we will have the opportunity to discuss traffic in this way. We have just one message for the Government, namely, that it has blown it. The Government is out of chances, having had all the chances that a Government any time or anywhere could ever wish for. It had five golden years of limitless potential. It had the opportunity, money, time, advice and expertise, but at the end of its term in office it has delivered nothing.</P>
      <P>I had no doubt that the Minister would table an amendment to the motion telling us about the few extra buses and rail carriages that have been provided. The Minister should be ashamed to admit to such a pathetically inadequate response when the Government knows only too well the scale of the problem. If it does not, over 1.5 million people in the Dublin region alone will let it know on election day.</P>
      <P>When the Government came to power five long years ago, it certainly inherited a congested city centre, but now, at the end of its term, that same congestion has spread to every village, town and suburb in the entire Dublin region. Through the Government's gross incompetence and inertia, it has all but destroyed the capital as a viable place to do business and made it a thoroughly unpleasant place in which to live. These are inescapable facts and no amount of PR packaging will disguise them. Congestion of intolerable proportions is what Dubliners live with every day: that is the reality of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, many commentators have predicted that we will end up with total gridlock and that we will wake up some morning and nobody will be able to move at all. I never subscribed to that view. I predicted that the gradual stranglehold of congestion would force rational people into making rational decisions and that they would ultimately withdraw from a battle they could not win. That is exactly what has happened. Slowly but surely jobs in every sector of the economy, particularly those in distribution and any <Col N="294" /> industry that requires any degree of mobility, are being eroded.</P>
    <P>A recent survey placed Dublin only just above Calcutta for ease of doing business. Why would any company locate a business in Dublin when it could not do its business with any degree of ease and when workers could take up to two hours to travel a short distance to work? Throughout Dublin, average commuting times have doubled during the Minister's term of office. Congestion is estimated to be costing £1 billion annually, but the figure is impossible to estimate. It is incalculable and probably a multiple of that figure. Competitiveness is suffering. The Minister has heard that from every possible report, whether from IBEC, the Competitiveness Council or the chambers of commerce. While the Minister might blame the events of 11 September for many things, the reality is that congestion in Dublin and all around Ireland and the lack of infrastructure are at least as great a contributor to the reduction in growth rates and the nose-dive in tax revenue in recent times.</P>
    <P>Whatever about business operating, people have to live in this city too. Their quality of life has dropped immeasurably during the past five years. In my constituency, which is a mere five, six or seven miles from the central business district, the average commuting time is anything from 1.25 hours to two hours. People are spending up to 20 hours per week just sitting in their cars trying to get to work. Is it any wonder that our health bill is going through the roof and that people are trying to retire earlier from work? They cannot stand the stress of this. At weekends, when they do have a bit of free time, the public transport system, such as it is, disappears off the streets altogether so that mobility is even worse. The smallest local journey is now an endurance test.</P>
    <P>When the Minister entered Government, the transport deficit was considerable. The Minister stands indicted because for every year she has been in Government the transport deficit has become greater. The challenge as now defined in the DTO's Platform for Change is to reverse entirely the modal split between public transport and car usage. That is a mammoth task requiring an increase in the transport capacity by a factor of four and a half. Even then, by 2016, the number of cars on the road will be exactly the same as it is today. Therefore, just to stand still, an enormous investment is required. Nobody expected or even demanded that rail transport would be provided overnight, but people did have a right to expect that the Government would begin to provide public transport, that it would make decisions and follow them through.</P>
    <P>One decision was made and that was to re-examine Luas, the one rail decision that had already been made. My constituency and others around Dublin are paying the price of that delay every day. The tragedy is that all that was achieved by that delay was a doubling of the cost and the production of a lesser project. Indeed, it <Col N="295" /> has not yet been delivered and we wonder when exactly it will be ready. The decision to re-examine Luas was made in 1997. At that time the Minister and Government let it be known that there was private sector interest in providing a Metro project and that this was one of the reasons for re-examining the proposals. Why did the Minister wait five years before she sought expressions of interest, not tenders &ndash; there was nothing more definite than expressions of interest &ndash; for the very same line? What was happening at Cabinet subcommittees during those five years that even the first-step decision could not have been made? Why did the Government wait until the price of that too has doubled and possibly trebled?</P>
    <P>The Minister has before her a firm public-private proposal to provide a Luas line in my constituency, which is required for the enormous amount of residential and industrial development which has planning permission, is being built and is fully in accordance with the strategic planning guidelines. Why is the Minister not giving that her support? Why is she casting around the world for another proposal when she already has one right here in Dublin from a group of people willing to put up their money for a facility that people are crying out for? Why does the Minister not want the light rail order &ndash; which is ready &ndash; to land on her desk before an election? Why is that decision being made? Is it because she is afraid she might have to make a decision before an election? Is it that the only decision she is capable of making is not to make a decision?</P>
    <P>This is not the only planning and transport disaster that is happening. They are happening throughout the country where development and strategic plans for areas are being drawn up. None of them, of course, is informed by anything like a national spatial strategy because that is another secret being kept until after the election. However, even with what is known, there is no co-ordination between road plans, rail plans and local development plans. In many cases there is downright conflict between them. This is creating transportation time bombs for every part of the country, including Dublin.</P>
    <P>Is there anybody in charge in the Government? Does the Taoiseach realise what is happening under his watch? Does he ever get back from his friendship tour for long enough to sit at his desk and make a decision? Does he have any planning and transport vision for the country? Does he have any target at all other than to shake hands with everybody in the country twice? Does he know, for instance, that the vital national road network has more or less ground to a halt and that only 12 of the 20 projects that were due to start last year actually started? Does he know that we are now into the second month of 2002 and have no roads programme and will not have one because no chairman has been appointed to the National Roads Authority? Maybe that is a delib<Col N="296" /> erate action to mask the fact for as long as possible that there will be no roads programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 4 p.m. today, there was none appointed. Whatever about the roads and rail programme, the real disaster I have to highlight is the one that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has surpassed herself in ignoring. For five years, I have being saying that buses, which may not be the sexiest solution, are the only short-term solution. It is the only mass transport system we can provide within a reasonable time to keep this city moving while rail based solutions are being put in place. That means throwing buses at this problem. It is only with increased frequency that people will switch to buses. People are too busy and their lives are too stressful to plan their days around buses that come every hour or hour and a quarter.</P>
      <P>When the Government came into office, Dublin Bus had 875 buses. In 2002, after five years of unprecedented wealth, the Government has managed to provide another 275 buses. The net increase in the fleet is 195. That is about 1.3 extra buses per route to cater for a vastly increased population and workforce and to cater for the altered pattern of traffic. The greatest travesty of all &ndash; I am not sure if the Minister is aware of this &ndash; is that after five golden years Dublin Bus is operating less routes than it did five years ago. Does the Minister have any contact at all with CIE or Dublin Bus? What happened to the great plans she announced for Dublin Bus park and ride schemes on the outskirts of the city? Has land been identified or bought? Has planning permission been received? Has anyone taken responsibility for funding any of them? The answer in each case is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, commissioned another of her famous consultancy reports on the future structures of public transport. As a result, she promised bus competition. Since then there has been a deafening silence and nothing has happened. There has been no legislation to change structures, no move to break up CIE, no move towards privatisation, no move to appoint a bus regulator and no competition. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment took my breath away at the weekend when she promised that if elected to Government she would introduce bus competition. She is in Government. Does she realise that she has been in Government for five years, but it did not strike her that bus competition might be needed in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Private operators applying for licences to give a service to a public that is screaming for it are being frustrated at every turn. When they get licences, they are so circumscribed in what they can do that they are inoperable. In a city that is <Col N="297" /> screaming for buses, at least two major potential operators have told me that they have cancelled orders for buses. However inexplicable Government policy may be in restricting people getting onto private buses, preventing passengers from getting off at their destinations defies all explanation and understanding. Five years on there is still nobody in charge of traffic in the Dublin region. We still have up to two dozen agencies with varying degrees of responsibility.</P>
    <P>As I have said on numerous occasions, transport systems are multi-faceted, but they are interdependent and unless they are co-ordinated and integrated, their sum is infinitely less than their parts. That is certainly true of Dublin, where dispersed responsibility has been used continually by Government to pass the buck. After an inevitable consultant's report, it was agreed that a single transport and land use body was required for Dublin. Again, no legislation has been delivered and nothing has happened. Failure to deliver has been the theme of this Government. Through its gross incompetence, indecision and inertia, the Government has completely failed the people of Dublin. That will not be forgotten or forgiven by the population of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only is there traffic chaos in the greater Dublin area, but most urban centres around the country are also clogged up by traffic. Our citizens spend too much time in their cars commuting to and from their places of work. On many occasions when the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was on this side of the House, she complained bitterly about the lack of finance provided for the development of infrastructure and said this is a First World country with a Third World infrastructure. She made the same statement just ten months ago after four years in Government. If proof was needed that infrastructure development is a shambles, the Tánaiste's statement highlights it.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend, the Progressive Democrats Party held its conference and it has a billboard campaign around the country proclaiming: &ldquo;Look what we have done with four. What could we do with eight?&rdquo; If there were eight of them in the next Government, we would get nowhere. That billboard campaign will not be believed. Eight Progressive Democrats Deputies would cause major concern for the development of this country and I have no doubt the people will make sure that does not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking forward to it. The national development plan that was to provide the necessary funding for the provision of infrastructure up to 2006 is an utter shambles. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise have both been abject failures in providing the necessary leadership and prioritising <Col N="298" /> funding for the many developments that would allow traffic and commuting problems to be resolved. The national development plan is so out of control that many projects that should have been completed are now in jeopardy. As my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, the chairperson of the National Roads Authority may have been appointed, but he is not making announcements about where money will be spent. I hope he will be able to explain why the costs of all these projects have increased so dramatically in recent years. Why are there about 40 projects under the national development plan that will not be completed by 2006? </P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not here. However, I ask the Minister of State to intervene immediately with the National Roads Authority and request it to provide funding for the Sligo inner relief road. There is gridlock in that town. The NRA has suggested that the money that should have been provided this year for the Sligo inner relief road will not be provided. That will have catastrophic consequences not alone for the development of Sligo, but also for the development of the north west in general.</P>
      <P>It now takes people more than an hour to commute less than a mile and a half from Carraroe into the centre of Sligo. This is replicated in many towns and cities. The Government had so much funding available but it has done nothing. The national development plan is a complete and utter shambles. The Minister talks out of the side of his mouth about a spatial strategy and that Sligo will become a spatial centre in the north west. However, the Government is not willing to provide the necessary funding to allow people to get into the town and develop it. Fewer jobs have been provided in that region than in any other in the country. Not many industrialists from Germany or America were brought to Sligo by the IDA or other Government agencies. They would get to within a mile and a half of the town and get stuck in traffic. That would not create the necessary confidence to bring much-needed jobs into the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My old friend, the Minister for Public Enterprise, is some pin up. For the past four and a half years she has done wonders for the public transport system. The only pity is that she did not sit in the Luas carriage that was in Merrion Square instead of sitting in her office. I have no idea what she is doing, but she is presiding over a shambles in public transport. Iarnród Éireann has decided not to continue to provide the Sligo-Dublin freight service. It has suggested that it will discontinue it at present because it cannot organise the train service or freight delivery due to developments taking place in Dublin. The Government's fictional amendment to our motion states that the Government welcomes the initiative to undertake a strategic rail review which will provide a blueprint for the future development of the rail network. A gentleman from Iarnród Éireann on a programme on local <Col N="299" /> radio in Sligo said it was up to the Government to provide a freight service to the north west as Iarnród Éireann will not do so because it is losing money. If the Minister for Public Enterprise was here, I wonder what would be her decision on that. The strategic rail review will stop more development than it will propose.</P>
    <P>Many other issues need to be dealt with in the context of traffic management and transport. The Government's record in providing and prioritising any form of transport policy has been one of abject failure. I have no doubt the old ostrich syndrome has been alive and well in the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise over the past five years. My fear is that the Ministers are sticking their heads further into the sand rather than coming up with policies to provide the necessary funding and development to free up the regions and cities and make it easier for people to commute to their place of work and for industrialists to invest here and provide much needed jobs in many of the regions. The Government's record in this area has been a failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support Deputy Olivia Mitchell's motion. The serious traffic problems Dublin has experienced over the past 20 years and which have manifested now as gridlock have also manifested further west along the N6 in Enfield and Kinnegad and have reached the most westerly town on the N6, namely, Loughrea in County Galway. Similarly there is gridlock on the N7 in Naas, Kildare town and as far as Monasterevin. A similar position is to be found on all roads radiating from Dublin. Every urban centre is experiencing serious gridlock, something people did not experience in the past.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years the Government has not done anything in any part of the country to alleviate the problems resulting from traffic gridlock. These problems are costing money. They cost commuters locked in traffic jams time and energy and there is also the high cost of pollution into the atmosphere from such congestion. That seems to be of little consequence, interest or concern to the Minister of State or his colleagues given that they have not done anything to address the problem.</P>
      <P>As recently as last Christmas, the Taoiseach indicated following a visit to Loughrea that he would quickly arrange to alleviate the traffic congestion in the town. He said the necessary funding would be allocated in 2002 for the provision of a bypass in Loughrea and that it would be in operation by the end of 2003. Reality struck home when we discovered such funding is not available and that even with the best will in the world on the part of the NRA and its professional personnel to deliver that project, they would be unable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NRA does not have a chairperson who can say when funding will be available for any of the projects it has mentioned. I ask the Minister of <Col N="300" /> State to ensure that we get on with the business we are supposed to be doing. Various public representatives, embarrassed by the situation created by the Taoiseach's presence in Loughrea recently, demanded that some people should place themselves in a conspicuous position, whereby the public would be fooled once more by the initiatives of the Government and the pretence it was doing something to address the problem. When the people concerned were approached they said they had been mandated to have a presence in Loughrea to show that they were progressing the project. They indicated this was the third time this project had been surveyed &ndash; there has been one topographical survey on top of another. That indicates the local Minister has power to deliver bodies on the ground but not to deliver the project the Taoiseach said would be delivered.</P>
    <P>Many of the projects costed at various times over the past four or five years are now so out of date that the NDP and the funding apportioned to them are irrelevant. That is why there have been indications that the NDP will be extended beyond 2006 to 2010 or maybe 2050 in respect of some projects for all we know. The Government has not shown any initiative to indicate it was serious about solving the problem of traffic chaos. I said to the Minister of State's ministerial colleague that if she was serious about addressing the transport needs of people in the west and wanted to make even a token response to doing so, she would introduce a pilot commuter rail transport service between Athenry and Galway city to encourage many commuters travelling by road to travel by train. Commuters could be easily facilitated on that line because it is under-utilised. Such a service could be timetabled to transport many people from outside the dormitory towns of Galway city to work easily, safely and on time without encountering chaos or concern, which would benefit other road users.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, who represented part of that constituency in the past, to relay this proposal to the Minister and to ask her to take up the cudgels and arrange for the provision of such a service and of park and ride facilities with bus services connecting the other satellite towns of Galway to Galway city. These are simple measures, but they would make a difference.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion dealing with transport and traffic chaos experienced by people going about their business, whether commuting to work or travelling for some other reason by road or rail. Some weeks ago I welcomed the fact there was not a chairman of the National Roads Authority at the time funding was supposed to have been announced for various projects. At that stage no money was allocated for many of the bypasses that were promised, including those for Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Monaghan town and Cavan town in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan which I represent. The possi<Col N="301" /> bility of additional funding now being available must give us some hope.</P>
      <P>Our party leader proposed that some of the pension fund money should be spent on special projects, whether in my area or elsewhere, which could guarantee a good return on funding for pensioners. That was condemned by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs but I understand the concept is now being considered by the Minister for Finance and I hope it bears fruit. It was interesting that the Tánaiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats admitted at her party conference last weekend that after five years in office, the Government has left the country with a third world infrastructure.</P>
      <P>All politics is local and in my constituency the Dublin to Derry road is still without a bypass at Monaghan town, Castleblayney or Carrickmacross. This is the major road that links the people of Derry, the fourth largest city in the country, with Dublin and the people of north Donegal, Tyrone, Derry and Monaghan with our major city and ports and the infrastructure needed to move our produce out of the country. However, no money has been spent on it. The other main road through my constituency is the Belfast to Galway road which goes through Monaghan town, Clones and Cavan, but that is not even on the NRA list for the next number of years.</P>
      <P>The Government rightly claims responsibility for the good work on the Good Friday Agreement but it fails to put funding into creating the infrastructure that would facilitate involvement between the people on the two parts of our island whom we wish to see working closely together. Last Wednesday in this House the Taoiseach assured me that there was infrastructure in place between North and South and mentioned the Belfast-Dublin road. That might eventually be of use if we can get to Ardee but for people trying to get through Monaghan, Castleblayney and Carrickmacross, the Taoiseach's words ring hollow.</P>
      <P>Monaghan was placed in the BMW region. It was the Taoiseach's wish to include Kerry and other parts of the country to keep the Independent Deputies happy but the EU overruled that and ensured the designated region comprised only the Border, western and midland counties. Will NRA money be spent on new bypasses in the region this year or in the near future? There is only four years left and we were supposed to get great benefits from the BMW designation due to additional &ndash; not replacement &ndash; funding from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railroads were closed in the 1950s. Successive Governments failed to live up to the promise that was made then, that additional funding would be put into building up the road infrastructure to compensate people for the loss of railway lines in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. What has been done? Nothing. The money is still given to CIE at national level. The Minister ensures the money is spent in Dublin and elsewhere but none is available for the people of our region. It affects <Col N="302" /> the quality of life for people in Monaghan. They must leave their homes in south Monaghan at 6 a.m. and do not get home until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. The Leas-Cheann Chomhairle is well aware of that. How can they be involved in community activities? They are too tired at the weekends and need to catch up on their sleep. Businesses are paying the extra costs of extra time spent on the road.</P>
    <P>The consultants are the only people who have won on this issue. I do not know how many millions have been spent on consultants drawing up plans for the three bypasses in Monaghan. They failed to communicate with the locals and to understand what was needed. They just caused more problems. The country is in a mess despite five years of the best economic circumstances it has ever experienced. We need action now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for putting down this motion. It is a hugely popular subject. In all the years I have been a Member of this House, I have never seen a Government more askew on the issue of developing transport services for an increasingly mobile population and on the need to plan for the next 20 years. This Government plans for tomorrow, not for what will happen in the next ten or 20 years. That is why we have our current problems in every city and town. One need not be a rocket scientist to appreciate that not only is our population increasing but that the mobility of our population is also increasing dramatically. Car ownership is shooting up. The roads are clogged with cars. On the deficit side, however, our road capacity has changed a little but not in tandem with what is happening. The standard of our roads did not keep pace with the volume of traffic.</P>
      <P>People will find fault with this Government at the next election for not coming up with the type of transport models or strategy for the future that are likely to work. I spend three or four days a week in the capital and I know it will take a huge amount to get rid of the gridlock. The great tragedy for people in the provinces, however, is that the same mistake that was made in Dublin is currently being made in the other cities, particularly in Galway, the city I know best. Ultimately, the Government, ably assisted by most consultants, has only one answer to gridlock, namely to build wider and bigger roads. They do not give a second thought to the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and I both live in Galway, the Minister in the city and I in the county. If the model of what has happened in Dublin is maintained in Galway in the next ten years, it will be a horrendous place to live. Galway is in a unique position and the Government would see this if only it opened its eyes. Around the perimeter of Galway city, about 12 miles out, there is a railway line owned by Iarnród Éireann which connects Tuam, one of the biggest towns in the county, to Athenry and goes on to Oranmore, where there is a new city, and into the city of Galway. No other city in Europe <Col N="303" /> has this dormant infrastructure. Iarnród Éireann owns the line and the land so there would be no question of court battles or the like. That is not to speak of what could happen by providing park and ride facilities. It will be possible to get all the land required for such facilities in towns such as Athenry, Tuam and Ballyglunin, where &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; was filmed. One can imagine the importance that would have for the north of the county: it would benefit the entire region.</P>
    <P>I have raised this issue for a number of years but until recently I felt like Moses in the wilderness. It appeared that nobody was taking any notice. However, I am a member of the transportation group in Galway County Council and I have tried to convince the consultants over the last year that there is merit in this proposal. As always, they tend to say it is a nice idea but that it would cost too much money.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that we need a better road structure but £300 million will be spent on new bypasses on the Galway roads and on the new road from Ballinasloe to Galway city. If one spoke about anything approaching that expenditure on the railways, imagine the system one would get. One is not comparing like with like, which has always been the problem in discussing road versus rail infrastructure. Everybody claims the railway will not pay for itself but no road has ever paid for itself in the first 20 or even 30 years of its existence.</P>
    <P>The problem with roads is that no matter how wide they are, cars will fill them at a certain time of the day as they act like funnels. One might get to Galway or Dublin city faster, but the problems start at the city's perimeter because the traffic must be dispersed somewhere.</P>
    <P>I have much to say on this topic and I am sorry that my time has run out. The Minister of State will discover when he knocks on doors during the next general election campaign that people will have a lot to say to him about transport.</P>

    <P>&ndash;notes that capacity on the Maynooth line has recently been increased by approximately 150%;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the significant progress being made on the rail safety programme;</P>

      <Col N="305" />&ndash;notes the commitment of the Government to strengthen the institutional arrangements for land use and transport planning in the greater Dublin area through the establishment of a Greater Dublin Land Use and Transport Authority; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the Government initiative to undertake a strategic rail review which will provide a blueprint for the future development of the rail network.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to address the House on this important issue and outline once again how the Government has prioritised the upgrading of transport infrastructure and services, not alone in Dublin and other urban areas, but throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The sustained economic success and prosperity which the country has experienced in recent years have seen GNP <i>per capita</i> increase by 92% between 1995 and 2000, unemployment decrease from 15.5% to 4.1% between 1993 and 2000, the labour force almost double in the last ten years to 1.86 million in 2001, the national population grow by over 6% to an estimated 3.74 million in 1999, the population in the greater Dublin area grow by 8% to 1.46 million between 1991 and 1999, employment in the same area grow by over 50% to 681,000. As these figures demonstrate, the performance of the country in recent years has been exceptional in terms of continuous high economic and employment growth.</P>
    <P>This level of success has resulted in real and tangible benefits in terms of jobs, living standards and reduced emigration. However, growth on this scale does pose challenges, of which one of the more obvious is increased traffic. For example, car ownership has increased by 40% since 1992, with over 1.2 million private cars now on our roads. The number of heavy goods vehicles has also increased substantially. It is generally acknowledged that our transport infrastructure has not kept pace with the growth in travel demand. For many years we did not have the resources to invest heavily in transport infrastructure and services. All parties were in office during these years and have shared this experience. The consequences are evident in traffic congestion in Dublin and other major cities and on some parts of the national road network. There is no doubting the adverse impacts of traffic congestion, whether they be increased costs to business and the community generally through longer journey times, reduced environmental quality or a poorer quality of life.</P>
    <P>The Government has been proactive in responding to this challenge and the urgent need to upgrade our transport infrastructure in Dublin and other urban centres. Since we took office we have put in place the integrated strategic framework and the increased investment necessary to ensure we have a comprehensive, well functioning transport network. While the Opposition may wish to deny it, we have made good progress <Col N="306" /> in implementation. Our approach is in sharp contrast to that of the main Opposition party which is bereft of a clear vision of how best to meet the country's transport needs. Investment in transport was at a low ebb in 1997, but we have turned the situation around during the last five years. We have made good progress and more is in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>Looking first at Dublin, it is clear that during the past five years, within the framework of the DTI strategy which has recently been updated, the Government has invested heavily in Dublin's transport network. The road network has been substantially improved through the completion of a number of major projects such as the southern cross route, the Balbriggan bypass, Naas Road widening and free flow slips on the M50. Work is currently under way on a number of other major projects, including the Dublin port tunnel, the south eastern motorway and completion of the M1 to Balbriggan. Completion of these projects, at a total estimated cost in excess of &euro;1 billion, will further improve traffic conditions around the city.</P>
    <P>Major investment in other arterial routes such as the Kildare bypass and the Glen of the Downs project will also have a beneficial impact on traffic flows into and out of Dublin. Despite the delays and difficulties in getting these projects under way, the Government has succeeded in doing so. A major upgrade of the M50 is planned and public consultation is under way regarding improvements such as widening to three lanes, upgrading junctions and relocation and enlargement of the West Link toll plaza. Preliminary planning of the Dublin eastern bypass is also under way.</P>
    <P>Investment in national roads has been complemented by substantial going investment in non-national roads. In this context, a number of key road schemes in Dublin city which are important from a traffic management viewpoint have been identified for priority funding &ndash; Macken Street Bridge, Cork Street-Coombe, Mercer Street and North King Street. In the 1998-2001 period, funding of &euro;11.368 million was provided for these schemes with an additional &euro;7.539 million provided in 2002.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has also been made by the Government in addressing the substantial deficits in the public transport system. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides for the most significant investment in public transport in the history of the State. Over the lifetime of the plan there will be a total investment of &euro;2.79 billion in public transport projects. These include investment in mainline rail, improved public transport services in major urban areas and the upgrading of regional bus services.</P>
    <P>The major elements of the public transport programme in the Dublin area between 2001 and 2006 are the introduction of the Luas light rail system; the enhancement, extension, and development of the Dublin Bus network, including increases in capacity, improvements in the <Col N="307" /> quality of service, accessibility to those who may be mobility impaired and extended timetabling; increase in capacity of the DART and suburban rail network through the acquisition of additional rolling stock; upgrading the suburban rail network to allow an increase in the capacity and frequency of rail services, and extension of the quality bus corridor network.</P>
    <P>This year the Exchequer has provided in excess of &euro;400 million in capital funding to meet the ambitious targets set out in the national development plan. This level of funding must be seen in the light of many years of underinvestment in public transport. The total Exchequer capital provision in 1996, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in government, was approximately &euro;507,000. The funding provided by the Government has allowed significant progress to be made on the implementation of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Progress to date on the Luas, for example, includes the following. The construction of the light rail lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green is progressing. The lines are on target for completion by end 2003. The depot at the Red Cow is now completed and fitting out is taking place. The trams are continuing to arrive at the rate of two per month and are undergoing initial testing. Work on laying a test track from the depot to Kingswood in Tallaght has begun and it is expected that track testing will commence in April 2002.</P>
    <P>The metro is the most significant transport infrastructural project to be undertaken in the history of the State. It also represents a major opportunity to engage with the private sector in addressing the country's public transport deficit by way of PPP. A preliminary public consultation process by the Light Rail Project Office has commenced and over 200 responses have been received. The formal procurement process for the metro will commence shortly. An independent Railway Procurement Agency has been established, which will be responsible for the procurement of the light rail and metro projects, as determined by the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>On the DART and suburban rail front, progress is also being made. Iarnród Éireann has purchased 38 new DART cars. These are the first new carriages purchased for the DART system since 1984 and will provide an approximately 50% increase in capacity on the DART system. In addition, planning and design work is continuing on the next phase of the DART upgrade, which will allow a greater number of DART trains to operate through the city centre and also allow the operation of longer trains providing a further significant increase in the capacity of the network. A total of 80 new diesel rail cars have been ordered and delivery will commence in the coming months. These carriages, when operational, will improve the capacity and quality of <Col N="308" /> outer suburban services in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Olivia Mitchell will note that over 400 new buses have been purchased, not the low figure she quoted. She did not have her facts right on any issue she raised tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All new buses purchased since the year 2000 are low floor and wheelchair accessible, and have provided significant additional peak hour capacity for commuters. The success of the ongoing development of the bus network in Dublin is illustrated by the fact that passenger numbers in peak a.m. hours are up 196% on the Stillorgan QBC, 44% on the Malahide Road QBC, and 40% on the Lucan QBC.</P>
      <P>While the major infrastructural projects such as the Dublin port tunnel and Luas have tended to attract most attention, good progress has also been made by the local authorities and the DTO in a broad range of other areas. We have seen the completion of nine QBCs throughout the Dublin area, with work under way on a further three which have changed commuting patterns and those that are longer established &ndash; Malahide, Lucan and the N11 &ndash; are now carrying twice as many people as a general lane of traffic. Approximately 160 kilometres of two-way cycle routes were developed, and 2,500 cycle parking spaces provided.</P>
      <P>The implementation of a parking control policy has improved traffic flow and reduced illegal parking. We have seen the implementation of environmental traffic cells, traffic calming schemes and street improvement projects on a widespread basis throughout the city and the greater Dublin area, and major ongoing investment in computerised traffic signal control systems and travel and parking information systems. Also, &euro;40 million is being provided to the DTO to fund these traffic management measures in 2002. The DTO and the local authorities have also sought to ensure, in line with the DTI strategy and the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, that land use and transport planning are better integrated so that the need for travel is reduced and the provision of public transport facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures and initiatives reflect the fact that meeting mobility needs is not just about providing more physical infrastructure and rolling stock. Those are undoubtedly needed but they must be provided in the context of an integrated approach to transport requirements, including improved traffic management, better integration of land use and transport planning, management <Col N="309" /> of transport demand and good institutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that there is a need for strengthened land use and transport planning arrangements within the greater Dublin area and a clearer regional perspective on transport and land use planning. Seven major local authorities plus various transport agencies need a coherent strategic framework. Robust mechanisms are needed to ensure that integrated transport and land use decisions are regional in character and implemented in a co-ordinated and effective manner. The extent of the geographical area, the number of public bodies involved, the population growth in the area and the complexity and scale of the land use and transport issues to be addressed all require an approach specific to the greater Dublin area. Proposals in this regard were published last year as part of a public consultation process and were well received. The public consultation paper proposed the establishment of a strategic land use and transportation body with the principal task of preparing an integrated long-term land use and transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area and monitoring its implementation. These proposals are aimed at finding the best way of addressing the complex and urgent problems facing the greater Dublin area and they represent a very positive step forward. Most of those who made responses to the consultation paper thought so also. The final shape of the new arrangements is being considered carefully and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will very shortly be submitting legislative proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>Taxi services are another important part of the transport system. This Government is the first in recent years to take direct action to facilitate a more urgent and accelerated approach to matching taxi supply and demand. The Government's commitment to improving the Dublin taxi service, outlined in &ldquo;A Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;, was followed by the radical initiative on 30 November 1999 for the issue of 3,100 new taxi licences in Dublin. Regulations to commence implementation of the initiative were the subject of High Court proceedings and the October 2000 decision of the court made it clear that limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing licence holders cannot be contemplated. As a result, new regulations were made to respond to this changed situation and to establish orderly licensing arrangements within it. Under the new regulations no restrictions are allowed on the numbers of new taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences which are granted by local licensing authorities. This is bringing significant benefits to the public through the increased availability of taxis. Taxi licence numbers in Dublin have more than doubled since liberalisation with some 4,419 additional licences granted by Dublin City Council under the new regulations at the end of December 2001. Increases in licence numbers are also taking place in the rest of the country with increases of 302, 177 and 187 licences in Cork, <Col N="310" /> Galway and Limerick respectively. The liberalisation of taxi services has led to an improved taxi and hackney service with greater availability of vehicles and reduced waiting times.</P>
    <P>As part of ongoing efforts to improve the quality of taxi services, I recently announced the publication of a consultation paper prepared by my Department relating to the development of further qualitative improvements in taxi services. The consultation paper has been prepared against the background of the liberalised regime of taxi licensing, the provisions of the Disability Bill, 2001, and the stated policy that by the end of 2003 the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible. I have invited all interested parties to contribute to the consultation process by 30 April 2002 and I am confident this process will lead to the further enhancement of taxi services for all.</P>
    <P>Going forward, the updated DTI strategy, &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo;, provides a long-term framework for the development of the greater Dublin area transport network. This document, which was published recently, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area in the period to 2016. Key elements of the strategy include a radical transformation in the quality and quantity of public transport services; strategic but limited improvements to the road network; improved traffic management and control measures; development of a freight management policy to improve freight access to ports and airports; development of a demand management policy to reduce the growth in travel while maintaining economic progress and to encourage modal shifts in favour of public transport; and better integration of land use and transportation planning.</P>
    <P>The strategy is designed to result in a high quality, integrated, public transport service being available to most people within ten minutes walking distance of where they live; increase the share of the market accounted for by public transport from 35% to almost 65%; reduce congestion; reduce average journey times dramatically; improve accessibility; and result in significant environmental gains including reductions in energy use and emissions. Significant elements of the strategy are now being delivered under the NDP. Capital spending on public transport has increased by 23% in 2002 or &euro;400 million over 2001.</P>
    <P>The problems posed by traffic congestion are not unique to Dublin. Other major cities and towns also experience traffic congestion reflecting again the economic, employment and population growth which the country has enjoyed in recent years. Just as in Dublin, the Government has responded with increased investment in the roads network, public transport and traffic management.</P>
    <P>Since it took office in 1997 this Government has increased investment in the national roads network to almost three times its 1997 level. Over <Col N="311" /> the past five years a substantial number of towns, including Nenagh, Portlaoise, Roscrea, Balbriggan, Cavan, Donegal and Arklow, have been bypassed with obvious benefits accruing to the towns from the removal of through traffic. The implementation of the national roads development plan provided for in the NDP will remove through traffic from more than 60 more towns and villages.</P>
    <P>In addition, major projects have either been completed, are under way or are well advanced in planning in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The Lee Tunnel has been completed and work is under way on the Limerick southern ring road, phase 1. Major projects in planning include the Waterford bypass and Limerick southern ring, phase 2, which are both PPP schemes, and the Galway outer bypass. I regret having to bore Deputies by listing these achievements but the Opposition seems to be ill informed about what is happening on the ground.</P>

      <P>Investment in non-national roads in urban authority areas &ndash; city, borough and town councils &ndash; has increased considerably in recent years. Urban roads constitute 3% of the non-national road network but will receive over 12% of total grants being allocated to local authorities for non-national roads in 2002. The Department's block grant for urban authorities in 2002 is &euro;26.583 million, an increase of over 120% on the miserly 1997 provision of &euro;12 million.</P>
      <P>Non-national road grant allocations to Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford City Councils of &euro;5.747 million, &euro;2.682 million, &euro;3.996 million and &euro;4.619 million represent increases of 194%, 302%, 403% and 369% respectively over the 1997 allocations by the Rainbow coalition to these authorities. This level of investment has brought about considerable improvement to the non-national road network in all urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key aims of the public transport element of the NDP are to increase bus capacity and upgrade facilities to enhance public transport services outside the greater Dublin area, together with implementation of the railway safety programme. Bus Éireann has acquired over 200 new buses under the national development plan. These buses have allowed a significant increase in capacity in prov<Col N="312" /> incial services. There has been a 40% increase in capacity on many routes providing commuter services in the greater Dublin area. There has been an increase of 26% in services in Cork, 18% in Limerick, 35% in Waterford and 32% in Galway. The Deputy mentioned the provision of private services which are in competition with CIE. We are familiar with that in Galway city where City Direct, a private operator, provides scheduled daily services and maintains a high standard which is to be complimented.</P>

Substantial progress has also been made in the implementation of the railway safety programme, with the renewal of more than 240 miles of track and approximately 200 bridges. More than 140 miles of fencing has been completed and safety improvements have been made to more than 200 level crossings. In addition, the Railway Safety Bill, 2001, was published late last year and its principal feature is the establishment of an independent statutory public body, the Railway Safety Commission, to regulate railway safety in Ireland. The commission will have wide-ranging powers to monitor and inspect railway infrastructure, investigate and publish reports into railway accidents and take enforcement action where it perceives unacceptable risks exist on the railway.</P>
      <P>Land use and transportation studies, such as those undertaken or being prepared by local authorities in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, reflect an awareness of the acute importance of the interaction between transportation and physical planning and how integrated responses can contribute to the overall development and quality of life. The studies will assist in securing an integrated approach to meeting transport needs in these areas. The traffic management needs of these cities have also been recognised with the introduction of regional traffic management grants for the first time last year. Expenditure under this grant category amounted to &euro;1.639 million last year. A further &euro;2.094 million in regional traffic management grants has been allocated this year. The introduction of these grant categories is a further indication of the Government's commitment to improving traffic management in all our cities.</P>

      <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the Government has not failed in its efforts to upgrade transport infrastructure and services in Dublin and other urban centres. On the contrary, and unlike the main Opposition party, the Government has a clear view of what it wishes to do and has put in place the policies and funding to achieve it. Any fair assessment of what we have done so far would acknowledge the substantial progress that has been made in completing road and public transport projects; in getting other major projects that have been on the stocks for some time to construction and in progressing others through planning; in the development and implementation of other traffic management policies and measures; and in the areas of institutional development. More remains to be done, but we are on course to transform the transport network in Dublin and elsewhere in a way that meets the mobility needs of the community and improves the quality of life for all.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to what the Minister of State said. He set out in the early part of his speech the demographic and economic background to the existing transport problem. There is probably no greater illustration of the consequences of the absence of planning than the present transportation chaos. I will give an example of that and the root cause of it.</P>
      <P>The decision to announce the national development plan ahead of the national spatial strategy was a major error. It was as if one could plan investment for all the different forms of transportation &ndash; road, rail, bus, taxis or private cars &ndash; without taking into account the projected demographic distribution in cities, towns and rural areas. It was the clearest case yet of the cart being put before the horse. In the absence of a transportation strategy, which in turn might have been a dimension of the national spatial plan, the national spatial plan will make projections for towns, cities and rural areas after all the major investment decisions have been made about road, rail and internal urban transport systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an absence of integration in transport planning. However, there has not been an absence of consultancy studies or data about requirements. The Minister of State gave us the <Col N="314" /> figures for the increase in road usage. There is an absence of policy choices by the Government in relation to public transport and private car usage. The Government has also been driven off course by an ideological commitment to private car usage over public transport. People should not accept my word on this, but should examine the projected capital expenditure in the national development plan, for example, for major road and rail development. The ratio reveals it all and shows the Government has accepted an increased volume of cars, moving at faster speed, at the cost of developing a public transport network.</P>
    <P>The advice given and the assumptions made in the studies upon which the Government has based its strategy have been wrong. It is assumed that a private commercial market model can be brought to bear on public transport. As long ago as the 1960s the late Dr. John Blackwell published a study which showed that public transport was not a profit earner in any country in the world, except Hong Kong. Nothing has changed since then. There is a simple conclusion to be drawn from that, namely, that if one wants to make a choice in favour of public transport for reasons of social inclusion, economic efficiency and ecological responsibility, one must be willing to pay for it and to provide adequate Government subvention. All the speeches in the world cannot distract from the facts. All one must do is compare the Government's subvention to public transport to that in other countries. It is a minuscule proportion of national expenditure compared to any other country.</P>
    <P>I heard the suggestion that the provision of funding will make the traffic and transport problems disappear. I will give another example of the absence of integrated planning. Other urban centres are referred to in the motion, such as Galway, with which the Minister of State and I are familiar. The Minister of State knows that the major decisions in Galway were made before the land use and transportation study, commissioned by both local authorities, was discussed, debated or decided upon. When one looks at the existing city and county development plan, one sees an absence of any recognition of the basic principles of the land use and transportation study.</P>
    <P>Another example of the disintegrated <i>ad hoc</i> approach is the manner in which CIE's property is being disposed of in different parts of the State. It is almost impossible to get a straight answer to one's question as to what CIE owns and what it might need should it get an adequate subvention for an adequate public transport system. We see, for example, in Galway city people queuing in the rain for buses outside a railway station. A hotel stands on the site the people had previously planned for a bus station. They are being asked to move to new land developed by the harbour authority. That is what is planned for the future. There is no provision in regard to CIE's land figures in the context of a commuter rail link to Galway city. There is no security, but that the land is being prepared for sale. There is an absence of <Col N="315" /> public accountability in regard to it and an absence of any attempt to integrate it into future planning needs.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important principles on which a public transport policy might be built, the most important being social inclusion. In this debate references were made to the great increase in gross domestic product, how everybody is more wealthy, that there are far more cars and so on. There are people in the population who were always dependent on a mode of transport other than the car &ndash; the young and the elderly. In relation to the totally separate planning of roads from any consideration of public transport, there is a desperate disregard of the needs of pedestrians, the young and the elderly. It is very interesting that when sacrifices need to be made it is the conversion of vehicles for the special needs of the disabled that is put on hold.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to ask what assumptions are behind the current expenditure. Who decided that the issue of traffic flow was a case of handling more vehicles at a faster speed at a cost of slowing traffic to allow pedestrians to cross in safety? These are fundamental issues as to how traffic moves, how it should move and the balance it meets between the elderly, the young and those in vehicles. Frankly, the existing philosophy, particularly actions of the National Roads Authority, could be described as homage to the single occupant motor car. It is almost as if one can adjust one's transportation policy to suit the insatiable increase in demand for more vehicles travelling at greater and unimpeded speed.</P>
    <P>This is disastrous and entirely uninformed by social needs and the social composition of communities. This happened in the case of the undemocratic imposition of the plans which were not in accordance with the late 1990s road upgrading proposals at the time. New proposals by the NRA which had been drafted without consideration, moving through special areas of conservation, through existing communities, ending nowhere, suggested, for example, that what was required was that greater volumes of traffic move, as I have said, with ever-increasing speed. This is madness and profoundly undemocratic. In the case of Dublin the problem will probably not be solved. We will not get a genuine approach towards transportation and traffic problems until we have a genuinely accountable and elected transportation authority, a regional authority, which can look at the integrated needs, not just of Dublin, but of the areas surrounding it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to bear in mind the undercurrent in regard to public transport. I recall the Irish Productivity Centre's human sciences committee carrying out a study at the end of the 1960s of the morale of Dublin busmen. It noted how families then worked on the bus and the rail networks. It is because of the uncertainty sowed at the heart of the State transport companies that morale has eroded. People have torn the heart out of it because it was suggested that if it was successful, <Col N="316" /> the more successful parts of it could be creamed off, that privatisation was down the road and that delivering a public service was somehow less important than working in the commercial sector. Another notable feature of those families who worked on the rail and bus networks was their pension structure. Those who worked in the uniformed grades in the rail sector received minuscule pensions, of some £40 a week, after 40 years service. That is the kind of ethos created, a destructive ethos that stated something other than a public transport system would have to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the changes made in regard to taxis. The Oscar Faber report and several others on Dublin, as well as commissioned studies and partnership agreements, suggested that something needed to be done in regard to taxis. Different Governments allowed a secondary market to develop in regard to taxi plates. Nobody can argue that one can go overnight from a totally regulated system to a totally deregulated one, but the manner in which it was dealt with caused appalling hardship. The suggestion that somebody could sell a plate one day for £120,000, could re-enter the market within a few weeks for £5,000 and compete in a more limited market on the same conditions was absolutely immoral. The State has an obligation in regard to this matter, as the Government of New South Wales accepted. If one makes an adjustment from a regulated system to an unregulated one, one has to do so by carrying some of the cost in order to prevent hardship.</P>
    <P>It is important that we hear the transport policies of the different parties, particularly prior to a general election. If we are to make a conversion from road congestion to increasing use of public transport, we must upgrade public transport and give it an adequate subvention, restore its morale and give it certainty into the future. There is a need to put in place accountable, responsible transport management structures in order that people can vote in those who can represent their transport needs.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State and the Cabinet to clarify immediately the issue in regard to CIE and its property portfolio. For all of these reasons, I support the motion proposed. For every extra ten minutes spent in a car there is a 10% reduction in participation by the people concerned in their communities. It is true to say that traffic chaos and transport confusion are reducing the viability of communities, not just commuters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up the debate where my colleague, Deputy Higgins, left off. CIE would traditionally argue that it has been starved of resources and that it simply never had the wherewithal to provide the kind of transport system about which Deputy Higgins spoke. Recently <i>The Irish Times</i> analysed the manner of disposal and development of CIE's property asset at Spencer Dock. Notwithstanding the location of the <Col N="317" /> land in question, CIE contracted to a joint venture with a private property developer. The first phase of the development envisages CIE's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, being the anchor tenant having signed contract documents to lease a 200,000 square feet building. It is estimated that this first phase will produce an annual rental roll of just under &euro;10 million, of which about &euro;1.5 million will accrue to CIE. The only significant revenue accruing to CIE, the owner of this immensely valuable site, is its share of the rent, which, in the instance of the PwC development, for example, is about 15%.</P>
      <P>There is a minor matter of the private developer paying CIE &euro;160,000 to take possession of the seven acre site where Iarnród Éireann's freight operations will have to be withdrawn. The value of the seven acres comprising the first phase of the development at market prices could be almost as high as &euro;100 million. The CIE deal dates back to October 1998 and its stated purpose is to allow investment in the railways. However, the scheme designed at Spencer Dock was rejected by An Bord Pleanála. Despite this rejection in the year 2000, CIE remains locked into the deal. The Minister responsible, Deputy O'Rourke, in the wake of this objection by An Bord Pleanála, caused an investigation to be held into CIE's obligations to the private developer under the terms of the 1998 agreement. For some strange reason, she refuses to publish the findings of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been looking at excerpts from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997, which requires that lands surplus to envisaged needs must be sold to the DDDA at market value. The proceeds would go to the State or its agency. This suggests the lands in question ought to have been offered to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and developed by it. I asked if this was done and if the DDDA was prepared to pay CIE what the private developers were offering. More pertinently, I want to go back again to the legislation. It seems clear that the land should have been offered to the development authority. Since it falls to that authority to prepare the master plan for the development of the area, it would be odd if it were not prepared to do business with CIE. It has done business with the Dublin Port and Docks Board as well as with Bord Gáis. Is it not the case that, shortly after coming to office, the Minister in question won a Cabinet decision that enabled CIE to do this deal with a private developer? We need to know if this is true and we need to know why that was done. On the face of it the deal is a rotten one for CIE. Why was it done? Was the CIE deal facilitated by a Cabinet decision? Why does the Minister consider it necessary to cause an investigation to be held after approval was refused? More interestingly, why will she not publish the findings? Deputy Stagg put down a question on this issue today, but it was disallowed on the basis that the Minister has no direct responsibility for it. It is a matter for CIE. The Ceann Comhairle, in the <Col N="318" /> exercise of the duties of his office, did not allow me to raise a matter on the Adjournment regarding the same issue.</P>
    <P>We cannot seem to find a way to get the Minister to come to the House to say it is true that this immensely valuable State asset has been contracted in a joint venture with a private developer on the basis of what seems to be a lousy pay back from the rental arrangement. A company starved of the wherewithal to develop its infrastructure had this immensely valuable site. There is a docklands development authority, whose role is set out in legislation. Was that changed at Cabinet when this Minister came to office? I am particularly intrigued as to why she will not lay before the House the results of the investigation she felt obliged to undertake after An Bord Pleanála had rejected the Spencer Dock development. Why can we not see what is in that report? My colleague Deputy Stagg tried, during Question Time today, to elicit this information. We need to know, because on the face of it, CIE, not for the first time, got a rotten deal.</P>

        <i>Reader's Digest</i> used to have a column entitled &ldquo;Laughter is the best medicine&rdquo;. I do not know if that column still exists as it is a long time since I read the magazine, but we all need a laugh now and again. The Government amendment asks us to welcome the progress being made on the Luas. In the same year, and possibly in the same month, decisions were taken in Dublin and in Montpellier in the south of France, to build a Luas light rail system. Last July a delegation from the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport visited Montpellier led by the Chairman, Deputy Sean Ryan. I was lucky enough to be included. We travelled on the Luas trains, which had been operational for some time, and admired their comfort and efficiency. Shortly after that, back in Dublin, I admired a Luas carriage similar to the one I travelled on in Montpellier, but this one was stationary, parked near Government Buildings, with not a track to be seen and its contribution to the transport scene was off in the future. The Taoiseach launched this carriage, which was the focus of jokes by the rude and scoffing multitude. So much for the Government amendment welcoming the progress of Luas. If it could be done in Montpellier, why could it not be done here? Why can it not even be done here now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time for another laugh. The Government amendment asks us to welcome the progress being made in the rail safety programme and the improvement in capacity on the Maynooth line. Will the Minister walk over to Connolly Station some afternoon and witness the gross overcrowding on the 5.15 p.m. and 5.40 p.m. trains to Maynooth? She will get there faster if she walks. Will she then return here and tell us about the great improvement in the service and the improvement in rail safety? It has not happened. It is a delusion. The Minister is not living in the <Col N="319" /> real world. In Dublin &ndash; certainly in my constituency &ndash; traffic ranks with crime creating public anger. On walkabouts, visiting house after house and housing estate after housing estate, whether in the larger centres of Lucan or Clondalkin, or in the smaller ones such as Rathcoole and Saggart, the complaint one hears is invariably about traffic. How often have I heard people say they paid £150,000 or £170,000 for a house and cannot get out of their estate in the morning, or back into it in the evening? I hope a day of reckoning is coming.</P>
    <P>The Government has not been prepared to make the hard decisions. It has always looked for the soft option. The only solution to the Dublin traffic problem is to keep the private car out of the city. There is no other solution and it has to be implemented by a mixture of carrot and stick policies. It all depends on the creation of a public transport system sufficiently efficient and sufficiently cheap to attract people to it. That requires commitment and money and this Government has lacked one and wasted the other. This will have to be tackled some time. I will suspend my contribution now in order to give Deputy Stagg the opportunity to move the Adjournment.</P>

Such criticism is well documented and understood by the public. Despite the expenditure of large amounts of money, circumstances are as described by other speakers.</P>
      <P>I am very happy that the Labour Party's strong support for the provision of public transport, which has been constant for as long as I remember &ndash; and I have a very long memory &ndash; has now been adopted across the political spectrum. I was amazed last Saturday night to watch the Tánaiste, leader of the Progressive Democrats, say we have to put in place an efficient public transport system. It is a pity she was not convinced of that six years ago, before she came into office. Perhaps she would then have done something about it over the past five years. Certainly, nothing effective was done, except to dismantle decisions that had already been made about public transport. I refer in particular to Luas, which has now been abandoned. The abandonment will cost £500 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make the House aware of a problem that has arisen in the Department of Agri<Col N="320" /> culture, Food and Rural Development with regard to area aid. This relates particularly to the 5,000 letters which have been issued from the area aid office in Hume House over the past week.</P>
      <P>A great number of farmers cannot understand why they got the letter in the first place. One farmer told me that a few years ago he got paid on the same land without any problems. From the contents of the circular it appears eligibility for area aid is in doubt in 5,000 cases. The inference in the letter is that under eligibility for payment under the arable aid scheme there is at least a doubt cast in the case of 5,000 farmers. I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is not here this evening because this is quite a technical matter and there are a number of technical questions which I wanted to ask him.</P>
      <P>A great many farmers are terribly upset about this. As I said, some farmers have got paid on the same land for the same scheme previously. One farmer, who grows a substantial amount of corn on conacre, has been told that the land on which the crop was grown was not eligible. He had no way of knowing that when he took the land.</P>
      <P>In many cases of which I have personal knowledge, the letters went out to people who had done nothing more than transfer eligibility from one part of the farm to another. This is allowed for every year and there is a transfer document for doing that. I have a sneaking suspicion that what has happened is that the Department, through an oversight or otherwise, has not seen those transfer documents because I know of at least nine or ten cases where the people who got one of those letters had the eligibility transferred to the land in question and everything was in order.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the staff at the area aid unit, over the years they have been most helpful and courteous. The questions I want to put, through the Minister, to the staff are the following. When farmers must answer the questions concerned to give proof, what sort of proof are they looking for? What must a farmer do to prove that the land in question had eligibility, which means, as the Minister of State will be aware, that corn was grown on it in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991? Under those conditions, what proof is needed which will be acceptable to the area aid unit? Would it involve getting a letter from a contractor stating that he or she ploughed and sowed it, from an auctioneer stating he or she had it rented as conacre for sowing or from a contractor who had a combine harvester? I hope the script they gave the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will outline those details because that is what farmers want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obviously difficult to prove the purpose to which the land was put during those years. I understand there is no database containing details of the acres under corn in the years concerned. Many of the 5,000 concerned have their answers ready and could answer quickly, but at <Col N="321" /> the same time I want the Minister of State to outline what those farmers must do to prove eligibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The Minister regrets that he cannot be here himself to take it.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is responsible for the disbursement of over &euro;1.1 billion in direct payments annually under the livestock and arable aid schemes and, when added to REPS, payments represent 56% of total farm income. Some &euro;130 million of this is paid in arable aid.</P>
      <P>The objective in the operation of all the direct payments schemes is to provide all those involved with the relevant information they need to comply with the rules applying to the schemes. Producers must be informed of the terms and conditions applicable to the various schemes, including the arable aid scheme, in order that they can maximise their entitlements.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU regulations, arable aid may be paid to arable producers who produce arable crops on eligible land. Arable aid may also be paid on eligible land which is set-aside in accordance with the terms of the arable aid scheme. Under these regulations eligible land is land which, on 31 December 1991, was not under permanent pasture, was not under permanent crops or trees, or was not used for non-agricultural purposes. Permanent pasture is land used for grass production for five years or more at 31 December 1991. Permanent crops are crops that occupied the land for five years or more at 31 December 1991, for example, orchards. Accordingly, the land had to be tilled at some stage in the period 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1991.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the Department's commitments under the protocol on direct payments to farmers, the area aid unit concentrated all its resources on ensuring that arable producers received their payments on the first possible date of payment, 16 November 2001. On that date over &euro;119 million was paid to 95% of arable aid applicants, which by any standards is a very efficient delivery of service to farmer clients.</P>
      <P>All payments issued by the Department are subject to ongoing audits. This is an essential aspect of the control measures to ensure this expenditure of public moneys is correctly accounted for and indeed is vital to the underpinning of the future availability of these payments. In this context, an audit was carried out on all payments made under the 2001 arable aid scheme. The aim of the audit was to ensure no arable aid was paid on land that did not meet the eligibility criterion which I have already described. As a result of the audit it was necessary to write to some 5,000 applicants to clarify the question of eligibility. This is the background to the letters that farmers received last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" />The Department will examine each response on its individual merits, taking account of the supporting documentation and the farmer's arable aid record. If any farmer is not in a position to supply the supporting documentation by 20 February, he or she should write to the Department indicating this by 20 February and submit the information as soon as possible thereafter. I am confident that the bulk of the applicants concerned will be able to respond positively to the letter but it has to be accepted that once the issue has been identified it has to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that these letters should not be seen in a hostile context but rather in the context of issues identified during an audit. There are very considerable sums involved in direct payments and this therefore places an onus on everybody to ensure that the benefits to the applicants are maximised, that avoidable penalties are not incurred and that there are robust and effective controls in place to protect the interest of the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The further erosion of vital services at Monaghan General Hospital, with the closure of gynaecological services and the diversion of accident victims from the general hospital area to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, must be stopped by the Minister of State. Otherwise Fine Gael in Government will do so after the next election.</P>
      <P>Accident and emergency services must be upgraded as a first step and that will be delivered by us. Our party leader visited the hospital and met the personnel there last autumn, but in the past few days he has again guaranteed that under his leadership Monaghan General Hospital will be funded so that the necessary work to retain and upgrade the services will be provided, not only for structures but also for additional staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcomed the recent visit of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, it seems the executives continue regardless. They have closed gynaecological services and, from 1 February, have diverted accident victims from the Monaghan General Hospital catchment area to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. Health board officials have often spoken of the &ldquo;golden hour&rdquo;. How can any accident victim in Knockatallon, Carrickroe or Moybridge &ndash; which are on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh &ndash; get anywhere within an hour? It would take a minimum of half an hour for an ambulance to get there and another one and a half hours to get from there to Drogheda if the roads are clear. Can the Minister imagine an ambulance finding its way through Monaghan town, Carrickmacross or Castleblaney in wintry weather with snow and ice, or at rush hour on any ordinary day? As I mentioned earlier <Col N="323" /> this evening, there are no bypasses for those towns.</P>
    <P>If the removal of accident services from Monaghan General Hospital is allowed to continue lives will be lost. Many patients that were dealt with at Monaghan General Hospital can verify that without its availability and expert services they would not be alive. Will the Minister advise me what his understanding was when he left Monaghan town after his visit? Did he realise or understand that the health board would close gynaecology services? Did he understand that accident victims would have their services rendered in Drogheda rather than Monaghan and that this decision would be made by ambulance personnel wherever the accident happened? Does the Minister accept that with the further erosion of services it becomes more and more difficult to sustain full surgical services at Monaghan hospital which, in turn, will make it more difficult to retain industry and other services in the area?</P>
    <P>In 1998 the executives of the North-Eastern Health Board asked its elected members and those interested in upgrading Monaghan General Hospital to meet them. They advised the meeting of their plans and that £5 million was needed to build a new theatre, improve accident and emergency services and make improvements in 17 other areas, including the upgrading of maternity services. None of those promises have yet been carried out. The maternity service has been closed. In-patient treatment in gynaecology services ceased at the time the Minister for Health and Children visited the hospital and now, just two weeks later, few are being serviced at the out-patient department. I will tell the House what happened in the children's ward last week. A paediatrician on out-patient duty refused to check on a child patient. It certainly seems like a winding down policy is in place.</P>
    <P>By 2001 costings of the new proposal of the health board were put at £10 million and were supposed to be part of the national development plan. However, no plans have been submitted to Monaghan County Council, therefore none of the major works can be done in the next year. The national development plan ends in 2006. Executives now say &euro;50 million is needed to do the job. Are they raising the jumps or just creating obstacles? A commitment from the Minister is needed.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this issue on the Adjournment. On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, I thank Deputy Crawford for the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to Monaghan General Hospital. First, I remind the Deputy that the North-Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of services at the hospital. It is a matter for the board to determine service provision at the hospital in line with its commitment to the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost effective service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently visited Monaghan Gen<Col N="324" /> eral Hospital and met the hospital staff, local representatives and members of the general public. The Minister took the opportunity to outline a comprehensive investment package for Monaghan General Hospital. A significant level of capital investment is proposed in the short-term. In this regard plans are being advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board for the development and upgrading of the high dependency unit at the hospital in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the treatment and minor injuries unit and the development of a midwifery led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of &euro;7 million. The Minister also indicated that he would support the board's proposed development of new consultant-led services in dermatology and geriatric medicine at the hospital. These developments will be progressed in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced the immediate commissioning process for an additional 709 acute hospital beds in public hospitals nation-wide at a cost of &euro;65 million this year. This is the first phase in the provision of an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011. Thirty eight of the additional 709 public hospital beds will be provided in the North-Eastern Health Board region with ten of these in Monaghan General Hospital. All of the additional bed capacity at the hospital will be designated for public patients and will allow the hospital to significantly increase activity levels for its public patients. I am satisfied the proposed development of additional consultant-led services, together with the provision of additional bed capacity and the proposed significant level of capital investment reflects the commitment to the provision and development of acute hospital services to the catchment area population served by Monaghan General Hospital. Furthermore the Minister promised to give careful consideration to issues raised by staff representatives in relation to surgery, staffing and management and to revert to them in a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was concerned regarding the transportation of persons from the Monaghan area who are involved in accidents. He also raised the issue of gynaecology services at Monaghan hospital. Prior to 1 February 2002, patients who suffered multiple trauma or orthopaedic injury arising from a road accident in the catchment area of Monaghan General Hospital were taken to Monaghan General Hospital to be subsequently transferred to Drogheda, Navan or a Dublin Hospital as deemed appropriate by the clinician in charge of the case. With regard to gynaecology services, in-patient treatment ceased in Monaghan General Hospital at the end of 2001. Facilities continue to be available for out-patient and day services at the Monaghan hospital site. The board will maintain and develop this out-patient and day services facility at Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague to outline <Col N="325" /> the developments that will take place in 2002 at Monaghan hospital. There is no reason to doubt that these will take place in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this subject. I also thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond. I demand the urgent start to the second and final phase of the Baldoyle flood relief scheme to prevent a recurrence of the flooding in Baldoyle parish which recently devastated the area. While media attention has rightly been given to the disastrous impact of the recent storm on the Ringsend and East Wall areas of Dublin city, the flooding of homes on the coast road and rural areas of Baldoyle parish has largely been overlooked.</P>
      <P>At around 1 p.m. on 1 February, a torrent of water burst over the banks of the swollen river Mayne and poured south down the rural Mayne and coast roads towards Baldoyle village. The two cottages nearest the Mayne occupied by the O'Rourke family were quickly flooded as water poured under the front doors and, inside the homes, rose quickly to half a metre and inflicted serious damage on both households. For a number of hours it appeared other outlying areas of Baldoyle would be similarly affected, as they have been for many decades.</P>
      <P>Baldoyle parish is a polder, a low-lying area of land which is partly below sea level. It is often compared to a saucer with the centre in Seagrange public park and the surrounding edges occupied by residential houses. In recent decades serious rain has always led to major flooding in districts such as Abbey Park, Stapolin, Seagrange and the Grange Road. Following the tragic death of a teenage boy almost eight years ago, a determined effort was made by Baldoyle Community Association and all its constituent bodies, with my support and that of other public representatives, to protect the area once and for all.</P>
      <P>After many delays, the first phase of the Baldoyle flood relief scheme was funded and implemented under the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the previous Government, Deputy Howlin. This improved drainage considerably in the Grange Road area. However, there has been a delay for the past four years on the second phase of the scheme which I understand has been redesigned several times. The implementation of the scheme appears to have come to a halt. The scheme is intended to separate the Mayne river basin, which flows into Baldoyle Bay, from the south flowing tributaries, which flow into Dublin Bay, by means of a large earth embankment, and to support water movement with a pumping station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I queried what happened last week with Fingal County Council director of drainage, Mr. Douglas Hyde, and senior county engineer, Mr. John Daly, I was informed that the high spring tide of 5.46 metres combined with easterly winds <Col N="326" /> raised the level of the Mayne river to such an extent that the works carried out by the first phase of the flood relief scheme on the Mayne River gate prevented the river from escaping into the sea. As a result, it turned south and flowed into the homes of my constituents.</P>
    <P>It is very annoying that, after tremendous efforts by the community in Baldoyle, the second phase of the flood relief scheme will not go to tender this month as I was continually promised for the past 18 months by the county manager, Mr. Willie Soffe, and his officials. The blame does not lie with Fingal County Council officials or the county manager because I am informed the foreshore licence for the second phase of the flood relief scheme &ndash; effectively the planning permission &ndash; has not been granted by the Minister, Deputy Fahey, as it was not by his predecessor, my constituency colleague, Deputy Woods. Without the foreshore licence, the second phase of the flood relief scheme cannot be implemented. I am told Dúchas has requested certain guarantees before the Minister can issue the foreshore licence because it has a concern about pollutants from residential housing issuing into the fragile Baldoyle Bay.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, four years have passed &ndash; the lifetime of the Government &ndash; and this important area of Dublin and parish of my constituency is still left vulnerable to flooding every time there is the type of stormy weather which occurred a few weeks ago. I appeal to the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Fahey, to grant the foreshore licence quickly in order that the Fingal county manager can proceed to ensure the events of 1 February 2002 never recur. It is interesting that a major housing and commercial development of a size between that of Tralee and Waterford city is being planned for this area north of Baldoyle. It is annoying for residents that a major hydrology study has not been undertaken. I would like the second phase of the flood relief scheme to be implemented and a major hydrology study of the area to be conducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a fair general election speech. Deputy Broughan has addressed this Adjournment matter jointly to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. I am responding on behalf of the latter. My direct responsibility relates to the foreshore licence aspect while the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has responsibility for the funding aspects. In general, foreshore licences are issued by me in accordance with the terms of the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stage one of the Baldoyle flood relief scheme was completed in the mid-1990s in response to the severe flooding occurring in the area following heavy rain. The worst flood affected areas of the Baldoyle catchment were diverted to new sewers which carried the surface water to the <Col N="327" /> Mayne river for discharge into the sea. These works did not require a foreshore licence.</P>
    <P>Stage two of the Baldoyle flood relief scheme is included in the Department of the Environment and Local Government's water services investment programme for 2000 to 2002 as a scheme to go to construction. Stage two consists of part one, advanced works, and part two, the rest of the works. Foreshore licences are required for both parts of these sets of works because the Foreshore Acts require that, before the commencement of any works, including works such as these, on State-owned foreshore, a licence or lease must be obtained from the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. As the Deputy may be aware, the foreshore is the land and seabed between the high water of ordinary or medium tides and the 12 mile limit.</P>
    <P>Applicants for such foreshore licences are required to publish notice of their proposals in newspapers circulating in the area. My Department prepares the notice and specifies the newspapers in which it should be published. Normally, a three week period is allowed for representations and objections from members of the public to be made to me. The applicant is allowed an opportunity to comment on any such objections before the final report is made to me. That report will detail the proposal and the process that has been gone through.</P>
    <P>This process would involve consideration of an application by staff of the Marine Survey Office, fisheries officers, other departmental officers and observations from Dúchas, the heritage service. In the case of these works, account will also be taken of the views of the marine licence vetting committee. This is a group comprising scientific and technical experts which advises me on foreshore leases, licences and permission applications. The report would also detail any objections received and commentary on them, and would recommend whether to grant a lease or licence and, if so, under what conditions.</P>
    <P>Part one &ndash; advanced works &ndash; is designed to improve the outfall of the Mayne river into the Baldoyle Estuary. A foreshore licence was granted by my Department on 1 June 1999 to facilitate these works which comprised improving the hydraulic capacity of the existing Mayne river outfall and the provision of an additional outfall. Improved tide gates were also installed. Part one was completed in early December 2001 and I understand from Fingal County Council that they worked effectively in protecting properties upstream during the high tides of 1 February 2002.</P>
    <P>Part two of the scheme involves discharging flood water from local streams into the Baldoyle Estuary via a new pumping station and rising main. The overall aim of these works is to eliminate major flooding in the Baldoyle area up to and including the 50 year storm event. The existing culvert along the Willie Nolan Road is also to be re-lined due to its poor condition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" />Application for the relevant foreshore licence was made to my Department in the normal way by Fingal County Council. Due to the location, it was necessary for my Department to consult Dúchas, the national parks and wildlife service, about the application. Dúchas had reservations regarding the effect the discharged waters would have on water quality in the Baldoyle Estuary. I understand Fingal County Council met Dúchas in mid-November and addressed the water qualities issues. The county council was in touch with Dúchas again last month and the matter remained unresolved.</P>
    <P>It is unfair for the Deputy to refer to my ministerial colleagues, Deputy Woods and Deputy Fahey, in this regard because the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has, under our leadership, been quite active in trying to resolve this difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be accused of making an election speech as this ship is not situated anywhere near my constituency. The last few days have seen the<i> Jeannie Johnston</i> project receive a significantly bad press. My purpose in raising this issue is not to mount further criticism on a project that has been attacked from all sides recently due to its massive overspend. Everyone who has taken an interest in the <i>Jeannie Johnston </i>project is well aware of the overspend and budgetary mistakes that have resulted in a project estimated to cost &euro;5.5 million in 1999 costing nearly &euro;15.3 million to date. Kerry County Council and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources on two occasions have had to put rescue packages together to ensure the project continued.</P>
      <P>It is stating the obvious to say the project is now in crisis but every crisis presents an opportunity. Many people seem to be convinced that we should close down the project and cut our losses. This would be a great mistake. If we set aside the massive overspend and consider the capital asset that is now the <i>Jeannie Johnston </i>our views on her future may change. She is a magnificent tall ship, the largest wooden ship ever built in Ireland with three times the capacity of <i>Asgard II</i>, our national tall ship. Rather than aborting the <i>Jeannie Johnston </i>in stillbirth we should be giving her the chance to live and prove herself on the ocean, for 2002 at least, now that she is virtually completed anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the principle that the vessel should <Col N="329" /> not cost the State significant sums of money to run on an annual basis in the long-term. However, so much public money has been committed already it should not be wasted by abandoning the project when there is considerable scope for a long-term profitable solution.</P>
    <P>The following measures could amount to a solution. In the short-term all financial obligations must be sorted out and a clean title of ownership put in place. I understand the trade debts could be paid off with the existing resources available from the sale of the dock which was specially constructed for the project. The ownership of the vessel should not be handed over to Kerry County Council or to any local group in Kerry, as clearly the expertise for a project of this scale can only be found nationally. Instead, the ship should become an asset of the State &ndash; a national asset &ndash; and given to an organisation or professional team of people, nominated by the Minister if he sees fit, with proven management experience to run as a sail training vessel for the remainder of 2002. If this revenue commitment from the State could be secured for nine to ten months with no long-term financial commitment it would give breathing space and an opportunity for a long-term plan to be put in place, combining a public private partnership, when the vessel has proven herself at sea.  </P>
    <P>Now that the capital expenditure has been spent and there is no way of getting it back, there is no reason the project cannot be a success in the future. Denmark, for example, has three vessels the size of the <i>Jeannie Johnston </i>and all are being run successfully. Germany has a similar number and so do most Scandinavian countries. In the US the <i>Pride of Baltimore </i>is an example of a ship that is funded 30% by the city of Baltimore and 60% to 70% privately.</P>
    <P>The State has spent &euro;10 million and I want to see this ship given the chance to return a dividend to the State, rather than being abandoned. With a proper management team in place the opportunities for this ship are huge, at a relatively low cost. The promotional voyage to the US that has already been planned as a North-South project would be very positive and welcome, particularly considering the events of 11 September. The ship could be used as a training vessel for nautical students in the new national maritime college in Cork, who will need a vessel for sail training anyway.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, the ship could be used for the provision of rehabilitation voyages for troubled young people. There is significant evidence of rehabilitative success with juvenile offenders in similar vessels, particularly in Scandinavia. The team work, discipline and bonding involved in crewing such a vessel can add significantly to self-esteem, confidence and self-discipline. When one considers the massive annual expense to the State of housing or incarcerating juvenile offenders with little success in rehabilitation, funding this ship may well make economic as well as social sense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" />I ask that this ship be given an opportunity to give something back to the State. It has taken a massive amount of money to build. With the right team and management structure in place we could be proud of this ship in ten years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Coveney on raising this issue and on his well researched presentation.</P>
      <P>The <i>Jeannie Johnston </i>project involves the construction of a replica of the famine vessel of the same name which carried Irish emigrants to the United States and Canada during the middle of the 19th century. It had been intended that the vessel, when completed, would embark on a tour of the US and Canada where it would illustrate the historical famine era links between Ireland and those two countries and generally demonstrate the nature of the cultural and social contribution made by Irish emigration during that period. The project was commenced in 1996 and is being run by the board of management of the Jeannie Johnston Company (Ireland) Limited, a company limited by guarantee.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine first became involved in June 2000 when the Minister agreed to provide grant aid of up to &euro;2.54 million to enable completion of the project. However, a due diligence report commissioned by the Department identified that additional funding would be required for the completion of the project and following the drawing up of a rescue plan the Minister sought and obtained Government approval in April 2001 to provide additional funding, bringing the total allocation by the Department to the project to &euro;3.97 million.</P>
      <P>Since the Government decision of April 2001, the grant from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has been allocated solely towards ensuring the vessel is completed to high standards of quality and safety. The company failed to complete the vessel in time for a voyage to the US during 2001, due mainly to difficulties with electrical work on the ship. It is now due for completion towards the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Following the company's decision to postpone the voyage in 2001, the Minister set up a focus group comprising the principal State and private stakeholders in the project to identify the options for the future role of the project and to work on a long-term strategy for the vessel after completion. The focus group completed its work and presented its report in January this year. It estimated that the final cost of the project will be &euro;14.35 million. It has overrun by &euro;10.16 million &ndash; 377% &ndash; on its original estimate of approximately $3.81 and by over 18 months on its originally scheduled completion date. The group also confirmed that the project to date has not delivered on any of its original objectives and the project promoters have been unable to develop credible plans for a voyage to the US and Canada or for a long-term future for the vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Dunbrody</i>, which is berthed at New Ross and in which I am heavily involved, overran by <Col N="331" /> approximately £1.9 million but it was completed for £4.9 million. It was thought that the <i>Dunbrody</i> should sail to the US but I understand the cost of sailing would be in the region of £750,000, a huge amount of money. There was no guarantee we would get back the money. The good news is that 60,300 people visited the <i>Dunbrody</i> in its first year. I say this because it could apply to the <i>Jeannie Johnston</i> and I agree with all the Deputy said. Last Sunday, there was an open day when 1,300 visitors went on board the vessel. It is a real prospect for earning money. Most people who pass by the quayside at New Ross stop out of curiosity and go on board the vessel.</P>
    <P>The focus group concluded that there were serious deficiencies in the original concept in terms of its planned role and in the estimate of the benefits envisaged for the project for the future. That project was inadequately managed and the <i>Jeannie Johnston</i> company was not an appropriate platform for planning, designing or management of a future role for the project, therefore, they are in agreement with what the Deputy said.</P>
    <P>In essence, the focus group has not identified a long-term use for the vessel, which will not involve the State in ongoing subvention to the <Col N="332" /> project. Moreover, the ability of the focus group to assess the costs and benefits associated with various options for the use of the vessel, or to identify private sector support, has been hampered by the extent of the financial crisis surrounding the project.</P>
    <P>Such were my concerns about the current financial state of the project highlighted in the report that I brought the focus group report to the immediate attention of my Government colleagues. In doing so, I expressed the view that the perilous financial state of the promoting company is likely to lead to its imminent forced winding-up unless the company and the State agencies involved can agree on a structured voluntary liquidation of the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>One of the first commitments I gave when appointed Minister for Public Enterprise in June 1997 concerned the post office network. I promised that there would be no forced closures of post offices. My position and that of the Government has not changed since then. We remain committed to a viable and competitive post office network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2001, two reports on the post office network were undertaken. One was by Phil Flynn and the other by the interdepartmental group. Both reports concluded that the post office network is facing serious challenges over the next few years. The Government having considered both reports and the future of the post office network decided on the following measures: first, the introduction by An Post of postal agency arrangements. In accordance with the Flynn report, and with the agreement of the Irish Postmasters Union, this is currently being implemented by An Post on a voluntary pilot basis; second, an increase in the share capital of An Post by &euro;12.7 million £10 million to facilitate the implementation of the overall package of reforms, in particular through payment of the increase for sub-postmasters recommended in the Flynn report. The pay increase for postmasters was implemented in November last year and the increase in share capital, which is subject to approval by the EU Commission, is expected to be cleared shortly; finally, the Government also approved the development of a Government services outlet network in situations where it is impossible to continue a post office service on an <Col N="335" /> agency basis, having regard to the availability of already-existing equivalent community-based or statutory services, so as to meet the needs of the community within each county. This concept is being developed at present.</P>
    <P>The partnership forum, chaired by Phil Flynn, which I established after the Government decision to facilitate negotiations on reform has concluded. Part of the work of the forum included agreeing the terms of 26 pilot postal agencies and examining the feasibility of routing additional government business through the network. I expect the report of the chairman to be published shortly. In addition, both An Post and my Department are exploring every opportunity to increase the level of business which can be undertaken by the network. An Post has recently succeeded in securing a number of business contracts, notably the ESB bill payment facility and the AIB contract giving access to the bank's customer accounts through post offices.</P>
    <P>However, the Government recognised that none of the measures, which I have outlined, would in themselves resolve the severe financial difficulties facing the company without the implementation of cost reduction programmes by An Post. To achieve this a transformation agreement which provided for cost savings and organisational changes was concluded with the unions. While some progress was made, for a variety of reasons the agreed level of savings required were not met. The announcement last week by An Post on the necessity for major cost reductions to be achieved by early retirement, voluntary severance or redeployment is a reflection of the continuing challenges facing the company's finances. I would stress that no compulsory redundancies are planned and the management and the unions have agreed to enter into negotiations on the proposals. I know and fully appreciate the work undertaken by postmasters and postmistresses over the years in terms of providing excellent services to the customer, particularly in rural areas. I am committed to ensuring that the public service ethos offered by the post office network will remain. An Post is fully aware of the Government's position in relation to the network.</P>

      <P>I have received representations on behalf of a group of pensioners who were employed by SRS Aviation Limited, a subsidiary company of Aer Lingus involved in ground handling and previously in the aircraft engineering business at Shannon Airport. The engineering business called Shannon MRO Limited was sold to UPS Limited in March 1999. In responding to the representations, I have clearly indicated that the resolution of the pensioners concerns about pension increases and entitlements is a matter for the trustees of the Shannon MRO pension scheme. I have no function or any statutory authority in relation to the Shannon MRO pension scheme.</P>
      <P>The pensioners concerns are the subject of legal proceedings which they initiated in the High Court against Aer Lingus, SRS Aviation and the Trustees of the Shannon MRO scheme. I understand that Aer Lingus met with the SRS pensioners in August 1999 in relation to the pensioners concerns. I have requested Aer Lingus to organise a further meeting with the members of the SRS pensioners group and I understand the meeting will take place later this month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 121 and 132 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann inform me that up to 80,000 passengers use the DART service daily. A further 36,500 travel on the outer suburban services. Substantial capacity has been added to the DART network since 2000, with the acquisition of 26 new DART carriages. A further 12 were delivered late last year and will enter service in the coming months. These 38 carriages are the first new carriages purchased for the DART network since the service commenced in 1984. The entry into service of the recently delivered 12 new DART carriages will result in a 50% increase in <Col N="337" /> capacity on the DART network in the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>The next phase in the DART expansion programme is to provide for the lengthening of platforms to accommodate eight car trains, a major upgrade of the signalling capacity to allow an increased number of trains in the city centre area, increased power supply for operating the enhanced network and upgrading station access to accommodate increased passenger numbers. Iarnród Éireann also holds an option on a further 36 DART cars to provide eight-car DART trains.</P>
    <P>Some £7.2 million, &euro;9.14 million, in Exchequer funding was allocated in respect of the DART expansion programme in 2001. The allocation of Exchequer funding to the project in 2002 will be decided upon when Iarnród Éireann comes forward with its detailed funding needs later this month. The Dublin Transportation Office strategy document Platform for Change, which sets out the strategy for the future development of public transport in Dublin, provides for upgrading existing stations but does not provide for the opening of any further stations along the DART line. However, additional stations on outer suburban services are planned.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, for a report on this matter and am advised that the RPII has not received evidence from British Nuclear Fuels that the highly active storage tanks, HASTS, can withstand a major terrorist attack. BNFL has assured the RPII that the HASTS are robust enough to endure such an attack. However, due to security restrictions imposed by the UK Government in response to the events of September 11, insufficient technical information has been revealed to permit the RPII's verification of this assurance. The RPII is continuing to press for access to further information on this matter. In my view, there is a clear onus on BNFL to accelerate the process of vitrification of this liquid waste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 73, 79, 81, 128 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to composite Dáil Questions Nos. 105 and 108 on 6 February 2002, I have been informed by Aer Lingus that there has been substantial progress on the implementation of its survival plan and that the company is on course to meet the financial targets set out in the plan. This plan is designed to return the company to viability and to secure its future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been made on the following key elements of the plan: 25% reduction in capacity came into effect with the introduction of the winter flight schedules; reduction in staffing &ndash; over 740 staff have left the company since last September, a further 600 will leave within the next week or so and arrangements for the departure of remaining staff exiting are under way; extensive work practice and other changes, as set out in the survival plan, are being implemented to yield the required cost savings and a number of <Col N="339" /> non-essential assets have been sold. Furthermore, the survival plan has been assisted by aggressive cost management and a recovery in volume of sales due to fare promotion initiatives and the upgraded internet facility.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the pilots, all groups within the company have accepted the survival plan and the work practice changes contained therein. As the House will be aware, following a day of talks on Monday, 4 February 2002, the Labour Relations Commission issued proposals to resolve the pilots dispute which were accepted by both sides. These proposals involve the appointment of an arbitrator to resolve outstanding issues relating to the changes in work practices with the process to be completed by 25 February 2002 and a facilitator to examine all mechanisms for addressing pilot surplus with the process to be completed by 1 March 2002. The LRC also proposed that the notice of redundancy already issued by Aer Lingus management to pilots be withdrawn and that IMPACT/IALPA withdraw notice of industrial action for 11 February 2002 with no further notice of industrial action to be issued during the process. This was agreed by both Aer Lingus and unions. I would urge all parties involved over the next few weeks to make every effort to resolve this dispute. It is essential that agreement be reached and that all the remaining changes which are fundamental to the company's survival and the retention of 4,000 jobs are fully implemented.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overall financial results for 2001, I am awaiting the company's draft accounts which I expect shortly. I understand, however, that due to the progress on the survival plan measures outlined earlier, the results for the year will show an improvement on the projected substantial loss at the operational level in the survival plan. However, on top of this, I am advised that significant exceptional costs arose in 2001 with the result that a large overall loss will occur for the year. In relation to projected performance in 2002, the company advise that as set out in the survival plan it does not expect any significant improvement in market conditions before the end of the third quarter. At this stage, Aer Lingus does not see any change in the survival plan projections for a loss in 2002.</P>
    <P>According to the company, current market conditions can be summarised as follows: Significantly reduced advance passenger booking, reduced business traffic levels, significant pricing reductions required to stimulate traffic and average yields lower than in 2000. In relation to route performance, there has been some recovery in traffic volumes on the transatlantic routes but yields are low, while on some European routes performance is poor. On the other hand, notwithstanding the current difficulties, Aer Lingus continues to monitor opportunities for new and more profitable services within the constraints of existing resources. It was in this context that the company recently decided to introduce new services <Col N="340" /> to Malaga, Barcelona and Nice through the re-deployment of aircraft from other European routes where the number of daily services had been reduced due to poor performance.</P>
    <P>While significant progress has been made in relation to the survival plan and a degree of stability has emerged, the company is still in a very vulnerable position due to its strained cash position and weak balance sheet. Considerable management action and initiative will be required in 2002, both to fully implement the very significant changes envisaged in the survival plan in the timescale required and also to continue to meet revenue and operating targets. External investment is necessary to support the future development of the company and the Government decision in this regard still stands. However, arrangements to give effect to this decision will not be activated pending resolution of the pilots dispute. Considerable progress has been made on the increased staff shareholding in the company and I expect talks to resume on this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EU, I should point out that &euro;6,668,770 was paid by the Irish Exchequer to Aer Lingus in December in relation to the four-day compensation measures agreed for all EU airlines in respect of the events of 11 September 2001. Claims for compensation were also received from three other Irish airlines, one of which has received payment. My Department formally notified the Commission on 14 December last that we have asked Aer Lingus to provide the relevant figures to the end of December, which we are now awaiting from the company. On receipt of that information, I will submit a case to the Commission for an extension of the compensation measure under the provision agreed at the October Transport Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The digital hub, the development of which is overseen by Digital Media Development Limited, DMDL, is designed to cluster Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin. It is part of the drive to make Ireland an international centre for <Col N="341" /> high-tech research and cutting edge digital industry. In the last couple of months the project has advanced considerably. Last December, I launched DMDL's development strategy which sets out the targets for the first phase of the digital hub. The Digital Hub Development Agency Bill was published on 14 January last. The Bill provides for the establishment of DMDL on a statutory basis as a State agency. Property purchase for the digital hub is almost complete and funding has been allocated for the provision of high-speed broadband infrastructure in the area.</P>
    <P>The strategy for the digital hub has been devised to concentrate on the scale and nature of State input to provide the essential facilities and infrastructure to get the project off to the right start over an initial three year period covering 2001 to 2003. Thereafter, the development of the area will be contingent on the level of private sector investment that the project attracts. It is on this basis that, to date, the Government has approved funding for the project totalling &euro;83.01 million. Of this, &euro;51.93 million has been spent on the purchase of property for the hub, including property for Media Lab Europe in line with its establishment agreement. A further &euro;21.71 million is to be spent in the coming weeks as contracts on the remaining properties are closed. In addition to this, &euro;2.29 million has been allocated for the provision of broadband infrastructure in the hub. A current allocation of &euro;7.62 million to cover the operating expenses of DMDL was made for the period 2001 to 2003. Of this, &euro;2.54 million was spent in 2001 and &euro;2 million will be spent in 2002.</P>

      <P>Electricity consumption from renewable energy sources during the year 2000 amounted to 6%. On 4 February 2002, I announced the results of AER V, a competition to support the building of new renewable energy based electricity generating plants. I have offered contracts totalling some 362 megawatts to the market. This offer more than doubles any preceding offer under the AER Programme and compares to existing installed capacity of 137 MW. This measure will support private sector investment of more than &euro;400 million in environmentally-friendly energy generation using wind, hydro and biomass technologies. It will provide enough electricity for the equivalent of 250,000 homes, avoiding more than 1.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Other benefits to derive from these projects include a reduction in our heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels by more than 2,000,000 barrels of oil annually and the redirection of over &euro;40 million previously spent on imported fuel back into the Irish economy. I expect to move to the next support measure, AER VI, in the coming months. AER VI will seek to deliver the remainder of the overall 500 megawatt additional capacity by 2005.</P>

      <P>I am aware that British Nuclear Fuels is involved in decommissioning redundant nuclear facilities in certain parts of the Sellafield site. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, which has been monitoring the situation through its contacts with the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, NII, has recently received an update from the NII on the decommissioning situation. The position, as advised to me by the RPII, is that in June 2000 decommissioning works were suspended at the Windscale reactor pile number one, the site of the 1957 Windscale fire. Progress was halted because of doubts over the safety of the strategy that had been proposed for handling the next stage of decommissioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decommissioning will continue to be suspended until a revised and more secure strategy has been developed. The particular work that has been delayed relates to the removal of materials from the site that, if not handled correctly, can spontaneously ignite. It is possible that delays <Col N="343" /> could continue for a further year or more. These difficulties, even though they relate to a decommissioning process, are a further indication of the hazards associated with the entire nuclear industry and a further vindication of the legal actions that Ireland is taking against the Sellafield MOX plant and of which this House is well aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 75 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including Internet services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. My Department has responsibility for the communications and e-commerce measure of the national development plan. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was &euro;200 million. A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and, on foot of submissions received, I signed nine contracts at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure with a grant allocation of &euro;30 million, leveraging an investment of &euro;70 million in the BMW region. Details of these programmes are available on the internet at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ran a second call for proposals last year with a submission date for proposals at the end of October 2001. The second call, as well as seeking private sector submissions, allowed for submissions by local authorities to provide open-access telecommunications infrastructure. Proposals received have been evaluated independently and, on foot of this evaluation, a number of local authorities have been asked to commence non-binding procurement processes. It is likely <Col N="344" /> that a number of private sector submissions to the second call will also be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation of Internet access charges is an operational matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. I have no function in these matters. The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has taken several steps to support dial-up internet access and in particular it has opened two new non-geographic codes for use in accessing internet service providers, ISPs. An analysis of dial-up Internet access prices is contained in the EU Commission's recently published Seventh Report on the Implementation of the Telecommunications Regulatory Package in Member States-COM 2001 706 final, 26 November 2001.</P>
      <P>Government policy is to facilitate the roll-out of state of the art infrastructures and to provide the legislative and regulatory environment which will serve to make a major contribution to sustained macro-economic growth and the realisation of competitively priced, high quality services. Low cost, high speed Internet access is a key element of my Department's communications policy. Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, &euro;200 million of public funds have been earmarked to leverage investment in advanced communications infrastructure and services. The focus of this investment will be to support investment in communications and electronic commerce infrastructure, systems and services in less developed areas.</P>
      <P>Government proposals in relation to regulatory reform of the communications sector are designed to ensure that the regulatory conditions in Ireland are effective in stimulating a competitive market for communications services, including internet services. In this regard the draft Communications (Regulation) Bill will enhance the regulatory framework so as to further facilitate the development of the sector while ensuring that appropriate elements of the public interest are taken into account. The Bill is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is my intention to have the Bill published in the next few weeks and, time permitting, to have it enacted before the Easter recess.</P>

While I have had no meetings with the European Commission to discuss Sellafield, the relevant commissioner is well aware of my position arising from my interventions at Council etc. The Commission has recently taken an interest in our legal strategy in OSPAR and ITLOS and this may well give rise to meetings at official level.

    <P>Iarnród Éireann informs me that since work was completed on doubling the line from Connolly to Maynooth there are now 21 departures <Col N="347" /> per day in both directions. The company informs me that this represents an increase of approx. 150% in the capacity on the Maynooth line since the commencement of new services in August 2001. While this is a major improvement in service levels, Iarnród Éireann accepts that the demand for services continues to grow. I understand that further increases in capacity will require an upgrade in the track and signalling system at Connolly Station. Planning and design work in this regard is currently being undertaken by Iarnród Éireann as part of the DART upgrade project. The planning and design work will be completed shortly and will include detailed timescales for the completion of the project within the lifetime of the national development plan and funding will be made available by the Exchequer for that project.</P>

In my reply, I mentioned the ITLOS judgment, handed down on 3 December 2001. This judgment imposed obligations of co-operation on the United Kingdom <i>vis-à-vis</i> the exchange of information and the establishment of measures to protect the marine environment. These obligations are being monitored and exercised in full pending the hearing of the substantive case against the Sellafield MOX plant under a Law of the Seas Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal. Ireland will shortly be in a position to submit a written memorial to this tribunal. It is anticipated that a hearing by the arbitral tribunal will take place this autumn. In so far as the OSPAR action is concerned, the position is as advised in the answers to the Dáil questions already referred to.</P>

      <P>A proposal relating to the split of the costs of the initial public offer, IPO, between the Government and the company was submitted to the company by my Department on 27 April 1999. However, part of this proposal met with a legal impediment under section 60 of the Companies Act 1963 and it was necessary to consider a revised proposal. This revised proposal was submitted to the company on 25 June 1999. It was not possible to conclude an agreement with the company in advance of the IPO which took place a few days later but the company did confirm that it would enter into meaningful discussions in relation to the issue of the possible sharing of costs. The matter has been the subject of a number of meetings and correspondence with the company but, to date, has not been resolved. My Department is considering what other means are open to it in order to progress this issue.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's strategy for transport in the greater Dublin area for 2000 to 2016 &ndash; A Platform for Change &ndash; is an integrated strategy comprising the upgrading of existing suburban services, the development of a light rail system, Luas, as well as a metro system. The construction of an interconnector tunnel from Heuston Station via Pearse Station to the docklands, which would link the Maynooth and northern lines, forms part of the proposals. Iarnród Éireann plans to commission shortly a more detailed study to develop this proposal. The <Col N="349" /> DTO advises that the Phoenix Park tunnel is very limited in capacity and does not offer the development potential when compared to the proposed interconnector and the needs of Dublin in the period up to and beyond 2016. In the short-term, due to track capacity constraints in Connolly Station, it would not be possible to route additional services via the tunnel without restricting existing services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>I have been briefed on this matter by my officials. In his opinion, the Advocate General whose views are not binding on the Court of Justice, proposes that the court should declare that the &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; agreements are contrary to Community law as regards fares of United States air carriers on intra-community routes, computerised reservation systems and by insertion or maintenance of clauses favouring national airlines in these agreements. It is not clear yet when the court will give its final legally binding decision on these cases. Accordingly, in the absence of such a decision, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what the implications may be for existing bilateral agreements on air transport between European countries and the US or for existing Government policy. However, as recently as last October, the Government confirmed the continuation of the existing policy on the Shannon stopover in the context of the Ireland &ndash; United States bilateral agreement on air services and I do not foresee that there will be any change to this policy.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications <Col N="350" /> services, including Internet services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised communications market, regulated by the independent Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. My Department has responsibility for the communications and e-commerce measure of the national development plan which aims to promote investment in advanced communications infrastructure in the less developed regions of the country.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was &euro;200 million. A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and, on foot of submissions received, I signed nine contracts at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. At the beginning of August 2001, I announced a second call for proposals. The deadline for receipt of proposals was 19 October 2001. In all, 31 proposals were made on a confidential basis from both private and public sector organisations. The proposals are currently being independently evaluated according to the criteria set out in the invitation to tender document and it is expected that the evaluation committee will make formal recommendations in the coming weeks. The successful projects will be announced when contracts have been signed.</P>

      <P>As recommended in the Flynn Report, An Post has invited applications from the non-automated post offices to participate in a voluntary pilot scheme to test the concept of provid<Col N="351" /> ing postal services on an agency basis. Under the pilot scheme, sub-postmasters would surrender their contracts and opt to become postal agents. The terms for the pilot scheme have been agreed with the Irish Postmasters Union. I understand that it is the company's intention, as agreed with the postmasters, to convert 26 post offices to agency status under the voluntary scheme. I have no statutory function in relation to the choice of offices to convert to agency status which is an operational matter for An Post.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultant to whom the Deputies refer, Professor Rigas Doganis, was engaged by the Department of the Taoiseach to advise that <Col N="352" /> Department and the inter departmental group chaired by the Taoiseach's Department, which was set up to examine possibilities for encouraging additional travel by air and increasing visitor numbers to Ireland following the terrorist incidents in the US last September. Apart from the Taoiseach's Department, the group included representatives of my Department, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General's Office.</P>
    <P>While the engagement of the consultant was a matter for the Taoiseach's Department, it was agreed by the inter departmental group that the funding for the consultancy would be provided out of my Department's Vote. The estimated cost of the consultancy is Stg£15,000. The consultant's terms of reference were framed in the context of the interim report produced by the inter departmental group in November last and Aer Rianta's response to that interim report. Specifically, the consultant's role was to advise the Department of the Taoiseach and the inter departmental group at a strategic level on Aer Rianta's response to the group's interim report and the economic and airport management issues arising. In carrying out this role, the consultant was requested to focus on identifying the optimum strategy for the Government and Aer Rianta to follow having regard to the company's statutory mandate to manage the State airports on a commercial basis and having regard to the overall Government aviation and tourism policy context in which it must operate.</P>
    <P>The consultant's report has been received and was considered by the Government at its meeting on 5 February 2002 and the decisions taken by the Government on the report were the subject of a press release issued on 5 February, 2002. The report has since been made available to the public via my Department's website at http@//www.dpe.ie. In its decision the Government noted the principal conclusions and recommendations of the Doganis report on aviation/tourism issues, and the endorsement by the report of the independent airport charges regulatory regime already in operation as established under the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001 and agreed the following actions should be taken: (a) the Minister for Public Enterprise to ask Aer Rianta to proceed immediately with the provision at the earliest possible date, of a rapid turn-around facility, having particular regard to the planning permission already secured for the proposed Pier D, at Dublin Airport to meet the specific needs of all carriers operating at the lower fares end of the market; the Minister to closely monitor this project so as to ensure that Aer Rianta provide the facility at the lowest possible cost, take full account of the needs of the low fares carriers and have the facility operational in good time for the 2003 season; (b) the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ask Tour<Col N="353" /> ism Ireland Limited to report to him on the existing consultative arrangements with the air carriers with a view to ensuring a greater degree of co-ordination and co-operation in marketing activities for existing and new services to the Irish airports between the carriers, Tourism Ireland Limited and Aer Rianta; and (c) the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to continue to highlight the need for accommodation providers and other tourism industry interests to improve price competitiveness to boost prospects for the 2002 season.</P>
    <P>The Government noted that Dublin Airport has the capacity to cater for a resumption of normal traffic growth and, while facilities at Cork Airport are already stretched, Aer Rianta is proceeding rapidly with its plans for a new, expanded terminal to deal with traffic growth going forward. Shannon Airport, on the other hand, has ample terminal capacity but has been more directly affected by the events of 11 September. Recovery of traffic levels at Shannon will depend largely upon the return of confidence among American travellers and a greater focus by the airport on securing more business from the UK and continental Europe.</P>
    <P>A feature of the recent debate on aviation-tourism issues is the belief that the level of airport charges is a matter for ministerial decision. The Government has drawn attention to the fact that the determination of airport charges is a matter for the independent Commission for Aviation Regulation set up under the Aviation Regulation <Col N="354" /> Act, 2001 and has noted the view of Professor Doganis that the commission's determination of August last year is quite demanding of Aer Rianta. The Government has also noted the view of the consultant that any suggestion of separating the management of one part of Dublin Airport from the rest was likely to create more problems than it would solve. I greatly welcome the publication of the Doganis report, which I hope will assist considerably the public debate about these very important aviation and tourism issues. I believe the actions now agreed by the Government, to be pursued by myself and my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, will help in the recovery of air traffic and tourism from the events of 11 September last.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on community employment are being mainstreamed. This process has already commenced in the case of CE services in schools and I am hopeful that the current discussions between officials of my Department and the Department of Health and Children, and FÁS will be concluded shortly to allow the mainstreaming of CE health services to commence in the late spring or early summer. Mainstreaming of CE health services will involve the phased transfer of current CE funding for such services to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" />Supervisors are employed by sponsors of CE projects to manage each project, and to look after the training and development needs of participants. These positions are funded by a grant from FÁS. They are not directly involved in the provision of services to persons with disabilities or other such services. It is intended that participants in health projects considered suitable for mainstreaming will be allowed to work out their contracts in the usual way. However, once mainstreaming has commenced a participant will not be replaced when their term on the programme has finished and the project will gradually, be phased out. Supervisors of certain projects discontinued due to mainstreaming who are not retained by the sponsor may, therefore, be made redundant.</P>
    <P>FÁS employment services will make every effort to ensure that supervisors are made aware of other employment opportunities, including those arising in the social economy, as this programme is rolled out, or in other community employment schemes. FÁS employment services will initiate contact with such supervisors and provide the full range of employment supports, including job placement or further training if required. In addition, FÁS will ensure that redundant supervisors, with their consent, are placed on the regional database of community employment supervisors for future prospective employers.</P>

The following published Bills are currently at various stages before the Houses: Competition Bill, 2001, Whistleblowers Protection Bill, 1999 and Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1999. I also wish to progress a number of Bills not yet before the Houses and where the Government has approved draft heads: Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill, Companies (Amendment) (Audit) Bill and Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Bill. I will shortly bring draft heads to Government in relation to the following two Bills: Work Permits Bill and Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many firms are facing and of the problems this is creating for them. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents us and our Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk. The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of the September 11 attacks in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, which had a significant presence in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board &ndash; PIAB. I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers. A workplace safety group has been established with a view to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The group is developing proposals at present designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms. I would encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the covers included in policies is actually required.</P>

      <P>Eligibility criteria for community employment, CE, is focused on long-term unemployed persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments. The general terms and conditions relating to participation on CE have been reviewed and adjusted in the light of the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure this programme, and the recommendations contained in the subsequent P2000 report on facilitating women's access to labour market opportunities. In this context, eligibility for CE has been extended to adult dependents of long-term unemployed persons &ndash; qualified adults, widows-widowers, persons in receipt of deserted wives benefit, and persons previously in receipt of carers allowance for a minimum of 12 months, who meet the general criteria for participation on the programme. Separated persons in receipt of maintenance payments are not currently eligible to participate in the programme.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited is a UK authorised insurer currently in provisional liquidation. The liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. Irish policyholders, including hoteliers, with claims outstanding against IICL are creditors of that insurance company and should pursue their case with the provisional liquidators. Unlike creditors of IICL, my Department has no standing in relation to the liquidation process in the UK. Our discussions with the provisional liquidators were aimed at obtaining information in relation to the extent of claims from Irish policyholders and on the liquidation process itself. As I indicated in reply to an earlier parliamentary question, I appreciate the difficulties being faced by IICL policyholders. However, it would not be acceptable to burden Irish taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims, resulting from the failure of this UK company.</P>

      <P>Company law has been drafted in a way which <Col N="359" /> seeks to both protect the interests of minority investors and which also encourages economic activity. Section 8(3) of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 requires the panel to make rules providing that where a person or persons acting in concert acquire effective control of a company, i.e., where they control not less than 30% of the company's voting rights, the person or persons in control are required to make an offer for all the remaining shares of the company on certain terms. The purpose of this is to protect minority shareholders so that they do not get locked into holding shares in a company, the effective control of which is exercised by another party.</P>
      <P>Under section 204 of the Companies Act 1963, a company that receives acceptance of an offer to acquire 80% of another company's share capital is empowered to acquire the shares of the remaining shareholders. There is an option for such minority shareholders to make an appeal to the courts against any such mandatory acquisition of shares. The rationale behind this compulsory acquisition provision is that it is often not an attractive proposition for a purchasing company to acquire less than 100% of the share capital of another company and acquisition schemes, which are economically desirable might not proceed if this provision did not exist. Accordingly, it will be seen that there is a sensitive balancing of interests to be achieved which in any one case may not satisfy all the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000 transposed EU Directive 96/82/EC (Seveso II) into Irish law on 21 December, 2000. Article 11(3) of the Seveso II Directive requires member states to ensure that the public are consulted on external emergency plans. Regulation 17(2)(<i>e</i>) of the regulations obliges a local competent authority (local authority), when preparing an external emergency plan, to consult with &ldquo;such other persons, including the public, as appear to the local competent authority to be appropriate to consult with in the circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst Regulation 17 makes consultation with various parties obligatory, it allows a certain amount of discretion to the local competent authority to determine the extent of the consultation necessary on a case-by-case basis. It is not the intention of the regulations to exclude consultation with the public. It should also be noted that <Col N="360" /> under Regulation 19, an operator of a facility subject to these regulations, or a local competent authority on behalf of an operator, is obliged to supply detailed information on the appropriate safety measures and steps to be taken in the event of an accident to members of the public who are likely to be habitually in a specified area. As far as I am aware only one representation regarding the transposition of this directive has been received in my Department. I am satisfied that the transposition of this directive has incorporated adequate public consultation procedures.</P>
    <P>At EU level, the first amendment to the Seveso II Directive is at an advanced stage of discussion and should be agreed later this year. Following the transposition of this amendment into national law, the level of public consultation will no longer be subject to the discretion of a local competent authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of permit applications awaiting decision has increased from 1,900 on 1 January 2001 to 6,953 applications last December and is directly related to the increase in the number of applications being received. The backlog on 31 January 2002 stood at 5,529 applications. The number of work permit applications increased from an average of over 350 per week in 2000 to over 825 per week last year. The level of appli<Col N="361" /> cations climbed during the year and in December alone, an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received. New procedures were introduced with effect from 2 January 2002 and this has resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received. The average number of complete and valid applications received for the month of January 2002 was 325 applications per week. While the staff numbers in the work permit section was increased by 50% last year in an effort to reduce processing time, the very large increase in applications meant that the waiting period could not be reduced. Nevertheless, the staff in the section issued 36,436 permits in 2001, compared with some 18,000 in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 to 99, inclusive, and 109 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1997, my Department has allocated a total of &euro;9.51 million in Exchequer funding towards the construction of marinas around the coast of Ireland. Of this total, &euro;3.81 million was allocated in June 1997 to the Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company towards the cost of the development of a marina and recreational facilities in Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin. Further funding of &euro;5.7 million was allocated in the December 2000 budget for four flagship marina and integrated marine leisure/access infrastructure projects, namely a new marina at Caherciveen, County Kerry, a new integrated marine leisure and access infrastructure facility at Kenmare, <Col N="362" /> County Kerry, a new marina at Roundstone, County Galway and a new marina at Rosses Point, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above funding, my Department allocated just under &euro;51,000 in 2001 towards the costs of a feasibility study undertaken by Galway County Council, in conjunction with the Galway Bay Sailing Club, for a marine leisure development at Rinville, County Galway. No funding has been provided by my Department for the construction of marinas on inland waters nor does my Department have any responsibility for the allocation of lottery funds.</P>
    <P>I recently formally launched the marine tourism sub-measure which will be implemented by my Department as part of the two regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Under this grant scheme, &euro;25.4 million has been allocated to marine tourism, and targeted particularly at improving marine access infrastructure such as marinas, berths and slipways. Funding will also be available under the scheme for feasibility studies. My Department has already announced the first call for applications and following the launch, formal application forms and guidelines are now being made available by my Department to all parties, including the Foynes Yacht Club, which has expressed an interest in the scheme. Once formal applications are received from the promoters of proposed projects, they will be assessed in accordance with the procedures laid down under the scheme.</P>

Two-thirds of this allocation will be spent in the Border, midlands and west region and one-third in the south and east region. A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received I signed nine contracts for grant assistance of &euro;55 million at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband in the regions.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Question No. 161 of 21 November 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the level of discharges into the Irish Sea are regularly examined by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, details of which are contained in a series of biannual reports published by the RPII. The most recent report published by the RPII, covers the period 1998-1999. The more recent RPII data covering the year 2000 and the first half of last year are available on the RPII's website &ndash; www.rpii.ie.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Sellafield MOX plant is expected to result in the estimated annual discharge of 12 megabequerels of radioactivity in liquid form which is not significant compared with the radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea from existing operations at Sellafield. According to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, radiation doses received by the Irish population as a direct result of discharges from the MOX plant will not be distinguishable from those due to natural background radiation. Based on the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of radiation, these radiation doses are not significant in terms of human health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the admission of the United Kingdom authorities, the commissioning of the MOX Plant has served to prolong the lifetime of other activities at Sellafield, primarily the THORP reprocessing plant. Thus the commissioning of the MOX plant will directly give rise to additional discharges of radioactive material into the Irish Sea. For that reason, the Government has always considered the impact of the operation of the MOX plant as an integral part of all activities at the Sellafield site. I would like to remind the House the activities of British Nuclear Fuels pose a continuing threat to the safety of the marine environment of the Irish Sea and I will continue to exert the maximum pressure on the UK authorities for the reduction and cessation of radioactive discharges. In this regard, Ireland has campaigned vigorously at OSPAR for the implementation of that organisation's strategy on the reduction of radioactive discharges. The ongoing legal actions which were initiated by this Government against the UK in regard to the Sellafield MOX plant are a further indication of the Government's determination to <Col N="370" /> bring about the cessation of operations at Sellafield.</P>

      <P>On 28 January, I announced the commissioning of a strategic rail study the primary purpose of which is to provide a 20-year blueprint for the future development of the rail network in Ireland. Accordingly, the study will consider proposals from Iarnród Éireann as well as a number of rail proposals from various interests around the country. Among the routes to be assessed by the study are: a new service linking Blarney, Cork and Midleton; a link between Ennis, Shannon town and Airport and Limerick;a commuter service between Athenry and Galway; commuter service linking Colooney, Ballisodare, Ballymote with Sligo; a western rail corridor linking Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork; Athlone to Mullingar route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study will provide a strategic framework for future Government decisions on rail development over the next two decades and will identify <Col N="371" /> priorities for investment. It follows a recommendation contained in an Iarnród Éireann report which called for the pinpointing of long range plans for the network. I will also shortly be inviting submissions as part of a public consultation process. It is expected that the study will be completed in the autumn and recommendations arising from the study will then be submitted to Government.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann selects the infrastructure safety projects to be included in its annual safety investment programme on the basis of its assessment of safety priorities. I believe the Deputy is referring to a bridge over the railway at Manulla, known as overbridge No. 771 at 145 miles, 1496 yards, Mayo line.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has advised me that this masonry arch bridge is in good condition. It has a clear dimension between its parapets of 18'0, 5400 mm. Iarnród Éireann advise that it does not intend to renew or widen this bridge in conjunction with the track upgrading work being carried out under the Railway Safety Programme.</P>
      <P>The road surface on the bridge is maintained by Mayo County Council. Iarnród Éireann has received no request from the council seeking improvement works to the bridge. However, Iarnród Éireann advises me that it will be pleased to co-operate with the council if such work is required.</P>

      <Quest>the criteria which is used to measure overcrowding on the DART; and the frequency with which these measurements are taken.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Management of crowding on the Iarnród Éireann railway is an operational matter for that company and I have no statutory function in that regard.</P>
      <P>There are currently no quantitative safety standards in place regarding the maximum number of passengers permitted on trains, either in this country or at EU level. I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that the capacity of a DART vehicle is calculated on the basis of six people per metre squared. This passenger loading calculation is done on the basis of the entire DART vehicle, including the seating area. In practice, therefore, the maximum capacity of a DART vehicle is unlikely to be achieved, even at peak times.</P>
      <P>I am, nevertheless, fully aware that there can be uncomfortable levels of crowding at peak times. This has arisen due to the significant increase in passenger numbers using the DART since its introduction in 1984. Figures from Iarnród Éireann indicate that weekday passenger numbers on the DART have increased from 35,000 in 1984 to 85,000 today. In order to address this, significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to increase the physical capacity of the system.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, 26 new DART cars were brought into service and a further 12 DART cars, delivered in 2001, will go into service in the coming months. Preparatory work is under way on a project which will further increase the capacity of the DART network, particularly the lengthening of platforms and the upgrading of power supplies to enable eight-car DART trains to operate at peak times. In the meantime, the railway inspectorate of my Department continues to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains and keeps me informed on the matter. The inspectorate has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review. The chief railway inspecting officer has also raised particular aspects of crowding on rail services with Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>My Department has not examined the possibility of appointing an ombudsman for transport. Each of the three operating companies in CIE now publish customer charters and audits of these charters have been undertaken by independent market researchers, the results of which have been published through information brochures, posters and on the companies websites. The audits helped to identify, in an objective manner, areas where customer expectations would largely appear to have been met and areas where customers are seeking specific improvements.</P>
      <P>By way of example, the results have indicated that passengers are satisfied with, safety while travelling on inter-city and suburban rail services; the ease of boarding, alighting, temperature, ventilation and smooth driving, in the case of Bus Átha Cliath; and, the drivers who they perceive as well presented, friendly, helpful and courteous in the case of Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the past year my Department, in conjunction with representatives of CIE and the three operating companies, has set up a quality customer service committee to encourage the acceleration of ongoing customer service issues, such as the provision of better information, developing mechanisms of redress for customers and to establish appropriate standards of public service. Furthermore, my Department is working with each of the CIE subsidiaries to develop key performance indicators for the companies which will include customer service issues.</P>

No. 425/1994, which provide that the ground testing of aircraft engines at any time at State airports is prohibited, without the permission of Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>Since then, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, transferred the authority to make by-laws, including the amendment of existing by-laws to Aer Rianta. Accordingly, the regulation of noise at Dublin Airport is a matter for the company, by law.</P>

      <P>On 16 January 2002, the Government agreed that a phased approach should be taken to the development of the Dublin metro and approved proposals for the Railway Procurement Agency to begin the procurement process for phase 1. This comprises a line from Dublin Airport to the city centre and Shanganagh, with a spur to Blanchardstown. I expect that the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, will shortly issue a notice seeking expressions of interest for this phase. Phase 2 of the metro, as approved by Government, includes an extension of the airport line to Swords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The metro will be developed as a public private partnership project and the exact costs will only become clear as the competition to select the <Col N="375" /> partners progresses. Initial estimates from the Railway Procurement Agency suggest that the cost of an extension of the airport line to Swords would be in the region of &euro;0.3 billion to &euro;0.5 billion, at 2001 prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, sponsored by me, the Commission for Electricity Regulation, CER, in carrying out its duties, is required to have regard to the need, <i>inter alia</i>, to secure that all reasonable demands for electricity by customers are satisfied and promote the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity.</P>
      <P>The CER has informed my Department that for this winter period generation capacity will be within standard and that there will be adequate capacity to meet the needs of electricity customers, given the availability of temporary generation. The CER will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are concerns abroad in relation to the likelihood of shortfalls of electricity. In this context, the Government approved an investment plan for ESB involving a capital spend of &euro;2.6 billion on the electricity transmission and distribution systems up to 2004-2005. The physical work on upgrading the transmission system will be carried out by ESB using their own resources and outsourcing in accordance with a development plan to be produced by EirGrid as the transmission system operator. EirGrid's development plan, which will take account of national and regional development objectives, will be subject to public consultation and to the approval of the CER. This investment programme, when complete, is expected to fully modernise Ireland's transmission system and underpin the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not given any direction, nor do I have the power to give directions to ESB national grid, <Col N="376" /> in relation to the adequacy of power supplies to the national grid. However, I am pleased to note that the generation adequacy statement 2001-2007 published by ESB national grid in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, shows that in the medium term the commissioning of largescale generation plant projected for this year will lead to a significant improvement in the generation adequacy position.</P>
    <P>The upgraded North-South electricity interconnector which was mandated by Sir Reg Empey and I, will also contribute to security and adequacy of supply. In the longer term, assuming a properly functioning market with adequate investor incentives, National Grid has stated that there is no reason why generation adequacy should not be maintained within standard from 2003 onwards.</P>

      <P>The Government approved the sale of Cablelink, which was 75% owned by Telecom Éireann and 25% by RTE, in April 1998. Telecom Éireann, RTE and NTL signed a sale and purchase agreement in July 1999. On 14 December 1998, Aer Lingus sold its aircraft maintenance subsidiary, TEAM Aer Lingus, to FLS Industries, a Danish multinational company as part of its policy of exiting non-core business activities. The initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann took place in July 1999. On 16 July 2001, the commercial assets and businesses of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation &ndash; the company's two commercial subsidiaries, the Irish Refining Company and Bantry Terminals Limited &ndash; were sold to Tosco Corporation, a major US oil refiner and marketer. There are no plans to privatise the INPC's non-commercial subsidiary, the National Oil Reserves Agency.</P>
      <P>As I said on previous occasions, questions about the future ownership of commercial State companies fall to be determined on a case by case basis in the context of developments in their main business areas. In a number of cases, conversion to Plc status through primary legislation is a prerequisite to any change of ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following is an update on the position in relation to the commercial State companies, under my aegis: Aer Lingus: Following the events of 11 September 2001, the Government decided on 23 October 2001 that, provided a survival plan aimed at restoring Aer Lingus to viability was rapidly agreed and implemented in all its essential aspects, the Government would facilitate private sector interests and the staff of the airline <Col N="377" /> in an investment in Aer Lingus to secure the future cash needs and development of the company. Considerable progress has been made on the increased staff shareholding in the company and I expect talks to resume on this matter shortly. In relation to private sector investment, preparatory arrangements for the process have been agreed between my Department and Aer Lingus. However, arrangements to give effect to this decision will not be activated pending resolution of the pilots' dispute; Aer Rianta: No Government decision has been taken in respect of the recommendation of the board of Aer Rianta that there be an IPO of a minority shareholding in that company; Irish Aviation Authority, IAA: There are no plans to privatise the IAA, which was incorporated as a commercial State company in 1994 and is the safety regulator and the provider of air navigation services in Irish-controlled airspace; CIE: In regard to the CIE group of companies, the consultation paper entitled A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport was published by the Government in September 2000. It sets out a number of proposals regarding the restructuring of the CIE companies including the possible privatisation of the bus companies. These proposals are currently the subject of consultation with the Public Transport Partnership Forum which was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; ESB: There are currently no plans with regard to the flotation-privatisation of ESB; Bord Gáis Éireann: I have asked the board of BGE to consider alternative options to an IPO for meeting the current financial and commercial needs of the company; Bord na Móna: There are currently no plans with regard to a privatisation of Bord na Móna; An Post: Investigations by An Post into alliance possibilities is an ongoing process. I understand there are indications of interest but it is too early yet to judge the eventual outcome. I expect the board of An Post to report back to me on this matter later this year.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's transport strategy A Platform for Change, forms the framework for the future development of the transport network in the greater Dublin area up to 2016.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Platform for Change strategy takes account of other transport studies, including the Dublin suburban strategic rail review, the bus <Col N="378" /> network strategy appraisal for the greater Dublin area, the national roads needs study, the eastern by-pass strategic study, and complements the strategic land use planning framework set out in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The strategy proposes an integrated public transport network comprising the following principal components: an improved DART-suburban rail network; an extension of the on-street light rail network, Luas; an interconnector tunnel between Heuston Station and the Docklands and other new rail lines; the development of a higher capacity segregated light rail network, METRO which is in tunnel at various stages; and a much expanded bus network.</P>

      <P>Bus Éireann has taken delivery of 218 new buses to date under the national development plan. The purchase of these new buses has led to a very substantial improvement in services both in provincial cities and the greater Dublin area. Peak capacity has been increased by at least 50% on all main corridors into Dublin.</P>
      <P>Commuters from the north Kildare area are benefiting from these enhanced services provided by Bus Éireann, with an increase in scheduled departures. For example, on the Edenderry-Clane-Dublin route, the number of departures has increased from six in 1999 to 20 today. There is also a 200% increase in departures on the Mullingar-Kilcock-Dublin route. High capacity commuter coaches are serving all these routes together with the Naas-Newbridge route.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.  </P>
      <P>The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy to Cork County Council, in conjunction with the IDA, for &euro;973,889, £767, 000, has been completed. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for &euro;380,921, £300,000, for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres, approximately, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for &euro;8,888,167, £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly.</P>
      <P>Regarding Castleblayney, the property has been sold to the North-Eastern Health Board for &euro;761,843, £600,000, and the legal formalities are now completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The integrated action area plan, which was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the former <Col N="382" /> Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, has now been adopted by Cork County Council. A tender competition has been held for the appointment of selling agents for the former barracks and it is expected that an appointment will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>On the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In relation to the remainder of this site, I am arranging early discussions with all the interested parties including the local authority.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001. Two bids were received one of which was from Dublin City Council. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property which remains on the market and in this regard ongoing discussions are taking place with officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin City Council. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs.</P>
    <P>Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers the cost of security at Magee barracks, Kildare, is now met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North-Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and the former Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy has been sold to Cork County Council and no further costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to either of these properties.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure in relation to the former barracks since closure now stands at &euro;2,060,984, £1,623,157. The total costs include expenditure on security, utilities, maintenance, advertising, etc. Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the six barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date exceed &euro;1,422,107, £1,120,000. In addition there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately &euro;230,765, £181,742, in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the reserve steering group. I established the special steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the Reserve and the group reported to me in September 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have advised that the process of formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and the draft Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board report is expected to be submitted to the Chief of Staff shortly.</P>
      <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over approximately six years. The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve force will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three Reserve brigades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the Reserve is that members of the FCA should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to suitable qualifications, personal availability and appropriate advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions in other countries is quite common. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation and any matters relating to overseas service by members of the Reserve which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the representative associations <Col N="384" /> at the appropriate forum. The question of the security of civilian employment for the members of the Reserve who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process. Accordingly, pending the completion of the implementation plan applications to serve overseas have not been received from members of the Reserve.</P>
    <P>The report of the steering group on the special study of the Reserve Defence Force indicated that the existing first line Reserve system meets the Air Corps Reserve aviation requirement. Former Air Corps personnel who volunteer for service on the Reserve, or who have a Reserve commitment, should be attached to a unit of the Air Corps. The steering group did not recommend that a special Reserve Unit be established specifically for the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Naval Service Reserve-An Slua Muirí is 25 officers, 42 non-commissioned officers and 108 seamen. In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence Reserve activities at the highest level in Brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces Training Centre, the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the integrated element of the Reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established, it will form part of the Implementation process.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <P>The Air Corps currently has 17 fixed wing aircraft and 13 helicopters which are used for the following purposes: seven Siai-Marchetti SF 260W Aircraft of Italian manufacture which are being used for basic pilot training; six Cessna aircraft of American design and French manufacture are held. These are Army co-operation aircraft with some offensive &ndash; air to ground &ndash; capability and with training capability; one Beech Super Kingair twin-engined turbo-prop aircraft which is used for ministerial air transport service and twin-engined pilot training; one Gulfstream IV aircraft was acquired in December 1991 for the transport of <Col N="385" /> Ministers and officials. It was leased for ten years from 1991 and was purchased in December 2001 on termination of lease; two CASA CN 235 aircraft which are used mainly for fishery surveillance purposes; seven Alouette III helicopters are held. They are used for search and rescue, air ambulance and other services and have proved valuable in security operations; two Gazelle helicopters which are used for pilot training; four SA 365F Dauphin helicopters which are used for search and rescue.</P>
      <P>It is intended to place a contract this year for the acquisition of medium range helicopters for search and rescue. This contract will include an option to purchase two further such helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>In the near future it is intended to lease a seven/eight seater aircraft as a back up to the ministerial air transport service. In addition, it is intended to hold a tender competition for new trainer aircraft as replacement for the SiaiMarchettis which are over 20 years old.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 15 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. In processing the application for payment it was found that a number of animals required further checks regarding details recorded on the CMMS. These matters have now been resolved except for animal tag number HWA518784. According to CMMS records this animal was slaughtered on 27 August 2001 under a County Cork herdnumber. As there is no record of the animal having been moved off the holding of the person named the matter is being queried further.

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 40 animals on 29 June under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. In processing the application for payment, each tag number is checked against CMMS data to establish compliance. In this case these checks gave rise to a number of queries such as invalid breed, last calving dates and one animal was listed on two applications. The movement details for some animals also required further checking. By 17 January 2002 all queries except one were resolved. According to CMMS records animal tag number 381113530129 was not in the herd of origin and there was no record of the animal being moved into the herd. An 80% advance payment amounting to &euro;6431.88 based on 39 animals issued to the person named at this time. On 11 February 2002 a balance payment of &euro;1819.12 based on 40 animals issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the protocol on direct payments to farmers, it was agreed with the farming organisations that advance payments under the suckler <Col N="387" /> cow premium scheme would issue to applicants when the six months retention period was completed.

      <P>Raw milk to be used in the manufacture of milk products or heat-treated milk for human consumption must meet the hygiene standards prescribed by Directive 92/46/EEC. That directive is given the force of law in Ireland by Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 1996. These are, therefore, long-standing requirements. It is the responsibility of milk producers and processors in the first instance to ensure that these standards are adhered to.</P>

      <P>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, PRRS, otherwise known as &ldquo;blue ear&rdquo; is a notifiable disease under the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (Notification of Infectious Diseases) Order, 1992.</P>
      <P>Pig herds identified as either positive or suspect for PRRS are restricted under the terms of the Diseases of Animals (Notification of Infectious Diseases) (Amendment) Order, 1998. This order only permits the movement of pigs from restricted herds to either a slaughter plant or to another PRRS restricted herd. Such movement may take place only under the conditions of a specific movement permit issued by my Department's local district veterinary office. Among other things, the specific movement permit requires the haulier to pay particular attention to the cleansing and disinfection of the vehicle after carriage of the pigs has taken place. At present de-restriction of herds may only take place after a suspect herd has been found to be negative following a series of further blood tests or, where a positive herd has been depopulated and the premises have been cleansed and disinfected to the satisfaction of my Department, the entire premises have been left vacant for 30 days and there has been a negative representative blood sample three weeks after the reintroduction of pigs to the premises.</P>
      <P>In the period March 1999 to July 2001, three national surveys of the incidence of the PRRS virus in pig herds were carried out by means of blood sampling at pig meat plants throughout the country. The blood samples taken were tested at my Department's Central Veterinary Laboratory at Abbottstown, County Dublin. In January of this year, a further blood sampling survey was carried out at pig meat plants located in southern counties. In addition, the blood sampling of sows at other plants is taking place at present. A system of follow-up blood sampling at farm level has also been set up to investigate certain herds who are either positive or suspect for PRRS.</P>
      <P>There have been six positive cases of PRRS in the last six months. These cases have occurred in Cork, Limerick and Donegal.</P>

This compares with his average headage payment of &euro;138.27, £108.90, under the old animal-based headage schemes in the three years 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of &euro;101.58, £80, per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of &euro;88.88, £70, per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will apply to the 2001 scheme.</P>

      <P>The 30 day holding period for purchases of susceptible animals, which was introduced initially in the context of the foot and mouth emergency, was intended to slow down animal movement in order to limit the risk of spread of disease. The measure has been reviewed on a number of occasions and is applicable currently until 28 February 2002. The measure will be reviewed again before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as dealing operations are concerned, a number of exemptions to the 30 day rule are available to assist registered dealers in the con<Col N="393" /> duct of their business. These exemptions were extended recently and, subject to certain conditions, allow dealers to purchase cattle from marts and sell them privately within the 30 days and to purchase cattle privately and sell them onwards at a mart within the 30 day period.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the 30 day rule is a sensible and beneficial precautionary measure in the context of limiting the spread of disease and that the exemptions in place are sufficient to facilitate dealers in their ongoing business.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for this scheme also include provisions for an appeal valuation to be carried out by another member of the valuer panel and for referral to an arbitration panel in situations where the appeal valuation is not accepted by either the farmer or the Department.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs and Excise Service of their office has responsibility for customs clearance at Weston Aerodrome. The aerodrome is licensed and approved by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of flights to or from other member states <Col N="401" /> of the EU. Flights to and from EU destinations are permitted provided that: no third country (non-EU) goods are carried on board; no stores are carried on board; no passengers who have originated in a non-EU country and who have not been cleared at another EU airport are on board; no goods carried on board are being exported to a non-EU country; and customs intervention is not necessary for the purposes of enforcing a prohibition or restriction on importation or exportation.</P>
      <P>Save as permitted by the commissioners, flights to Weston from outside the EU must first clear customs at an international community airport; and flights from Weston to destinations outside the EU must depart via an international community airport. There are three international community airports in Ireland, Dublin, Shannon and Cork. Flights into Weston from places outside the EU are infrequent and prior permission must be obtained from customs in respect of these.</P>
      <P>The volume and type of business conducted at Weston &ndash; primarily national and EU flights &ndash; does not justify the deployment of a permanent Customs presence there. However, customs officers maintain close liaison with the airport management and visit Weston regularly as a check against the landing or exportation of prohibited goods, in particularly controlled drugs. This type of liaison is conducted under the customs drugs watch programme, a coastal and airfield reporting system that establishes confidential liaison between customs enforcement officers and relevant operators.</P>
      <P>By agreement with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, Customs will report to the Department and the Garda Síochána if they suspect any non-national of the EU &ndash; European Economic Area has entered the State at a licensed aerodrome.</P>

These maps will include details of historic flood events and will be developed by collecting and interpreting large volumes of data from a range of sources and transferring the results into geographical format.

      <P>Following completion of the historic mapping the intention would be to develop indicative flood maps. These would indicate the estimated extent of various flood events. The development of historic flood maps is a substantial project in itself, involving the collection and assimilation of vast amounts of data from a number of different sources. Substantial resources will be required for this project. As a first step it is intended to develop a pilot project based on a single local authority area. The results of this pilot can then be used to judge the feasibility of a nationwide project.</P>

      <P>Income tax relief in respect of service charges paid to local authorities or to private contractors was first introduced in 1995. Such relief is currently available in respect of domestic waste charges paid to local authorities and to private refuse collectors subject to a ceiling of &euro;195. Under the provisions of section 477 Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, individuals who pay their refuse charges to private contractors or who have to purchase &ldquo;tags&rdquo; for domestic refuse collection are entitled to income tax relief of &euro;195 per annum &ndash; irrespective of the amount actually paid. The relief is available at the standard rate of tax in respect of charges paid in the financial year &ndash; 1 January to 31 December &ndash; immediately preceding the year of assessment in which the claim is being made, provided the charges have been paid in full and on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In The Finance Bill, 2002, published on 7 February 2002, I have proposed to abolish the limit on the amount an individual may claim in respect of charges paid to either a local authority or a private collector.

An indi<Col N="403" /> vidual may claim either the amount paid to a local authority or private collector, or the &ldquo;tag&rdquo; system limit. The relief can be claimed retrospectively, based on the levels of relief appropriate to the year in question and subject to the normal statutory time limits of ten years for making claims for repayment contained in the income tax legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no income tax relief available to individuals in respect of payments made by them to crèches. However, since 6 April 1999, there is an exemption to the usual benefit-in-kind provisions for employees who enjoy free or subsidised child care facilities provided by their employers. The benefit-in-kind exemption applies whether the employer provides the facilities &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; or in a premises made available by the employer in another location which suits the employer and employees. The exemption also applies if an employer provides child care facilities jointly with others, for example with other employers, or with a voluntary body. In such circumstances, the employer must be wholly or partly responsible for both financing and managing the child care facility.</P>
      <P>However, the employer may opt not to be involved in the management of the child care service. To cater for such circumstances, I amended the benefit-in-kind exemption last year so that it covers situations where the employer provides financial support for items of capital expenditure and equipment but not other costs incurred by the employer. This provision was introduced to make the scheme more attractive to the many employers who did not want to be involved in the management of the facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, capital allowances are available for capital expenditure on the construction, exten<Col N="404" /> sion and refurbishment of a building, or part of a building or the conversion of an existing building which is used for the purpose of providing a pre-school service, day care or other child care facility. The premises must not include any part of a building in use as, or as part of, a dwelling. Aside from these tax incentives, the Government consulted widely and ultimately considered a universal child benefit system to be the most equitable approach to this issue. In this regard, the improvements in child benefit which I introduced in the past two budgets are part of a three year programme which will see an additional &euro;1.27 billion invested in child related payments.</P>

Such contractors are required to register for VAT provided they make supplies over &euro;25,500. When registered they can recover input VAT incurred in respect of the provision of such activities.</P>
      <P>State and local authorities are regarded in general as non-taxable bodies for the purposes of EU and national VAT law. This means that they do not recover VAT on their inputs but are not required to charge VAT on any services they provide, even where they charge a fee for such services. Under EU VAT law, the question of treating state or local authorities as taxable persons would only arise in circumstances where they were engaged in activities in which their treatment as non-taxable persons would lead to significant distortions of competition. Evidence would be needed that such circumstances arise before a change in Irish VAT law could be considered justified.</P>
      <P>I am aware that concerns have been raised in this area by representatives of private waste contractors. If such a distortion of competition were proven and VAT law amended it would involve imposing VAT at 12.5% on all households and businesses who pay waste charges and whose waste is collected by a local authority.</P>

      <Quest>his Department's estimate of the tax, interest and penalties foregone as a result of the tax amnesty of 1988 and the tax amnesty of 1993; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4198/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1988 amnesty provided for the waiver of interest and penalties but outstanding tax had to be paid in full. There was, accordingly, no loss of tax as a result of the 1988 amnesty. While the waiver of interest and penalties does imply a loss to the Exchequer, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that an estimate is not available and that in fact it is not possible to quantify the real loss because interest and penalties would have had to be pursued on a case by case basis and the amounts involved would depend on the age of the debt and the other circumstances applying. However, I am advised by Revenue that the overall amount foregone would not have been significant and that any such loss in interest and penalties was more than outweighed by the significant payments of outstanding arrears under the amnesty &ndash; some &euro;620 million, £490 million &ndash; payment of which freed up Revenue staff to pursue outstanding liabilities in other cases.</P>
      <P>The 1993 amnesty provided for two separate amnesty schemes: an incentive amnesty under which, subject to compliance with specified conditions, certain liabilities to income tax and capital gains tax, together with interest and penalties, could be discharged by payment of 15% of the underlying income or gains on a confidential basis to the chief special collector; and a general amnesty under which other tax arrears had to be paid in full with remission only for interest and penalties. Some &euro;96.5 million, £76 million, was paid under the 1993 general amnesty. In so far as the foregoing of interest and penalties is concerned, the situation is similar to the 1988 amnesty.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 1993 incentive amnesty, I am advised that, as at end 2001, Revenue had discharged &euro;56.06 million, £44.15 million, that was on its records in relation to some 8,204 taxpayers who availed of the incentive amnesty and who produced the relevant forms of evidence to Revenue. Revenue estimates that, taking account of payments that would have been made to the chief special collector in these cases, the tax loss in these cases would be some &euro;38 million, £30 million. Possible interest and penalties foregone would add a small amount to this figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall amount collected under the Incentive amnesty was &euro;235.4 million, £185.4 million, from some 38,400 individuals, including 8,204 taxpayers mentioned earlier. It is clear, therefore, that the bulk of incentive amnesty payments related to undeclared income and gains not reflected on Revenue's books. Because of the confidential nature of the amnesty it is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy the amount of tax foregone in the case of these individuals. Varying rates <Col N="406" /> of tax applied in the years covered by the amnesty and one cannot know the rates of tax applicable in the case of those who availed of the amnesty. However, if one were to assume an average marginal rate of 50% over the years the amnesty payments could have accounted for tax liabilities not reflected on Revenue's books of the order of &euro;762 million, £600 million. It is unlikely that tax &ndash; or interest and penalties &ndash; would have been recovered in many of these cases. Overall, therefore, the amount collected under the incentive amnesty outweighed any potential tax &ndash; and interest and penalties &ndash; foregone.</P>

      <Quest>if he will discuss with his colleagues in the Council of Ministers, the problem whereby a person seeking to send a cheque from one eurozone country to another incurs greater charges than they do when undertaking a similar transaction in their own country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of affordable methods of cross-border payment has recently been addressed at European level. An EU regulation on cross-border transfers, agreed by the Council of Ministers and by the European Parliament last December, has established the principle that charges levied by an institution in respect of cross-border consumer payments in euro will be the same as the charges levied by the same institution for corresponding domestic payments. Although this regulation does not apply to cheques, it will ensure that costs of other convenient methods of cross-border payments are reduced. To be specific, the regulation provides that: with effect from 1 July 2002, charges for electronic payments in euro, such as cash withdrawals using an ATM card or card payments, shall be the same at both the domestic and cross-border level; and with effect from 1 July 2003, there shall be a similar equalisation of charges at domestic and cross-border level <Col N="408" /> in the case of other transfers such as credit transfers.</P>
      <P>The regulation will initially apply to cross-border payments in euro up to &euro;12,500 and from 1 January 2006, this limit will be increased to &euro;50,000. I should point out that the volume of cross-border payments is relatively small; they represent only about 1% of all non cash transactions.</P>
      <P>As far as cheques are concerned, there is no central cheque clearing system within the euro area. Moreover these are not a popular means of payment in many eurozone countries. Cheques accordingly entail higher processing costs. For these reasons a person receiving a cross border cheque will likely incur greater charges than they do when doing a similar transaction in their own country. Electronic based transactions have become increasingly popular with consumers and businesses alike. Paper based transactions, such as cheques, have declined accordingly and this decline is expected to continue in the future.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, an employee in receipt of a preferential loan is charged income tax on the difference between the interest actually paid and the amount which would have been payable at the &ldquo;specified&rdquo; rate of interest for home loans. It has been the practice to review these specified rates before each budget to reflect the interest rates generally available in the marketplace at that time. The specified rates are usually adjusted in 0.5% increments. Having regard to the prevailing interest rates at the end of last year, I announced in budget 2002 that the specified rate for home loans would be reduced from 6% to 5%. The relevant provision has been included in Finance Bill 2002.</P>

      <Quest>if he will revise the Finance Act, 2001, to allow capital gains tax treatment to stock options rather than benefit-in-kind; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general situation is that the gain arising from shares acquired as a result of employee share options is chargeable partly to income tax &ndash; on the difference between the price paid for the shares and the market value at date of exercise of the option; and partly to capital gains tax &ndash; on the difference between the market value at the date of exercise and the proceeds received on any subsequent sale of the shares. The case had been made to me that the gain from such shares was more in the nature of a capital receipt than income and should, therefore, be chargeable to capital gains tax only. It was argued this treatment would help companies recruit and reward highly skilled and internationally mobile staff as well as facilitating participation by all employees in the fortunes of the company they work for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" />Accordingly, last year I introduced an amended tax treatment of share options that provided for favourable tax treatment whereby, on disposal, the gain from shares acquired as a result of employee share options would be chargeable to capital gains tax only, providing certain conditions were satisfied. This was done following extensive and prolonged consultation with representative bodies and relevant state agencies.</P>
    <P>To receive approval from the Revenue Commissioners for such favourable tax treatment, a share option scheme must be open to all employees and must provide that employees be eligible to participate on similar terms. There is a key employee provision, whereby options can be granted without similar terms conditions; no more than 30% of the total number of shares over which rights are granted in any year can be used for the key employee element and employees cannot participate in both elements of the scheme in the same year. These &ldquo;all employee-similar terms&rdquo; rules are a feature of the other tax relieved employee share schemes &ndash; approved profit sharing schemes, employee share ownership plans and save as you earn schemes. There is also a minimum retention period of three years between the time the option is granted and the time the shares may be sold by the employee. As with all tax reliefs, I will continue to monitor it to ascertain that it is fulfilling the aims for which it was introduced.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy is concerned about a situation where the value of the shares held is less than the tax liability which arises on exercise of the option. This tax liability arises, at that stage, because the taxpayer has been given a benefit by their employer equal to the difference between the market value of the shares at exercise and the price the employee paid when exercising. The taxpayer is then the owner of the shares and has the choice of selling or retaining them. The difficulties referred to by the Deputy arise not because of an unusual or anomalous application of tax law, but wholly as a result of the holding of shares in a declining equity market. Equity investment is a risky business and the Exchequer cannot be expected to underwrite the negative impact on taxpayers of such capital losses.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should point out that provisions in Finance Act, 2000 &ndash; section 128A of the TCA 1997 &ndash; allows the deferral of payment of the income tax charge, where an option is exercised on or after 6 April 2000, for a period of seven years or until the shares are sold, whichever is the earlier. Clearly this deferral option is not available where the shares are sold. Where the deferral option is used, it is possible that shares may increase in value in the future. If an individual is not in a position to pay the tax charge it would be open to that individual to seek to negotiate with the Revenue Commissioners to pay the tax charge by instalment. There are no fixed rules in relation to instalment payments; however, I <Col N="412" /> understand that Revenue will agree instalment schemes in hardship cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220, 238 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children under two years of age against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme, parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI. General practitioners are aware of the contra-indications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>
      <P>The MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this programme. On the basis of currently available information, there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines. Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time and be at greater risk of contracting the diseases concerned. There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines.</P>
      <P>I am aware from media reports that a private clinic is planning to offer single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. However, I have no information about this clinic or the vaccines it proposes to offer. The MMR vaccine is licensed by the Irish Medicines Board which is responsible for monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international consensus is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published medical evidence did not support a causal link between MMR and autism. The institutions involved include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, the World Health Organisation, the CDC USA, the American Academy of Paediatrics, UK professional organisations &ndash; the RCGP, the Royal College of Paediatrics, the Faculty of Public Health Medicine, the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Most recently, the United States Institute of Medicine also concluded that there was no link between the vaccine <Col N="415" /> and autism-inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that observations made regarding the onset of autism following the administration of the MMR vaccine do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest that the vaccine is the cause. It has also indicated that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of the vaccine. The WHO strongly endorses the use of the MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the RCPI.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children in its report on childhood immunisation, which was published in July 2001, concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>The most recent MMR uptake figure &ndash; for the third quarter of 2001 &ndash; shows that the national MMR uptake rate in children at 24 months has declined to 70%. This falls considerably short of the target figure of 95% uptake which is necessary to generate &ldquo;herd immunity&rdquo;. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and more than 1,500 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake. Measles is a highly infectious disease and is not a trivial illness. Approximately one in 15 children with measles suffers serious complications. These include pneumonia, ear infection and, less commonly, inflammation of the brain &ndash; encephalitis &ndash; myocarditis and SSPE, which may result in permanent brain damage usually occurring many years after infection.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. My Department has recently received this report and is currently examining its recommendations.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in Dublin 12 is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;541,000 in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.498 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative: two consultant orthodontists, five specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and <Col N="417" /> two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; a six surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open and the treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; and three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards. Furthermore, under this initiative my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that the number of patients awaiting orthodontic treatment fell by 1,613 between June and December 2001. They have also informed me that there was a reduction of 1,133 patients awaiting assessment for the same period.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, was introduced by way of circular 24/73 and is administered by the health boards on my behalf. DCA is paid in respect of eligible children from the date <Col N="418" /> of application up to the age of 16 years whose disability is so severe that they require constant care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained on a full time basis in special-residential institutions. However, the allowance may be paid on a <i>pro rata</i> basis for the number of nights spent at home, for example, weekends or holidays, by eligible children who attend special-residential institutions. The current rate of payment is &euro;179.80 per month from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be under 16 years of age; the disability must be present at the time of the application and be likely to persist for at least a year; and the disability must be so severe that they require from another person constant care or supervision, that is, continual or continuous care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the circular points out, <i>inter alia</i>, that:</P>
      <P>The fact that a severe handicap is present does not automatically justify the payment of an allowance . . . It is not intended that the Scheme should apply to short-term illnesses or disabilities &ndash; the handicap must be present at the time of application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date, and be likely to continue for at least one year. It is not visualised that any particular condition should be debarred from consideration &ndash; each case can be considered on its merits . . .</P>
      <P>The constant care or supervision must be provided by the parents themselves or by arrangement by them with another person or persons.</P>
      <P>Only the means of the child should be taken into account in determining eligibility for an allowance &ndash; the means of the parents should not be considered. Means in this context include payments of compensation, following a court action or otherwise, in respect of injuries or disabilities sustained.</P>
      <P>The assessment of entitlement to DCA in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. If the Deputy is aware of any particular case in the Midland Health Board that may require examination, please forward the details to me and I will ask the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>As the provision of services at Mallow General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance, my Department has asked the chief executive officer at the board to deal with the specific points raised and to reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been some difficulties in relation to radiology services at Mallow General Hospital. The Southern Health Board is addressing the deficit in radiology services created by the retirement of a permanent consultant radiologist at the hospital. I understand the board has a temporary consultant radiologist in place since mid October 2001 providing 7.5 sessions per week. Radiology services have been augmented by the recruitment of another temporary consultant radiologist from the end of January 2002 which should result in much improved radiology services at the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study, which took account of requirements arising in relation to the learning disability sector, was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.</P>
      <P>An interagency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the interagency working group.</P>
      <P>The numbers of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists &ndash; wholetime equivalents &ndash; employed in the health services for the years 1997 to 2000 are detailed as follows.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for ophthalmology services. During the period September 2000 to September 2001 the number of adults waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 17%. The number of adults on public hospital waiting lists for ophthalmology services in September 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was 2,978. This figure represents a decrease of 8% on the comparable figure for September 2000. Dedicated funding of &euro;138.5 million was made available to health agencies between 1997 and 2001 to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and a further &euro;43.8 million is available under the waiting list initiative for 2002.</P>
      <P>The new Health Strategy which I launched recently, includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients, either from private hospitals in Ireland or, if necessary, from abroad.</P>
      <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients <Col N="425" /> and a national hospitals agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>The provision of counselling and support services for women who have had an ectopic pregnancy is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA and the health boards. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the ERHA and the chief executive officers of the health boards to advise the Deputy of the existing services available in this area and of any proposed developments at regional level.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit does not propose, at present, to carry out a national awareness raising campaign or to produce literature on ectopic pregnancy, as suggested by the Deputy. However, the situation will be kept under review. I am not aware of the existence of a trust or organisation in Ireland that deals specifically with the issue of ectopic pregnancy. However, I understand that the Miscarriage Association of Ireland, as part of its core services, provides support, help and information for women and their families who have suffered an ectopic pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Statistical information on the number of women who have had this type of pregnancy and their age profile is being collated by my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Infant formulae contain protein from either cows' milk or soybean. There are no cows' milk proteins that have been genetically modified. Soya infant formulae are designed for babies with an intolerance to cows' milk and contain soybean-derived material. Ireland imports all of its soybean products and, due to the growing of GM soybeans in many soybean producing countries, the presence of GM soybeans among non-GM soybeans is a possibility.</P>
      <P>Only GM ingredients that have been authorised by the EU can be marketed in member states. In the case of soya, only one variety of soybean called Roundup Ready is authorised for use in food. Specific labelling applies to food and food ingredients with a GM content. The result is that a food or a food ingredient, for example, soya, having a GM content greater than 1% must be labelled to indicate that it contains, or is made from a GMO. When an ingredient has a GM content of 1% or less then the operator must be able to show that the food was obtained from a non-GM source so that the GM presence is then considered as an unavoidable contaminant.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the competent authority in Ireland charged with enforcing the novel foods regulations under which GM foods currently fall. The FSAI carries out surveys of the Irish food supply to satisfy itself that regulations governing the sale in Ireland of GM foods are adhered to. In a recent survey of soya-based foods, including infant formulae, the FSAI analysed the three leading brands of soya infant formulae and found that they contained GM soya which are at EU authorised levels significantly below the 1% that triggers mandatory GM labelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's query on the regulation of the sale of all GM foods, there are three main pieces of legislation relevant to this issue. <Col N="427" /> First, Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients came into force in all member states on May 15 1997. This regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients &ndash; including genetically modified food &ndash; must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved/authorised before being placed on the European market. It also contains provisions in certain instances for the labelling of novel foods and novel food ingredients.</P>
    <P>Foods and food ingredients which fall within the scope of this regulation are those which have not, as of May 15 1997, been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which fall into the following categories: foods which contain genetically modified organisms, GMOs; foods which are produced from but do not contain GMOs; food and food ingredients with an intentionally modified molecular structure; foods composed of micro-organisms, fungi or algae; foods produced from plants or animals not using traditional propagation techniques; and foods which are produced from new technologies which give rise to significant changes in the composition or structure of the food.</P>
    <P>The regulation states that there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property &ndash; for example, composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food) which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. There must also be specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of: material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population &ndash; for example, a protein from a known food allergen source such as peanuts; material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns &ndash; for example, a gene of porcine origin in a plant; or an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification &ndash; for example, a genetically engineered tomato.</P>
    <P>The second item of legislation is Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000 of 10 January 2000. The labelling and other provisions of the novel foods regulation as outlined above do not apply to foods or food ingredients which were used for human consumption to a significant degree within the EU before the entry into force of the regulation and, therefore, not considered to be novel.</P>
    <P>Regulation 1139/98 applies to foods and food ingredients which are produced, in whole or in <Col N="428" /> part, from a genetically modified soya bean manufactured by Monsanto and a genetically modified maize manufactured by Novartis. These products were authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. This directive is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This regulation lays down additional labelling requirements for the products outlined above. Such labelling ensures that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff, then that foodstuff is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified soya&rdquo; or &ldquo;produced from genetically modified maize&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients.</P>
    <P>Commission Regulation (EC) No. 49/2000 of 10 January 2000 amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms sets a <i>de minimis</i> threshold level for adventitious contamination at 1% &ndash; of each ingredient individually considered. It came into effect on 10 April 2000. The rationale for such a threshold is to avoid a situation whereby foods and food ingredients would have to be labelled in cases in which, despite not being from GMO origin, small proportions of modified DNA or protein would be present due to &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; contamination of conventional soya or maize with GM soya or maize. Adventitious contamination can potentially occur at many stages of the production chain, from the field &ndash; pollen &ndash; through transport and storage to food processing. At a level below this 1%, products not of GMO origin but containing small proportions of genetically modified DNA or protein due to adventitious contamination, will not be subject to the additional labelling requirements as outlined above.</P>
    <P>The third item of legislation is Commission Regulation (EC) No. 50/2000 of 10 January 2000 on the labelling of foodstuffs and food ingredients containing additives and flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced from genetically modified organisms. Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 &ndash; the novel foods regulation &ndash; and Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 do not apply to additives and flavourings intended to be used in foodstuffs. The Commission, in consultation with member states, agreed that it was important that consumers should be informed of the use of additives or flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced through genetic engineering as they are already informed of the presence of other ingredients containing or produced from genetically modified organisms. Dis<Col N="429" /> cussions culminated in Regulation 50/2000/EC which came into effect on 10 April 2000.</P>
    <P>If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a food additive or flavouring, then that food additive or flavouring is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified .&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients. I am advised that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is satisfied that, based on current scientific opinion, GM ingredients authorised within the EU are safe for human consumption.</P>

      <P>My Department had previously been working to resolve this problem by way of a limited <i>ad hoc</i> repayment scheme covering the months from July <Col N="430" /> to September. However, following consultations with the relevant section in the Department, it became apparent that this issue could not be dealt with on any kind of <i>ex gratia</i>-limited basis as the people involved have a legal entitlement to have all such claims paid. Consequently, officials from my Department raised the issue at a meeting with the health board primary care managers and it is now proposed that all such claims be routed through the existing demand led payment mechanisms.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the implementation of improvements to be carried out in Portlaoise General Hospital is the statutory responsibility of the Midland Health Board in the first instance. A sum of &euro;634,869 was allocated in December 2000 for the development of symptomatic breast disease services in the Midland Health Board in line with the report of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum. Consultations on this matter between my Department and the board have been ongoing and my Department is currently awaiting proposals for the development of symptomatic breast disease services at Portlaoise General Hospital.</P>

      <P>The national policy of replacing 19th century mental hospital accommodation by acute assessment and treatment units in general hospitals and, for less acute illness, high-class community residential premises is moving ahead steadily. There are now 20 general hospital psychiatric units replacing Victorian admission units and several others are under construction and shortly to open. In relation to community residences, there are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country providing over 3,000 places and there are just under 200 day hospitals and day centres operating in Irish mental health services providing a total of just under 4,000 places.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to St. Loman's Hospital, Palmerstown. This hospital has now been largely closed with only 20 long-stay patients remaining in the hospital in one ward. I understand that this ward is due to close within three months and the patients therein will be transferred to temporary accommodation being provided on the St. Loman's campus, pending the construction of another replacement unit for their rehabilitation. This is to allow demolition of the existing St. Loman's buildings and their replacement by a number of up-to-date modern units for rehabilitation purposes as well as other health care needs.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by <Col N="434" /> participants on community employment are being mainstreamed. This process has already commenced in the case of CE services in schools.</P>
      <P>A FÁS audit of services currently provided under CE has identified in the region of 2,000 places in the area of health and personal social service, including services for people with disabilities, suitable for mainstreaming. My Department supports the mainstreaming of these services in view of its potential to create more permanent funding for the delivery of such services in the future. The allocation of funds to specific service providers will, thereafter, be a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.</P>
      <P>The modalities involved are being actively examined between my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, health boards and FÁS. It is intended that discussions will also be held with representatives from the major sponsor organisations to ensure that all the relevant issues are properly considered before the mainstreaming commences. I am confident that current discussions can be brought to an early and satisfactory conclusion to enable mainstreaming to commence at an early date.</P>

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines &ndash; ex manufacture &ndash; in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, FICI, which provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of reimbursable medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products. The current agreement has been extended to mid-2005.</P>
      <P>Under the general medical services scheme, pharmacists are reimbursed the trade price of the drug plus a dispensing fee. In the case of prescriptions reimbursed under the drug payment scheme, the cost reimbursed by the State covers the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost, normally 50% of the trade price, and a standard dispensing fee. My Department has no function in relation to the retail mark-up on private dispensing, which has been established by custom and practice over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" />In addition, persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. The cost reimbursed by the State covers the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost, normally 50% of the trade price, and a standard dispensing fee.</P>
    <P>Developments in biotechnology and therapeutics have given rise to the introduction of medicines for the treatment of medicinal conditions, many of which previously had either no effective treatment or required extended in-patient hospital care. Heretofore, these medicines were supplied in the main by hospitals or health boards. To improve service to persons who require these drugs, agreement was reached with community pharmacists on arrangements for the dispensing and use of these highly complex medicines. This arrangement, known as the high tech scheme, improves patient care and brings about greater control of these expensive and essential medicines. A capitation payment per patient per month is paid to community pharmacists in respect of this scheme.</P>

      <P>Approximately &euro;38.09 million, £30 million, in capital funding is being made available by this Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or foster care services. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 93. Included in this figure is the 24 place purpose built special care unit at Ballydowd in the eastern region which is being opened on a phased basis. An additional 41 places are due to become available by mid 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South-Western Area Health Board has operational responsibility for the Ballydowd special care unit which caters for young people with serious emotional and behavioural problems who are placed there by order of the High Court. <Col N="437" /> The board provides a wide range of therapy and specialist services in the centre as well as a comprehensive GP service and full-time education programme. The young people in question have very special needs and often their behaviour can be extreme and can include assaults on staff. This is not unusual given the emotional and behavioural difficulties the young people have. To address this the health board has an ongoing training programme for staff which assists them in managing these difficult situations. The health board also provides training for staff in child development and in working with young people who have experienced trauma.</P>
    <P>Due to the special care and attention that the current young people in the centre need and the problem of recruitment and retention of suitable staff it has not been possible so far to utilise the centre to its full capacity. I have been informed by the South-Western Area Health Board that interviews took place last week on foot of advertisements placed in English, Scottish and Welsh newspapers in a continuing effort to address this problem. A recruitment agency which specialises in the recruitment of child care workers has also been contracted to assist in the recruitment process.</P>
    <P>The social services inspectorate carried out an inspection on Ballydowd special care unit last July, which was very favourable in relation to the management and running of the centre and the quality of care provided to the young people. As it is a special care unit, it is due for annual inspection by the social services inspectorate in March of this year. The South-Western Area Health Board is also carrying out an independent review of the working of the unit and a report is expected shortly.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in the Donegal area is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the North-Western Health Board. My Department has made inquiries of the board concerning the issue raised and has been advised that, in response to the recommendations of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development, the board set up an island review group to conduct a comprehensive review of health needs and service provision for island communities. In 1999, the <Col N="439" /> review group recommended the provision of a small nursing unit &ndash; six to eight beds &ndash; for Aranmore. It was planned to develop the unit on the site of the existing health-day centre. Architects were engaged and draft plans were produced in consultation with committee members and representatives of the island community. However, difficulties arose and the architects suggested that the site was not suitable to accommodate the proposed development.</P>
      <P>The board subsequently made contact with the owner of the land adjacent to the health-day centre and purchased an additional .783 acres. Ongoing discussions are taking place with the local island community as to the type of accommodation required to meet the residential needs of the community.</P>

In this letter, the Deputy was advised that the applicant was assessed as being of high dependency, thus eligible for a subvention of £120 &ndash;&euro;152.37 &ndash; per week. Following an assessment of means and a review of the case, the applicant was deemed to qualify for a subvention of £10.27 &ndash;&euro;13.07 &ndash; per week. I am advised that this is the maximum the board can provide in this case. I am further advised by the board that the situation has not changed since this letter was issued.</P>

      <P>There has been an increase in recent years in the numbers of children being diagnosed with autism. Similar increases have also been experienced in other European countries and in the USA. The diagnosis of autism is a clinical one, that is, it is based on a variety of observations rather than a defined laboratory investigation. Hence the evolving concept of an autistic spectrum which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability. There is increasing recognition of autism in Ireland and in other countries. What is not clear however is whether the increase is due to a greater awareness leading to better ascertainment or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years, as part of the overall planning and development of services for persons with autism, the health boards have been obtaining additional information on the needs of this group in their regions, and in particular in relation to those who require or will require specialist services. My Department is working <Col N="441" /> with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to establish an information system which will provide accurate data on the numbers of persons with autism and their service needs.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the recent report of a study in the United States, as reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute on 6 February 2002. In this new and fairly small study, the authors concluded that people using tanning devices had 2.5 times the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer. Adjustment for history of sunburns, sunbathing and sun exposure did not affect the results.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that in general, the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer is related to total UV dose, so although this article does not give any data on dose, the risk will depend on the amount of use of sunbeds. There has been very little measurement of the extra amount that sunbeds contribute to lifelong UV exposure, however the assumption seems to be that a few hours on a sun bed does not significantly contribute to life time UV. Melanoma, on the other hand, is related to sunburn at younger ages and would only relate to the use of sun beds when such use had actually caused burning. The conclusion seems to be that sunbeds probably increase cancer risk in the same way that sun exposure does, but the precise amount depends on the length of exposure and whether or not burning took place.</P>
      <P>Existing consumer legislation sets standards for tanning equipment and requires appropriate warning notices to be displayed on the equipment. I am advised that no licence or medical training is required to operate one. I have no plans to introduce stricter controls in this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to use of sunbeds the advice from my Department is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances, exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by persons under 18 years of age, persons who burn easily or tan poorly, those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer, and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from tanning equipment and the appropriate precautions is available from the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" />Sunbeds are widely used in beauty salons by beauty therapists who offer cosmetic tanning as part of their services. Guidelines on the use of sunbeds by beauty therapists in beauty salons were drawn up by the Society of Applied Cosmetology which represents beauty therapists. These guidelines incorporate advice from the Irish Cancer Society on appropriate precautions to be taken by sunbed operators to protect the health of clients. The health promotion unit in my Department supports a range of initiatives organised by the Irish Cancer Society which impact on awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers including melanomas. A Sunsmart campaign is organised each year by the society to increase awareness of risk factors for skin cancer and to encourage people who are high risk to avoid excessive exposure to the sun and to avoid the use of sunbeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic care to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The chief executive officers have advised me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, the total number of patients on the waiting lists for orthodontic assessment or treatment was 32,767. This is a reduction of 2,746 in <Col N="443" /> comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter. The chief executive officers have also informed me there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards at the end of December 2001. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. My Department has asked the chief executive officers to expedite the assessment of the 20,877 patients currently on the assessment waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the structural measures that I have introduced in the orthodontic services begin to take effect. These include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.498 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative: two consultant orthodontists, five specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; a six-surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping <Col N="444" /> of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; and three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards. Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out of hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan, both of which are operational, and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>Target waiting times for the provision of orthodontic assessment or treatment cannot be addressed until the structural changes which I have set in train are in place and receive the co-operation of all the service providers. Nonetheless, as I have noted above, returns from the chief executive officers indicate that some progress is already being made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 to 279, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group.</P>
      <P>I am aware, in the context of work carried out by my Department along with health service employers and IMPACT on the Joint Review Group on Psychology Services in the health service, that shortages of psychology staff including clinical psychologists exist in the health service. The review group identified that a key factor was the inadequate number of post-graduate training places available.</P>
      <P>A workforce planning exercise carried out under the aegis of the review recommended the provision of approximately 30 additional post-graduate training places in psychology. Following a process initiated by my Department 30 additional places are now being provided from 2001 through the Psychological Society of Ireland's post-graduate diploma course.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of sufficient health and social care professionals proficient in the Irish language rests with the health boards. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of each health board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and a reply will issue to the Deputy from the Department as soon as possible.</P>

A person wishing to avail of the capital allowances and reliefs available must make a formal application in writing to the relevant local authority. If the local authority is satisfied that the park and ride facility and associated development, where relevant, conforms to the guidelines issued by my Department and also conforms with the relevant sections of the Finance Act, it may issue a certificate which will enable the developer to avail of the tax incentives.</P>
      <P>In August 1999, my Department issued local authorities with guidelines relating to the certification of qualifying park and ride facilities and residential development located at a park and ride facility. Guidelines on commercial development located at a park and ride facility were issued in July 2001. Copies of the guidelines are being made available to the Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the register of electors used at any poll should be as accurate as possible. The compilation and publication of the register is a matter for each registration authority in accordance with electoral law and involves the carrying out of house to house or other local inquiries and in many cases delivering registration forms to households for completion. The draft register is published on 1 November and is made available for examination at post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses and local authority offices up to 25 November. The public is invited, through national and local advertising campaigns, to check the draft during this period to make sure that they are correctly registered and to bring errors or omissions in the draft to the attention of the registration authority. The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force for a year on 15 February.</P>
      <P>The law in relation to registration procedures, including the provisions in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, concerning the introduction of an edited register for electors who do not want their details used for a purpose other than electoral or other statutory purpose, the production of a national register of electors, the preparation and maintenance of the register by a body other than a registration authority and the use of electoral lists, is under ongoing review in my Department.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of changes in recent years which have helped to improve accuracy. Most recently, the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, included new provisions to allow persons who have moved residence to another constituency during the currency of a register or who will reach 18 years old on or before polling day to apply for entry in the supplement. It also provided that persons who are unable to vote in their constituency because of their employment by a returning officer in another constituency on polling day will, in future, be eligible to apply for entry in the supplement to the postal voters list.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these and previous amendments to the electoral code will contribute towards a more accurate register but I will, nonetheless, continue to keep the administrative and legal arrangements for the compilation of the register of electors under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 290 together.</P>
      <P>Electoral law provides for postal voting by members of the gardaí, whole-time members of the Defence Forces, Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses, electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or disability, certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside and electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day. Full-time students registered at home, who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State, are also eligible to apply for a postal vote.</P>
      <P>In order to vote by post, an elector's name must be entered on the postal voters list which is prepared by the registration authority as part of the register of electors. An application by an elector for inclusion in the list to be published on 1 February as part of the register of electors must have been received by the registration authority by the previous 25 November. Electors, who are eligible for but not already included in the postal voters list, may apply for entry in a supplement to the list which is published prior to each poll. The latest date for receipt of applications by registration authorities for inclusion in the supplement to the list is not later than two days following the dissolution of the Dáil at a general election or not later than two days following the date of the order appointing polling day at a Presidential, European or local election or a referendum.</P>
      <P>An elector ordinarily resident in a hospital, nursing home or other similar institution who is unable to go in person to vote at their normal polling station by reason of a physical illness or disability may apply to be included in a special voters list. Such electors vote on a ballot paper delivered to them by a special presiding officer accompanied by a Garda. There are no proposals to extend the range of postal voter categories.</P>

This represents an increase of 10% over the 2001 baseline allocation and is some 75% higher than the corresponding allocation in 1997. I am confident that this level of allocation, together with income from local sources, is sufficient to meet the reasonable cost of local authority services.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for local authorities themselves to prioritise spending within their own budgets.

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the operation of section 55 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, in relation to the illegal dumping of waste; if adequate resources are available to the local authorities to effectively implement the provisions of the Act; and his further proposals in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>Section 55 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, empowers local authorities to require, by notice, specified measures to be taken in relation to the holding, recovery or disposal of waste in order to prevent or limit environmental pollution. Failure to comply with a notice under this section constitutes an offence and may be prosecuted accordingly.</P>
      <P>While I have no function in relation to the implementation by local authorities of this provision of the 1996 Act, I understand that the relevant powers are used generally by local authorities to require the cessation of unauthorised waste activity and, if necessary, the taking of measures to mitigate or remedy the effects of such activity. I am not aware of any general difficulties arising from the implementation of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that adequate resources are being made available to local authorities to implement the 1996 Act. In 2002, an amount of &euro;593 million in general purpose funding has been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund. Allocations for 2002 are on average more than 74% greater than the initial allocations for 1997, and represent an increase of about 10% on the baseline allocations provided for 2001. General <Col N="451" /> purpose grants from the local government fund are additional to specific grants for purposes such as roads, water services, etc., and supplement authorities' income from local sources such as commercial rates, waste charges and landfill gate fees. It is largely a matter for authorities themselves to decide how these general-purpose grants should be spent.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised that the introduction of the proposed landfill levy, which among other things will generate significant revenues for the Environment Fund, could give rise to perverse effects such as increased fly-tipping or dumping. Accordingly, I intend to direct a significant proportion of the revenues from the levy to support dedicated and measurable additional enforcement initiatives with regard to control of fly-tipping and unauthorised waste activities, and I have asked local authorities for proposals in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 292 and 318 together.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations, 2001, designate the Revenue Commissioners as the responsible authority for enforcing the collection of the 15 cent levy on plastic shopping bags which is due to take effect from 4 March 2002. In addition, the regulations impose a supplementary requirement on retailers to pass on the full amount of the levy to customers, and this regulatory provision will be enforced by local authorities. The relevant enforcement officers will have extensive powers to enter any retail premises, to conduct any searches or investigations considered necessary, and to inspect or remove any records, books and documents for the purposes of any proceedings in relation to the levy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners and the local authorities will have the necessary powers &ndash; equivalent to those available in respect of the implementation and enforcement of relevant taxation and other waste management measures &ndash; to ensure that the levy can be successfully applied and that any efforts to evade liability can be detected.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the regulations, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners gave careful consideration to the most effective way of collecting the levy while at the same time minimising the opportunity for evasion. My Department was also conscious of the need to ensure that the levy was passed directly on to customers in order to effect the change in consumer behaviour for which the levy was designed. It was considered that the optimum way to achieve these objectives was to impose the obligation to pay the levy on retailers. There are no plans to change this arrangement.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations, 2001, provide that the 15 cent levy on plastic bags which is due to take effect from 4 March 2002 will apply to all plastic bags suitable for use by customers at the point of sale in any shop, supermarket, service station or other sales <Col N="454" /> outlet, except plastic bags solely used to contain fresh meat, fish and poultry and plastic bags solely used to contain the products referred to, whether packaged or not, provided that such bags are not greater in dimension than 225 mm in width, exclusive of any gussets, by 345 mm in depth, inclusive of any gussets, by 450 mm in length, inclusive of any handles, and plastic bags solely used to contain non-packaged fruit, nuts or vegetables, confectionery, dairy products, cooked food, whether cold or hot, and ice provided that such bags are not greater than the dimensions referred to above.</P>
      <P>The above exemptions will only apply where bags are used for the purposes referred to. If other products are placed in these bags, then the retailer must charge the levy to the consumer. The regulations further provide that plastic bags designed for reuse, and which are sold to customers for a sum of not less than 70 cent each, will also be exempted from the levy. The micron weight of plastic bags is not a factor in determining whether or not particular plastic bags are to be exempt from the levy.</P>

      <P>Following a period of public consultation, a public local inquiry was held into the N24 Piltown-Fiddown by-pass scheme on 22 July 1997. Having considered the report of the inspector who carried out the inquiry, I confirmed the relevant compulsory purchase order and approved the relevant environmental impact statement on 15 June 1998. The role of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in determining the CPO and EIS, which has since been transferred to An Bord Pleanála, was of a quasi-judicial nature and my consideration was necessarily confined to objections received and the inspector's report. I am not aware of any contacts by the Ombudsman with my Department in connection with the CPO and EIS.</P>
      <P>Under Section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993, the National Roads Authority has a duty to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads and, for that purpose, it has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. The improvement works being undertaken on the Piltown-Fiddown bypass are a matter for the NRA and the local authority concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. The need to increase the wearing rate of seat belts has been identified as one of the four key priority areas in the strategy.</P>
      <P>The third progress report on the strategy shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. The level of roads deaths reduced by 13.3% between 1997 and 2001, and serious injuries decreased in the 1997-2000 period by almost 25% relative to a reduction target of 20% by end 2002.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council has been mandated with the role of road safety promotion, education and advertising. Its hard-hitting advertising campaign called DAMAGE is aimed at increasing the wearing rates of seatbelts in the front and rear of vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish regulations, subject to certain limited exceptional exemptions, require that the driver <Col N="457" /> and each passenger occupying a forward facing front seat of a car must wear a safety belt or an appropriate child restraint, where fitted.</P>
    <P>Current wearing rates in Ireland, at an estimated 55%, may save as many as 40 lives each year. The Government strategy sets a target of 85% wearing rates for front and rear seat belts which when achieved could result in saving an additional 30 lives each year. Measures in support of this target include the extension of the on-the-spot fines for failure to wear a seat belt and the operation of a penalty point system.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of the Road Traffic Bill, 2001, is to promote new legislative provisions that will further enhance road safety. Given the priority accorded to the wearing of seat-belts in the Government strategy on road safety, the Bill provides that a number of offences resulting from the laws pertaining to seat belts will attract penalty points.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

      <P>A person who holds a driving licence issued by a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area is permitted to drive in Ireland for so long as that licence remains valid. Where such a person has taken up normal residence in Ireland, he or she may alternatively exchange the licence for an Irish driving licence without taking a driving test.</P>
      <P>In addition, Australia, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, South Africa and South Korea are recognised states for the purpose of driving licence exchange under the terms of Article 30(7) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999. Under these regulations, persons holding a valid driving licence from a recognised state may exchange their licences for Irish driving licences where they take up residence here, without the need for a driving test. Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with Zimbabwe for the exchange of driving licences.</P>
      <P>Temporary visitors to Ireland who hold a national driving licence or an international driving permit may drive here for the duration of their visit up to a maximum period of 12 months. Persons taking up Irish residence must, however, either avail of the arrangements described above, where applicable, or begin the process of obtaining an Irish driving licence.</P>

    <P>The most comprehensive data on waste arisings are contained in the national waste database reports for 1995 and 1998 published by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA <Col N="463" /> estimated that some 2.056 million tonnes of municipal waste was generated in Ireland in 1998, compared to a best estimate of 1,848 million tonnes in 1995. On this basis, it is estimated that <i>per capita</i> municipal waste arisings increased from 0.52 tonnes in 1995 to 0.56 tonnes in 1998.</P>

      <P>A detailed examination of the issues which arise in relation to the sale of local authority flats, carried out some years ago in consultation with local authorities, concluded that no adequate arrangements could be made which would be satisfactory to tenant purchasers, local authorities or the other tenants in a flat complex who did not wish to purchase. The main difficulties involved were, apart from any legal issues, the level of management charges necessary, public liability insurance issues and the future saleability of purchased flats.</P>
      <P>However, in the light of the increased activity in the sale of private sector apartments in recent years and following consultation with my Department, I understand that Dublin City Council are in the process of engaging consultants to advise them on a scheme for the sale of local authority flats to tenants.

      <P>As outlined in the Government legislation programme published on 29 January last, I intend to bring forward a number of Bills over the coming months. The Pensions Bill, published on 27 July 2001, is currently before Seanad Éireann. This Bill deals with the regulation of occupational pensions and the legislative framework for the implementation of recommendations contained in the Pension Board's report, Securing Retirement Income. It is expected that the Bill will be passed by the Seanad by end February and then considered by the Dáil with a view to its enactment before the Easter recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" />The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, will be published very shortly. It will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the implementation of certain social welfare improvements announced in the Budget Statement of 5 December 2001 such as increases in the monthly rates of child benefit and increases in the respite care grant and improvements in the schemes of disability and unemployment benefits and pre-retirement allowance. The Bill will also provide for amendment of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts to facilitate the implementation of a new computerised system of registration of births and deaths pending the enactment of a comprehensive Civil Registration Bill later this year. In addition, it will include a number of amendments to the Combat Poverty Agency Act, the Health Contribution Act and the Charities Acts. The Civil Registration Bill will provide for reform of the existing births, marriages and deaths registration legislation, and underpin the modernisation of the Civil Registration Service. The Bill is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel's Office and it is my intention to have the Bill published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill will provide the legislative framework for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service established under the auspices of my Department in response to problems of moneylending and overindebtedness. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for a firm statutory basis for the service and to secure its continuity into the future. The drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to publish the Bill before the Easter recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 324, 333 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>The Job Initiative Programme &ndash; JI &ndash; is administered by FÁS, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This scheme is designed to provide full time employment for three years to long-term unemployed persons and lone parents. Payment rates are based on the going rate of pay for the job and there are no additional payments for spouse or children. JI participants are eligible to avail of family income supplement.</P>
      <P>Similarly, employees taken on under the Jobstart scheme, which was phased out by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment over 2000/2001, were eligible to claim family income supplement. Under this scheme, &euro;101.58 per week subsidy was paid to employers offering full-time jobs to long-term unemployed people, for one year.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the community employment, CE, scheme, on the other hand, is to provide part-time employment to assist unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, to re-enter the labour market. The Deputy will be aware that participation levels on CE are gradually being reduced, reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. CE participants receive payments which are in excess of their entitlements under the social welfare system. In addition, the rate is adjusted based on the number of dependants in the household. For example, a CE participant with an adult dependant and two child dependants receives &euro;255.50 per week, as compared with an entitlement under long-term unemployment assistance of &euro;231.20. CE participants are also free to supplement their payments through earnings from work outside of their working hours on the programme.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the family income supplement, FIS, scheme is to create an incentive for full-time workers with families, who are in low paid employment, to remain at work. Extension of FIS to CE participants would not be consistent with these policy objectives. Although FIS is not available to lone parents working on community employment schemes, there is additional income support available under the one parent family payment, OPFP, scheme. Because of the earnings disregards associated with the OPFP, recipients can earn up to &euro;146.50 per week and still qualify for a full rate OPFP. Those who earn between &euro;146.50 and &euro;293.00 per week may still qualify for a reduced payment.</P>

      <Quest>his proposals to allow old age pensioners, who qualify for a reduced rate of contributory old age pension and also qualify for an old age pension based on social welfare contributions that are pre-1953, to aggregate both these pensions up to the maximum rate of old age contributory pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the widest possible coverage for old age contributory pension. The special flat-rate pension based on pre-1953 social insurance contributions is designed to benefit people who would not otherwise receive a pension, though some people who were already receiving pensions based on mixed insurance, at less than 50% of the maximum rate, have also benefited by transferring to this special pension.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that a person be allowed combine a special pre-1953 pension with a reduced payment being received under normal qualifying conditions would not be in keeping with the overall objective of the pre-1953 pension which, as already indicated, is to benefit those who would not otherwise receive a payment. Also it would not be in keeping with overall policy in the social welfare payments area which, in most cases, does not allow for the making of more than one income support payment to an individual at the same time. In the circumstances, changes along the lines suggested would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must satisfy a number of basic conditions, one of which is that they must have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the date of entry into social insurance, if later. A yearly average of 48 contributions is required for a full rate pension with reduced pensions payable for those with yearly averages of between ten and 47 contributions. In the case of retirement pension a yearly average of 24 contributions is required for a minimum pension.</P>
      <P>The yearly average is calculated by dividing the number of contributions recorded over the period from the start of the year of entry into insurance up to the end of the last full contribution year before reaching pension age by the number of contribution years in this period. The alignment of the contribution year with the calendar year does mean that those born between the dates in question will have their contribution record for pension purposes averaged over an additional year.</P>
      <P>However, those who made contributions in the transitional year from April 2001 to December 2001 will receive an additional 14 contributions to take account of the shortened contribution year. The operation of the new arrangements will be monitored with a view to identifying any problems which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the longer term the possibility of changing the basis of assessment for pensions from average contributions to a system based on total contributions paid or credited is being considered as part of the second phase review of the qualifying <Col N="472" /> conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. I expect to publish this report shortly.</P>

      <P>To be entitled to unemployment assistance a person must satisfy a means test and demonstrate that he or she is capable of, available for and genuinely seeking, but unable to obtain, suitable employment. Decisions regarding entitlement to unemployment assistance are made by a deciding officer. Deciding officers are statutorily appointed under section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and are independent in the execution of their function. Each decision is made on the particular merits of the case, having regard to the information supplied by the claimant and, where appropriate, the report of the social welfare inspector. Inspectors operate under a strict code of practice which sets out the manner in which they are required to deal with the public. They are instructed to take account of individual rights and entitlements while carrying out inquiries and investigations, to exercise their powers with courtesy and discernment and not to exceed those powers. Claimants are required to furnish the inspector with any information and &ndash;  or documentation deemed relevant to the claim. Inspectors, having examined the information and supporting documentation, will, if necessary, seek further clarification of any gaps and inconsistencies identified. Claimants are provided with an opportunity to respond and furnish further supporting evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the claim process, the claimant is advised of any statement or allegation that affects the claim, of which he or she may be unaware and upon which a discontinuance of payment or unfavourable decision may be based. This is done to provide the claimant with an opportunity to comment before the claim is referred for formal decision, in accordance with the principles of natural justice that entitle a person to know the source and content of any evidence in his or her case. Having made a decision on a claim, the deciding officer advises the claimant of the means <Col N="474" /> assessed and the rate awarded. Where the claim is disallowed or payment is disqualified, the claimant is notified in writing of the decision, together with reasons for the disallowance or disqualification, and advised that the decision may be reviewed in the light of any new evidence the claimant may adduce, or may be appealed to the independent social welfare appeals office. I am satisfied that this process fully safeguards the rights of the individual in that claims are investigated and decided fairly and independently; there are adequate provisions built into the process to ensure that claimants are made fully aware of all the information on which the decision was based; reasons are given for the decision; and there is a right of review or appeal as appropriate.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued expeditiously, having regard to the eligibility conditions which must be satisfied. Where the deceased person had been in receipt of a social welfare payment, the surviving spouse is entitled to receive that payment for a six weeks period after the death of their spouse. In these cases, entitlement to widow or widower's pension commences from the seventh week. This provision insures continuity of payment in the period following the death of the spouse. A bereavement grant of &euro;635, £500, is also payable in these circumstances. This payment is issued automatically by cheque to the survivor on contributory based schemes, once the death is notified. A widowed parent grant is also issued automatically where there are dependent children and it is currently paid at the rate of &euro;2,500, £1,969.</P>
      <P>Where the widowed person was the spouse of a recipient of retirement or old age contributory pension, the legislation provides for an automatic entitlement to widow or widower's contributory pension. Once information of the death is received in these cases, arrangements are made to put widow's contributory pension into payment. In all cases, claims by widowed persons are dealt with promptly as soon as all the information needed to decide the entitlement is available. In the case of some 80% of applications, it is possible to complete the process in five weeks. In others, where problems arise in establishing the relevant insurance record, involving older records which extend to 1936 and are not computerised, or in establishing the applicant's means for entitlement to a non-contributory pension, it may take a little longer. In these cases, however, the overriding consideration is to ensure that no avenue to establish entitlement is left unexplored.</P>
      <P>Given that each claim, which is not covered by the arrangements for automatic payment, has to be considered for entitlement under the various statutory qualifying criteria, I am satisfied that there is no undue delay on the part of my Department in processing widowed persons' claims. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind I will be happy to have this examined on receipt of the details. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The timetable for legislation in areas under my remit is as set out in the Government legislative programme for the spring session, which was published on 29 January last. In accordance with that programme, work is under way on four Bills at present. The arts Bill will update the relationship between the State and the arts sector, in particular the Arts Council. The general scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government and a parliamentary counsel has been appointed. It is expected that the Bill will be published in the present session. The official languages equality Bill will provide a framework for the delivery of State services bilingually or through the medium of the Irish language. The general scheme of the Bill has also been approved by Government. While the Government legislative programme envisages that this Bill will be published by mid-year, efforts are under way at present to seek to advance that timetable.</P>
      <P>Two other Bills are also scheduled for publication this year, a national monuments Bill and a Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (powers and functions) Bill. The national monuments Bill, which is based on a review of the national monuments Acts 1930 to 1994 and related legislation, will lead to consolidated and, where appropriate, revised and extended legislation for the protection of the archaeological, architectural and historic heritage. The primary purpose of the proposed powers and functions Bill is to clarify the extent of the Minister's powers and functions in relation to by-laws and regulations relating to properties in the care or ownership of the Minister. In both cases, the general scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government and submitted to the Attorney General's office for drafting.</P>

      <P>At the time that my Department paid out compensation for losses arising from destocking in 2001, the information that the person named had not applied for ewe premium was correct. After investigation, it appears that the person's application to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was not received. When he produced a copy of his application, along with a certificate of postage, his application was accepted and his ewe premium paid at the beginning of <Col N="477" /> this year. Accordingly, the person is entitled to compensation from my Department for losses arising from destocking and a payment will issue in due course.</P>

      <P>I refer further to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 907 to 911, inclusive, of 30 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect to suggest that spring traps and gin traps are not regulated under S.I. No. 307 of 1977. The position is that the use, possession and importation of traps is regulated under the wildlife Acts &ndash; section 34 of the 1976 Act, as amended &ndash; by the Wildlife Act, 1976, (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations, 1977 and S.I. No. 307 of 1977. Under section 2(a)(i) of these regulations, gin traps are not approved traps for the purposes of section 34(6) of the Wildlife Act, 1976. Section 2 of the regulations also sets out the parameters by which spring traps may be considered as approved traps for the purpose of section 34(6) of the Wildlife Act, 1976. Section 34(6) of the Wildlife Act, 1976 makes it an offence to import, other than pursuant to and in accordance with a licence granted by me as Minister, any trap snare or net to which section 2 of the Wildlife Act, 1976. (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations, 1977&rdquo;, S.I. No. 307 of 1977, does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an attempt to import traps without a licence, the customs service took possession of the traps and the importer then made an application to Dúchas for a licence to import the traps under section 34(6) of the Wildlife Acts 1976, as amended. A sample of the traps was made available to Dúchas staff for examination. On receipt of advice from Dúchas staff, the application for a licence was refused based on the efficiency and effectiveness of the trap <Col N="478" /> concerned. I understand this decision is currently under appeal by the applicant.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 347 and 348 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on a routine site visit, a conservation ranger from Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, noticed works being carried out on Cloonchambers Bog, a candidate special area of conservation &ndash; cSAC &ndash; in the townland of Cloonkeen. These works appeared to involve the cutting of new drains, which could cause considerable damage to the cSAC. Any potentially damaging works within a cSAC are deemed to be notifiable actions, which require my prior consent. No such consent was sought in this instance, <Col N="480" /> therefore, the ranger requested that these works cease.</P>
    <P>In relation to drainage works, including maintenance of existing drains at designated raised bogs, the main conservation concern is to avoid increased drying of intact bog surfaces. There are no set procedures dealing with drainage works within designated bogs as each bog must be individually assessed. However, any drainage works on a designated bog or within the local water catchment area are deemed to be notifiable actions and must have my consent before being carried out. Usually, maintenance of existing drains will not result in a significant impact on the bog and consent can be given quickly. Every effort is made to identify all landowners in a cSAC and site information packs containing information in this regard have been issued to all landowners known to Dúchas. Landowners and users are also invited to participate in a local liaison committee, as a point of contact for landowners and a forum, which can address matters such as this.</P>
    <P>Attempts by officials of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to set up a liaison committee in this area proved unsuccessful due to opposition from local landowners. Nevertheless, officials of Dúchas are always available to meet with landowners to discuss and advise on any proposed works within designated conservation areas. Attempts are made to facilitate landowners as much as possible while ensuring the conservation objectives of these sites are maintained.</P>

      <P>The Television Without Frontiers Directive, as amended by EU Council Directive 97/36/EC, provides that member states may designate certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society and take steps to ensure that events so designated are available on free-to-air television services.</P>
      <P>The directive places an obligation on member states to provide in national legislation the statutory basis for the designation of events as being of major importance to society and which should be available on free-to-air television services. Ireland's obligation under the directive was fulfilled through legislation promoted by me, that is, the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that legislation, I have the power to designate a list of events which should in the public <Col N="481" /> interest be available on free-to-air television. In drawing up such a list I am obliged by the Act to consult with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. In addition, I must consult with the organisers of the events and with broadcasters who are under the jurisdiction of the State. This in turn must be followed by a wider public consultation process in respect of any event that I intend to designate. It is only then that a draft order designating an event or events can be brought before the Oireachtas for approval. Any list drawn up must be compatible with EU law.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the question of drawing up a list of events to be designated and a consultation process with the major sporting organisations in this country has taken place. It is very clear from the consultation process that the drawing up of a list of events is a very complex matter. Some sporting organisations have argued against designation of the major events they organise on the basis that designation could impact negatively on their finances and consequently on the development of the games, particularly at club level. The possible negative impact of designation on sporting organisations has to be considered and balanced with the public interest of certain events being available on free-to-air television.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are complex but are being addressed in an appropriate, consultative and democratic manner. Consultation with the sporting organisation and with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is ongoing. When these consultations are concluded then I will be in a position to make a decision regarding a list of events.</P>
    <P>The complexity of the issue is actually evidenced by the position that pertains in relation to the Ireland <i>versus</i> England game on Saturday next. That game which is a home game for the England team will not be shown live on free-to-air television in England despite the British Government having actually designated a list of events. The game is included in the B list of events designated by the British Government and only events on the A list must be available for live coverage on free-to-air television.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs and Excise Service of their office has responsibility for customs clearance at Weston Aerodrome. The aerodrome is a licensed aerodrome and is approved by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of flights to or from other member states of the EU. Flights to and from EU destinations are permitted provided that: no third country &ndash; non-EU &ndash; goods are carried on board; no stores are carried on board; no passengers who have originated in a non-EU country and who have not been cleared at another EU airport are on board; no goods carried on board are being exported to a non-EU country; and customs intervention is not necessary for the purposes of enforcing a prohibition or restriction on importation or exportation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Save as permitted by the Revenue Commissioners, flights to Weston from outside the EU must first clear customs at an international community airport and flights from Weston to destinations outside the EU must depart via an international community airport. There are international community airports in Ireland at Dublin, Shannon and Cork. Flights into Weston from places outside the EU are infrequent and prior permission must be obtained from Customs in respect of these. The volume and type of business conducted at Weston &ndash; primarily national and EU flights &ndash; does not justify the deployment of a permanent Customs and Excise presence there. However, customs officers maintain close liaison with the airport management and visit Weston regularly as a check against the landing or exportation of prohibited goods, in particular controlled drugs. This type of liaison is conducted under the Customs Drugs Watch programme, a coastal and airfield reporting system that establishes confidential liaison between customs enforcement officers and relevant operators. By <Col N="484" /> agreement with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Customs will report to the Department and An Garda Síochána if they suspect any non-national of the EU or European economic area has entered the State at a licensed aerodrome.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 935, 943, 947, 951 and 1035 of 30 January 2002, under the terms of the Government decision of 26 July 1999, the person in question is ineligible to work as he has not been compliant with his obligations as an asylum seeker. These obligations were clearly set out in the information leaflet for applicants for refugee status in Ireland which issued to all asylum seekers. Each applicant is, <i>inter alia</i>, informed that he or she may not leave the State without permission while the application is under consideration. I am informed that the applicant failed to comply with this obligation, and accordingly, he was not entitled to avail of the right to work arrangements under the Government decision of July 1999.</P>

      <P>Under the Refugee Act, 1996, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications and appeals for refugee status and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.

      <P>The person in question entered the State on 8 November 1999, and claimed asylum. His claim was refused and he was informed of this decision on 8 June 2000. He appealed this decision but this appeal was refused. On 8 November 2000, a letter issued informing him that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and giving him the options of 15 working days to make written representations setting out any reasons as to why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; to leave the State before a decision whether or not to order his deportation is taken; or to consent to the making of a deportation order. Representations were received as to why he should be allowed remain in the State. I expect the case file in relation to the person in question to be submitted to me for decision shortly.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I am aware of the concerns of unmarried fathers regarding custody and access rights and I agree that children should have the benefit of a family life which involves both parents. Of course, this has to be subject to the overriding consideration that the welfare of the child must be paramount. <Col N="486" /> Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act, 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child. Examples of such proceedings are applications for custody and access orders. In making such orders and in determining whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. I believe that these legislative provisions are appropriate as they permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, capital and staffing grant schemes for community based and &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo; groups are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006. In October 2001, my Department received an application from the group in question for a capital grant under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006 for the construction of a childcare facility within a proposed new family resource centre. An application for staffing funding was received by my Department from the same group on 7 November 2001.</P>
      <P>I understand from officials in my Department's childcare directorate that a technical assessment of these applications is being carried out by ADM Limited prior to referral to the programme appraisal committee. I have also been advised by ADM Limited that, in view of the costings of the capital project, an independent architectural appraisal is being carried out. This is standard practice in capital projects of this size. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the applications under the equal opportunities childcare programme.</P>

      <P>The person in question entered the State in early 2000 and claimed asylum. He withdrew his claim for asylum on 13 December 2000, applying instead for residency in the State on the <Col N="491" /> basis of marriage to an EU national. This application was subsequently refused and the individual was informed of this decision on 1 October 2001. At that time he was given the opportunity to submit other grounds on which he may wish to remain in the State. He failed to do so. On 12 December 2001, a letter issued informing him that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and giving him the following options: 15 working days to make written representations setting out any reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, to leave the State before a decision whether or not an order for his deportation was taken, or to consent to the making of a deportation order.</P>
      <P>Representations as to why he should be allowed remain in the State were received from his legal representatives and these are being considered by my Department. I expect the case file in relation to this person to be submitted to me for decision shortly.</P>

      <P>The Maintenance Orders Act, 1974, gives effect to an agreement with Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders. Under the Act a maintenance creditor may apply to the court which made the order to have the order transmitted to the appropriate authorities in the other jurisdiction for enforcement. The authorities are then obliged by law to institute court proceedings to have the maintenance order enforced in that jurisdiction. This is carried out at no cost to the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, the Maintenance Act, 1994, which gives legal effect to the United Nations Convention on <Col N="492" /> the Recovery of Maintenance Abroad done at New York on 20 June 1956, provides, through a transmitting and receiving agency, administrative assistance to claimants who wish to recover maintenance from debtors living abroad, whether or not a maintenance order is already in place. In line with the relevant provisions of the convention, section 20 of the Maintenance Act, 1994, provides that the Irish central authority can obtain any information necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions. In this connection it can require any holder of a public office or body financed wholly or partly by means of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to provide it with any information in the possession or procurement of the holder or the body as to the whereabouts, place of work or location and extent of assets of a maintenance debtor. The central authority may also seek an order of the District Court to obtain such information from any other body or person. There is no equivalent provision in the Maintenance Orders Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>Ireland has in place the necessary statutory instrument (S.I. No. 288 of 1995) to facilitate the application of the New York Convention in Irish law, including in respect of the United Kingdom. I understand, however, that the UK authorities have yet to complete the corresponding steps under UK law as respects Ireland. I remain in contact with the UK authorities as to their proposals in this regard.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a previous parliamentary question on the matter, the Olden report to which the Deputy refers was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 6 July 2001. The report examined in great detail the management of the sentences of the life sentenced prisoner who murdered Mrs. Nolan on 14 February 2000 while on temporary release from Castlerea Prison. It illustrated some weaknesses in the system and made recommendations to deal with them. I asked the director general of the Prisons Service to implement all the recommendations of the report without delay and to take whatever other steps were necessary to improve procedures and risk assessment. The director general has assured me that the necessary steps have <Col N="493" /> been taken to ensure the procedural deficiencies identified in the management of this case do not recur.</P>
      <P>In addition, the recent establishment of the parole board with the required levels of resources will address other concerns raised in the report. The board has begun its work in reviewing cases and advising me in regard to the sentence management of long-term prisoners coming before it. The board considers reports from the various services dealing directly with a particular prisoner. Particular attention is paid to the therapeutic work a prisoner has undertaken in regard to his or her offending behaviour and to the views of An Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I again express regret at the tragic consequences of the release of this prisoner and extend my sympathy to the family of Mrs. Nolan on the death of their mother two years ago this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 374 and 375 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland maintains a common travel area with the UK which is of enormous value and relevance to the island of Ireland and within which there is free movement for Irish and British citizens. Prior to 1997, it was the case that persons including persons who were not Irish or British citizens travelling from the United Kingdom did not encounter immigration controls upon arrival in the State. However the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order, 1997, altered that position and empowers immigration officers to carry out immigration checks on persons who are not Irish or British citizens arriving from the United Kingdom and to refuse such persons leave to land on the same grounds as apply if they arrive from outside the common travel area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immigration controls are applied selectively on persons to whom the 1997 order applies including those who arrive by land from Northern Ireland so as not to interfere with the freedom of movement between the two jurisdictions of Irish and British citizens. I hope the Deputy will appreciate that, for operational reasons, it is not possible for me to state precisely where and when such checks <Col N="494" /> are carried out nor to specify the precise reasons for such checks in particular locations at particular times. I can say however that intelligence information plays a significant part in these matters and that the relevant operations are co-ordinated by the Garda national immigration bureau in consultation with local Garda divisional officers.</P>
    <P>The development of a comprehensive intelligence base and closer co-operation with immigration authorities in other jurisdictions are obviously essential elements in combating the type of activity to which the Deputy refers and was one of the main reasons the Government approved the setting up of the Garda national immigration bureau. The bureau has established effective operational co-operation with immigration and police authorities in the UK and a Garda liaison officer has been assigned permanently to London for the purpose of interacting with relevant UK personnel on immigration and trafficking matters.</P>
    <P>Since August 2001 over 300 persons, who had attempted to enter the State via the land border, have been refused leave to land as a result of intelligence driven operations. The Garda national immigration bureau has no specific information on agencies ferrying illegal immigrants across the Border in County Louth. There have however been three separate arrests of taxi drivers on suspicion of having committed offences contrary to the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000. Those investigations are ongoing.</P>
    <P>From a legislative point of view, the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, targets professional traffickers in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and providing a framework by which those engaging in such trafficking can be dealt with under the law. The penalty on conviction on indictment for the offence of trafficking under the Act is an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is raising the question of changing legislation due to the recent case of Maughan <i>v</i> the Glimmerman <Col N="496" /> Limited which is a decision of the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations under the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>There has, I believe, been a certain amount of misunderstanding concerning the actual finding of the equality officer in this case, which has given rise to concern on the part of the licensed trade &ndash; and indeed, on the part of parents &ndash; in relation to the licensing, opening and operation of licensed premises.</P>
      <P>For whatever reason, the impression that gained wide currency, was that the equality officer had ruled, that children may be present in a licensed premises at any time provided that they are accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>There were however some important qualifications in the decision itself which, unfortunately, were not sufficiently highlighted in the public discussion and in media coverage etcetera, which followed.</P>
      <P>What the equality officer found was that having a blanket ban on under 18 year olds being in pubs with their parents is a discriminatory policy against parents of under 18 year olds on the family status ground under the Equal Status Act, 2000. However, the equality officer specifically stated that his finding should not be interpreted as meaning that publicans must serve parents when accompanied by their children under 18 years old in all circumstances. Instances are cited by the equality officer where a publican could be entitled to refuse service, for example, where a parent was drunk or if a parent or under 18 year old was disorderly. Moreover contrary to the impression that appears to have been created, the validity of a partial ban, for example, allowing children on the premises before a certain hour, was not considered at all in this case.</P>
      <P>Under current licensing laws, the renewal of liquor licences is conditional on the peaceful and orderly manner in which the licensed premises were conducted in the year ending on the expiry of the licence. In certain circumstances, the licensees may, therefore, be required to refuse admission or service but this power may not be exercised in an arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory way.</P>
      <P>Although the equality officer's ruling was, as I say, quite significantly qualified in ways that have not been widely understood, I have, in the interests of providing reassurance to parents and others concerned about the ruling, asked my Department to examine the ruling and the implications that flow from it, with a view to assessing the adequacy of existing legislative provisions in relation to these aspects of licensing law.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 383 and 386 together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,300 applications were received before the closing date, including one from each of the organisations in question. All applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, &euro;14 million, £11 million, in grants from the European <Col N="500" /> Regional Development Fund, administered by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, was provided towards the cost of developing elements of the heritage towns programme under the Operational Programmes for Tourism 1989-1993 and 1994-1999. This funding was by way of assistance to promoters towards the cost of presentation and, in some instances, promotion of the heritage elements of the proposed development plans of some 34 designated heritage towns. Most local authorities played a lead role in the promotion and development of the programme in the relevant towns.</P>
      <P>Since then Bord Fáilte has continued to contribute towards the cost of the annual overseas marketing plans of the heritage towns. I understand that a progress report on the overall project has been prepared and that the representatives of the Heritage Towns of Ireland have been in consultation with Bord Fáilte in this regard. There are no plans for meetings, additional to these consultations, with myself or my Department.</P>

      <P>I understand that while the club has submitted some of the documentation required there is still a considerable amount of documentation outstanding. Among the documents outstanding is the execution of a deed of trust and the fire safety certificate. When all of the documentation is received and found to be in order, the grant will be formally confirmed and payment of the grant will be made.</P>

      <P>On 20 November 2000, Campus <Col N="501" /> and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, the company established to oversee the development of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland, advertised a tender competition for the stadium and other sporting facilities, in the form of a design, build, finance, operate and maintain process. Following receipt of preliminary expressions of interest, a selected number of companies were invited by CSID to participate in the outline bid stage of the competition. The bid documentation for this stage of the competition which closed on 21 June 2001, provides for the awarding authority to amend the bidding process by notice in writing to bidders.</P>
      <P>The same bid documentation specifies that only bidders selected to proceed to the next detailed negotiation stage will have their reasonable third party costs met by the awarding authority and such costs will have to be agreed between the parties in advance of the negotiations moving to this stage of the process. However, a decision to move to this stage is subject to considerations now under way of the implications of the recommendations and options of the recently published High-Point Rendel Report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the Government has clearly stated that it remains convinced that a stadium project at Abbotstown is both desirable and feasible and that the Abbotstown Campus can and will be developed into a vital infrastructural asset for the achievement of national aims in the field of sports, recreation and related tourism.</P>

      <Quest>the reason, further to Parliamentary Question No. 28 of 31 January 2002, in assessing schools for funding, the scheme is not available to schools which have had more than 2% of pupils assessed; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this discriminates against schools in disadvantaged areas where a far higher percentage of students would require psychological intervention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Since 1999, my Department allocates resources as an automatic entitlement to primary school children with disabilities. In many cases, the existence of a disability is determined by means of a psychological assessment. The National Educational Psychological Service Agency of my Department is gradually expanding in a phased and orderly manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to cater for pupils in schools not yet covered by NEPS, I announced funding last June for the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. As I stated in my reply on 31 January, the number of assessments per school is determined by the number of pupils, to a maximum of two per 100 pupils enrolled. The first reason for this is to allow all the eligible <Col N="503" /> schools to have initial access to the available funding. The second reason is that the incidence of children with defined disabilities is comparatively stable across all socio-economic groups. The NEPS management team is currently reviewing the operation of the scheme and will report to me on any adjustments that might be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are children in schools who need access to extra educational, including psychological, support. My Department has provided a range of other schemes to meet their needs, particularly in disadvantaged areas. The needs of disadvantaged children have been given a high priority in planning the expansion of NEPS. NEPS is currently developing a database that will enable its management team to ascertain which schools have a higher level of need and will therefore require a higher level of psychological intervention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of steps have since been taken to progress the development of the facility, includ<Col N="504" /> ing the determination of a catchment area and a long-term projected enrolment. It had been proposed initially that provision should be made in the new school for 700 pupils. This figure is currently being reviewed, however, in the light of a proposal from County Meath VEC that provision should also be made for the possible demand for second level schooling through Irish, given the existence of three gaelscoileanna in the general area. A decision in this regard will be made in the near future.</P>
    <P>Also, County Meath VEC is currently in the process of identifying potential sites for the new school. When a suitable site is identified, architectural planning will begin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment, CE, schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of &euro;58,407,951, £46 million, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003 as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in respect of the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department received a total of &euro;40,631,618, £32 million, for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>My Department has now issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. In line with the new arrangements, the level of funding provided by my Department to schools has been increased from the &euro;50.79, £40, per pupil that applied in the 2000-2001 school year to the &euro;101.58, £80, per pupil that applies in this school year. It is anticipated that the payment at the rate of &euro;101.58, £80, per pupil will issue to schools in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" />I have set aside approximately &euro;2.5 million in 2002 to respond to the particular difficulties that may be experienced by some schools.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004, depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>While issues relating to the question of supervisors being made redundant are essentially matters outside the remit of my Department, I have been informed that FÁS employment services will make every effort to ensure that CE supervisors being made redundant are made aware of other employment opportunities, including those arising in the social economy, as this programme is rolled out, or in other CE schemes. In such cases, FÁS employment services will initiate contact with supervisors and provide the full range of employment supports, including job placement or further training if required. In addition FÁS will ensure that redundant supervisors, with their consent, are placed on the regional database of CE supervisors for future prospective employers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, arrangements are already in place whereby FÁS will fund the statutory redundancy entitlements of supervisors made redundant due to the mainstreaming of schools services where the sponsors are unable to meet these costs from their own resources.</P>

My Department received a total of &euro;40,631,618, £32 million, for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from &euro;50.79, £40, per pupil per annum to &euro;126.98, £100, per pupil over this school year and the next. With effect from September 2001, the grant was increased from &euro;50.79, £40, to &euro;76.18, £60, per pupil. This has been further increased to &euro;101.58, £80, per pupil with effect from January 2002. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less has increased from &euro;3,047.37, £2,400, to &euro;6,094.74, £4,800, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from &euro;25,394.76, £20,000, to &euro;50,789.52, £40,000, per annum.</P>
      <P>The school in question had the services of a shared secretary up to the end of 2001, and was also receiving <i>per capita</i> grant aid from my Department of £20, &euro;25.39, per pupil for caretaking services. From January this year, the school's secretarial sharing arrangement has been terminated, with the school's agreement, and the school will now receive <i>per capita</i> grant aid from my Department for both secretarial and caretaking services. The total <i>per capita</i> payment this year will therefore amount to &euro;101.58, £80, per pupil. A payment of &euro;7,701 in respect of the secretarial service issued recently to the school. A similar payment will shortly be made in respect of the caretaking service.

In recent years, two grants, amounting to some £5.2 million, &euro;6.60 million, have issued to second level schools under the free education scheme to assist them with the development of their library resource materials.</P>
    <P>In 1999, as part of a national reading initiative, my Department channelled some £2.6 million, &euro;3.3 million, to second level schools. The level of grant amounted to £7.70, &euro;9.78, per pupil with a minimum payment of £1,540, &euro;1,955.40, per school. This grant was in addition to the school library grant, amounting to some £2.4 million, &euro;3.05 million, that was paid to schools in 1998. All second level schools in the free education scheme received £2,500, &euro;3,174.35, increased to £5,320, &euro;6,755, in the case of schools classified as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Schools were informed that the grants were to be used to improve the range and quality of library books and an information note offering advice on book purchases was issued in 1999.</P>

      <P>My Department already has an inspectorate of schools that was placed on a statutory basis in the Education Act, 1998. This legislation also defines the main functions of the inspectorate, which may be categorised broadly as the evaluation of the educational sector, particularly at primary and second level, the provision of advice and the contribution to educational policy development. There are no plans, therefore, to establish another inspectorate.</P>
      <P>However, a major reorganisation of the inspectorate has been undertaken so that a more effective service can be delivered to schools and the educational sector generally. Details of this reorganisation will be published and forwarded to schools and the wider educational community shortly. The Deputy should also note that, in summer 2001, the Government accepted recommendations from me to implement a major restructuring of the Department of Education and Science. The Government decision to establish a special education council, an examinations commission and regional offices of the Department will further alter the role of the inspectorate and allow it to focus more effectively on its evaluation and quality assurance role.</P>

      <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students ages 23 and over.</P>

      <P>Every year, my Department receives for examination more than 1.5 million scripts, practical pieces and other test products. It is not logistically feasible to facilitate the return of this quantity of examination material to candidates and, in the interests of fairness and equity, I could not return metalwork projects to candidates and retain material from other candidates who took art, engineering and other examinations.</P>
      <P>The optimum solution to the issues raised by the Deputy lies in realigning the assessment arrangements in subjects such as metalwork that generate artefacts. At present, the practical pieces in a number of subjects are examined in individual schools and consequently there are no logistical difficulties involved in returning the material. There are, however, short-term storage issues for the schools, which make it difficult to expand the number of subjects where the schools retain the material to include subjects like metalwork.</P>
      <P>My officials are reviewing the arrangements in consultation with the relevant interests, including school management bodies, in order to progress these issues on a consensus basis.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy made an application for access to personal and other records held by my Department in respect of his placement in Artane Industrial School. My Department identified all personal and general records relating to the requester's period in the school. The majority of records were released in full.

      <P>A request for an internal review of these decisions was received and duly processed by my Department. The original decision to refuse access to 15 records was annulled and the records were accordingly released in full to the requester. An additional 12 records, which were previously released on a partial basis only, were released in full on foot of the internal review. The request for access to non-personal records was refused on internal review as the records in question are outside the scope of the FOI Act.</P>
      <P>My Department's decision in this case was appealed by the person concerned to the Office of the Information Commissioner.

    <P>Clifden community school is to be redeveloped as part of the Government's programme and my Department has recently interviewed candidates for a design team. The question of commencing architectural planning will be considered as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that last year I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme replaces the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some &euro;33 million with the allocation of over 200 teaching posts. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the rural dimension and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of &euro;952 in respect of the 2001-2002 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. Rural schools with the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage were clustered into groups of four to five and each cluster is entitled to the services of a teacher-co-ordinator to work with the schools in relation to the needs of the pupils concerned. The school in question was not considered eligible for clustering, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
      <P>The position of this school will fall for consideration again in any future expansion of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not have data on the number of second level students taking up part-time jobs during the school week. I share the Deputy's concern about non-school attendance, caused by whatever reason. Due to the link between non-school attendance and early school leaving, my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, replaced and reformed current school attendance legislation. It provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body, the National Educational Welfare Board. Its focus will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>
      <P>It provides measures designed specifically with early school leavers in mind. Section 29 provides that a young person &ndash; in most cases 16 and 17 year olds &ndash; may register with the National Educational Welfare Board if he or she leaves school before the 18th birthday. The board will then, following consultation with the young person, parents and others, prepare a plan for his or her continuing education and training. Once that is done the board will issue a certificate to the young person concerned. In addition, the Act provides that an employer cannot employ a young person unless he or she is the holder of a valid certificate. An employer is also obliged to inform the board within a month after a young person has been employed. The Act provides significant penalties for employers who breach these provisions. The overall thrust of the provisions is to place meaningful restrictions on the process whereby young people, who are encouraged by an immediate earning potential, to leave education and training and take up often low-skill work. The provisions do not prevent young people taking up employment but seek to ensure that a balance is struck between their employment rights and their future educational, training and social needs. My Department is in the process of implementing the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, precludes young people, between the ages of 16 and 18 and who are still at school, from working after 10 p.m. on any night when there is school the following day. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, <Col N="527" /> Trade and Employment, has recruited an additional seven inspectors to assist with the enforcement of this legislation. In addition my Department currently supports two initiatives aimed at increasing the retention of pupils in school, namely the 8 to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level. Significant funding has been made available by this Government under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to address the problem of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>I have provided a total of &euro;22.5 million for these school completion initiatives in 2002. I expect that this will be sufficient to facilitate a significant expansion that will focus on areas with the greatest pupil retention difficulties as identified through my Department's post-primary pupil database. In this regard, proposals are currently under consideration in my Department and I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement in relation to this matter shortly. The objective of preventing early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and, in order to have a real chance of success, the solution must be wide ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment.</P>

The youth affairs section of my Department is not responsible for setting salary scales nor is it involved in the provision of pensions.

      <P>According to my Department's records, there are 1,683 eligible part-time teachers, EPT, employed in secondary and community-comprehensive schools in the current school year. My Department has requested vocational education committees to submit the relevant details in respect of the VEC sector and, as soon as they have been received and compiled, they will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Vacancies in schools arising from career breaks, approved leave of absence or secondments and concessionary posts, which are allocated in excess of a school's normal quota of posts, may only be filled in a temporary or part-time capacity. In addition, in order to ensure that schools have the flexibility to meet the curricular needs of their students, particularly in minority subject areas, it is necessary for them to appoint temporary or part-time teachers.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the EPT scheme, EPTs who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required. Most teachers, who are initially employed as EPTs, subsequently apply for and are appointed to permanent teaching posts in their subject area. They are entitled to incremental and pension credit for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes.</P>
      <P>The job security of temporary teachers is related to the number and type of posts available. In this regard the position at second level has significantly improved in recent years. Over 1,200 additional posts were created in the sector since the 1999-2000 school year. A further 400 posts will be created for the 2002-2003 school year under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

The school relocated to new premises in November 2001. The planning section is currently examining the application in light of this development.

During the debate on the Bill in this House and in committee, it was proposed that its scope be extended to include those who suffered abuse in a number of other institutions, including Magdalene laundries. The laundries differ substantially from the institutions now covered by the Bill in that the residents concerned were for the most part adults and the laundries were entirely private institutions, in respect of which public bodies had no functions. On Committee Stage I undertook to consider the arguments raised further and to report back to the House on Report Stage. Report Stage is now scheduled for 20 February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants. The action group considered that the tar<Col N="539" /> get group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant, a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses. All four schemes have similar provisions relating, for example, to residency and means which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has to date been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative under which my <Col N="540" /> Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-2001 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-2002 academic year.</P>

      <P>My Department makes a grant available to each local authority on an annual basis to enable local authority librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to primary schools. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each local authority area. The total value of the grant in 2001 was approximately &euro;1.32 million. It is a matter for each local authority to provide a library service for the schools in its area. My Department has no involvement in the operation of this service.</P>
      <P>In May 2000, following the publication of <i>Branching Out</i>, the comprehensive review of public library policy, a working group was established to explore all of the issues relating to the schools library service. My Department, along with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, An Comhairle Leabharlanna and the library authorities is represented on the group, the work of which is continuing.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. In this regard, in addition to the funding that my Department provides to local authorities on an annual basis, two grants have issued in recent years from my Department directly to primary and post primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each. The grant that was issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to £2,500, while disadvantaged schools received £5,320.</P>
      <P>As part of the national reading initiative, a second grant was issued to all primary and post primary schools by my Department in December 1999. Under the terms of this grant, primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or fewer. Post-primary schools also received £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £1,540 was paid to all schools with fewer than 200 recognised pupils. At primary level the total value of these two grants was approximately £7.7 million, while at second level the two grants amounted to £5.2 million.</P>

      <P>My approach to the value of maintenance grants has been to increase the level of grants annually, at least in line with inflation. In keeping with this policy, in June 2001, I approved increases of 6% in the rates of maintenance grants. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index to mid-February. The increase of 6% in grant rates for 2001-2002 was higher than the reference value, which was 5.3%.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001-2002 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1999 to March 2000, which was 5.9%. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>On my initiative, a special project team is carrying out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review includes the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
      <P>Some of these topics are complex and require detailed research. As part of the review, the Economic and Social Research Institute was commissioned to undertake research on the effect of changes in the income thresholds and on related matters. The report's findings have informed the work of the project team and drafting of the team's report is now being finalised. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already introduced special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders with effect from the 2000-2001 academic year. The rates are &euro;3,809, £3,000, for students residing more than 15 miles from the college attended, and &euro;1,535, £1,200, for students residing less than 15 miles from the college attended. These increased rates of grant will be a powerful incentive to eligible students to enter third level and to complete their studies in the knowledge <Col N="543" /> that additional financial assistance will be available to them.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Since the Government came into office, there has been a great increase in the level of activity in the area of primary school building. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction, which has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is being extended-refurbished as part of the Government's programme and the project is currently in architectural planning.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 470 and 471 together.</P>
      <P>Inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the certificate examinations. My Department is of the view that the range of measures introduced since 2000 were appropriate and positive in the interest of enhancing the inclusiveness of the examination system. Under the new measures, it is now open to special needs students to apply to have a part of an examination waived and to be marked out of 100% on the balance. In other words, a candidate being exempted from part of an examination will suffer no disadvantage and can obtain a top grade in that subject. This option was not available before. The concept of using an explanatory note to enable such a development is one that is in use in many other jurisdictions, where the special need or the nature of the arrangement provided is noted on the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department considers that by ensuring the explanatory note is confined to a factual narrow statement on the assessment issues, rather than a reference to the nature of the arrangement or the special need of the candidate, we have a better model than that employed elsewhere. We feel that our model does not categorise or label the candidate in any way because the explanatory note is confined to the assessment issue alone. In fact, the notation is presented as a positive statement. We use the format that all elements of the examinations were assessed except the xxxx element. Even though a candidate may have made known to us that he or she does not have the skill-competence under assessment in the national test instruments we do not state that anywhere on their certification. Rather, we state that we were unable to assess it given the nature of the arrangement sought by the candidate. The <Col N="546" /> core issue is the <i>de facto</i> exemption from an element of the standard assessment.</P>
    <P>It should be added that in other jurisdictions, the examining authorities take the view that students with a specific learning difficulty should not be allowed any accommodation in language tests such as assistance of a scribe, use of a tape recorder or spell check on a personal computer, on the basis that to do so is totally inconsistent with standard national assessment criteria. By contrast, my Department not only allows the candidate such accommodations, but also allows that candidate to obtain full marks or avoid mark loss, even when some of the marks are allocated to core assessment objectives such as spelling and grammar. In our view, this represents a very positive discrimination for the candidates concerned.</P>
    <P>The use of an explanatory note enables my Department to maintain existing accommodations and introduce new ones by striking a balance between doing all we possibly can to help special needs candidates who have a difficulty with attainment in core elements of the examination, and ensuring that our approach is credible, valid and defensible in assessment terms.</P>
    <P>The matter referred to by the Deputy has not been the subject of a court case in Ireland. My Department has received correspondence from the Office of the Information Commissioner, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Equality Authority on the matter, and has provided comprehensive responses explaining the position in respect of the issues raised.</P>
    <P>In one individual case where legal proceedings had been initiated, my Department decided that, without prejudice, it would not have been reasonable to record an explanatory note on the certificate because the candidate in question may not have been afforded due process at the time of the initial application.</P>

      <P>: Under the terms of my Department's free fees initiative, the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration at approved colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eligibility under the initiative is subject to a number of conditions. For example, students who are repeating a year are generally not eligible for funding. Based on criteria issued by my Department, the third level institutions make decisions regarding eligibility under the free fees initiative. These institutions do not refer individual queries <Col N="547" /> to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition in the criteria is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Where an institution has not extended the benefit of the free fees initiative to an individual student, and the student is of the view that the free fees criteria have not been interpreted correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the institution itself may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on an issue from my Department.</P>
    <P>Universities are autonomous institutions and, where a student is not eligible to benefit under the free fees initiative, issues relating to the payment of tuition fees are a matter for the university concerned.</P>

      <P>In 1998 the school authorities in question sought approval for the provision of a PE hall. My Department agreed to the provision of a hall of 608 m² and a further 200 m² of ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>In January of last year the authorities of the school requested my Department to assess its overall accommodation needs and to include the PE and ancillary needs in that assessment.</P>
      <P>As the school was now effectively requesting a potentially more significant capital investment, my Department sought to establish the long-term viability and enrolment projections for the school. Last summer it was agreed with the school authorities that a long-term projected enrolment of 500 pupils was a reasonable basis on which to base the detailed assessment of the school's future accommodation requirements.</P>
      <P>In August last my Department provided the school with a draft schedule of overall accommodation seeking its agreement. This draft was based on an educational worksheet prepared by the school showing its curricular options. The school authorities responded in October with some queries. My Department addressed these issues and a revised schedule was recently issued to the school. As soon as the school authorities agree the schedule the question of designing accommodation for the future needs of the school can be addressed.</P>

      <P>Is í an leithroinnt d'fhoirgnimh bhunscoile in 2002 ná &euro;153.6 milliún, an leibhéal is airde maoinithe fós, agus léiríonn sé tiomantas an Rialtais seo maidir le cúrsaí cóiríochta i mbunscoileanna a fheabhsú.

      <P>De bharr an mhéadaithe mhóir ar ghníomhaíocht i réimsí foirgneamh bunscoileanna ó tháinig an Rialtas seo in oifig tá ardú mór ar an líon tionscadal beag agus mór tógála a bhfuiltear ag dul dóibh agus tá an leibhéal tógála agus gníomhaíocht athchóirithe dá bharr seo níos airde ná riamh.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>My Department will give detailed consideration to an application from Glassan national school for improved accommodation, as part of the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The allocation for post-primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;182.31 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in post-primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of investment in the post-primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>A report on the condition of the school has been submitted by County Longford VEC on behalf of Ballymahon vocational school and this is currently being examined by the technical staff of my Department. On completion of this examination, consideration will be given to the progression of this project to the next stage under the expanded building programme.</P>
