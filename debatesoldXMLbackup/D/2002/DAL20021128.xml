      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following issue of national importance: the need for a considered debate on the national spatial strategy, published today, as it impacts on every city, town and parish.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 14, motion re approval by Dáil Éireann of a Council framework decision on combating sexual exploitation of children and child pornography; No. 13, motion re membership of committee; No. 14<i>a,</i> motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 12<i>a,</i> Supplementary Estimates for Public Services, Vote 2; No. 2, European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second and Subsequent Stages; No. 12<i>b,</i> motion re approval by Dáil Éireann of the terms of the Treaty of Nice amending the Treaty on European Union, the treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related Acts; No. 27, Private Security Services Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 1, Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 14, 13, 14<i>a</i> and 12<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate and in the case of No. 12<i>a</i> any division demanded thereon shall <Col N="622" />be taken forthwith. Second and Subsequent Stages of No. 2 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply: Second Stage to conclude at 1 p.m. if not previously concluded and Committee and Remaining Stages to conclude at 1.30 p.m. if not previously concluded. The proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. No. 12<i>b</i> shall be taken immediately on the conclusion of No. 2 and shall be decided without debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 12<i>a</i> is a list of Supplementary Estimates for expenditure for the remainder of this year and I protest that today the Government publishes the national spatial strategy, a development plan for the next 20 years, without inviting any Member of this House to the launch in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. The Government does this having informed its backbenchers of the contents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an insult to the Members of this House that a major statement of public policy and development is being made outside Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will be aware that in other Parliaments there are strict regulations and rulings that no major announcement of this type should be made outside Parliament. This House and its elected Members should be the first to be informed of the development plan by the Minister and the Minister of State. It does down the House, the office of Ceann Comhairle and elected representatives from every party to have this major announcement made outside and without reference to the people who have to debate and pass legislation. I note the Minister's opening remarks to the launch refer to the Taoiseach, Ministers of State, ladies and gentlemen, but it seems Deputies did not receive an invitation. The Minister's speech describes how he will visit each region to spread the message.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the spatial strategy now. I am asking a question of the Ceann Comhairle. He will be aware that in other Parliaments there is strict regulation to prevent this kind of activity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly about it because, as Deputy Cuffe said, it affects every city, town and parish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the two matters I wished to raise has been dealt with well by Deputy Kenny &ndash; that this happens is a diminishing of Parliament. I have heard one Minister recently criticise sections of the media for reduced or, in some cases, non-existent coverage of the Oireachtas, but that is being led by members of the Cabinet, most of whom cannot even manage to come to the House for the Order of Business anymore.</P>
      <P>Given the amount of time the Nice treaty took up on the public affairs agenda over the past year, it is not appropriate that motion 12<i>b</i> be put to the House without debate. I see no reason the Tánaiste would not be prepared to agree to a short debate on the formal passing of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to No. 12<i>a </i>because the situation raised by my colleague, Deputy Cuffe, regarding the spatial strategy ties in with the Supplementary Estimates as an indication of a back to front approach from Government regarding proper planning and financial management. We had the national development plan and now, long afterwards, we are beginning to hear about the spatial strategy. I object to the manner in which the Government is planning the country financially and spatially and suggest that the debate on spatial strategy should be held in this House. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle &ndash; unfortunately you did not facilitate Deputy Cuffe &ndash; to think again and facilitate a debate on the spatial strategy which is not mentioned on the Order of Business and yet it is the news of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning certain Members of this House had the opportunity to have a preview of the national spatial strategy proposals in the Davenport Hotel. This document has national implications for constituencies throughout the length and breadth of the jurisdiction and impacts on Border counties and on an island-wide basis. I find it incredible that there was an opportunity for the select few to preview the detail of these proposals when Members of this House returned by the overall electorate only received copies in their pigeon holes minutes before the commencement of business this morn<Col N="624" />ing. This is unacceptable. Is this a national spatial strategy proposal, or is it a Fianna Fáil-PD proposal? Let us call it what it is. It is not national because the elected voices of a significant section of the people represented in this House are not privy&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to consider that it would be totally inoperable to set a limit of 20 minutes on this period of our business. One of the great difficulties is that we were given a legislative programme which is turning out to be a work of fiction. Numerous Bills were promised for 2002 and the reason we have to ask questions is that they have not been published. <Col N="639" />The maternity Bill and a Bill relating to refugees are outstanding and we were told, in respect of a previous legislative programme, that they would be published in 2002. It is now not even known when they will be published. No date has been set.</P>

One of the last rights left to Deputies in this House is to ask a question. It is not the Ceann Comhairle's fault, the Government has demeaned the House and Members by making major announcements outside and by the Taoiseach absenting himself on Thursdays. The Ceann Comhairle, as an impartial Chairman, should show some vision by saying that if any Member wishes to ask a question on legislation or matters relevant to the House, they should be authorised to do so. Whether that takes 164 minutes on Thursday or whatever, the Chair &ndash;<Col N="640" />in its impartiality &ndash; should be entitled to do so. This is one of our last rights because the Government has diminished every representative and every right they have had here&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is intended to circulate it. In commending the Bill, I would like to set out in brief what it contains and why it is necessary. Given its relevance to the future of Europe, I also wish to make some comments on the wider background against which the Bill is being debated. The decision to ratify the Treaty of Nice was taken by the people in the referendum on 19 October. However, a few further, essentially technical, measures must be taken in law before the State can actually ratify the treaty. Passage of this Bill is one of those measures.</P>
      <P>A fundamental aspect of European Union law is that Community legislation has direct legal effect in each of the member states. This was recognised and allowed for in the original constitutional amendment enabling Ireland to join the EEC, as it then was, in 1973. The European Communities Act, 1972, listed the various treaties and other acts which would have direct legal effect in the State, and allowed for further implementing regulations to be made by Ministers. As the original Communities have grown and developed through successive treaties, it has been necessary in each case to amend the European Communities Act accordingly to take account of these next treaties. On each previous occasion, before Ireland has ratified an EU treaty, it has, through legislation, made relevant provisions of the treaty part of the domestic law of the State, so that at the time of ratification it is fully able to discharge its obligations. That is the purpose of this Bill. In proposing this measure, we are acting on the authority given to us by the people in the referendum.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains three sections and further amends the 1972 Act. Section 1 is the principal operative part of the Bill. It adds the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Nice to the list of treaties and other instruments contained in the definition of the treaties governing the European Communities in section l(1) of the 1972 Act, as amended. These are Articles 1.15 and 2 to 10, together with annexed protocols. For ease of use, the 1972 Act, as amended. contains a table with a complete list of the treaties governing the European Communities. Section 1(2) of this Bill adds reference to the Treaty of Nice to that table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 is a new section, added to the Bill in the Seanad by the Government, reflecting an amendment tabled by the Labour Party in the Seanad. It ensures that options and discretion available under the Treaty of Nice, referred to in the new Article 29.4.8º of the Constitution, fall within the remit of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act, 2002. This is the legislation under which all EU legislative and policy proposals can <Col N="646" />now be scrutinised by relevant Oireachtas committees. This was always intended to be the case. The new section makes the position totally clear and puts the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains normal provisions concerning the short title, collective citation, construction and commencement. It provides that the Act will come into operation on such day as may be appointed by order made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That day will coincide with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice itself.</P>
    <P>If Members will bear with me, it is worth outlining briefly the logic behind the selection of those Articles of the Treaty of Nice which, through this Bill, are to be made part of domestic law. Article 1 of the treaty amends aspects of the Treaty on European Union. Measures adopted under the treaty in the foreign policy, justice and home affairs areas differ from directives, regulations and decisions adopted under the Community treaties in the main social and economic sectors in that they do not have direct legal effect. The obligations which are created are intergovernmental and purely international in scope. For the most part the European Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction in these areas. Therefore the Bill does not include reference to Articles 1.1 or 1.14 of the treaty. Article 1.15, however, amends provisions relating to those limited areas under the treaty in which the European Court of Justice has jurisdiction. It is therefore necessary to include it in the list of those provisions of the Treaty of Nice which, through this Bill, are being made part of our domestic law.</P>
    <P>In the areas of justice and home affairs, some instruments once adopted by the Council require subsequent legislative implementation by member states. In preparing this legislation, consideration was again given to whether provisions relating to justice and home affairs matters should be brought within the terms of the European Communities Act. This would allow for justice and home affairs legislation to be given domestic effect by regulation rather than by primary legislation. However, as was the case when the matter was last considered as part of the Treaty of Amsterdam, it was felt that these matters are of sufficient weight and sensitivity to merit implementation through primary, rather than secondary, legislation.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 to 10 of the treaty, together with annexed protocols, represent the main body of substantive amendments to the European Communities Treaties under the Nice treaty. Article 2 amends various aspects of the treaty, establishing the European Community. It is much the most substantial of the Articles. Article 3 amends provisions of the treaty establishing the EURATOM. Article 4 amends aspects of the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. Article 5 amends the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. Article 6 amends the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" />Articles 7 to 10 are part of the treaty's transitional and final provisions, and provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for certain repeals consequent to the new provisions of the Treaty of Nice. All of these Articles are therefore included in the Bill. Articles 11, 12 and 13 also form part of the treaty's transitional and final provisions concerning matters of international treaty law. They provide that the treaty is concluded for an unlimited period. They set out how it is to be ratified and when it is to enter into force. They list those languages in which it is to be equally authentic. It is not deemed necessary that these aspects of the Treaty of Nice become part of domestic law.</P>
    <P>There are four protocols to the treaty which form part of the Bill. Two are particularly important. The Protocol on Enlargement sets out the new arrangements governing the European Parliament, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the composition of the Commission. The Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice makes significant changes to the operation of the court. They are intended to allow it cope with enlargement and with a far greater case load.</P>
    <P>As I hope will be apparent to Deputies, and in keeping with past practice, the terms of the Bill have been carefully drafted to ensure that only those provisions of the Treaty of Nice which it is necessary to make part of domestic law prior to ratification are made part of Irish law. The Government has not sought to go any further than is necessary to achieve that aim. Once the Bill has been enacted it will be possible for Ireland to draw up and to deposit its instrument of ratification with the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome, which maintains the archive of all the treaties as a depository of the treaties.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice states that it will enter into force &ldquo;on the first day of the second month following that in which the instrument of ratification is deposited by the last signatory state to fulfil that formality&rdquo;. As Ireland will be the last signatory state to take that important step, if we deposit our instrument of ratification before the end of this year, as the Government expects, the treaty will enter into force at the start of February.</P>
    <P>The timing of this could not be more significant. As Deputies will be aware, there are twelve countries currently negotiating to join the European Union. Of these, ten are expected to be ready to sign an accession treaty later in the spring. In a very real way, Ireland will open the door to allow them in.</P>
    <P>The enlargement negotiations for these ten countries are drawing to a close. The European Council meeting in Brussels at the end of October, in welcoming the outcome of the Irish referendum on Nice as paving the way for the treaty to enter into force, endorsed a Commission paper which stated that the ten countries in question Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, fulfil the political criteria <Col N="648" />and will be able to fulfil the economic criteria to assume the obligations of membership from the beginning of 2004.</P>
    <P>The Council decided to allow the Union to present negotiating positions to the candidate states on all outstanding issues by early November, with a view to concluding enlargement negotiations at the European Council in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December and to signing the accession treaty in Athens in April 2003. This process remains on track.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that all of the candidate counties have made enormous sacrifices to come this far, achieving the standards necessary to join the European Union has forced all of them to make difficult choices and to take tough decisions. Despite the attempts of a great many people to offer reassurance, there is no doubt that the result of the first referendum on Nice was a serious blow to their hopes, throwing into doubt the European Union's ability to achieve the timetable to which we had all been working. The result of the second referendum was, therefore, particularly welcome in the ten countries concerned.</P>
    <P>In all of the discussions we have had here on the future direction of the European Union, whether in the debate that preceded the referendum, in the National Forum on Europe or elsewhere, there has been an overwhelming national consensus in favour of enlargement. Irish people&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated a few moments ago, the discussions we have had about Europe have shown an overwhelming national consensus in favour of enlargement. Irish people, who have felt the pain of conflict and division, see the expansion of the Union and the ending of the unnatural division of the European continent as a project of historic import. When we ratify the Nice treaty, allowing it to enter into force, another important step towards the achievement of that goal will have been taken. Ireland will be the last member state to ratify the treaty and the Government is conscious of why this is the case. Had the people not <Col N="650" />voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the first referendum, we would have expected to have completed the necessary procedures more than a year ago. While this would have made our lives considerably simpler, we would not have had the thorough and detailed debate on the future of the European Union and Ireland's role in it that preceded the second referendum. We have all gained from the experience, difficult as it certainly was, and the lessons we have learned will stand us in good stead for the future.</P>
    <P>It is probably true that successive Governments tended to take comfort from the generally strong support which the people continued to feel towards the EU, assuming it would automatically translate into a favourable outcome in a related referendum. The result of the first referendum on the Nice treaty, therefore, was a wake-up call in many ways. It forced us to do more to listen, explain and respond to the concerns people raised. That we did so sincerely and, I hope, effectively, was reflected in the outcome of the second vote. I pay tribute to Deputies and indeed to many other people outside the House who did much to ensure a positive result in the second referendum. I do not doubt that the result was the right one for Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>We have learned valuable lessons &ndash; for example, last year's result made it clear that we were not engaging the people sufficiently well in wider debates about the future of Europe. Many people felt that things were changing in a way that gave them little opportunity to discuss what was happening and to make their views and opinions heard in a meaningful way. In response to this concern, the Government established the National Forum on Europe which, under the excellent chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes, has made an enormously important contribution to furthering the debate on European issues. I commend the decision to take the debate out of Dublin Castle and into many parts of the country, rural, urban and suburban.</P>
    <P>As a result of the roadshow conducted by the forum, the debate on Europe has a much more localised and genuine flavour. Deputies will be aware that discussions on the future shape of the EU are continuing, including at the European convention, to which I will return in a moment. The Government is pleased that, having played such an important part in facilitating discussion on enlargement and other aspects of the Treaty of Nice, the forum will continue to play a central role in ensuring that Irish people have a full say.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the first referendum reflected a feeling that EU legislation was being imposed without a chance for elected representatives in the Oireachtas to examine it properly. As the House is aware, the Joint Committee on European Affairs is at the centre of new scrutiny measures which ensure that every legislative or policy proposal from Brussels is given appropriate consideration in the Oireachtas. The committee's work began in July and its arrangements now have a statutory footing in the form of the <Col N="651" />European Union (Scrutiny) Act, 2002. The work of the committee is a significant step towards addressing the democratic deficit sometimes associated with Europe. I pay tribute to the members of the committee, especially its Chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell. The committee is doing an excellent and effective job in a new and challenging area. It is in everyone's interest that Governments are held to account.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Nice treaty revealed a worry that membership of the EU somehow tends to diminish Irish identity and difference. I have never believed that this is the case and many people would argue that Ireland's culture and identity have been reinvigorated and enriched through our participation in and membership of the EU. Some people fear that our distinctive traditional policy of military neutrality may be encroached upon without people being given the chance to make a decision on the matter. In the declarations made at Seville earlier this year, however, the Government and its European partners made clear that this is not the case. Nothing in the EU treaties impinges on Ireland's traditionally neutral status. In an effort to offer reassurance that no change will be made without the people's approval, the second referendum on the Nice treaty proposed a constitutional prohibition on Ireland joining an EU common defence programme without a further referendum on the matter. I am pleased that, as a result of last month's vote, this position is now entrenched in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If I was asked what was the single most important lesson learned during the course of the Nice treaty referendum campaigns, I would say it is that the Government and elected representatives need to listen more carefully and respond more actively. This is an enduring lesson that we will do well to remember, especially as the debate begins to take shape at the European Convention on the Future of Europe. Under the Laeken declaration, the convention is charged with examining ways in which the Union can be brought closer to its citizens, play a full and active part in a rapidly changing global environment and be better organised to meet the challenges ahead. This is a task about which we should feel positive and enthusiastic, particularly given our recent experiences.</P>
    <P>The convention brings together representatives of Governments and Parliaments from member states and applicant countries, together with MEPs and representatives of the Commission. It has been meeting since February under its President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, but its work has recently begun to gather pace. Ireland has been well represented at the convention by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who has played a full and active part as the Government's representative since his predecessor in the role, Mr. Ray MacSharry, stepped down after the general election. I also pay tribute to the work of his colleagues representing the Oireachtas, especially <Col N="652" />Deputy John Bruton, who is a member of the convention's presidium.</P>
    <P>The convention represents a significant opportunity to make Europe more relevant, transparent and accountable. Many positive suggestions have been made as to how this can be achieved. There is widespread support, for example, for a simpler and more coherently organised treaty, an approach that was reflected in the preliminary draft constitutional treaty. If the necessary subtleties are maintained in the various policy areas, a single unified text will be a positive step towards making the treaties more accessible to the lay person. The proposed removal of the distinction between the Union and the Communities would be a further helpful step towards simplification. We would welcome measures aimed at giving more meaning and substance to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. It is clear from the convention's discussions that no great appetite exists in most areas for a significant transfer of competence to the Union. Equally, nobody is contemplating a tilt in the other direction by transferring competence back to member states.</P>
    <P>Valery Giscard d'Estaing has stated his intention to seek an agreement that will endure for a generation or more, stand the test of time and bring to an end the sense that the Union is engaged in a constant process of reconstruction and development. Such an outcome would be welcomed by most people in Ireland. There are challenges ahead for Ireland as for all member states, but we should keep our eyes on the big picture &ndash; a more intelligible and transparent Europe &ndash; and not get lost in the plethora of proposals that exist. The Government will continue to take an active part in the proceedings of the convention. Genuine and meaningful steps can and should be taken towards giving the people greater ownership of the European project. From our point of view, it is a question of striking the right balance, of protecting what is good about the Union while preparing for the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>That is all for the future. I know that Deputies will continue to follow matters with great interest and to make an intelligent and meaningful contribution through speeches in debates such as this. Today's task is to take a further step towards ratification of the Treaty of Nice. As I hope I have explained, the Bill is a simple one, but it is significant. I warmly commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a real danger that the Government will return to its bad old habits in relation to European affairs. I was hugely concerned to see a headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that read: &ldquo;Open contempt for Convention on Future of Europe may cost Irish dear.&rdquo; The article over which it appeared was written by a respected journalist, European correspondent Denis Staunton. He outlines very tellingly the lack of input from the Government to the convention. The Minister acknowledged the import<Col N="653" />ance of the work of the convention in shaping the future direction of Europe, but the Government has little or no input into it. Worse than that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has virtually dismissed its work and made it clear that, as far as he is concerned, any decisions of consequence would be made at the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference, which is technically correct. However, on that basis he seems to think that the work of the convention is, to a large degree, irrelevant.</P>
      <P>The contrast between the approach adopted by the Government to the convention and that of other Governments is becoming clear. The two major continental powers, Germany and France, now that their relationship has been restored, have recently appointed their Foreign Ministers as representatives at the convention. I have a warning for the Government. The old approach of taking the people for granted, as in the case of the Nice referendum, has been seen to be a failure. I admit that the Government has accepted this and it had to mend its ways before the second referendum was held.</P>

      <P>I do not want to see the Government falling back into the same old ways. It would only be storing up trouble for the future by standing idly by while important decisions are being arrived at in the convention. From the Opposition point of view, every effort is being made to provide as significant an input as possible from Ireland. My colleague, Deputy John Bruton, who is virtually living in Europe at present as a member of both the convention and its governing presidium, is trying his best to project an approach that is in the interest of Ireland. Mr. Proinsias De Rossa MEP has also been making significant contributions. Others, including Deputy Gormley, have been trying to influence the direction of the convention in the best interest of Ireland as they see it.</P>

      <P>This is a most dangerous situation. If the attitude of the Government is to be that the same old approach will do for the next treaty, we will encounter big trouble. Important decisions will be made at the convention. They may not be legally binding or ratified at the Intergovernmental Conference, but they will have an enormous influence on the ultimate outcome of that conference. If we do not contribute at Government level &ndash; not just at parliamentary level, which is working fine &ndash; and lay out our stall on behalf of Ireland, decisions will be made which, as highlighted in the newspaper headline to which I refer, may cost the Irish dearly. To some degree, that view is reinforced by the Minister's contribution in which he referred to the convention in broad terms.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 2002, This is an obvious opportunity for the Government to outline its approach in detail, to engage in a debate on this matter and to inform us of what it will seek to have accepted by the convention. That has not happened. Instead we heard broad, bland phrases to the effect that the Government will take an active part in the proceedings and that the Minister believes that genuine and meaningful steps can and should be taken towards giving people greater ownership of the European project. What does that mean? I have been around long enough to know that Ministers can produce bland words to cover any situation, but we have gone past the stage of blandness.</P>
      <P>We know what the Government does not want. There are a couple of simple things that we did not want to come about through the Nice Treaty, namely, tax harmonisation or of the transfer of dealings with tax from unanimity to qualified majority voting. What else does the Government believe in? For what is it fighting at the Convention on the Future of Europe? What is its philosophy? I know where I stand; I believe that the EU is a work in progress and that it will evolve. I do not accept the approach of Giscard d'Estaing that what happens at the convention, followed by the Intergovernmental Conference, will put the matter to bed for a generation. The European Union is a unique body which will continue to advance over the years.</P>
      <P>I favour further integration in areas of benefit to Ireland and Europe, such as the environment, social policy, cross-border co-operation and crime and especially the fight against narcotics and international terrorism. I am completely open in this regard. What is the Government's approach? Does it favour changes in relation to the institutions, which might involve the direct election of the President of the European Commission? If so, why not debate that? Does it favour direct election by the people or by the European Parliament or does it favour direct election at all? This is just one of the issues. Is the Government in favour of a second house in the European Parliament? Is it in favour of the legal enforcement of the charter on fundamental rights?</P>

      <Col N="655" />Does the Government support a further extension of the powers of scrutiny of the Select Committee on European Affairs? I put forward a proposal in this regard, but I accepted the Bill that was passed. This is just a stage on the way, however. I want the Select Committee on European Affairs to have powers which would allow it to vet appointments by Ireland to European institutions. I refer here to the appointment of a Commissioner or of somebody to the Court of Auditors or the European financial institutions. If it had possessed such powers in the past, a number of difficulties might have been avoided. In the Convention on Europe and in this House we should have a genuine debate based on a detailed setting out by the Government of what it is seeking from the Convention. What have we instead? A report from the Convention on Europe suggesting that the Government is making no meaningful input. It is certainly not making any meaningful input here.</P>
    <P>A Member of this House, Deputy John Bruton, is a member of the Presidium of the Convention. He has never been asked by the Government for a briefing at any time on the inner body directing the affairs of the Convention. We must get serious and ensure there is an understanding at Government level of the changes taking place as a consequence of the work of the Convention on Europe. The Government must make its input and ensure its proposals are fully debated in this House. We must also involve broader society and avoid the late night bargaining on the Nice treaty that led to a cobbled together compromise that took the people by surprise. The Government must not fall back into the bad old ways that led to problems in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the first Nice referendum was a wake up call. It was, and the Government had to respond to it. It had to accept our views on how to deal with it from the point of view of the declarations from the European Council and the change of approach for the second referendum. Having passed the referendum, this is no time for the Government to sit on its hands awaiting the same disaster. It is vital that we look ahead and involve the Oireachtas and the electorate in the debate. There will be another referendum in two or three years time and we should involve the people in the ongoing debate in Europe.</P>
    <P>An issue that always arises and that has not been satisfactorily clarified is our security and defence policy. It will arise not only in the context of the next referendum, but much sooner if President Bush decides to have a go in Baghdad.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably right. When neutrality is raised, I wonder what people imagine it to mean. It is like asking how long is a piece of string. It is important to be clear where <Col N="656" />we stand on this issue. We are not neutral in the conflict against international terrorism, the struggle against ethnic cleansing or other gross violations of human rights. I know where we are not neutral but there should be a greater understanding of where we are neutral and what that implies. If neutrality involves not being part of a mutual defence pact, and the Oireachtas deciding our line on any issue, let that be clear. The time is right for our neutrality to be examined in full and a comprehensive White Paper should be produced to address our position on it in the new Europe and an uncertain world. That would provide clarity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I congratulate him on his elevation. In his speech, however, he said that, look<Col N="657" />ing back on the journey we have made, if asked what was the single most important lesson to be learned, the answer would be that the Government and elected representatives generally need to listen more carefully and respond more actively. We have got off to a bad start. Whoever is organising business on the Government side seems to be unaware that the National Forum on Europe is meeting in Dublin Castle as we speak. People who would have liked to contribute to this debate cannot be here. Due to an administrative cock up the normal courtesy of having a copy of the speech was not available. The Minister for State at the Department of Foreign of Affairs, with responsibility for Europe, who would be better informed than the well informed Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is not here.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of a party that has vigorously supported this project, it is obvious the Government has not followed the admonition in the Minister of State's speech. It has not learned or listened. One reason for that is that the Department of Finance is not resourcing the European section of the Department of Foreign Affairs sufficiently.</P>
      <P>Also, it is not resourcing the scrutiny subcommittee of the Committee on European Affairs. It is not possible for those of us who are members of that committee, with the normal requirements of a Dáil Deputy, to go through the documentation piling up on our desks and to scrutinise it in a meaningful manner without back-up resources. This is not a matter for the Minister of State but, presumably, someone in the Government will read the text of this debate. We will not meet our requirements if we do not put our money where our mouth is, and the Minister will not have listened. The cost of the second referendum was way in excess of anything we are looking for in terms of resources.</P>
      <P>This process ratifies the Nice treaty and transposes into domestic law those sections of Community legislation which require to be transposed through secondary legislation. It makes all the other adjustments in a somewhat complex and technical manner, which I will not go into in great detail. I appreciate, however, the fact that in regard to justice and home affairs, the Government wisely decided to retain the instrument of primary legislation rather than secondary legislation because of the sensitive nature of many of these measures and the fact that it is not accountable to the courts in Luxembourg or, in most cases, to the European Parliament, even though there have been some changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, the primary purpose of the legislation is to give effect to enlargement. Much of the Minister's speech in this House and his colleague's speech in the other House referred to Ireland being the last country to ratify, that the process of enlargement can now proceed and it is quite possible that in the first half of 2004, under Ireland's Presidency, the actual formal accession of the candidate states will take place. Sadly, we are not taking full advantage nor are we properly <Col N="658" />prepared to do that task. For example, there are 12 accession candidate states, including Bulgaria and Romania, who will not be part of the first ten but undoubtedly will be down the road. Unlike each of the 15 member states, with the exception of Luxembourg, we do not as yet have embassies in all those accession candidate states. That is a matter of resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs in the previous Government spoke about his desire to open embassies, but we have not yet done so. If we are in the business of making alliances with other small member states, and if we are trying to help other countries become potential partners, decision-makers and co-decision-makers with us in the changing political structure that is the enlarged European Union, we need to get to know the new members and we should begin by having embassies in those countries. Many of these countries do not make much distinction between Ireland and the rest of these islands, except in recent times when they looked at the performance of the Irish economy. Therefore, there is a requirement for the Government to announce a programme indicating when it will introduce the embassies, even though I know it will be the first casualty of the retrenchment of Government finances. It is an unwise economy because it would be an expensive decision from Ireland's point of view.</P>
    <P>This is not just about embassies. Enlargement requires us, in anticipation of the membership of these countries, to enter into bilateral programmes of help and assistance. We have an enormous ODA budget, part of which could be considered from the point of view of bilateral programmes. There are other programmes in the context of existing budgetary provisions that would enable applicant and candidate countries to come to Ireland, send personnel to Ireland and learn procedures relating to the <i>aquis communitaire.</i> English has become <i>de facto</i> the first working language of the enlarged Community and Ireland is uniquely placed as a small member state whose working language is English to offer these facilities. I know the IPA has done so in the past but the programme now needs to be accelerated, and we are not taking advantage of that.</P>
    <P>The last thing I would say in regard to the enlarged European Union is that it has been the experience of any of us who campaigned in the recent referendum, on whatever side, that it was very difficult much of the time to engage the attention of people about the proposed changes in the decision-making rules of the European Union when many, if not most, of them had no idea of what the existing rules were. I invite the Minister of State to consider a Government initiative, which would probably come from the European affairs section of the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, whereby some form of information, communication, wall chart or whatever would be put up in every primary and secondary school classroom showing how decisions are made in the European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" />The Minister of State may recall that in 1966, the fiftieth anniversary of the insurrection, a wall chart and documentation was put into every classroom. It is impossible to discuss changes in the off-side rule in soccer if people do not know what the primary rule is. It is virtually impossible to have a rational debate with people, many of whom are influential in our society, about changes in the operation of the European Union if they do not fundamentally understand the role of the Commission, the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, the role of the Parliament and the powers of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Without that understanding of what is currently in place, any meaningful discussion on the outcome of the convention will be seriously impaired because it would be a discussion taking place against a set of changes and proposals to an existing infrastructure which is not properly comprehended by the rest of the Community.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister of State had a chance to read Denis Staunton's article, but if it is true it is seriously disturbing. I have no reason to doubt its veracity and I must say it confirms other things I have heard recently. It confirms the isolation of the Irish Government and, as someone who had the privilege to be in the same position as the Minister of State, it confirms an Iveagh House-Department of Finance congenital response about which I have written and spoken elsewhere, and which runs as follows:</P>
    <P>Let us not put our head above the parapet in respect of anything. Let us wait and see as to what is emerging. Let us be agreed as to what it is we are opposed to and not look for allies for anything which we might actually have a positive view upon, because we do not need to, in fact, have a positive view on anything because we are net recipients of largesse from Europe. Therefore, let us not rock the boat but defend our own interests.</P>
    <P>That caricature has characterised many attitudes from different Departments through successive Administrations. It is partly informed by a lack of resources in the European Union section of Iveagh House and other Departments. It is a policy we can no longer pursue for two reasons. First, the work of the convention is of such a serious nature that we cannot afford not to have our voice heard at the appropriate time. The informal meeting convened by the Dutch Ministry for Foreign Affairs of similar small member states and candidate states was one to which we should have been asked. If we had an articulate voice expressing Ireland's point of view in regard to the constitutional evolution of the future of the European Union, it would have been incomprehensible that the Irish representative would not have been invited. If, as the article suggests, that person was not invited, it indicates we do not have a positive view to express and that we are simply there with a watching brief, like a lawyer in court, for a secondary client who may be named in proceedings <Col N="660" />and, therefore, will jump in at the appropriate time to defend their interests. That is not the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the relevant Ministers what the Irish view is in regard to the emerging structure and outcome of the convention. If, as reported by Denis Staunton in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times,</i> the Government thinks it can afford to ignore the proceedings of the convention and it is business as usual with an intergovernmental conference like at Nice, Amsterdam or Maastricht, then it has totally and utterly missed the sea change that has occurred throughout the European Union.</P>

      <P>The Nice treaty was a disaster, and I am on record as saying so, in terms of the incompetence of the French and the way in which it was negotiated over four nights. I want to know now, not at three minutes to midnight, the Irish Government view with regard to a written constitution for the European Union and whether the Government wants to have the Charter of Fundamental Rights incorporated into that constitution and have it accessible in legal terms. I know of the conservative neo-liberal reservations of the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Is that the Irish Government view? While it is consistent with the views of former Deputies O'Malley and O'Kennedy, does it reflect the view of the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly the progressive element of that party?</P>
      <P>What is the Government view of the election and selection of the President of the Commission? I want to know the Government view with regard to the balance of decision-making powers between the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Parliament, and the balance between the unique legal creature that is the European Union, as Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned. What should the balance be between the mixture of intergovernmentalism and the Community decision-making that makes it so unique? What is the Government attitude with regard to the Union becoming a legal entity so that, for example, the Union would represent Europe at the Security Council and France and Britain would give up their Security Council seats so that the council is broadened and enlarged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this debate. The Labour Party will support it and that is consistent with what we said during the Nice treaty campaign. However, I am disappointed as there may be a reversion to old ways. If this is the way the Government intends to proceed with European business in this or any other Chamber following the second Nice referendum, the admonition set out in the Minister's <Col N="661" />speech may simply be for other people but does not apply to the Government.</P>

I confirm what Deputy Quinn has said and what was stated in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times,</i> namely, that the Government is not taking the convention seriously. I regret that but it is the case. There may well be reasons for it and I would give the benefit of the doubt if possible. The general election intervened and the Nice treaty referendum was held. The Government may have taken its eye off the ball. The Nice treaty campaign is finished. The Irish people have spoken and, as a democrat, I accept the will of the people even though they spoke for a second time, something I regret. I accept what is before us today but the Government, having succeeded with the Nice treaty with much help from the Opposition&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems the Government is adopting the Seamus Heaney approach, whatever you say, say nothing. The Government is sitting back and putting nothing in writing. I have tried to make progress. I regularly phone people in Iveagh House and had a good meeting with them yesterday. However, they must be circumspect because this is a peculiar situation, which I will now outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job of those in Iveagh House is to serve the Government. They are dealing with what they see as a diverse group from the Opposition. They <Col N="662" />would possibly see Deputy John Bruton and Mr. De Rossa MEP as federalists. I read a very interesting article by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, which categorised them as arch-federalists, so there may be a suspicion of them. Those working in Iveagh House may look at me and say that I am the person who tried to undermine them at the time of the Nice treaty referendum and that they must be careful with me.</P>
    <P>Those are backward views. The Government will have to accept that representatives in Europe should work as a team. They should go there to get a good deal for Ireland and that is the spirit in which things should be done.</P>

I am also trying to get a message across to the Minister for Finance that there is a Franco-German alliance. Those countries have just put forward a paper on defence. We must get to the nitty-gritty of their proposals. The Joschka Fischer paper proposes applying enhanced co-operation to the area of defence. This was clear to me at the time of the Nice treaty referendum although my words fell on deaf ears.

      <P>We should not get into such partisanship now. I accept the result of the Nice treaty referendum as I accepted previous results. However, Deputy Lenihan should know that much of what I warned has come to pass. With regard to militarisation and the partnership for peace, it was interesting to see the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, at the Prague summit and to hear Deputy Lenihan's comments following the Nice treaty referendum that the PfP was not a military organisation. The reality of the Government commitment is clear.</P>
      <P>When talking in the defence working group, it is interesting that Ireland is never referred to as neutral, it is simply referred to as non-aligned, and that is how we are seen. I agree with Deputy Quinn although I probably disagree with his views on the substance of neutrality. A debate is required in this country. The convention is trying to separate defence from external affairs. European security and defence policy must be a fundamental part of the common foreign and security policy. Once that is moved out, difficulties will be experienced.</P>
      <P>The events of 11 September are increasingly used as a pretext for further military spending. It is as if terrorism was invented on 11 September. Each country in the European Union has experienced terrorism and they know that it cannot be defeated by military means alone. This is something I have tried forcefully to get across to Lord Robertson when he addressed the committee. I hope he and others have taken this on board. However, there is a fundamental question on defence that must be faced up to.</P>
      <P>There are those at the convention who want to move away from the United States and NATO on defence. That is fine, but they must realise that it has very severe cost implications for the defence spending of the EU. This country would have to substantially increase its defence spending. Do those people, including Green Party colleagues such as Mr. Joschka Fischer, really believe EU militarism is superior to American militarism? Do they want to tell their electorates that they want to spend more money on arms? I certainly do not want to do that. It is much more important to invest in health, the environment and education.</P>

It was a very deliberate decision and has left the back door open for us to join NATO. Deputy Harney's maxim that we are closer to Boston than to Berlin is very true. We are much closer to joining NATO than a European common defence organisation. That is where the Government is coming from, but it is always unstated, nothing is put in writing and the <Col N="664" />Government is playing its cards very close to its chest. It is a bad long-term strategy. Once the Government goes to the Intergovernmental Conference and starts to play hardball we will be asked where Ireland has been for the past ten months.</P>

They made the grandiose statement that the young people of Europe want more qualified majority voting. I can think of many things the young people of Europe might want, like more sex, drugs and rock and roll but I am sure most of them do not know what qualified majority voting is.</P>

      <P>We need to be realistic when talking about citizens. The citizens do not know about qualified majority voting but they want to be involved in the European project. The one good thing about the referendum process is that our citizens know more about the Nice treaty than those of any other EU member state. We require more involvement from the citizens of Europe and it can be done if the proper institutional changes are made. Unfortunately, the convention does not seem to have the bottle, or the wit, to do that.</P>

      <P>I take no pleasure in speaking on this Bill as it codifies aspects of the Nice treaty into domestic law. Sinn Féin remains steadfast in its opposition to the treaty, the substance of which we outlined in two referenda campaigns. Moreover, we remain opposed to the agenda the Nice treaty represents at international level, within the EU and in Ireland. It has an elitist, militarist, big-business agenda and it is not the agenda we want to see driving developments in Europe, Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>There is no need to go into a Nice treaty campaign post mortem other than to remind the pro-Nice treaty parties that the result indicated a significant sector of the electorate remain committed to voicing their ongoing concerns around democracy, neutrality, militarisation and the influence and power of the global big business agenda that dominates the EU. Despite this very clear statement, the fast tracking of this Bill, as with the fast tracking of the treaty debate and the European Union Bill, confirms the Government believes that unless the people vote its way their vote and their voices do not count.</P>

      <Col N="665" />During the most recent referendum campaign, Sinn Féin emphasised that the Government &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign was yet another campaign of Government lies. In the context of this Bill I am forced to return to this assertion. The Government's stated neutrality commitment was a lie &ndash; it cannot be dressed up in any other way. In the days and weeks after securing the referendum result, the Government signalled its intention to support and co-operate in the impending war in Iraq and sent a Minister of State to participate in Ireland's first NATO summit to discuss NATO expansion. Only now are we hearing the post-Nice rumblings&mdash;</P>

      <P>These rumblings are not only signals of the anti-neutrality policy shifts to come, they belong to an anti-neutrality policy continuum. The Government has increasingly pursued a policy that includes a reversal of its stated position on Ireland joining NATO's Partnership for Peace, committing troops to the EU's Rapid Reaction Force and appointment of an Irish Army officer to one of the top EU military positions in Brussels. It includes allowing Ireland to be used as a staging ground for the war in Afghanistan and the impending war in Iraq without seeking prior Dáil debate, much less approval.</P>
      <P>The development of the EU is now reaching a critical stage. One month ago today the Convention on the Future of Europe presidium released its highly controversial draft EU constitutional treaty. The treaty, which will be debated in the coming months and finalised next summer, represents the next frontier, or the site of the struggle in shaping Europe. All those who opposed the Nice treaty in the interests of democracy, neutrality and sovereignty, as republicans did, will watch these developments very closely. I reiterate my call for an early debate in this House on the proposals for a draft EU constitution to allow the representatives of the people have a full input in the process. It is very well for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to treat the convention with, as <i>The Irish Times</i> says today, &ldquo;open contempt&rdquo;, but he cannot and must not treat this House, and, by extension, the electorate, with the same contempt.</P>

      <P>I campaigned for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Nice treaty referendum and strongly support the enlargement of the EU. The &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the first referendum gave all of us cause for concern. We are on the road to enlargement but must learn lessons from what the electorate told us. Many people have said we should look at the concerns of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and we should, but we must recognise that many people that voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; have genuine and grave concerns about our involvement in Europe, the direction it will take and the role we will play in it. I am one of those people who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. However, I still have concerns even as a Member of this House. People might ask how I, as a Member of Dáil Éireann and of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, can be concerned. I listened to Deputy Gormley, one of our representatives at the convention, express his concerns about his role there. That is enough to make me more concerned. What is being discussed, negotiated and decided at the convention will have major implications for the future direction of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reflect on my role as a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I am a new Deputy who has an interest and a lot to learn. However, people in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and nationally expect me to be their eyes and ears and to help to eliminate the democratic deficit which both &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters <Col N="667" />recognised in the recent referendum. The reality of my situation is reams of paper and armfuls of documents which I cannot trawl through. I can scan them, but I cannot examine them. I cannot put my hand on my heart and say to the electorate that I am its eyes and ears. I need greater resources and backup. The committee structure may need to be changed so that I can do my work effectively. I cannot carry out my role effectively as a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. The promises made to the electorate before the recent Nice treaty referendum about the role of the Joint Committee on European Affairs have not been honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill which seeks to include certain sections of the Nice treaty with a list of EU treaties in the European Communities Act, 1972. The Bill arises from the resounding acceptance by the electorate of the Nice treaty in the recent referendum. The part played by the Forum on Europe to convince the electorate to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; cannot be overstressed.</P>
      <P>Some 40% of the electorate voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum. It is appropriate that the fears of those people are adequately addressed and that they are given concrete assurances on issues such as neutrality and common European defence. One of the major fears expressed during the referendum campaign related to the democratic deficit. This fear looms large in the minds of many people and it should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I hope the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs will be given an expanded role in terms of vetting proposed EU legislation. The joint committee played a significant role in the run up to the referendum. It received presentations from delegations from several of the first tier applicant countries for EU membership and from Commissioner Chris Patten. There was tremendous enthusiasm for EU membership among the applicant countries and confident anticipation of Ireland's acceptance of the Nice treaty in the first referendum. The hopes and aspirations of countries in the second tier were dashed on that occasion. However, they greatly appreciated the result of the October referendum.</P>
      <P>Military neutrality was an issue of major concern to many people during the referendum campaign. It was made patently clear during the debate that our neutrality would not be compromised. It was further established that any change in status could only happen through a constitutional referendum. That helped to reassure the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be an important step for Ireland to establish embassies in the applicant countries, many of which have already set up embassies in Dublin. Several of the second tier applicant states have already opened embassies in Dublin. This legislation is a <i>sine qua non</i> to clear the way for <Col N="668" />the final ratification of the Nice treaty. It is also a further step on the road to completing the enlargement process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the Bill. I am particularly happy for the 12 applicant countries and that the historic process of EU enlargement can proceed as planned. We have always had a generous spirit and I am glad these countries will have the same chance we had. We have done well out of Europe. However, I would be happier if the west had done better. They got EU Structural Funds on our backs. We worked hard for Objective One status. However, when the money is not available, what good are higher grants? </P>
      <P>People are aware of our place in Europe and there is a major obligation on us to allow the people to be part of what happens in Europe. The Government must be more careful in how it interprets European directives. It should have more of an input into the directives before they are made. The problem is that the directives have been grossly over interpreted. We are still suffering in the west from the effects of the nitrates and habitats directives. They have done more harm than anything else. The west is still suffering from these sterilising statutes. This issue must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I hope the EU will be more democratic and that the Council of Ministers will be able to come back to the committee and accept its directive.</P>

      <P>I thank Members on all sides of the House, with one notable dissent, for their general welcome for the Bill's principle. I welcome the fact the Bill is seen as a necessary technical measure on foot of the authority the people have given us as a result of the referendum. I also welcome the wide ranging debate in the House on the result of the Nice treaty and the convention on the future of Europe, which is now in session. I propose to deal with the points raised by speakers in order in my reply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> about a dinner or luncheon which has been convened in connection with the convention. The article emanates from the hothouse world of Brussels speculation. We had similar articles prior to the plebiscite about the possible existence of a plan B. I am glad the people in their wisdom ignored such material and studied the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that we must focus on the issues raised by the convention. The Government is approaching the convention and will approach the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference in a positive and constructive manner. We recognise the outcome of the convention will be a significant factor in shaping the debate as we move towards the Intergovernmental Conference. The Govern<Col N="669" />ment representative at the convention is the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, who has been charged with special responsibility for European affairs. He is playing a full and active part in the proceedings of the convention and in the networking and alliance building which must take place on the margins of the formal meetings of the convention. Deputy Roche played a full and vigorous role not alone in the referendum campaign but also in the proceedings of the convention and its associated meetings.</P>
    <P>We recognise the need for reform if the European Union is to rise to the new challenges ahead and to sustain and develop public support across the member states. We should not lose sight of the fact that the Union has been a great success. In moving forward, we should take great care to protect the existing institutional balance. That is the Government's position. The broad policy mix of competences has served us well to date and there is widespread support for this point of view throughout the convention. The Government, in co-operation with all the parties, has established the national Forum on Europe. That continues in session, as Deputy Quinn reminded us this morning. The forum is a unique experiment among all the member states. It allows for continuing engagement on these issues which, as all Deputies acknowledged, is of fundamental and critical importance in this area.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Quinn, I salute the work done by all the parties and the Independent Deputies, such as Deputies Cowley, Harkin and Connolly, in persuading the people to make their minds up to support the treaty in the referendum. It was tremendous that there was a greater turnout and participation by the electorate on that occasion than on the previous one. That gives a unique democratic legitimacy to the result given by the people. It is often said that it is a woman's prerogative to change her mind. It is also the prerogative of the people. They did that and that is their entitlement.</P>

It is perfectly within the rights and powers of this House to resubmit a question to the people and because the matter was so grave and moral in character for the great majority of Members of this House, it gave us no pleasure to have to ask again. However, we felt entitled to do so as it is our democratic right. We are elected by the people.</P>

      <P>In his excellent contribution, Deputy Gormley touched upon a point it is very important to make in connection with the convention. A referendum will be required in the case of any proceedings emanating from the convention and agreed upon at the Intergovernmental Conference which involve a substantive change in the identity of the communities of the European Union. The Government has not obtained final advice from the Attorney General on this matter and cannot obtain such advice until the final shape of the proposals is clear, but the possibility that we may have a further referendum must be factored in to our preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>Questions were raised about the degree of consultation that is taking place between the Government and members of the convention, but members of the convention are sent to it to use their intelligence, their undoubted judgment and their good sense. I say to Deputy Gormley that I did not mean any disrespect to them when I interjected during the debate. The convention is independent in its purpose and scope and it is not meant to act according to the dictates of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs or its Minister, not even in the case of the Government representative. Members have been sent to the convention to exercise their undoubted wisdom and perspective and it is open to Deputy Gormley to formulate an alternative constitution for Europe to put on the table at the convention.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies said that the process that led to the Nice treaty involved late <Col N="671" />night bargaining in Nice and that there was a danger of us sitting on our hands at the convention stage. Of course there is that danger, but we should remember the fundamental point that the convention and any Intergovernmental Conference can only be implemented through free decisions of the sovereign states which make up the European Union in accordance with their constitutional requirements. On that I have to disagree with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. The reason there has to be an Intergovernmental Conference is that sovereign states have to agree on any treaty before it can be implemented. Sovereignty may be a very unattractive sight at a late hour at Nice, but it is something this State possesses still.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe called for a White Paper on neutrality and a full examination of our policy. In a sense we have had a full examination of that in the run up to the referendum and the Government has set out a very clear position in regard to it. The people approved that. There was a White Paper on foreign policy when former Deputy Dick Spring was Minister for Foreign Affairs, but this Government has no immediate plan to bring forward a document on neutrality. When speaking on this subject, it is very important to have clarity in our terminology.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn that it is unfortunate that our debate this morning co-incides with the session of the forum, but we must take matters as we find them. Deputy Quinn raised the very important issue of our representation in the candidate and applicant states, a matter also raised by Deputy Connolly. In recent years our network of embassies and missions has expanded significantly to include a number of the applicant states and as of today we have embassies in the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. It is the policy of the Government to complete that network as soon as is practical. We have diplomatic relations with all of the states involved, but those are the embassy footholds we have established which is very important. The effort should be furthered.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that Deputy Quinn drew attention to the important distinction between primary and secondary legislation which we may return to on Committee Stage. While the justice and home affairs pillar always requires implementation through primary legislation, it is often the case that such legislation is also required to implement EU directives. This is very important work which the committees charged with these matters must undertake.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised one of the most valid points of the debate. One of the key findings of much of the field research we conducted during the recent referendum campaign was how small a proportion of the population is aware of the institutional workings of the European Union. Perhaps that is because the institutional balance is very new and different to the conventional Montesquieu model of legislative, executive and judicial institutions that we in this House understand, or try to. Many in our population do not realise the precise functions of the Commission, the Parliament, the Court of Justice and the Council and there is a clear need for more information. Deputy Quinn's suggestion of a wall chart or illustrative device for primary schools is excellent and I will take it up. I am authorised to say on behalf of the Minister that it will be discussed with the Minister for Education and Science. It is vital that we deepen our understanding of these institutions which have such power to shape our lives and it is important that we are able to shape them also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Government regarding to the role of the European Parliament and issues arising in relation to the convention has been dealt with by the Minister in reply to a parliamen<Col N="673" />tary question. In opening this debate, I made the key point that we very much welcome the drive towards clarity and simplicity in the formulation of the fundamental European document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the principal section of the Bill. It deals with the amendment of section 1 of the European Communities Act, 1972. The basic point we touched on in our Second Stage remarks was that we are looking forward to a further amendment of that Act following the next Intergovernmental Conference. That leads to the points raised in connection with the convention. Frankly, I am not satisfied with the Minister's Second Stage response. The analysis in today's <i>The Irish Times </i>of the lack of input from the Government to the convention cannot be dismissed as merely the result of a hot bed of intrigue in Brussels. It is an analysis by an experienced correspondent whose comments are devastating. He stated that:</P>
      <P>. . . the Government appears confident that its deeply conservative approach to Europe's future will win the day.</P>
      <P>This analysis is almost certainly wrong and if the Government does not move fast, it will be out-manoeuvred in the final negotiations.</P>
      <P>I do not mind the Government suffering loss of face; I am worried about the country, unfortunately, a country that at this time is ruled by this Government. He goes on to state:</P>
      <P>Such an outcome would not only damage Ireland's national interest; it would leave the Government once again with the sorry task of selling to the Irish people a treaty it does not itself believe in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I sought an outline from the Minister on where the Government stands in relation to the convention but I have not got it. We have got wonderfully Lenihanesque flowery phrases which <Col N="674" />is a reminder of what we used to get from the Minister of State's father as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was just telling us about the Government taking a full and active part in the proceedings and being positive and constructive and recognising the need for reform. We all know this sort of blandness is an excuse for not replying to the questions. To tell the House the Minister, Deputy Cowen, responded to parliamentary questions on the issue is not sufficient. This is where we are debating Europe and there are no responses from the Government. I do not expect full responses and, I suppose, the Minister of State would be brave to give full responses. I would like a commitment from the Minister, on behalf of the Government, that from now on there will be a clear exposition of what the Government is seeking from the convention and a clear effort to input that to the convention and, furthermore, an opportunity for that approach to be fully debated in the House. We have not had any such debate and without it the Government is leading this country in the dark so far as the convention is concerned. This is made worse by the fact that the work of the convention has been largely dismissed by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, as being irrelevant. That is a serious fundamental mistake which will cost this country dear, as mentioned in this article today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit of co-operation that time requires I want to take up a point referred to by Deputy Harkin. I do not know if she heard my contribution prior to coming into the Chamber. I made substantially the same point. On Committee Stage, if we wanted to be difficult and obstructive, we could ask the Minister of State to clarify, for example on page 4 of the Bill, paragraph (<i>f</i>) which states:</P>
      <P>the Treaty amending certain Budgetary Provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities and of the Treaty establishing a single Council and a single Commission of the European Communities, signed at Luxembourg on the 22nd day of April, 1970,</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may have made his First Communion in 1970 for all I know. We could do that and we could be difficult but he is expecting the European Affairs committee to deal with this kind of thing with absolutely no resources. The thrust of the point I made, and which Deputy Harkin, as a new Deputy, has made is that without the backup of a party or the experience of being here for a number of years, it is very difficult to do the work of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to get the referendum passed to give legal effect to the convention's outcome and the intergovernmental conference within the lifetime of this Government &ndash; it will be within the lifetime of this Government &ndash; he has to start working for that now. He has to address on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side those of us who reluctantly voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for what was a bad and imper<Col N="675" />fect treaty but nevertheless better than the alternative. The serious issue of the democratic deficit that pertains here was enunciated as recently as this morning by the Tánaiste when she said this particular measure is required by the EU, in other words, it was being imposed on this Chamber by the EU, without any explanation or any reference. If the Minister wants those of us who campaigned for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and this country to vote knowingly and constructively for the outcome of the intergovernmental conference, he has to start now; he cannot do it in a second referendum. The first thing he has to do is to make resources available to the European Affairs committee.</P>

      <P>Section 1 serves as a good historical reminder of how far we have come because from 1972 it lists all the accession treaties. At Laeken we were told to go out and simplify the treaties but not to add to them. Unfortunately, the convention has taken on its own momentum and Giscard has a sense of his own historical destiny and he certainly wants to put his mark on history. He may well succeed in doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has diverted me slightly but I will take him up on that point. He did make a statement to the effect that he wanted to exclude Turkey and he may well have been articulating a view that is common within the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons for this and I heard them stated yesterday when I spoke with a number of ambassadors about the question of human rights, to which many referred; the clash of cultures, as some see it; their standard of living and how far behind they may be. There is another question which, perhaps, may not have been thought about &ndash; the size of population. I was astounded when a well informed individual told me the population at the time of the First World War was only about 4 million but it has increased amazingly and by 2020, if allowed, it will be the biggest country within the European Union. It would be a welcome development to allow Turkey to join if it had its human rights record dealt with in a substantial way. I do not believe in exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason many put forward was whether we really want a European border with Iraq. I <Col N="676" />would like to hear the Irish Government's position on this issue. It is a fundamental question because we try to play it every way. We try to pretend. We go to these meetings with our European partners and say: &ldquo;Yes, you are right&rdquo; and go to Turkey and say: &ldquo;Please come in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To return to the point of simplification, what we have here is a way of trying to sell this to the Irish people. I understand the last thing the Government wants to call this is a constitution because Bunreacht na hÉireann is sacrosanct to many in Fianna Fáil. They do not want a European constitution. Many of them would prefer to call this the consolidated treaties and sell it on that basis.</P>
    <P>One of the lessons of Nice was that there would be no choice. There was great triumphalism in Dublin Castle but I knew from the outset &ndash; I said this to those who wanted to listen, including the Minister, Deputy Cowen &ndash; that it would go through. It went through because it had to go through. We, the minority, were up against a huge giant, the Establishment, and we never had a chance. We were up against political parties, the media, the Church, the farmers, the unions and big business. How could we, a relatively small party, face up to that and expect to win? It was an impossible task. We did not have the type of debate on this that I would have liked. What we got were regrettable tactics, the type of scaremongering tactics used by some elements of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side on the last occasion. They simply looked at what they did on that occasion and decided it worked and they should try it again. That is how they went about it.</P>
    <P>This is a historical document. The convention brings all this documentation together and produces a synthesis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is will we have a debate on this or are we to revert to scare tactics? Are we to have a choice? Deputy John Bruton performed a very valuable task in this regard which was not referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe. It is now accepted that in the presidium Giscard wanted to introduce a provision that if a member state rejected this by way of referendum it could be expelled. We could be expelled from the European Union for rejecting a referendum. This threat has been used before. Deputy O'Keeffe asked what would happen if we rejected it, would Europe throw us out? It could not throw us out. People are now talking about introducing such a mechanism, and that would be very regrettable. Where is the element of democracy? If one wants to give real legitimacy to a constitution why not have a European-wide referendum? What are people afraid of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may speak about the constitutional difficulties of various member states and the fact that they cannot hold referendums. The Germans <Col N="677" />have their historical difficulties with the idea of a referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. As I indicated to my colleagues, there is a need to look afresh at this. There is a need for a real debate within the European Union. I regret that what is happening in the convention is far removed from the ordinary citizen. The ordinary taxi driver in Brussels is not aware of this convention. The ordinary citizen in Dublin or any part of this country is not aware that there is a convention on a constitution for the future of Europe. Their first reaction would be, &ldquo;I thought we just decided that by way of referendum, what are we talking about now?&rdquo; It leads to confusion and leaves one wondering where all this is going to end? Is there an end game or will this go on and on?</P>
      <P>It is clear there is a push for a common defence. The people go through the discussions on Nice and agree it &ndash; in many cases they do not know what they have agreed to &ndash; and then we get this through by way of a second referendum. The same issue is then placed back on the table and eventually Europe gets what it wants. It is incremental change. Our sense of ownership is being eroded.</P>
      <P>The Government's view of a European Union &ndash; I heard the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and others say this &ndash; is, as I understand it, a union based on a nation state. What does this mean? Does it mean the Government wants a federation of nation states? Does it want a united nations of Europe &ndash; that is one of the titles used by Giscard? Is that what the Government wants? Does it want a united states of Europe? The Minister of State appears to be excluding each of these options.</P>

      <P>Many issues have been raised. Deputy Quinn raised the question of committee resources &ndash; this was also raised by Deputy Harkin on Second Stage. For an Oireachtas Committee to function in a proper manner adequate resources must be committed to it. I know Deputies appreciate that it is not the function of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to create an Estimate for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The Government has advanced legislation through this House providing for autonomous control over the budget and allocation of finances within this House which is important in this regard. The evidence of the forum suggested that those committees which have worked well in other jurisdictions have been well funded. A mass of documentation, as pointed out by Deputy Harkin, is emerging from the European Union. It is, however, not like domestic legislation. It is possible for a Deputy who is not a member of the Government to collect a copy of a Bill, study it and make a reasoned judgment on it. It is far more difficult to do that with Community legislation drafted with a very different legal technique and with different presuppositions representing, necessarily, a comprise between many member states. To make an intelligible translation of such a document from Brussels to Leitrim, as mentioned by Deputy Harkin, is a very difficult challenge. I accept that more resources should be given to the committees.</P>
      <P>The position of the Government in relation to the convention was raised. I spoke about the Government's general approach to this at the conclusion of Second Stage. On the issues of substance, the Minister made it clear that he supports the current identification of the Communities as the European Union. He has expressed reservations regarding a change in that nomenclature. It is not for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to try to predetermine the conclusions of this convention. There is a delicate relationship between the intergovernmental conference and the position of the Government and the convention. The convention has been asked to do a job. Some Deputies, including Deputies Gormley and John Bruton, the Minister, Deputy Roche, and Proinsias De Rossa MEP are playing a full part in that. We are asking Deputy Gormley to shape the new Europe. He cannot sit back and say this is all very remote to 400 million citizens. He is being brought to the heart of this issue. Whether he likes it, Deputy Gormley is now part of the Establishment. He comes in here and talks about the Establishment when he is now one of the leading pillars of it in Brussels.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gormley raised a good point in relation to the word &ldquo;constitution&rdquo;. I accept it is a somewhat intimidating word. It is, in our arrangement, a bunreacht, which is a basic law. The Germans use the same phrase in German for their constitution. That is the best description I can come up with if I am to make a contribution to the proceedings of this convention. It is not a bad description but I do not say it as the imprimatur of Government policy. The convention seeks to devise a basic law for the European Union, a law that is intelligible for citizens. Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to republicanism. What should be fundamental for republicans is that the citizens should know the laws of the State. One of the most difficult matters with the European Union is the inaccessibility and arcane character of the legislation. A straightforward statement of principle as to where the Union stands on the legal plane is welcome.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley and others referred to the principle of subsidiarity. That is an attempt to clarify the precise competences of the Union as against the precise competences of the member states. Subject to careful examination of any legal formula that may be devised, we welcome the principle of subsidiarity being entrenched in the basic law. The question of legal personality has also been raised and not for the first time. An earlier merger treaty fused EURATOM, the European Community and the European Coal and Steel Community. We have no difficulty with personality.</P>
      <P>I am not speaking for the Government but there has been too much concentration on the issue of personality in the debates of the convention. The community should have a personality but continental lawyers and jurists have always been obsessed with the theory of legal personality. I have no difficulty attributing a personality to the Union.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has reservations about the harmonisation of criminal law and the codes of criminal law. It is a legitimate concern. Our system, along with that which operates in the United Kingdom, is the result of a long, historical evolution which has provided a degree of protection for persons accused of criminal offences. The continental system is different. I do not say it is worse, but it is the result of different historical growth with many of its roots in the canon law courts. The tradition is different and it is not easy to marry those traditions as advocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" />There is a danger that vital protections in our system will be lost through a careless transposition. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has expressed that, perhaps more forthrightly than I have. He has strongly championed that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bear with me here, because every word is of significance. Debate on the charter has to start with what happened at Nice. The charter was promulgated at Nice and given the status of a political declaration. We fully supported that. Some wanted to move towards full incorporation at that time but we were not satisfied that, as the charter was then drafted, all of the legal issues associated with incorporation had been addressed. We are aware that within the relevant working group at the convention, important work has been carried out on what has been described as the horizontal articles of the convention. What these unexciting horizontal articles deal with is the limitation of the scope and application of the charter. Drafting amendments to bring greater clarity and certainty to these questions have been proposed by the group.</P>
      <P>The Government is not in a position to give a definitive view on the issue. The core difficulty is that the charter of fundamental freedoms here is contained in Articles 40 to 44 of Bunreacht na hÉireann and the people have direct control over the content of these Articles through referendum. We have always accepted the system of the European Convention. At Strasbourg we were one of the first states to accept both the compulsory jurisdiction of the court in Strasbourg and the right of individual petition. There was never a problem on the intergovernmental or international sphere in our participation there.</P>
      <P>The question of the charter has to be carefully examined to ensure that it does not encroach on the protection that Articles 40 to 44 provide in regard to the enactments we pass here. That is a vital interest of the State.</P>

      <P>I outlined the view of the Government on a number of issues including legal personality and the name of the Union. The charter is an attempt to provide a constitutional guarantee of fundamental rights within the Com<Col N="681" />munity's own legal order. To some extent that is already implicit in Community law. The Court of Justice in Luxembourg has said on numerous occasions that the phrase, &ldquo;the jurisdiction of the court extends to ensuring that the law has observed&rdquo;, includes within it, implicit in that definition, the idea that certain fundamental rights have a prior status in the Community legal order. If what is involved in the charter is to make that explicit, the Government would be open to looking at that. That is as far as I can put that matter.</P>

      <P>I offer the following observation from the Labour Party point of view, working within the party of the European Socialists and the Christian Democrats, the European People's Party and the Green Party. Deputy Lenihan invited Deputy Gormley to be adventurous and courageous and to help shape the convention. Undoubtedly, he is doing that through his own participation. Our concern about the Government's silence is that party positions will attach themselves to certain outcomes in the convention and we will be wedded to those outcomes through the process of negotiation and bargaining. If subsequent to that, the Irish Government &ndash; which has remained silent to date other than saying the current balance of the institutions should not be changed &ndash; remains silent at the Intergovernmental Conference we could find ourselves in the run up to a referendum where the outcome of Nice &ndash; mark 2 is seen as a disaster and therefore we cannot support it. That is why it is essential that the Government articulates its position.</P>

There is a need for the Government to produce a position paper. We should have a position paper, any colour, setting out the Government position on the issues being discussed in the convention. Will the Minister discuss that with his colleagues? This discussion paper could then be debated fully in the House in a non-partisan manner so that what emerges can have as great an input as possible.</P>

We should recognise that we could all aspire to and agree with 99% of the charter. Will the Minister and the Department spend some time trying to identify the areas causing a problem. That could be promulgated through Deputy O'Keeffe's notion of a position paper. If that does not happen we will give the message to the people that there is something to be feared in the charter when in fact the charter is something to which we should subscribe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this important Bill. The absence of legislation and vetting procedures has opened the doors to people with criminal records working in the security industry. Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe with no legislation to regulate it. It is important that control, regulation and training be brought to bear and it is positive that the regional technical colleges have adopted the subject as a module. As the RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary revealed some weeks ago, there have been numerous vicious assaults and the industry needs to be regulated and controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Business crime has increased by 10%, costing businesses &euro;775 million. Some 45% of businesses are victims of crime. Theft of stock, cash and property and credit card fraud are increasing and the average cost per incident is &euro;2,181. The incidence of business people being targeted in their <Col N="683" />own homes in violent crime has increased by 27% and Internet crime has also increased, with an average cost per incident of &euro;4,800. Crime in business has led to increased investment in security equipment and personnel.</P>
    <P>Of the 648 companies which responded to a survey carried out by the small businesses association, theft of stock happened in 25% of businesses, criminal damage in 21%, burglary in 19%, theft of cash in 19%, theft of property in 19%, Internet fraud in 10%, credit card fraud in 9%, armed robbery in 2% and other crime in 5%. Crime is a big industry and is now highly organised and on the increase. This is highly professional and planned criminality. Against this background, the Bill provides for the establishment of a body to be known as the private security authority to control and supervise individuals and firms providing security services. The principal function of the authority will be to provide a licensing system for providers of security services in order to maintain and improve standards within the sector. This has been talked about for some time and is welcome. The Bill will give effect to the principal recommendations contained in the report of the consultative group on private security published in 1997. Even though it has taken five years, given the level of crime in the business sector, the Bill is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>Licensed premises are victims of much crime. Equality legislation in the sector also deals with the control of property and security on premises. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is dealing with this legislation and, having spoken to the Vintners Federation of Ireland, I know its members are happy with his approach. The legislation is creating some difficulties for many people working at the forefront of the tourism industry in hotels, restaurants and pubs. Bringing private security into these premises may help businesses deal better with the provisions of the equality legislation. People feel they have an entitlement to refuse service even though it is a difficult decision to make. One cannot discriminate against any segment of the community, although the vintners have their view on this. There is an obligation on the trade to have security on their premises. It is important that when people do not adhere to the code of conduct on the premises, the licensee has recourse to a regulated security firm. It is not always possible to have the gardaí on hand and they often arrive after the fact. This Bill will go a long way in helping the Minister of State introduce equality legislation, particularly in dealing with the VFI.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the establishment of a private security authority which will be independent in the exercise of its function and the details of its operation. Section 7 deals with the composition of the authority and the term of office of its members. It is a standard provision for legislation dealing with the establishment of a public body of this nature. Members will be appointed by the <Col N="684" />Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the authority will consist of not more than 11 people. These will include a practising barrister or solicitor, a representative of private security employers and a nominee of the Garda Commissioner and staff representatives. It is important to have members from the licensed trade too, such as the VFI, if we hope to get acceptance of the Bill. The regulation and promotion of this authority is important as is a code of conduct and standards requiring qualifications that could be awarded to suitable individuals.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Garda is involved because it gives the weight of law to the body. Security personnel should wear uniforms that conform to a certain standard of dress code as well as identifying serial numbers &ndash; which relate to registration &ndash; on their jackets or lapels so people in night clubs, etc. can identify who they are dealing with and ask for their number. In that way, there can be no subsequent claims that the individuals in question were not on duty on the occasion in question. It is important that the Minister should get it right by introducing those measures in a professional manner, having looked at systems in operation in other jurisdictions. The policing of the system should allow for total traceability.</P>
    <P>Adequate resources must be invested in dealing with the growth in violent crime. The issue of crime within business also needs attention, including more effective use of Garda resources and increased provision for detention places. I am also concerned about the operation of the courts system, in terms of bail arrangements, forfeiture and estreatment. There has been a 10% increase in the level of crime against small businesses since the last survey a year ago. That also involves associated costs for businesses, which have been estimated at &euro;181 million, based on an average cost of &euro;2,181, representing an increase of 34% on a 1997 survey figure. Those figures take no account of capital expenditure by small businesses on private security equipment, costing an average of &euro;2,650 per company, plus an additional &euro;842 for maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>Private security cameras have provided valuable information to assist the Garda in the investigation of crime. The total cost of criminal activity and preventive measures borne by businesses amounts to &euro;775 million per annum, including night clubs, pubs, hotels, supermarkets and industrial premises. The Minister should take account of that resource and ensure that the security business is properly supervised so that vested interests are dealt with. Relevant security equipment includes alarms, closed circuit television, hidden cameras, access control, time-lock safes and till surveillance. Such facilities are now an everyday part of doing business.</P>
    <P>In relation to the courts services, the proportion of people absconding from bail is quite alarming. According to a recent report, the Garda Síochána identified 5,000 cases which arose between 1988 and 1998 as still outstanding. Unex<Col N="685" />ecuted bench warrants are increasing at an annual rate of about one quarter of the number issued in 2000. In 2001, 10,121 bench warrants were issued and, in the same year, the number of such warrants executed was 5,787 in terms of the persons concerned being brought before the relevant courts by the Garda. However, the executed bench warrants are not necessarily for those issued in 2001, indicating that many bench warrants are carried over to the following years. In practice, a warrant execution rate of 100% is regarded as unattainable in the foreseeable future. Of the 10,121 bench warrants issued in 2001, some 1,810 are estimated not to have involved a cash bail amount. However, in 3,297 of the remaining 8,311 cases, there was failure to pursue estreatment. Clearly a substantial number of people are getting away with paying a small amount of their bail and there is no subsequent follow-up. In the Dublin Circuit and Central Court, no order for forfeiture or estreatment of bail money has been made in the five years from 1997 to 2001, although 1,321 bench warrants were issued during the same period for non-appearance in those courts. Those alarming figures would suggest that crime pays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been allocated time to speak and I am availing of the privilege. I will take the <Col N="686" />time allotted to me, regardless of the Minister of State, and I will not tolerate his interjections which are totally out of order. My point is that people go into court and get off scot free, without any follow-up by the Garda. People have to invest in their own security to protect their businesses because the State is not providing it. People walk into court, claim they have no money to pay their bail and then abscond. The business community is investing &euro;700 million in private security, in addition to which they pay taxes. The Minister of State should be aware of the factual situation. I speak from some experience having come up through the business sector. There is very little compensation for the risks one has to take in business. Private security is operating without any Government involvement. Business sectors such as the hotels federation, the vintners' federation or RGDATA have a vested interest in their own businesses and have to invest heavily to safeguard them. There is no tax write-off on investment in private security, despite expenditure of thousands of euro in security cameras and other equipment to protect their businesses. People are also at risk when keeping cash in their homes overnight.</P>
      <P>It is in that overall context I have referred to the situation whereby people can get away with serious crime because of the lack of follow-up on bench warrants. The Garda Síochána should follow up on court judgments and orders in the matter of bail. Those who commit crime should pay the bill. If the Minister of State thinks there are no parallels with private security issues in this regard, then why did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduce the Bill in the first instance? This Bill is long overdue and I fully endorse the need for regulation. I reiterate the need for security personnel to carry proper identification, including an ID number or seal of office. That area has been totally unregulated up to now, apart from self-regulation by business people who have invested heavily in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat dismayed that the Minister takes exception to the fact that thousands of bench warrants have not been acted upon. I will raise this matter on the Order of Business. I wonder if the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, will refer to it in his column in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i></P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to speak on the Private Security Services Bill, which I hope will conclude today since we have much legislation on our programme. I look forward to this Bill going to Committee Stage. Speaker after speaker stressed its importance. The only way we can complete it is by getting it to Committee <Col N="687" />Stage, dealing with the amendments there and completing its passage through the House.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill in so far as it deals with everyone from alarm fitters to private investigators. Like many other speakers, the matter on which I would particularly like to focus is the positive impact it could have on door security. We have all witnessed an expansion of this whole industry over the years, including the night life industry. That has brought with it a number of problems due to the fact that in some cases there is no training. There is wide variation in the content of training and, indeed, there are certainly discrepancies in the conduct of security staff across firms and premises. This Bill will help to regulate the whole area and address the growing disquiet and public concern that exists about the need for effective control and regulation of security services.</P>
      <P>The Bill is based on the proposals in the report on the private security sector on establishing the Private Security Authority. It gives a clear direction and sufficient flexibility to respond to all future developments. The independent agency will have two main functions, to regulate and to act as a fair and impartial complaints mechanism. That is in everybody's interest, including the reputable private security firm, which feels that the reputation of the industry as a whole is being tarnished by a few unsavoury elements, and businesses, as Deputy Perry said, which employ personnel to safeguard both their premises and their patrons. They need to be assured of the professionalism of security companies. It is also in the interest of the patrons of licensed premises who come into contact with doormen.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of people who have had some run-in with bouncers on a night out, or at least witnessed such an incident. In most cases it simply means somebody is refused entry to a premises. It might have to do with the standard of dress or the level of intoxication, or it might just mean a harsh word or some minor altercation. However, there have been very serious incidents which have resulted, unfortunately, in injury or death. In the past year we saw one such incident in Dún Laoghaire where, when a row broke out outside the door of a premises at night, the Garda was called and two gardaí were very seriously injured. This is the type of thing we want to avoid and we believe that this legislation can help towards that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being a doorman is not an easy job. Doormen work in an environment where they must face difficult circumstances. They deal with people who are unruly and intoxicated on a nightly basis. They have to make split-second decisions as to whether a potential patron would cause trouble inside or would cause discomfort for other customers. It is incredible that these people receive no training, for the most part, to equip them to carry out their duties responsibly and deal with such tense situations without resorting to violence. I welcome the fact that the report highlights the need for the completion of a comprehensive <Col N="688" />standard training programme to be mandatory for licence approval of security personnel. Such training would be set by the authority and would need to be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are a number of elements to that training. The doorman should be trained in how to deal with emergencies such as fire &ndash; we can all recall the terrible events which have happened in that regard. What are the rights and responsibilities under legislation such as the Equal Status Act or the liquor licensing laws where there has been a serious injury on the premises? These people should be trained in drug awareness and first aid and to defuse situations without recourse to violence. This not only would enable the doorman to be assured of his position but would also be a major reassurance for patrons.</P>
    <P>The right of recourse to the authority of anyone who feels that a security person has abused his or her authority is central to the Bill. It will uphold the reputation of the industry as a whole. The conditions must be put in place for this right to be substantiated. A number of speakers have mentioned the need for ease of identification and objective evidence. There is no doubt that if you are making a complaint it is not good enough to say &ldquo;the big fellow standing outside the door of the night club&rdquo;. All those standing outside the doors of night clubs are big fellows and some form of identification is needed. I hope that this recommendation will be taken up. Obviously some objective evidence is needed. It would not be enough to have the doorman versus the complainant. There would need to be CCTV. It would be in the interests of many premises, particularly late night ones, to install CCTV. That would be a deterrent for everyone and would lead to better behaviour all round.</P>
    <P>Young people particularly need to know that they can rely on a well-trained security service to facilitate them having a safe and good night out. To ensure that there is another end of the equation, a sense of responsibility among young people is needed. The level of intoxication among young people is of serious concern to all of us, as is the level of binge drinking and the number of people who go out with the sole purpose of spending their money to get drunk. The Minister for Health and Children launched a campaign last week called Think Before You Drink. It advises young people about the hazards of binge drinking. There is no doubt that large numbers of young people are putting themselves in very vulnerable and potentially violent situations. It is linked to the whole public order issue but also to this Bill. If someone who is binge drinking tries to gain access to premises, doormen have to make decisions on what to do with him or her. This can lead to altercations outside the door.</P>
    <P>All these matters should be seen as part of the overall picture. The Minister is trying to make progress on alcohol policies. This concerns the policies adopted by the governing authorities of third level institutions, which I welcome. The Government is trying to tackle this issue as a jus<Col N="689" />tice, education and health issue. We must all be aware of it in the wider society also.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. This authority, when constituted &ndash; I hope the Opposition facilitates its passage through Second Stage today &ndash; will address the issues of training, visible identification and objective evidence as a matter of priority. It will ensure that the regulatory provisions achieve their full potential to protect not just the people working in the industry but businesses and young people who avail of their services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of contributing to the Second Stage debate of the Private Security Services Bill, 2001. Like my friend, the Minister of State, I was surprised the last speaker for the Opposition appeared to be reading from an explanatory memorandum. He referred to items which appeared <i>prima facie </i>to be completely outside the ambit of the Bill. This is a very important Bill. We should try to finish Second Stage as soon as possible and move on to Committee Stage. I believe that this Bill can be somewhat amplified and improved on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that the Bill lays the legal foundation for a private security industry in Ireland. That is very welcome and overdue. The average punter's ideas of a private detective range from Marlow through to Hercule Poirot, detectives with white macs, ill-trained security guards and big, heavy bouncers outside discos. There is no reason the private security industry should not represent itself or be of the same standard as any other industry. It should not be over-regulated, but it should be regulated. It should be licensed and there should be certain standards and training. There should be accountability and a professional body, as in any other industry. I do not think genuine security service providers will have any difficulty with this Bill. They have nothing to fear from licensing or regulation of the industry and will, by and large, welcome this legislation.</P>
      <P>There are several pivotal sections in the Bill. While I do not need to go over them in great detail, I will underline some of them. The definition of a &ldquo;security service&rdquo; is very wide and includes door supervisors, private investigators and security consultants. Perhaps the Minister will note that the definitions section does not seem to include the monitoring of alarms. As I understand it, certain companies are involved only with the monitoring of alarms by telephone or the Internet. If the Minister and the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel believe such companies are not included in the Bill, perhaps an amendment will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Private Security Authority, to be established under the Bill, has a standard structure. Its power to control and supervise the industry is very important. It will be charged with developing a strategic plan for each three year period and <Col N="690" />will have the power to inspect and investigate the industry. Security service providers will have to apply to it for a licence as a consequence of the Bill, the key to which is that anyone operating in the industry will have to possess a licence. This provision will ensure the unwanted elements in the industry, including gougers, ruffians and those who do not pay their employees the correct amount of money, cannot stay in it. The authority will enforce the licensing provisions and have the power to investigate any breaches. It will also publish a register of those licensees who have been issued with identity cards. Everyone will be able to find out if a given firm has been registered.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, mentioned the issue of complaints against licensees. In that context, I want to discuss the topic of privacy, which may be seen as the other side of the security industry. I do not think privacy is specifically mentioned in the Bill as a ground for a complaint, but I am sure the Minister of State will agree that it is important we bear it in mind. If certain security companies cross the boundary from mere surveillance to interfering with people's privacy, those whose privacy has been compromised should be able to use it as a specific ground for complaint under this legislation. Perhaps we can return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which will do a great deal for the security industry and society. Unfortunately, security is necessary in its various shapes and forms, including house alarms, bouncers, CCTV systems and airport security. I would like to stress, however, that we need to be wary of certain developments as regards privacy and the rights of the individual. People have a right to their privacy and to exist peacefully without intrusion. I was a little alarmed when I read a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning stating detailed personal data will be retained for up to four years for security purposes under a new Bill to be brought forward by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>This is an excellent Bill. It is the first Bill to try to set down a regulatory framework for the private security industry. It is not all-inclusive.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress to the Minister that the issue of training needs to be addressed, as I notice that it is not specifically mentioned in the Bill. It may appear in the Private Security Authority's three year strategic plan. The issue of remuneration of employees in the security industry needs to be addressed, as it is possible that some security firms have attempted to employ people at low wage rates. Workers are entitled to be properly trained and well remunerated. An amendment to the Bill could be introduced on Committee Stage to address these issues, although it may be necessary to introduce a further Bill.</P>
      <P>I inform the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that I very much welcome the Bill. I hope it passes Second Stage today. I look forward to contributing to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>We are familiar with the type of people who are sometimes found to be working in the security industry. They think they are protected by the peace process and that they can still beat people in public and get away with it. This issue has to be dealt with quickly. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, spoke about the Minister for Health and Children's programme to encourage young people to think before they go on binges. The last Government has to answer to society in relation to its changes in the licensing laws during the last Dáil, as it will be judged on that decision. There should be a review of the licensing laws.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should allow me to finish my point before he answers me. <Col N="693" />There should be a proper review to determine the numbers who have been injured, murdered or hospitalised and the effects on society of the new licensing laws which allow pubs to stay open until 2 a.m. or 4 a.m. It is outrageous &ndash; the worst legislation that has ever been passed. It has been proven that thousands of people are coming out onto the streets at the same time at night. It is time this legislation was re-examined. We must make difficult decisions in the House. There is no other vested interest with as much power as the Licensed Vintners' Association &ndash; with the exception of the IFA &ndash; but it must be taken on whether we like it or not because society is breaking down. Drinking has got out of hand and the Bill must be considered in the light of this.</P>
      <P>It is time this Bill was introduced because we must regulate the people in this profession. When certain people put a uniform on &ndash; a white coat or a jacket from a hotel &ndash; power goes to their heads. It is not drink that goes to their heads but power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we are talking about the Minister, Deputy McDowell. He is power hungry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>A person like this thinks that when people come in to a pub or a disco and look at him the wrong way he can beat them up and that he is protected by this uniform. It is time something was done about these people. They should do a course or be trained in how to handle people. They should receive training in the law and they should have to apply for a licence every few years. Members of the Garda Síochána must regularly do a two-year course and receive training in the law.</P>
      <P>On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; recently we saw what a certain nightclub bouncer did to a young person coming in to the club. That is what has pushed this Bill on. I welcome that because legislation and regulation are essential in this area. We have to know who is working in private security and they must be monitored on a week-by-week basis. They must also be checked out by the Garda. There is no law, nothing to stop a person who may have just come out of jail after committing a serious crime &ndash; he may have served ten years for murdering somebody &ndash; putting on a uniform and standing outside the biggest hotel or disco in the country. These people feel they are protected by law because of the uniform. Something must be done about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in the private sector are feeling the pinch at the moment. I was on a radio programme last Saturday about issues relating to my own county. We talked about its three major towns. There are three local newspapers and I do not write for any of them. I wish I could, but I do not. For the last six months the local papers have been reporting one serious assault after another. All these are taking place outside discos and nightclubs late at night. The editorials are beginning to ask what has gone wrong in relation to law and <Col N="694" />order. I must ask the Minister that question: what has gone wrong?</P>
    <P>The Garda says it does not have the resources to deal with these people late at night and the numbers in the Garda are dwindling, when one considers the numbers off sick or who have injured themselves or been assaulted. We must give them the resources and the powers they need. The gardaí are the only ones who should be responsible for security in this State. We must regulate private security, but if we had public security we would not need as much of it. As I said, most of these serious incidents are taking place late at night. The business community feels that it must put more resources into its own security because the State is not able to protect it. Yet businesses are taxed and regulated and must pay money to the local authority.</P>
    <P>If a person started a business tomorrow morning, the first thing he would get in the door would be from the Revenue Commissioners giving a reference number. Then the health inspector would come in, followed by the area inspector and the dog licence inspector. People even come looking for money now. This is the most over-regulated state in the whole of Europe and I want Deputy John Bruton to take this up in Europe. I am sick and tired of the way we are being regulated on a day-to-day basis. Deputy Bruton is the only one fit to do that. We have people out there who have done nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have full confidence in the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The business sector feels that it is over-regulated by the State and is not getting the protection it deserves. It says that crime costs businesses &euro;775 million per year. They feel that even if they provide their own security they do not get the tax write-offs they deserve. They get no support from the State. This is something that should be considered on Committee Stage. Perhaps in the forthcoming budget something could be done for these people who must provide their own security, provided they go through the law and register their security people. They should be rewarded for this while the State does not provide security for them.</P>
      <P>We have waited for this Bill for a long time and it should be serious and succeed in its aims. We should regulate the people in this industry because it has been the subject of much criticism from the general public. Young people in particular might go to a nightclub and have a drink or two, maybe for somebody's eighteenth or twenty-first birthday, and somebody might take a dislike to them and feel that because he is standing at a door wearing a uniform he can attack these people. People must be protected. Security staff must be trained and licensed. They must not be allowed to beat up whomever they want and think that the law is with them. More resources will have to be put into fighting crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" />Deputy O'Dea is the junior Minister in that Department. Every day people complain to me that crime figures are rising. Listening to the radio it seems that someone is murdered in this city every hour on the hour. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Another Minister once sat where Deputy O'Dea is sitting and I remember the Deputy making a vicious attack on her. That was former Deputy Nora Owen. Deputy O'Dea and Deputy O'Donoghue blamed her for everything. Deputy O'Donoghue is the man who advocated zero tolerance. He is the Minister who, last year, did everything he could to stop refugees coming into the country but now, as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, is using them as tourism statistics. There has been a great change in a year. That is the kind of hypocritical Government we have. That is the man who lectured us on zero tolerance. I used to see him getting up to address the House and I would say to my colleague that this man was taking matters so seriously if he did not stop he would have a heart attack or a stroke. What happened when he went over to the other side of the House and was made Minister? Crime rates rose, the number of assaults rose and the number of murders rose. This was the man who was to solve every law and order problem. He got his chance and he failed.</P>

Deputy Bruton was responsible for the leisure centre and the Custom House Studios in Westport. The Minister is officially opening the Custom House Studios today and he will be telling people about all the projects that are gone: the main road from Westport to Castlebar is gone, the school in Newport is gone and he is down there opening something we set up. We were only there for two and a half years. The people do not know what they missed by not giving us another turn.</P>

      <P>I want this Bill to work. The people in this industry must be regulated. This State has paid a high price to people in certain organisations and many people have suffered as a result of their actions. These people must be monitored and dealt with. We must scrutinise their connections to the IRA. The public should not be intimidated. Those in the industry must be licensed, checked by the Garda and monitored regularly. There is no point establishing an authority if we do not give it the necessary resources.</P>
      <P>The incidence of crime has increased. Some people are afraid to go to bed at night and others do not get up until it is bright in the morning. People are afraid they will be attacked during the night. That is a sad reflection on society. We want law and order and the resources to enforce it. The Garda must be given proper resources. When Nora Owen as Minister gave them the resources to implement the CAB it became the most successful legislation in the history of the State. Give the Garda the resources. I have full confidence that it can do the job and we will not have to depend on private security firms.</P>
      <P>The Garda has done a good job since the foundation of the State. I am glad Deputy Bruton knows my people were there from the beginning. They helped to set up the State and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Any venue seeking an extension should give an undertaking that every inch of the premises will be under video surveillance from start to finish. The coloured German system with 48 channels is most suitable for this. Every channel is necessary to cover the entire 7,000 square feet of a venue. If that is done, everyone, the patrons, the stewards and those involved in running the function, will bear in mind their responsibilities and will behave in a proper manner. A great deal of responsibility is involved in running the clubs frequented by our sons and daughters. If they are run properly, they are successful. Young boys and girls going out to enjoy themselves want to go to places where they will have the freedom to socialise in a secure environment. That is a simple proposal. If anything unfortunate happens in the course of the evening, the tape recording what happened can be given to the Garda. Like figures at election time, the tape does not lie.</P>
      <P>I do not want to take up too much time. Many people have contributed on this debate and some have completely gone off the rails to make it political. Video surveillance would cover almost all staff and patron behaviour. Any establishment that videos every square foot of the premises during an event will have low rates of anti-social behaviour. This is an efficient way of monitoring an entire venue. It prevents the arrival of unknown people from other towns who might want to tempt young boys and girls to try drugs.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. My former constituency colleague, John Farrelly, has for a long time campaigned for legislation along these lines. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who refused to take Deputy Farrelly's Bill on board was a Deputy who had previously promoted Private Members' Bills in Opposition and demanded they be accepted as a basis for further work. In one case he was successful but as Minister he was unwilling to accept a Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Farrelly. That showed a lack of vision and generosity, which is regrettable. I am sorry John Farrelly is not present to see the broad welcome for the legislation which he did so much to bring about. If he has not already done so, I hope the Minister will pay a well deserved tribute to former Deputy Farrelly for his persistence in the matter.</P>

    <P>As many Members know, I am particularly concerned about a certain type of private security service that is increasingly being provided by the armed wing of one of the political parties represented in the House. I refer here to the provisional republican movement; the IRA, which is part of Sinn Féin. The two are indistinguishable and have one common aim. I was horrified to read about cases where so-called &ldquo;punishments&rdquo; were administered by that organisation in this State. These attacks involved the use of iron bars to break people's legs. The aim such attacks is to <Col N="699" />punish people in the most painful and terrifying way in order to create an example. There are those who may think these punishments are minor matters, but people have been crippled; in psychological and physical terms, for life.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that there is a political party in the House which is still associated with an organisation &ndash; the Provisional IRA &ndash; that is willing to provide a private security service in parts of this island. I know this is not a matter which in any way meets with the approval of the Minister or any Member of the House. I have no doubt Sinn Féin, if it so desires and if it seems politic to do so, will also condemn such activity. The reality is, however, that this indivisible republican movement is engaged in providing the type of service to which I refer and, of course, the IRA will not apply for a licence under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The only way this type of activity will be brought to an end will be if it is submitted to the same degree of searching exposure to which other activities are being subjected through the tribunals of inquiry. There is no doubt that, in recent years, the tribunals of inquiry into the funding of other political parties &ndash; including the activities of such parties while in office &ndash; particularly in terms of the way they have gone about their work, have ensured that democratic constitutional politics is being cleaned up in a most rigorous fashion. If it is justifiable to have a tribunal of inquiry into the funding of certain elected politicians because it might be suggested that the methods used to provide such funding may have interfered, in a corrupt way, with their work, it is also entirely justifiable to have a tribunal of inquiry investigate links between other political parties and secret unaccountable armed organisations.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the association of one political party with an armed organisation is not just as much a corruption of politics as, for example, the way in which another political party raises its funds. We must ensure uniform standards are applied in regard to corruption. There are many forms of corruption, including financial corruption, but there is also the corruption caused by the threat of physical violence. On balance, the corruption caused by the threat of physical violence is even worse than that caused by the raising of illicit funds either for personal political or party political purposes.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the legislation, because I am concerned about its vagueness. The criteria upon which the private security authority will decide whether to issue licences are not contained in the Bill. If we are giving a power to any authority to prevent an individual or company from doing a business, the criteria under which that power should be used should be set out in the principal legislation and not left to be subsequently provided for by way of regulation. I draw the attention of the House to section 40(2)(<i>d</i>), which provides that the authority, with the consent of the Minister, may set down the <Col N="700" />qualifications for licences or particular categories of licences, including any training requirements, and the assessment of those qualifications for people providing security services. I submit that those criteria should be included in the Bill, they should not be something to be done afterwards by means of delegated legislation.</P>
    <P>The House should lay down the principles upon which power should be exercised. The Bill contains a great deal of information regarding powers, but no detail about the criteria by which these powers are to be exercised. The parliamentary counsel &ndash; this legislation is not unique in this regard &ndash; is falling into the trap of being more concerned with process than purpose. The purpose of the legislation should be clear, which is not the case in this instance. The process whereby the powers are to be exercised is set out in inordinate detail, presumably in order to ensure these powers cannot be challenged. However, the purpose of these powers and the criteria under which they should be exercised are buried in a subparagraph in the second last section of the Bill. That is not the way legislation should be drafted. I am pleased the Minister of State is present because he is lawyer who is well qualified in these matters. If he reflects on the issue I have raised, he will agree that it is not satisfactory to have legislation in respect of which the criteria are not delineated in the principal legislation. It is an abuse of the Oireachtas to present it with a request to approve a whole range of powers without indicating what will be the criteria under which such powers will be exercised. The Bill is silent on that matter.</P>
    <P>I will now deal in greater detail with the areas the authority will regulate. The authority will be responsible for regulating and licensing people to provide services as private investigators, doorkeepers, installers of locks and security consultants. It will be an offence for a person providing such services not to have a licence. These terms are defined. For example, a private investigator is defined as someone who obtains or furnishes information in relation to the personal character, actions or occupation of a person. Everyone does that from time to time. We will all be asked on occasion to recommend such a person. All Deputies are asked from time to time to make inquiries about particular matters.</P>
    <P>It is not clear that the requirement to seek a licence is confined to those who provide these services on a full-time basis. It appears the legislation can apply to anyone who provides these services, whether part-time or otherwise. It is not clear that the services must be provided for a reward in order for them to be deemed licensable. From what I have read, there is no reference to the provision of services having to be for a reward. Despite all the detail and the 40 sections contained in the Bill, there is a considerable element of vagueness in terms of on whom the legislation imposes an obligation to seek a licence.</P>
    <P>I also have doubts about the provision relating to security consultants. Anybody who advises on <Col N="701" />methods of protecting property, including information in non-legible form, from vandalism, intrusion, trespass, theft, damage or interference, would have to seek a licence. It is normal that anybody who installs a computer system provides elementary advice on how to secure that system from intrusion. Are such persons to be required to seek a licence under this legislation? The Minister of State suggests that is not the case and I accept that it is not the intention of the legislation. However, the Minister of State should explain in his reply how such persons are excluded. They are not listed in the exemptions in section 3, whether part-timers or those providing other services to which security services are a necessary ancillary. There should be a provision to exclude such people.</P>
    <P>The focus should be on those aspects of security where there is a risk of abuse of power or force. The extension of the requirement for involvement in a licensing process to include those who simply monitor security equipment is going further than necessary with regard to the purpose of the legislation, which is to prevent the abuse of power. However, as the criteria are not set out in the Bill it is impossible to know the statutory intent as distinct from the Minister's political intent, which is irrelevant with regard to the interpretation of the legislation before the courts.</P>
    <P>I assume the strategic plan required in section 9 is a standard demand in all legislation. However, if we are asked to enact legislation of this kind by the Minister, he should set out the strategic plan in the Bill or in his speech. It should not be delegated to an authority to produce the plan. The strategy which this entity is to fulfil is something that should be set for it by its political masters. It should not set its own strategy and I would have expected the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>In section 14, the authority is given extensive powers to enter premises at reasonable times to inspect books and that sort of thing. That is par for the course but the fact that it has such extensive powers indicates why the Bill is so deficient in that it does not set out the criteria for the fulfilment of which such powers are exercisable. I am disappointed by that omission.</P>
    <P>I worry about such legislation from another perspective. When an industry is regulated by the State, licences begin to acquire a monetary value, the industry becomes a restrictive practice and becomes more expensive than previously. The best example of that is the so-called licensed trade. It is well known from the service it provides that it is licensed to sell alcoholic drinks. Those licences were initially introduced in the interests of public order and for good motives similar to those the Minister has with regard to this legislation. However, licences have allowed for restrictive practices where some people who happen to have acquired a licence from the State, for a particular area at a particular time, have been able to prevent others entering into competition against them where that could damage their <Col N="702" />profits. The licensing system in the matter of intoxicating liquor has become a method of allowing excessive profits in certain areas, although there are areas where excessive profits are not made. I doubt that excessive profits are made by many publicans in Roscommon town or in some other rural areas. In the Minister's city of Limerick and my area, however, I have no doubt that the licensing system operates to protect existing providers against competition.</P>
    <P>I am interested to know if consideration has been given to ensuring that this legislation is not used to that end and we do not have a situation &ndash; I cannot recall the precise economic term &ndash; where excessive profits are allowed by virtue of a system of State regulation. I do not suggest that the Bill should not proceed because that fear exists but there should be a provision whereby the Competition Authority would regularly oversee the activities of the private security authority and of all other licensing authorities as a matter of course. In all cases where there are licensing restrictions, the licensing authority should have to justify those restrictions every five years to an independent entity such as the Competition Authority. That would demonstrate that there is no question of excessive profits being made. An amendment to the legislation to that effect will enhance the legislation considerably and reduce the fears I have expressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. I pay tribute to my colleague, former Deputy John Farrelly, for his contribution to bringing this about. I regret, however, the vagueness of the legislation with regard to the criteria to be used in the exercise of its very extensive powers. The Minister, in introducing future legislation of this nature in different areas, should ensure that the criteria for the exercise of powers are set out more fully than is the case with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which provides for the establishment of a body known as the private security authority to control and supervise individuals and firms providing private security services, to investigate and adjudicate on any complaints against them, and for the establishment of the private security appeals board to hear and determine appeals against decisions of that authority. That is a laudable objective and it is clear we have paid a heavy price for the absence of legislation up to this. A vetting procedure is necessary to change that and to vet those working in the industry.</P>
      <P>If laws and regulations existed, there would be some chance of better operations. Anybody can work in this industry because no proper qualifications are required. As in every industry, there are unsuitable people, but that is a particular problem due to the total lack of regulation in the security industry, particularly in the context of night security. There are unsuitable people involved who contribute to the bad name of the security industry. This must be changed and that is why I welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" />About 11,000 people work in the industry which is a large number. Regulation is required and Ireland is one of few countries where there is none; only three other countries in Europe do not have controlling legislation in this area. Many of the problems that land at the door of the security industry are caused by the serious alcohol problem in Ireland. As a GP, the Ceann Comhairle will know as well as anyone that people endure many problems because of alcohol. One in four people that attend a hospital casualty department does so because of alcohol, and that rises to every second person after 6 p.m. I worked in a casualty department and can vouch for the prevalence of alcohol-related patients. The levels of drunkenness were such that one would not have to use anaesthetic on many patients admitted after a fight. The saddest thing is the number of young people involved.</P>
    <P>Work is created for the security industry because so many people are suffering from the effects of alcohol. The number of serious assaults points to the need for action in this area. I am aware that the industry has attempted self-regulation and has done quite well. There are good people in every industry but there are also individuals that are not interested in regulation. The absence of legislation is the cause of the problems. The report of the consultative group on the private security industry concluded that further scope for voluntary regulation had been exhausted and that the time was right to establish the Irish security authority to manage a comprehensive licensing system. This is an industry that needs to be controlled because of the serious potential for physical violence arising from the abuse of alcohol and the confrontational nature of the job. Everyone has witnessed aggressive doormen in action and it has, on occasion, resulted in serious assaults.</P>
    <P>The Bill has come about after much consultation with the industry. The annual turnover of the industry is approximately &euro;250 million and it is prone to people who are interested in making money quickly. Access to the industry is of paramount importance. Fundamental matters that must be addressed by the Bill include issuing licences to people and companies, the registration of licence holders, setting out required training standards and devising suitable training courses. It is important that those who receive licences are the best qualified to operate in the industry. I am aware of a Mayo security company that provides training. It has taken on a responsible role and has been successful. It is important that responsible, pro-active groups continue to have an input into monitoring the industry and that they are represented on the authority. There is a suggestion that the authority will consist of big businesses but the smaller companies and sole traders must be represented too.</P>
    <P>Alcohol is the major drug of misuse although it is often not recognised as such. Although people often do not think of those who abuse <Col N="704" />alcohol as drug addicts, they should. Some people have infiltrated nightlife with the criminal intention of pushing drugs.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Cassidy said about the use of CCTV. Anyone who watches programmes such as &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; will be aware of the use that can be made of these videotapes. The courts are increasingly using this footage as evidence. The presence of CCTV has driven criminals off the main streets in Dublin and the extension of such coverage is a good idea. The lack of video evidence can sometimes be telling. Even when someone is charged there can be a conflict of evidence that CCTV footage would go a long way towards settling. I have always been struck by the attempts of families looking for lost persons to access CCTV footage.</P>
    <P>During this debate we have concentrated on nightclubs, because they are the most prominent, but the debate must be extended to factories, shops, the use of dogs, etc. Private security may take over where the State does not provide adequate security. There is a direct relationship between the consumption of alcohol and the increasing need for the security industry. The lack of Garda resources will result in the greater use of private security. It is sad to see security people vetting people on the doors of businesses in every town &ndash; it is an indictment of our society. There is need for regulation because of heavy-handed interference with people. Society has deteriorated and it is sad that we need such a high security system.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed because it will ensure, as far as possible, that people of good character are involved in this industry. It is important that those who deal with the public, particularly in this industry, are of good character. I hope this Bill will bring an end to the misuse of this industry by unscrupulous individuals, psychopaths and drug dealers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <P>This Bill is based on a Private Members' Bill, introduced as the Door Supervisors Bill by a former Deputy, Mr. John Farrelly, on 24 and 25 March 1998. On 24 March the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave a commitment that he would introduce legislation to provide for the regulation of the private security industry in general. Although this Bill was published in 2001 we have had to wait until now for it to come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowley spoke about the impact of alcohol on car accidents, particularly at weekends. I defy the Minister to provide information on the number of car accidents involving someone who has taken alcohol and the number of fatalities arising from that. Such information cannot be provided. I sought it from the Department on a number of occasions, but blood alcohol tests are carried out after a road traffic fatality at the discretion of the coroner in each area. We do not know if 30%, 40% or 50% of fatal accidents involve alcohol. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, <Col N="705" />to examine that issue. Perhaps we should consider amending the Coroners Act, because we need accurate figures.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a person who works in the ambulance service last weekend and he informed me that the number of call outs for road traffic accidents has decreased from five per week to one per week since the penalty points system was introduced. The system is having a dramatic impact on road safety. I am sure the Minister of State will ensure that the additional resources the Garda Síochána badly needs to enforce the penalty points system will be provided next year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation, which is long overdue. A commitment was given in March 1998 that the legislation would be published and enacted. Former Deputy Farrelly must be commended for publishing legislation related to this area and for frequently pursuing this matter on the Order of Business. It is a pity John Farrelly is not a Member of the House and present to contribute to the debate the Bill. He was committed to ensuring that legislation would be enacted in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to regulate the activities of door supervisors or bouncers. It also deals with other issues relating to the private security industry. Some of the main difficulties with regard to bouncers are violent assaults, drugs and the black economy. We have all heard examples of such activities. Many security men have not been properly trained and they do not know how to handle incidents inside or outside nightclubs. Bouncers believe their sole purpose is to punish individuals who cause a disturbance in a nightclub rather than removing them from the premises. We have had numerous incidents where bouncers caused grievous bodily harm to individuals who were ejected from a premises.</P>
    <P>It will soon be compulsory for nightclubs in certain areas of Cork to have closed circuit television cameras if they want to renew their licences. I hope that will happen in every nightclub throughout the country because a significant number of incidents, some of which involve door supervisors or bouncers, occur at the entrances to nightclubs. Employers should ensure that security cameras are put in place as they would protect bouncers and the premises. I hope the Minister of State examines the licensing laws with a view to introducing such a provision.</P>
    <P>Many bouncers are in favour of this legislation. They are concerned about the issues related to this area and they want their profession and the industry properly regulated. The legislation will help provide improved public safety and it will give members of the public confidence about bouncers.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for complaints to be made and inquiries to be carried out. Section 36 states that any person may make a complaint in writing to the authority against a licensee in relation to the provision by the licensee of a security service. However, if one is assaulted by a bouncer when leaving a nightclub, how can one pursue that individual if one does not know him? One does not <Col N="706" />have any right to ask to see their identification. That issue must be addressed. It is a flaw in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 27, which deals with identity cards, states that a member of the Garda Síochána, a member of the staff of the authority which issues the licence or a person for whom the licensee is providing a security service can seek identification. However, if a door supervisor, whom one would hope is properly licensed, assaults me outside a nightclub, I cannot seek identification. While I have the right to make a complaint about an assault or maltreatment by an individual, I am not entitled to see their identification. If I look for the identification number, name and station of a member of the Garda Síochána, he or she is legally obliged to provide them. The same should apply in this area. If we want investigations to take place and if we want the public to be confident about the regulation of door supervisors and bouncers, it is fundamentally important that people should be able to seek identification. This area has been neglected for many years.</P>
    <P>We have all heard about assaults involving door supervisors which have happened in areas, including that represented by the Minister of State, throughout the country. Door supervisors often disappear off the face of the earth. Employers do not know where they have gone and they do not leave a forwarding address. Many of them leave the country if they have committed a criminal offence. I hope the legislation regulates this area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify the type of offence a person commits if he or she employs an unlicensed door supervisor. I know there is a &euro;1,500 fine for an unlicensed person who works in the industry. Unscrupulous employers may employ unlicensed supervisors for pubs and nightclubs. What sanctions, other than the non-renewal of licences &ndash; which could take 12 months &ndash; are imposed on such employers? We must address that issue.</P>
    <P>We must seriously consider the introduction of compulsory identification to ensure the protection of door supervisors. There has been much debate about this issue and about individual rights. However, with the increasing abuse of underage drinking, we must introduce compulsory identification. There will be a greater obligation on door supervisors to provide a reason for someone being refused entry to a premises.</P>
    <P>If someone is refused entry without being given a plausible explanation and wishes to take a complaint, he or she does not know who the complaint is being taken against because the individual involved does not have identification. I hope that issue can be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the expansion of the legislation to include not only door supervisors but other elements of the security sector which have been outside regulation to date. Those elements include the installers of security equipment and security guards and there have been instances where unscrupulous individuals in this sector <Col N="707" />have facilitated robberies. Certain subversive elements have been involved in the industry as well. It is an ideal opportunity to get to know everything about a business under the guise of providing security advice and services. In reality all these people are doing is casing the joint in order to carry out a robbery at some later stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for exemptions to the legislation, which include references to the Garda and the Defence Forces, and section 3(1)(<i>d</i>) highlights the provisions in regard to airport police. Does this exemption apply to all airport police or just those employed by Aer Rianta? There is a different legal definition of airport police employed by the State authority and those employed by regional airports. The police at regional airports do not have the power to detain an individual which seriously restricts their ability to provide security. Now that we are investing millions of euro to improve security at regional airports, can the Minister of State clarify whether they are covered by this section's exemptions or will regulation be required?</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a list of reasons for refusal by the authorities to grant or renew a licence, one of which is if a person is not a fit or proper person to provide a security service. That is pretty broad. I presume provision has been made for referral to the Garda to ensure that a person is of upstanding character, but does the authority have the right to be provided with the conviction record of a particular individual? Is it the case that the Garda will simply say whether or not the person is suitable? What sort of convictions are we talking about? Reference is made to convictions for involvement in an illegal organisation, but my concern relates to cases where people may not have convictions though complaints have been made about them regarding, for example, the use of Rohypnol. A prime example of that is a court case taking place in the west of Ireland, though the allegation there has not been made against a door supervisor. It was made against another member of staff. However, it could be the case in another nightclub that complaints are made consistently to the Garda about young girls waking in the morning unable to remember what happened the night before. Tests may be done and Rohypnol or a similar drug detected without a conviction due to lack of evidence. It is virtually impossible to get a conviction unless the person is discovered in the act of putting the drug into a drink. Surely, a question mark must hang over such a premises and I ask how that can be addressed in the licensing process.</P>
    <P>Bouncers have a responsibility to ensure the security and integrity of a premises and to ensure that it is not being abused in relation to the use of Rohypnol or some other drug. If the Garda raids a club and a person is found to be in possession of or selling drugs, the licensee can be prosecuted, but what about the individuals who are providing security? How does this relate to a person who is not fit and proper to provide such <Col N="708" />a service? There must be a question mark over individuals when the events I have described happen on premises. Does the authority have the right to access and retain information regarding convictions? The Garda can describe a person as unfit if he or she has convictions. However, what is the scenario if the Garda has concerns but has not secured a conviction against an individual?</P>
    <P>There are serious difficulties in relation to delays in getting Garda approval and clearance, especially in voluntary organisations. Is the Garda going to be provided with additional resources to ensure that it can deal with these matters swiftly? This means people are being allowed to work with children and will be issued with security licences on a temporary basis until clearance can be provided by the Garda. Naturally, there is going to be an immense bottleneck as soon as this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions to be asked in relation to approval and concerns about individuals who may not have been convicted for anything though the Garda has serious doubts about them. That state of affairs exists in the taxi industry in Dublin. There are people with convictions who should not be in possession of a taxi licence and I wish to know if that will be the case in the private security sector. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>If the Minister of State listened for a little while he might learn much.

It fell on deaf ears. After all this time, suddenly the Minister of State is impatient, petulant and sarcastic. I recognise Ministers are given wide scope in their brief.

      <P>Just in case the Minister of State thinks that is beyond the ambit of what might happen, there have been instances in this city during the past ten years involving bouncers in public places. Some of the most horrendous incidents involved death. In one particular case a young man was being ejected on the basis of drunkenness and disorderly behaviour. In evidence at the trial it was suggested by a security person that in the course of ejecting the person he or others became sexually aroused and the upshot of it was that the young man in question was raped. While that is just a single issue there have been countless other similar incidents. There was an incident in the city not many years ago, where a young man who saw two students being beaten by bouncers outside a premises intervened and was fatally injured. When I detect a certain impatience and petulance from the Government side I am not impressed. Of all the issues one could think of&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will take your cue from that. I wish to touch on a matter raised by Deputy Naughten and others and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in recent days. There is a notion abroad that every young person is a potential thug and for some unknown reason that somebody should beat them up and kick them around the place. If one treats people like that one gets violence. Violence begets violence. Heretofore, people who were unlicensed and had no authority to beat anybody seemed to think they had a licence to kill. The situation that has prevailed in recent years has been intolerable.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said there is a responsibility on the premises concerned in respect of drink being made freely available to persons, whether young, old or middle aged, who have had enough. There is also a responsibility on the nightclub or premises which charges a fee to persons of whatever age. After people have been fed drink and reject it, they are surplus to requirement and are thrown out on the street. A contract exists between the promoters and the consumer but nobody seems to think about it. Nobody thinks the unfortunate citizen has rights. The culture of recent years is that where a person becomes inebriated they should be unceremoniously ejected from the premises, despite having been granted the hospitality of the place. Those people have rights and are entitled to be treated as citizens, as human beings, with the potential to uphold the law. The premises or the promoter has a responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything about cases pending, but I could and I would have quite an amount of information which is alarming in relation to some security firms. There are some security firms that run their business on a proper footing and have due regard for people's rights and entitlements and to the fact that they do not have a licence to carry on in an unlicensed manner. <Col N="711" />There are others who think the opposite and that the uniform of a particular type is sufficient guarantee to do whatever one has to do or can do. It has been noticeable that young men of small stature appear to be a great target for some of these attacks. It is well known in the business that most bullies will seldom pick on somebody their own size, they usually pick on a smaller person. It is easy to score in such situations or at least that is how they see it.</P>
    <P>Certain things envisaged in the Bill have been thought about belatedly. I am not certain the Bill is capable of covering all these eventualities. In the course of the Minister of State's further consideration of the Bill I ask him to go through it carefully, line by line, in the knowledge that after it is enacted, certain credentials will be accorded to those in the security business. There are no problems with those who already observe and have due regard for the law, but there will be serious problems for those who abuse and ignore the law and ultimately there could be serious consequences for those who grant licences to those who breach the laws again.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for allowing the Minister of State to upset me, although I assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, he did not upset me at all.</P>

If that leaves the Minister of State short of inspiration he should look at all the unsolved crimes and the increase in crime generally on a daily basis.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The termination of the first-time buyer's grant announced on 14 November 2002 arose from the necessity, in the context of the 2003 Estimates, for the Government to ensure a sustainable match between expenditure and resources and to concentrate housing programmes on areas of greatest impact and social need. It is not proposed to review the basis on which the scheme was terminated or to reintroduce the grant.</P>
      <P>In the context of the changes involved, the Government has sought to ensure fair treatment by ensuring that all applications approved or pending in my Department will, subject to the normal conditions of the scheme, qualify for grant payment. In addition, people who had already made commitments in the form of signed contracts or by the pouring of foundations on or before 14 November 2002 have been given an opportunity to apply for the grant. The position of persons approved for a new house under the affordable housing or shared ownership schemes is also being recognised. In providing a grace period up to 4 December for cases such as these, first-time buyers who are at the most advanced stage of purchase or building are being facilitated as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The payment of a booking deposit which is subject to contract does not constitute a contract and is therefore excluded from the above arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people buying their homes need clarification on this matter. What does the Minister mean when he says those buying under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes are being recognised? Does he agree that first-time buyers who have paid a booking deposit have shown a clear intent to purchase a home but have not signed a contract because their house has not yet been built &ndash; the Minister will be aware that very often houses are sold off <Col N="713" />plans &ndash; and will he not consider at least extending the first-time buyer's grant to them?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that there will be substantial savings to the Government as a result of the abolition of this grant &ndash; I understand it is approximately &euro;40 million. Will he identify, specifically, which housing programme will receive that money? I cannot find a place for it anywhere in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's questions. I have tried to make clear to all local authorities what I mean by affordable housing and the shared ownership scheme. Many projects around the country have already commenced. Most of the people to be allocated a house in a particular scheme have been so informed by the local authority and they are included in this scheme. I took the view that because the local authority is the contracting authority in this regard, the owner, who may not have all the internal documentation in his or her possession but who has been informed that house A, B or C is being allocated to him or her, is included in this scheme.</P>
      <P>I will draw a corollary for the Deputy. I have allowed those who have only their foundations poured but who will complete a house within the next 12 months to be included also. Those who are involved in the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes are also included in the scheme. I am sure local authorities have the wit to work that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include people who paid a deposit under the shared ownership scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because they are dealing with the local authority which is the contractor in a shared ownership scheme. I presume the paper work in that regard is in order and indications to my Department are that local authorities have cleared up this matter satisfactorily. Many questions raised by my colleagues have been satisfactorily cleared up for them in discussion with their local authorities. If the Deputy has any particular scheme to which he wishes me to refer I will undertake to do so. It is only right that those involved in such schemes be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I widened the scheme substantially from the cut-off point. Usually only those approved would be included in the scheme. I widened that to include those who had submitted forms but had not yet received approval. I went further and included those who had signed contracts and poured foundations. The scheme is extremely wide. We expect the number of extra applications received up to 27 November to be in the region of 5,500. It is indicative that everybody in the marketplace who wished to be included has been included. The money saved next year, as the Deputy knows, will be small &ndash; in the region of about &euro;8 million &ndash; but indications are, on the basis of applications sent out and downloaded, <Col N="714" />that savings in the current year, if any, will be minute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, has considerably strengthened public participation in the planning process. The imposition, under the new Act and regulations, of a fee for the making of a submission or observation on a planning application is against the background of a very open and transparent planning system, of which public participation is a key element at all stages.</P>
      <P>The city, town or county development plan provides the framework within which all planning applications are determined. Public participation is actively encouraged during the making of a development plan and there is no charge involved. In addition, the public has full access, free of charge, to all documentation submitted with an individual planning application. It is only when a person wishes to formally lodge a submission or observation on an application that the fee arises.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the fee is to contribute towards the enhanced service, required under the 2000 Act and the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, to be provided by planning authorities to persons who makes submissions. I am satisfied that the fee has been set at a level which will not deter any person or body who has genuine concerns in relation to a planning application and I have no proposals for amendment of the requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. Individuals and community groups are being disenfranchised by the &euro;20 charge. Does the Minister not feel that individual observations assist professional planners in their assessment of a planning application and that over the years contributions from individuals, community groups and non-governmental organisations, such as An Taisce, have been of tremendous use to the local authority in terms of assessing planning applications? That source of free advice is being lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that many individuals and community groups are finding out far too late <Col N="715" />that if they do not make an initial observation and pay the &euro;20 charge they have no recourse to An Bord Pleanála? I have had quite a few representations from people who are astounded to find out that they must pay &euro;20 and that if they have not paid the charge they have no right of access to An Bord Pleanála. Does the Minister not feel that this is disenfranchising the poorest and weakest in society and preventing them from making their views known on planning applications which often have an impact on their neighbourhood and homes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is I do not. The regulations and legislation brought in under the 2000 planning legislation have made the planning system more transparent. Observations and all the documentation under a planning application are available free of charge although they are a cost on the local authority in human resource, time and cash terms. A &euro;20 charge is not the real cost and it is only a marginal imposition on an individual or group putting forward an application. It is set at the margin simply to insist the contribution is to local authorities. People make applications for many different things and are quite happy to pay for them. This streamlines the matter. It is recognised internationally that the Irish planning process is probably the most open and transparent planning system in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to hear that because I believe openness and transparency do not go hand in hand when there is a charge to enter into debate. In a sense it is an exclusive club one must pay a &euro;20 charge to enter. That flies in the face of allowing access to local democracy. Does the Minister agree that it is a lot easier for city and county councillors or Deputies to make representations and pay the &euro;20 fee than it is for people of limited means? Does he also agree that often it is the single householder or a family that lives next to a proposed development who will be most affected and who will find the charge quite daunting? Does the Minister not think that representations are a source of free advice which are now being lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy suggests and I am sure that at heart he does not believe it either. The planning is a transparent process done in a public way. If someone wants to lodge a submission formally then a &euro;20 fee must accompany it. In today's world that is easily affordable by almost anybody and it is certainly not a bar to a proper planning process.</P>

      <P>The results of the most recent statutory assessment of local authority housing need indicated that, at 28 March 2002, a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing. This represents an increase of 23.5% on the results of the previous assessment undertaken at the end of March 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need and has been responding actively to this situation by expanding on our social and affordable housing output. For example, this year we will deliver the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for over 15 years. I anticipate that total social housing output this year, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures, will meet the needs of approximately 13,000 households on waiting lists compared to just over 8,500 households in 2000. The Government will continue to maintain the high levels of overall social housing output in 2003 and onwards to meet needs within the constraints now bearing on public expenditure programmes.</P>
      <P>A particular feature of Government efforts in recent years has been a diversification of instruments and increases in support of voluntary and affordable housing. This approach will continue in 2003, with increased output anticipated in these housing sectors.</P>

Will he confirm that does not take into account those people seeking transfers from overcrowded local authority dwellings? How can he reconcile the huge increase in the number of people waiting for social housing with the effective 10% cut in the Estimate for social housing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the assessment is 23.5% not 25%. It does not include people seeking transfers. This is an assessment of needs and of how many new dwelling units will be needed to cater for those needs. It does not include people seeking a transfer for overcrowding, or whatever, on the basis that if a family of six looking for a transfer moved out we would be able to accommodate a smaller family in that unit. Therefore, this is not an indication of the number of allocations or transfer lists. It is an assessment of the number of new dwelling units needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no 10% cut. The expenditure on local authority housing over the last two years has doubled. It was &euro;470 million two years ago. We <Col N="717" />will not make a huge leap forward next year but we will maintain the base. We expect that next year the number of starts will be up on this year's number although the number of completions will probably be somewhat down depending on the way the cycle goes. For a year or two our priority may be to hold the expanded base. Hopefully, as soon as resources permit we can move forward again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister of State say there is no cut when there is a 5% cut in actual figures and when we take building inflation into consideration, the cut is about 10%? How can he reconcile his statement with the 23.5% increase in the numbers awaiting housing? Does he agree that we are now condemning people who are nine or ten years on a housing list to waits of ten and 11 years? In view of the fact that people are being forced into the private rental sector, does he agree that local authorities now need the resources and have the responsibility to examine and vet the hovels to which people are condemned? I could take the Minister of State around this city and Cork and show him the lack of enforcement of building regulations with regard to the hovels into which people are forced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to building inflation we are getting better value this year. There is an indication in tenders coming into local authorities that they are more competitive. We expect the &euro;900 million we are providing this year to go further than last year. Those indications are there and more builders are tendering for jobs. Some years ago we were lucky if we could get two tenders.</P>
      <P>A large number of the 48,000 on the waiting list, 32%, are single people. That is an extraordinary figure and it has grown in recent years. Up to about eight or ten years ago a single or separated person could not get on a local authority waiting list unless he or she was over 55 or 60 years of age. We changed the law and single people over 18 can now get on the list. Along with the 32% that are single, another 29% are lone parents with one child. The length of time someone is on a list varies. It depends on the letting scheme used by the local authority.</P>

      <P>Current global modelling of sea level change predicts a rise in the range of nine to 88 centimetres by 2100. For Ireland, the effects are likely to be accentuated where high tides coincide with storm surges. Coastal flood plains are most at risk and the south of the country is likely to be affected first. The impacts of sea level rise will be most apparent in major cities where infrastructure is at risk of inundation.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, specifically empowers planning authorities to provide in their development plans that development in areas at risk of flooding, whether inland or coastal, may be regulated, restricted or controlled. If development is proposed in a flood-risk area, planning permission can be refused, if necessary. My Department is currently preparing guidelines for planning authorities on development plans, to be published first in draft form for public consultation. The question of indicating areas which are liable to flooding on development plan maps will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility in relation to flooding rests with the Office of Public Works. My Department's main concern is to ensure that, when adverse conditions arise, local authorities are geared to respond promptly and effectively to help offset the worst effects in relation to those aspects for which they have direct responsibility. In this regard, my Department has included a strategic drainage study of the Dublin region in the current water services investment programme. This is expected to identify policies, strategies and projects for developing a sustainable drainage system for the growing greater Dublin area, including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. While the study will deal with all drainage issues, it will deal specifically with flooding problems, including those linked to climate change. It will take account of available international and national research and proposed solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study began in 2001 and is expected to be completed by July 2003. In addition, the consultants have been instructed to produce an interim <Col N="719" />assessment of short-term flood protection measures for the River Tolka catchment and their costs, which might be possible in advance of the completion of the main report. This interim assessment is expected shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware there has been no revision of the guidelines to local authorities in terms of determining planning applications since the last ones were issued in 1981 and that they are seriously out of date? Does he not feel there is a huge problem with recent flooding? The vast new housing estates being built in Kildare and Meath in the greater Dublin area are causing flash flooding downstream because of the impermeability of tarmacadam and concrete. Those waters are flooding into rivers like the Tolka which is compounded by possible rising sea levels and tide and rainfall increases. When one adds to that the failure of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to seriously tackle climate change and when one examines our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, we are spiralling out of control. Does the Minister not agree he is not paying enough attention to the issue of climate change given that emissions will be 175% over the level they should be in eight years' time?</P>
      <P>Surely, the Minister needs to tackle the issue of climate change. The document he launched today merely pays lip-service to it because it states that it seeks to minimise the increase rather than fulfilling obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. Does the Minister agree he has little control over climate change and that the kind of flooding problems we have had in Cork, Dublin and Clonmel will continue unless he takes radical steps to plan where development should take place? There seems to be no evidence of that in the strategic planning guidelines, certainly not in the way local authorities are flouting them, and there is no indication of new legislation in the national spatial strategy.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply to the Deputy, guidelines are being drafted at present which we will have shortly. These will form part of the discussions with local authorities and have done so already. I agree we need specific and strict guidelines in this regard. It is no excuse, however, for a local authority to make decisions on flood plains without regard to common sense. That is the basis from which we should all operate. In my former role as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I specifically issued guidelines in regard to what happened with many new motorways two or three years ago, insisting that account be taken of flooding impacts from developments in the area. The Department is there to assist local authorities in this, as is the Office of Public Works. I understand that yesterday evening the Minister of State in that area announced a full review of flooding <Col N="720" />and its impact, and that is a positive aspect to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>On climate change, I am not satisfied with the situation in Ireland. We are under pressure. We have legal obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and our agreements within the EU. As a nation, we want to live in a better environment. Support will be needed from all sectors of society, including this House, to deliver the major changes, particularly in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As the Deputy points out, the average emission per person in the EU is ten tonnes whereas, unfortunately, in Ireland it is 17.7 tonnes. That is a serious problem. I will continue to ensure that I drive forward legislation, rules and regulations to change this aspect but I need public support over a range of issues to counteract this.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the housing study 2002, produced by the Society of Chartered Surveyors, which found that only 10,000 new houses are coming on stream in Dublin each year, while up to 20,000 are needed; the steps he intends to take to ensure that the shortfall is addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the study referred to in the question. The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area estimated that there would be a need for 17,000 to 20,000 units for the five year period 2001 to the end of 2005 for the full greater Dublin area. The need for the Dublin area alone is somewhat less, estimated at about 13,000 to 15,000 units per annum over the five year period 2001 to the end of 2005. This is below the figures suggested in the Society of Chartered Surveyors report. I expect that the publication of the national spatial strategy will provide a context and structure for the review of the strategic planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Government is firmly committed to the continuation of the measures which we initiated in our previous term to increase the supply of housing, including increasing investment in the provision of serviced land for housing and more effective use of that land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities. These measures have led to record levels of house completions and there are strong indications that output in 2002 will exceed the 52,602 completions achieved in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" />This strong performance is particularly reflected in the Dublin region. I expect that house completions in the Dublin area will considerably exceed 10,000 units this year, thereby demonstrating that the funding and institutional mechanisms put in place by the Government are now having an impact on increasing housing output in Dublin. There are also good indications for the future supply of houses in the Dublin region as registrations with Home Bond have increased 81% in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year. In addition, provisional data from the latest annual national inventory of zoned serviced land, issued in June 2002, shows that there were about 5,580 acres of zoned serviced land available in Dublin, with an estimated housing yield of 96,700 units. The overall objective of the Government is to continue to maintain these record levels of output to satisfy the projected housing demand.</P>

      <P>What is the Minister of State's view of the report issued last week by the four voluntary agencies &ndash; Focus, Simon, Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul &ndash; on housing, which indicates that almost one out of every four newly formed households in Dublin cannot afford to buy a house in the city? Does he agree that, due to the continuing failure, as evidenced in his reply, to provide the number of new dwellings required to meet the need in Dublin, prices are being driven up and young people are being driven to seek housing in dormitory towns as far away as Westmeath and Offaly? These people are obliged to commute to and from Dublin and deal with all the consequences that entails in terms of transport and lifestyle. Aside from the general problem of high house prices, what does the Government intend to do to deal with the fact that people on good incomes cannot now afford to provide homes for themselves in our capital city? </P>

      <P>May I try to answer any of the Deputy's questions? I may have lost some of the points he made at this stage. There is more to buying a house than the price. The affordability index, which is compiled in my Department, indicates the price of a house, the interest rate one pays, the level of disposable income, etc. Those are all major factors. Nobody denies the fact that house prices have increased enormously in recent years, although the increase this year is quite reasonable. I accept that there are pressures and, because of these, the Department and successive Governments have tried to help people who are caught in the limbo to which I refer by introducing measures such as the affordable housing scheme. I believe this excellent scheme will be of huge benefit in the future and there are already a number of major innovative projects in progress, under Part V and PPP proposals, with developers in areas such as Fingal. As a result, a far greater number of houses at more reasonable and affordable prices are becoming available. That is the way forward. We need to greatly expand the affordable housing scheme to provide more houses at an acceptable price for the people to whom Deputy Gilmore referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State, who is responsible for housing, come back to the real world? He is completely out of touch with reality in informing the House that people on good incomes, such as a garda, a nurse or a teacher, can afford to buy a home in Dublin. Given that the report issued by the four voluntary agencies was based on the housing strategies drawn up by the local authorities in Dublin, is the Minister of State satisfied with a situation where one out of every two newly formed households in the capital <Col N="723" />city cannot now afford to buy a home here? What is the Government going to do about this?</P>

      <P>The report to which Deputy Gilmore referred was mainly concerned with the housing strategies. Local authorities completed those strategies and they will be reviewed. The Deputy and I have both served as members of local authorities. The people who issued the report last week were on the local authority SPCs, but they are now standing back and being rather critical. Those first attempts at housing strategies will be reviewed and amended by local authorities and I have no doubt we are all learning as the process goes on. I agree there are many new households which cannot afford housing. I referred earlier to the approximately &euro;900 million being spent this year on local authority housing.</P>

      <Col N="724" />On Deputy Allen's point, I agree that some parents are contributing. On the affordable housing aspect, local authorities were very short of land a few years ago.

Much of that land has now been, or will be, converted into affordable units.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, the operation of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, is being reviewed to ensure that it is meeting its objectives in relation to social and affordable housing. The review is being undertaken by officials in my Department in consultation with major stakeholders. As part of the review, the Department wrote to each city and county council and also consulted a wide range of interested bodies, including representatives of the house building industry, professional institutes and social housing providers. Follow-up meetings were also held with a number of bodies to give them the opportunity to elaborate on their written submissions. The review is almost complete.</P>
      <P>There is no question of setting aside the requirement on developers to assist towards the provision of social and affordable housing. The aim is to ensure that the objectives of Part V in relation to social integration are met while also ensuring a good supply of housing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reported that the Minister is prepared to take a levy from developers, or to allow local authorities to accept a levy instead of houses because they are not in a position to avail of some of the schemes. How many houses have come into the social housing sector under this umbrella? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I have show the position up to August. A total of 50 units had been, or were about to be, occupied on foot of Part V agreements, with many more units the subject of pre-planning discussions and final negotiations between authorities, developers and builders. Having consulted some of the larger authorities, it is estimated that around 300 units may come on stream before the end of this year. Of the 33 strategies, 26 provide for the full 20% provision. Kilkenny provides for 18.7%, Laois 17.5% and the remaining five &ndash; Cavan, Donegal, Fingal, Offaly and south Dublin &ndash; 15%. A total of 19 specify a split between social and affordable housing, 14 do not.</P>
      <P>I made it clear to the developers and the building industry last Friday that if they think that I will make any change in the 20% social and affordable housing they are wrong. It is centrally important and social integration is at the heart of it. It is being said that there needs to be less rigidity in the system to get this and to get the volumes and the housing supply up. I am examining various options which are already being used imaginatively from what I have gathered from discussions with local authorities in Dublin and other parts of the country. I am coming to a conclusion on that. All of the different parties have been in to me and I have also had discussions with my officials. I hope that we will have an outcome. The heart of the provision will not change.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister now agree with the Labour Party's criticism of the way in which Part V was introduced? Four years after it was initially announced, only 50 units of accommodation have so far been produced under this scheme.

      <P>Three hundred is still pathetic. In relation to the review, will the Minister consider closing the loophole in the existing provision whereby a site of less than half an acre does not <Col N="726" />come under the scheme and, therefore, apartment developments in urban areas, some of which are benefiting from urban renewal tax benefits, are not required to make any contribution to the social housing provision? There are applications for planning permission for significant apartment developments &ndash; 40 and 50 units perhaps &ndash; on such sites where there is no requirement at present to provide social housing. Will the Minister consider, as part of his review, closing that loophole so that, particularly urban authorities with large housing lists, can benefit from the scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister is not proposing any major changes to the legislation. I repeat a question I put to his colleague. If the developers do not move ahead with sites would he consider down-zoning the land? The provision is there within the 2000 Act. It is a powerful provision which could be used to bring some of the major landowners to heel. Some of the big boys are standing firm and not proceeding with applications and we need to use all of the powers of the State to ensure that those lands come on stream. Otherwise the housing crisis will continue.</P>

      <P>I agree in principle with both Deputies that we do need to maintain the housing supply and get more people into social and affordable housing. We need better integration. That is at the heart of this issue. I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the numbers have not been delivered. The Act is only now coming into effect. The one thing that Deputy Gilmore did not say was that there was a serious need for a change in the public mindset. There has been enormous resistance, as the Deputy would be well aware, to people purchasing these houses. We have overcome that now. I have only come into office and I am dealing with it. I think that the Deputy would recognise that. Local authorities, the social housing partners, those who deliver the type of housing have told me, as have county managers, that if there was less rigidity in the system a bigger volume might go through.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cuffe talks about the withering issue. There is a dilemma because I do not want to lose out on the complete supply of housing. Coming back to some questions which the Minister of State answered earlier, housing supply is the real question in the market and this is now up to record figures this year at somewhere around 55,000. We need to sustain that type of figure for the next ten years without dropping it below 50,000 per annum. That is essential to meet the requirements we all want.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy was published earlier today and a copy was sent to each Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The strategy is a 20 year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to grow and develop to its potential. It recognises that various regions of the country have different roles and aims to organise and co-ordinate these roles in a complementary way. The strategy's objective is to allow regions to become more competitive in terms of investment and job opportunities, while ensuring a high quality urban environment as well as vibrant rural areas.</P>
      <P>The strategy aims to build up the strengths of different areas in order to achieve more balanced regional development and population growth. It recognises that a greater share of economic activity must take place outside the greater Dublin area. To achieve this, the strategy sets out a framework within which gateways, hubs and other urban and rural areas will act together to allow areas to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In completing the strategy my Department has had the benefit of an extensive public consultation process and has sought to take account of the spatial aspects of a wide range of economic, social and environmental policies in collaboration <Col N="728" />with other Departments, agencies and bodies primarily responsible for these policies.</P>
    <P>The priority now is to ensure effective implementation of the strategy. In the coming weeks I intend visiting each region to communicate and discuss with a wide cross section of public representatives and interest groups the implications of the strategy for that region. Regional planning guidelines under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, will be a key step in implementing the strategy. Extensive public consultation in the preparation of such guidelines is a requirement under the Act. Similarly, as city and county development plans are reviewed to take account of the spatial strategy, the enhanced process of public consultation in relation to the preparation of development plans provided for under the Act will apply.</P>
    <P>On the issue of investment in infrastructure, such investment must take account of prevailing macro-economic and budgetary conditions. The national spatial strategy is a 20 year planning framework and is robust enough to deal with the various economic cycles which will occur over that period.</P>
    <P>The strategy sets out a number of measures intended to enhance cross-Border co-operation in the spatial aspect of a range of economic issues. Co-operative arrangements to promote implementation of the national spatial strategy and the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland will be advanced.</P>
    <P>County and other large towns, such as Drogheda, will have a vital role to play in achieving balanced regional development. They will provide bases for investment, economic activity and growth. Drogheda has considerable potential given its scale, its established enterprise base, its strategic position on the Dublin-Belfast corridor and its communications and business links with the greater Dublin area. I am satisfied that the national spatial strategy provides for the optimum number of gateways and hubs which will function to connect with and energise other urban areas to achieve more balanced regional development across the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on his Department's press release today which states that Drogheda is a primary development centre in the greater Dublin area, as well as being important for County Louth and the east of County Meath? Will the Minister tell me where Drogheda is mentioned in the planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, as I do not think it is mentioned? Does the Minister agree it is a disgrace that Drogheda is ignored in the plan, especially given that it is the largest town in County Louth, it is bigger than Dundalk, it has a population of over 30,000 and it plans to grow to over 70,000 people? It is a disgrace that the strategic Government plan for hubs and gateways does not mention investment in such a vibrant and economically important town. Drogheda has been ignored by being left off the list. Will the <Col N="729" />Minister comment on the fact that the motorway link between Drogheda and Drogheda Port, which will cost &euro;22 million, has not received funding from the Department of the Environment and Local Government? The road is essential to the development of Drogheda. Does the Minister agree he ought to resign?</P>

      <P>The Deputy should allow me to finish. I understand that people cannot be expected to grasp all the detail of the strategy as it has just been published. Drogheda was not included in Fine Gael's plans for building the nation, which is a statement of consistency with the Government's point of view. It is equally important to point out that the four new national gateways, which will be developed in addition to the five existing gateways, are in the BMW region, as are seven of the new hubs. I have listened in this House for many years to the argument that we need to encourage growth in the west, the midlands and along the Border. When Deputies, councillors and the public have studied the report in detail they will see that every area is included. Drogheda is located in a strategic position and we could not move it tomorrow if we wanted to.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm to the House that legislation will be required to implement the strategy, as he stated in a television interview at lunchtime? Will he say what the legislation will be? I remind the Minister of a previous interview he gave in which he stated that one of the purposes of the strategy will be to retard the growth of Dublin and I recall the statements he made, including one in his reply today, about balanced regional development. When one looks at the small print of the document, however, one sees that a different policy is being pursued.</P>
      <P>This document provides not for balanced regional development but for the continued growth of the greater Dublin area, which will include the counties of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and south Louth. The strategy projects that the population of the greater Dublin area will grow to about two million people by 2020 and that almost 50% of the State's population will live in Dublin by that date, compared to 40% now. Despite all the ballyhoo about regional development, the most that can be said about this document is that it does not do what it says it does. Does the Minister agree that a core element of the strategy is not regional development, but the continued growth, development and consolidation of the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a great deal of the Deputy's remarks and I am delighted to respond to him. I said earlier that I am considering the introduction of legislation to underpin the spatial strategy. Certain aspects of the strategy, such as the part dealing with regional authorities which have a strong function in the plan, will have to be established with a legislative base if they are to work properly. I am looking at other issues in that context and it would be wise to consider them fully. It is interesting that certain important powers that were provided for in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, in advance of the publi<Col N="731" />cation of the spatial strategy, have not yet been used. They will almost certainly come into effect now in terms of the guidelines for planning authorities' development plans.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore is right to suggest that it would have been foolhardy and ridiculous to produce a report suggesting that one could suddenly stop Dublin from growing, as the reality is that it will continue to grow. The over-development that has been prevalent in Dublin in the past ten years will continue if we do nothing. The strategy recognises that Dublin, just like the capital city of any major country worth its salt, is the centre of international focus. The strategy will slow the growth of Dublin, but it recognises realistically that it cannot be stopped. The plan projects growth of between a minimum of 500,000 and a maximum of one million in Dublin's population. I suspect that the final growth figure will be somewhere between the two. The strategy is robust enough to take account of the fact that growth may even exceed the maximum figure.</P>
      <P>On that basis, it is important that we develop engines in different parts of the country. People will take a subjective view of whether they are happy or unhappy with the plan for their area, but the reality is that we have to select for development areas that have a critical mass. Local authorities, chambers of commerce, the business community and the social partners have worked on this plan for three years. The arguments we have heard echo those made in Denmark and the Netherlands when plans were produced in those countries. The national spatial strategy has a 20 year timeframe &ndash; I would not pretend that it is for next year or the next five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is inevitable, as we said today. Anyone with a knowledge of planning will acknowledge that this strategy sets out to limit and slow the growth of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be foolhardy and unrealistic, when producing a report like this, to pretend that the growth of Dublin can be stopped suddenly. I have heard public remarks to the effect that this document is rooted in reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>An invitation to the launch of the spatial strategy would have been nice as it is difficult for Deputies, particularly those of us on the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, to gatecrash parties. How can the Minister reconcile this strategy with our climate change strategy? I do not see within this docu<Col N="732" />ment any serious attempt to tackle climate change. Two thirds of transport funding is going on roads &ndash; there is no change there. If anything there seems to be a downgrading of the importance of rail. There is no rail link proposed to link the Border, midlands and western regions. It is business as usual for the Minister's transport plan. There is no proposal to provide a rail link through the west from Derry through Galway and Limerick to Cork. If the Minister is seriously concerned about improving the BMW region he should consider a rail route there. The Minister is simply compounding the existing problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentions climate change in the document, on page 59, but he talks about minimising increases in carbon dioxide emissions. That does not comply with protocol. The Minister is storing up problems for the future by using a roads-based strategy to link these regions. I am disappointed with the strategy. It is a genuine attempt to move forward but it is a roads-based strategy which is unsuitable for the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Deputy's opening remarks he confirmed every reason we need a spatial strategy. The point is that this is a framework. Given that we have a spatial strategy in place, all Departments, semi-State bodies, public sector organisations and local authorities and all involved in the planning process will have to take account of it. The problem used to be that decisions were made by Departments or by companies in isolation because there was no framework. People asked where we were going and the result was massive over-development in Dublin. This is not a transport policy on behalf of anyone. For Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann, private sector bus companies or whoever is involved in the delivery of transport, it sets out with absolute clarity a method of ensuring sustainable development. Transport may be by bus or by train but now it must be based on the developments in the framework set down in the spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>The Deputies must bear in mind that this is a framework for 20 years. It is for a generation. It is not for next week or next year or even ten years' time. From now on policies will be based on it. In the future it will directly form part of the review of the national development plan to ensure that the NDP is in keeping with what the spatial strategy sets out.</P>
      <P>As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have direct responsibility for climate change. The policies of which the Deputies and I spoke earlier do not go away because there is a spatial strategy. Instead, the strategy is a drive for sustainable development. It is about stopping the overgrowth of Dublin and ensuring that communities and quality of life issues are at the heart of things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the strategy. I support its emphasis on balanced regional development, given that I represent an area that has known only imbalance due <Col N="733" />to the concentration of resources in the south and east over many decades. The proposed hub towns include Cavan and Monaghan in my own constituency. I heard the Taoiseach stating this morning that the strategy was not an investment plan in itself. However, I must ask the Minister what investments and improvements can be expected by those in hub and gateway towns? We want to be able to spell out for people that this is not just aspiration, but something that can really be delivered.</P>
      <P>Cavan and Monaghan, located on the N3 and the N2, have both been awaiting bypasses for a long time. After the announcement of the Estimates we were fearful that projects that had been proposed had now been set further back. Will the publication of the national spatial strategy address the importance of fast-tracking developments that have already been discussed for towns with gateway and hub status? Can Cavan and Monaghan look forward to the realisation of the proposals to bypass both towns in order to facilitate not only the indigenous community, but also the considerable North-South traffic that passes through both? Will it arrest the loss of critical services?</P>
      <P>I heard one of my colleagues speak this morning of a hub town without a hospital and he was right. We have been facing in recent years the loss of essential services &ndash; hospital services at Monaghan General Hospital, swimming facilities &ndash; there is now no municipal swimming pool in the whole of County Monaghan. Is it not the case that this strategy will prove unworkable if the Government proceeds with the cuts outlined in last week's Book of Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy will prove unworkable if everybody does not adopt it, from the lowest democratic forum in the country right up to the Dáil itself. We must remind ourselves of where we are. Sometimes in the middle of the debate I think I am in a different country. The country that existed ten years ago is completely different to the one we live in today. We have all been part of that transformation, which happened in a short space of time. There has been significant involvement and investment, which has benefited the entire country and every region. However, the Border, midlands and western region, of which all Deputies in this House are constantly speaking, has not had the same benefits or level of investment as other areas. If we want to maintain the impetus for economic development for the future, we need a framework &ndash; a spatial framework, as other countries have. Ireland is one of the first to do this in Europe &ndash; there are only two or three countries ahead of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about this recently in Northern Ireland, sharing a platform with the then Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Peter Robinson, who was extremely positive about the benefits of a co-ordinated approach to many aspects of the Northern Ireland strategy and our own. That is why areas such as Dundalk, Cavan-Monaghan and <Col N="734" />Letterkenny, which is linked with Derry, have developed positively using the critical mass available to us in different parts of the island. The Deputy is right to say that infrastructure and major investment must follow if the framework is to be implemented, but we are talking about a 20 year framework. We have had a significant transformation in the public finances in the last five or six years, almost doubling the level of investment in the country. That is a good thing and everybody benefits. Now we must focus on creating real jobs and living space in areas other than Dublin, so that people who come from those places or want to live there will have certainty.</P>
    <P>Equally, for foreign direct investment or indigenous investment, there can now be certainty. Speaking to a number of companies in America 12 months ago, I was amazed at the questions about planning, roads and waste management for these areas, the latter of which has come to the top of the agenda, as Deputy Cuffe knows, for companies coming into the country. All arms of the State &ndash; the public sector, the private sector and the semi-State sector &ndash; will get involved in investment in these areas because they will see that the State will provide the levers. If we are serious we must create the gateways from which goods and services will emanate for the home market and for export. The plan sets out how we do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the spatial strategy links Tralee and Killarney in County Kerry, Ballina and Castlebar in County Mayo and Tullamore, Mullingar and Athlone in the midlands, ought the Minister not link Dundalk with Drogheda, particularly as the distance between them is shorter than the distances between the other towns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the reality is that Drogheda has grown enormously, has been very successful and will continue to be so. The emphasis was on moving away from Dublin's sphere of influence. We want to offer to the people a vision of where Ireland will be in 20 years. The Deputy says, as many other Deputies have said in debates over the years, that there is a lack of balanced regional development. The Government accepts that. All the expertise consulted on this issue said the same thing. Now we have produced a spatial strategy and while it is possible to be subjective at a micro level, the reality is that Drogheda is hugely successful and will continue to be so. The spatial strategy does not inhibit continuing development in any place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a bone of contention for some time. There are many areas with a dis<Col N="735" />persed population where people are involved in agriculture or have gone there because of a business. We want people to continue living in sparsely populated areas and many choose to do so. I am not implacably opposed to one-off housing. The problem lies with one-off housing around urban areas. The villages and smaller towns offer the opportunity to maximise the facilities that are put in place. I will not stand up and suggest that people are not entitled to live on their own land in different parts of the country. It is a good thing, I support it in the spatial strategy and people will welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the paragraph on page 106 of the strategy several times and it gets more complicated every time. I suspect it is a fudge. On page 122 there is no specific commitment to legislation or the amendment of existing development plans. Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation or does he hope that regional and local authorities will take on board the implications of this plan in the way they took on board the strategic planning guidelines? The guidelines were not fully taken on board in Kildare or Meath. I am worried that will happen in this instance.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act took on board many powers in advance of publication of the spatial strategy. Those powers were not exercised because we did not yet have a strategy. There are requirements to ensure the strategy is continually driven forward. In my view legislation will be needed but I am teasing out the issues with my officials. I have no problem with introducing legislation to ensure we deliver on the spatial strategy.</P>

There is no question that they will seriously inhibit the potential of the strategy to deliver in real terms, both for the hubs and the designated gateway towns.</P>
      <P>Will a real programme of decentralisation follow publication of the strategy? The Minister for Finance has promised decentralisation for many years. It was supposed to be delivered by the end of 1999 but we still have not seen it. It could address the congestion in Dublin and the need for other regional centres to develop. Decentralisation is the key to this.</P>

      <P>The Government will spend &euro;30 billion in the coming year, an increase on last year. We are currently at a plateau in comparison with previous years and we will maintain that level. The macroeconomic situation has slowed some of the projects but we have to balance fiscal management and going forward. This plan has a 20 to 25 year timescale for the framework of the entire country. It will take three national development plans, one after the other, before we <Col N="736" />really see the vision come to life. We should not expect the strategy to change the world in two or three years. I am confident, however, that in ten or 20 years, we will look back on this and say that it worked. There is no reason it should not work. We must not forget the volume of investment that will be made, even in the present difficult financial situation. All projects to which the Government is committed will be delivered under the national development plan. The Government is committed to decentralisation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the announcement today of the loss of 185 jobs in Comerama in north Kilkenny. This factory, which was named Comer International in 1969, started operations as a result of the demise of the coal mining industry in the area and it was a significant boost to employment and the economic development of north Kilkenny. Comer International, a company of some size and importance, was able to employ, train and upskill people who had been involved in another industry.</P>
      <P>The textile plant at Comerama has been involved in the manufacture of woollen yarn and lycra for export to the fashion trade. Fashion is a cyclical industry and the textile industry worldwide has been subject to upturns and downturns in recent years. There was never an occasion, however, in the lifetime of this plant that unions, management and the company did not come together to resolve their differences.</P>
      <P>Recently, the level of activity in the woollen trade began to cause difficulties as cotton became the fashion of the day. This made management and workers concerned for the future viability of the plant. Co-operation between workers and management bailed them out of short-term difficulties in the past and they approached this difficulty in the same spirit. That co-operation was evident when public representatives, management and unions met recently to come up with ideas to persuade the Minister and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come up with a viability plan for the factory. Such a plan is vital because it is rare that a plant of such significance can be found in a small town. The national spatial strategy calls for inward and mobile investment in the gateways, hubs and larger urban areas. An employer of the size of Comerama in an area like Castlecomer, however, is not easily come by. That is why every effort must be made to keep the business alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was informed that a small financial injection would give an opportunity to see if the export of yarn would increase. Unfortunately, this idea was not accepted by the Minister or the State agency. That is regrettable. It is also a mat<Col N="737" />ter of regret that the Minister did not, as originally envisaged, see fit to meet representatives of the management, the unions, the workers and public representatives last Tuesday evening to point out the difficulties she had and to give an opportunity to members of the local community to explain their co-ordinated approach and how they intend to retain the plan and develop it in the future. The business was not given a chance to survive in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Following the very sad announcement today by the management in Castlecomer, I call on the Minister to immediately establish a task force with the same haste she would apply in other parts of the country. She should recognise the importance of this facility to the town of Castlecomer and the surrounding area. I refer here to the involvement of management and workers in the plant over the years and the enormous impact it has had on the community in Castlecomer and the surrounding parishes. Support should be provided, through the statutory bodies and the local authorities, in order to facilitate the provision of a replacement industry as quickly as possible at this very modern plant.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about the national spatial strategy in recent days. The first test of the strategy will be to bring businesses out from the centre of commercial and business activity to the regions and, in particular, to places like Castlecomer, where there is a modern building and a good workforce available. I am sure members of that workforce will have no difficulty in acquiring new skills, if necessary. Many people have spent their lifetimes working in this plant. I do not say this in a party political way, but every effort must be made to bring together the various interests and ensure that a replacement industry is found in order to give hope and a morale boost to the workers in the lead-up to a very bleak Christmas.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. This is the third time Comerama has been raised on the Adjournment of the House. The company was also discussed on 26 June and 15 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comerama has two plants in Ireland, one in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, as outlined by the Deputy, and one in Bunbeg, County Donegal. Approximately 180 employees work in each plant. The industrial development agencies, particularly Enterprise Ireland in regard to the Kilkenny plant and Údarás na Gaeltachta in regard to the Donegal plant, have been trying to assist the companies with their current difficulties for some time. Last Friday, the Tánaiste met the managing director of Comerama. He indicated that a review of operations was under way. Both production lines in Castlecomer were closed at that stage. It was high stock levels and a slowdown in drawing down from customers that forced the company to place staff on short time <Col N="738" />initially. Unfortunately, further action had now become necessary due to continued difficult retail conditions.</P>
    <P>Comer International spins yarn that is then sold on to weavers who weave the yarn into cloth. The cloth-fabric is then made up into clothing for male and female underwear, suits, trousers and shirts. However, cotton is now much more popular than wool and cotton has enjoyed considerable success over the past few years. Cotton is approximately one fifth the price of wool and the trend is still to cotton and away from wool. Eight years ago there was a surplus of wool and the price of wool was suppressed. This has now changed and wool prices have risen substantially. Wool spinners have not been able to pass this on to clothing manufacturers. Retail sales have been poor worldwide, which has reduced the demand for cloth.</P>
    <P>Significant investment has been made in the company by Enterprise Ireland, most recently in April 2002, when training assistance was provided. Enterprise Ireland has provided total funding of more than &euro;3.5 million. A number of meetings took place between senior executives of Enterprise Ireland and the company. It was Enterprise Ireland's clear understanding that the company required a significant increase in working capital. However, this could not come from Enterprise Ireland as it was not legally in a position to provide funding of this nature.</P>
    <P>I understand that the reason for the closure of the Castlecomer plant is primarily a market issue and this is further compounded by the fact that there are also competitiveness issues. This was explained to the workforce in Castlecomer this afternoon. The company announced that the Castlecomer plant will close with immediate effect and notice was given to all staff today. I understand negotiations with the unions on redundancy will begin on Monday.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for coming to the House to debate the case of a 12 year old boy which was heard yesterday in the High Court. This boy has been in care since the age of five. He suffers from ADHD and has been described as very damaged. The boy had been in the Ballydowd special care unit since September 2001. Yesterday, the health board with responsibility for his care, the Northern Area Health Board, and the manager of Ballydowd sought to move him from this special care unit to a remand centre because they were unable to meet his needs. They propose that he should be sent to Oberstown boys centre for young offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 12 year old is to be placed in a unit with seven other boys whose average age is almost 15 <Col N="739" />years, all of whom have criminal convictions and a history of repeat offending. In other words, the health board and the management of the centre are attempting to criminalise the boy, which flies in the face of the principles and spirit of the Children Act. It is beyond belief that a State agency, charged with responsibility for providing therapeutic care for troubled children, has effectively refused to do its job. It has washed its hands of its responsibility to this child and has sought to place this vulnerable child in a care setting which in all probability will damage him further.</P>
    <P>This shameful and sorry episode is further evidence that the health authorities have shown themselves to be utterly incompetent. As a member of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health Board, it gives me no pleasure to say this. I have listened to too many plans, too many promises and too many undertakings given to the courts, most of which were not met, to now have any confidence in the health board to provide health care. The Minister must take responsibility for much of the problem. The care of the most vulnerable children, those displaying serious behavioural problems, has always been the poor relation of Government policy and investment. For various reasons we are now seeing an increasing number of disturbed children who require high support therapeutic care. Many of these children are dysfunctional. However, the real scandal is that the care system, which is supposed to cater for them, is seriously dysfunctional.</P>
    <P>Following the 1994 FN case and the 1998 High Court order directing the State authorities to provide appropriate therapeutic care facilities for troubled children, the Ballydowd unit was built. It is a state-of-the-art unit and cost taxpayers almost &euro;10 million. The unit is supposed to accommodate 24 children, but there have never been more than eight children present. There are currently only five children there, while many other children must wait for services. After just two years in operation, this unit has utterly failed to provide the service for which it was intended. There is no clear policy on the approach to meeting the needs of these children. There is no consistency in the ethos or staffing and there is a reprehensible shortage of professional therapeutic services. Physical shortcomings and limitations in the unit abound. The forensic psychologist involved in yesterday's case, who had seen the boy on several occasions over many months, advised strongly against the move to Oberstown and claimed that the care system had failed the boy and that another move could be interpreted by the boy as another rejection.</P>
    <P>This is a tragic situation for this boy and indeed for many other children who depend on the Minister of State. Sadly, an increasing number of children, both boys and girls, are in need of care provided by the State, the responsibility for which clearly lies with the Minister of State. Too often, they are <Col N="740" />met with rejection, dysfunction, incompetence and disinterest by the State. It is now up to the Minister of State to take responsibility for the shameful situation and to provide appropriate care for the most vulnerable children, for whom he is legally and morally responsible.</P>

The young person concerned is in the care of the Northern Area Health Board, of which the Deputy is a member, and has been placed in the Ballydowd special care unit, which is the operational responsibility of the South-Western Area Health Board. As the Deputy indicated in presenting the matter, the child has been there for the last 14 months.</P>
      <P>Given the particularly challenging behaviour of the young person recently the health boards concerned considered that placement for a short time in another secure setting was appropriate.</P>

      <P>Prior to my becoming aware that the Deputy had raised this matter, I requested from the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority a report on the case as a matter of urgency. The Ballydowd special care unit is undergoing refurbishment <Col N="741" />work and capacity is currently temporarily reduced to six. With the phased completion of the refurbishment work and following the positive recruitment campaign, a second six bed unit is due to come on stream in December and the special care unit is due to be fully operational by February next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the 18 beds on site it is anticipated that the Ballydowd service will incorporate a six bed step down unit. Since mid-1997 more than &euro;170 million has been invested in the development of our child care services including new child and family support services such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects to allow health boards to provide a range of appropriate interventions which will place specialised residential care in an appropriate context. These include the youth advocacy pilot programmes which have been established this year in the Northern Area Health Board and in the Western Health Board, which aim to provide community based alternatives for high risk young people with challenging behaviour and to serve as an alternative to residential care.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, high support and special care facilities with over 120 places including individual high support packages are in place and about 57 of these places are currently filled. This compares with 17 such places in 1997. The 12 place Rath na nÓg high support unit in Castleblaney and the 24 place Crannóg Nua high support unit in Portrane, which have recently opened and are being brought on stream on a phased basis, are included in the overall figure.</P>

This aims to ensure that people are attracted into child care and to ensure that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level. I share the concerns the Deputy has expressed about the circumstances of this case and I have sought a full report on it from the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. There have been confusing reports in the media with regard to an incident in Mountjoy Prison on Monday last. It was reported by the governor that some 100 prisoners on B wing dumped the contents of their toilet buckets over the landing, that it was a peaceful protest and that the reason for it was the introduction of new identification measures designed to keep drugs out of the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" />There is currently a protest outside Mountjoy Prison where relatives are protesting at the forms of identification required. I have been informed that the identification required is similar to that required by Ryanair, a passport or driver's licence. Alternative forms, even with a photograph, such as a bus pass or a domestic bill are not accepted. If that is the case, only very limited forms of identification are acceptable. That is certainly the message which has got out.</P>
    <P>Many of those with relatives in prison are not the type who fly abroad or own cars. They live in the inner city, are of poor circumstances and generally live in ghettoised areas. Many would not have the type of identification required. That is why there is a picket at the prison.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody disagrees with the introduction of measures to prevent drugs entering the prison. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has always denied that there were any drugs in Mountjoy when it is known that Mountjoy is the biggest drugs centre in Ireland. Measures are at last being taken to try to prevent drugs entering but the Department should avoid a state of denial. If it remains in denial, it will be more difficult to implement a satisfactory range of measures to keep drugs out.</P>
    <P>The protest also raises the issue of slopping out. Some 100 prisoners on one landing are slopping out each morning when we were told that great things were being done to introduce toilets in cells. Nothing has happened in Mountjoy and the prisoners are still held in Dickensian circumstances. The Minister of State must address that macro-issue as well as that of the Department's state of denial.</P>
    <P>I want to know what happened and why. What forms of identification are required? Why was something like this not introduced if the problem was known about? Is it now acknowledged that the situation had got out of hand? Considering the proposed closure of Shanganagh Prison, will the Minister of State say where there is a safe place for young people who are not drug addicts to spend their sentence without being plied with drugs? Shanganagh was the only open juvenile centre for rehabilitative purposes and one that had a great track record with regard to re-integration. This has been deliberately run down by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of numbers, with the result that only 20% of capacity is being used despite having 100% of staff. Its closure is now being justified when it should be used to its maximum potential rather than the closed prison in St. Patrick's. The Minister of State might reply to those issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues. The Irish Prisons Service is resolutely committed to tackling drug abuse in prisons in a comprehensive manner and has the full support of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this. On this issue, the Deputy can be assured that the Prisons Service will continue to seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the <Col N="743" />prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders.</P>
      <P>As part of the national drugs strategy's battle against the scourge of drugs, an action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system was approved in 1999. This advocated a broad-based approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. The 1999 action plan, which built on an agreed policy between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the then Eastern Health Board, advocated the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug-free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. It is my intention to continue with the implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>The national steering group, which was established in 1999 to implement the action plan, continues to pursue a multidisciplinary approach to the drugs problem with substantial input from the health sector, particularly the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There has been considerable progress in regard to the work of the steering group and a number of initiatives have been completed. A drug service co-ordinator from the Eastern Regional Health Authority is now in place. A deputy governor now has the position of training officer for drug treatment work by prison grades. He has been in position since October 2001 delivering training programmes designed to enhance and further professionalise prison officers involved in interpersonal work with prisoners undergoing drug treatment.</P>
      <P>There is now extensive access to methadone maintenance for prisoners in the Dublin area, which is a complete transformation from the situation which existed up to 2000. Designated drug-free wings opened in St. Patrick's Institution in November 2000 and in Wheatfield Prison in April 2002 and more are due to open at other prisons in the coming months. The training unit at Mountjoy has been drug-free since 1996.</P>
      <P>Seventy qualified nurses are in place to administer methadone programmes in the prisons and monitor breaches of the programmes, along with carrying out their general duties. A further eight nurses are due to finish training on 6 December 2002, and will take up duty in the prisons shortly afterwards. Additional probation and welfare officers have also been authorised to work in this area. A number of other appointments are planned by the health boards in the eastern region for positions, both full-time and part-time, in prisons in the Dublin area. These include consultant psychiatrists and addiction counsellors. There are extensive links between Cork Prison and the local drugs task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 2001, at the request of the director general, a special linkages group &ndash; the prison and community drugs liaison group &ndash; was established between the governors of the main Dublin prisons and voluntary sector services which work with drug dependent people in the community. Over 400 offenders have completed Mountjoy Prison's drug treatment programme which com<Col N="744" />menced in 1996. The national steering group has recently established a multidisciplinary working group, composed of the in-house services and a member of the addiction studies department, Trinity College, to review the current drug treatment programme in the Mountjoy complex.</P>
    <P>The Irish Prisons Service is committed to evaluating the effectiveness of all prison programmes, including those aimed at the reduction of drug misuse and, under the national drugs strategy 2001-2008, it has undertaken to commission and carry out an independent evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the prison strategy by mid-2004. Furthermore, a number of other measures have been implemented in recent years in an attempt to curtail smuggling and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These measures include video surveillance, improved visiting-searching facilities and increased vigilance by staff. The introduction of screened visits in Cloverhill and Midlands Prisons accompanied by the erection of nets over the yards of Cork Prison and St. Patrick's Institution has further strengthened this policy.</P>
    <P>In addition to these security arrangements, new visiting procedures are being implemented in Mountjoy Prison and it is these procedures which appear to have sparked the incident referred to by the Deputy. The evidence for this is the fact that a petition objecting to the new procedures had recently been submitted to the governor by a number of the prisoners involved in the protest. I reiterate, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that these procedures are being introduced as part of the ongoing battle against the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>On the morning of 25 November 2002, following unlock after breakfast, approximately 110 offenders on the B wing of Mountjoy Prison, apparently acting in unison, proceeded to throw the contents of their bins and empty their chamber pots onto the landing of the prison. No prisoner or prison officer received injuries during this protest. However, a number of officers received splashes from the chamber pot contents. The prisoners, who offered no resistance, were immediately placed back in their cells. These prisoners, with the exception of the short time required to escort small groups to receive their meals, remained locked in their cells for the whole day. Those with a significant involvement in the disturbance were disciplined by the governor in accordance with the rules for government of prisons. It is important to note that the other areas of the prison operated normally during the disturbance and were unaffected by the incident. It is also significant that the entire prison was unlocked, without incident, the next morning and, in the meantime, has experienced no further protests.</P>
    <P>The new visiting procedures include the provision that each prisoner is now required to supply prison authorities with a list of up to six persons who they wish to visit them. Excluding their children and legal representatives, only those per<Col N="745" />sons on this list and have been approved by the governor, will be permitted to visit the offender. In addition, each visitor, prior to receiving entry into the prison, is now required to present photo identification confirming their identity. Each prisoner is also entitled to request changes to his visitor list through the governor of the prison. While these new procedures have met with some resistance, the Irish Prisons Service is committed to eliminating the smuggling of drugs into the prison system and it is likely that, rather than give into the above protest, these procedures will soon be extended to other institutions.</P>
    <P>The reasoning behind the introduction of this list system is evidence suggesting that a number of vulnerable prisoners were being pressurised into receiving visits from persons that they did not know for the sole purpose of attempting to smuggle drugs into the prison. I assure the Deputy that the six visitor rule is not inflexible. For example, in cases where a prisoner has a large family he can make a case to the governor who will, I am sure, treat the request sympathetically. Legitimate visitors will not, in the short-term, be denied access to the prison for the purpose of visits solely because of the lack of photo identification.</P>
    <P>It is also, the belief of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that it is highly appropriate from a security point of view for persons to provide identification prior to entering our prisons. People are often required to provide such identification for everyday events such as withdrawing money from a bank, claiming social welfare payments, opening an account with a video rental club or indeed, when they wish to purchase alcohol.</P>
    <P>I must again stress that it is the intention of both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Irish Prisons Service to continue to place a high priority on battling the scourge of drug misuse among prisoners and in the community. This Administration, in is programme for Government, has given a commitment to publish a plan to end heroin use in Irish prisons. In this context, a working group is currently considering the issue of drug use in a prisons context and, in accordance with the programme for Government, will shortly be submitting proposals which will form the basis of a draft plan.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for inclusion in the Adjournment debate. I have already been able to raise the serious concerns that are the subject of this matter with my local superintendent and chief superintendent from whom I received a sympathetic hearing and I was encouraged by what they had to say. However, I raise this matter in this House because Border villages in Donegal have become increasingly urban. Where once there were small villages, there are now quite <Col N="746" />substantial towns which developed because of a spill-over from the large urban centre of Derry.</P>
      <P>Although large numbers of people have moved to Muff, Killea, Carrigans, Lifford, Burnfoot and Bridgend, Garda manpower has not reflected the increase in population. Gardaí have not said they are unhappy with the stations in which they work, but I would not disagree with them if they did. The conditions at Muff are particularly bad. A new Garda station has been promised for Muff for some time. I am aware that a house has been purchased for this purpose and cannot understand the delay in opening it. It is unforgivable that gardaí on that Border crossing do not have proper accommodation. I ask the Minister to ensure the new station is opened forthwith.</P>
      <P>There has been a substantial increase in the number of burglaries in the area. In addition to the increase in the population of Border villages, there has been an increase in &ldquo;smash and grab&rdquo; raids, many of which are masterminded by individuals crossing the Border from Derry. Many busy petrol stations are located in these villages and people are either taking petrol without paying for it or threatening staff in shops. This is reflected in the recent crime figures. Larcenies from shops have increased by 53% in 2001 and larcenies from unattended vehicles have increased by 7%.</P>
      <P>The Garda station at Burnfoot is due for a substantial renovation in March 2003. I hope this will proceed on schedule and I am seeking a guarantee in respect of it because it precedes the development of Buncrana Garda station. We cannot assume that these people can work in substandard conditions. We should put decent facilities in place for our gardaí to ensure a good service in those areas.</P>
      <P>The 2001 statistical report shows that the divisional drugs unit streamlined its operations and achieved a threefold increase in the number of detentions for possession of drugs. That is an extremely important aspect of what is happening in the north-west. That is why I would like to see more co-operation between the police forces. We must try to achieve a reduction in overall crime. We are suffering substantially from raids in the districts of Strabane or Derry. I do not exclude the fact that there is crime in Donegal.</P>
      <P>Crime detection was aided by the setting up of a special crime unit to deal with high crime areas. There was a 29% increase in the number of crimes detected this year compared to the previous year. That must be commended, but it must be replicated next year. The Minister might consider the issue of crime prevention. I know it is aided by community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes. I ask for more money to be given to those schemes to ensure they can help the overall situation. I encourage the reporting of crime and I look forward to a more visible Garda presence in all our towns and villages.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this matter in relation to the progress on <Col N="747" />the opening of a new Garda station on the land frontier with Northern Ireland at Muff and the general response to the recent crime figures in the Donegal area.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already noted that the final crime figures for 2001 published this week confirm the disappointing news indicated in the earlier provisional statistics in relation to headline offences, namely, that there had been an overall increase of 18% over the figures for the year 2000. However, in Donegal the satisfactory detection rate of 41% was maintained in 2001, despite a 31% increase in headline crime. The setting up in the Donegal division during the year of special crime units to deal with high crime areas contributed to maintaining this detection rate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keaveney referred to the burglary figures for Donegal. While there was a disappointing increase nationally of 8% in 2001 in the rate of burglaries, figures for Donegal are more positive. They show that the number of burglaries in 2001 at 319 is 8% less than for the preceding year when the number stood at 346.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is correct about public disorder because if we look at other groups of offences for Donegal, there are disappointing increases, particularly in the assault category. However, the detection rates in this category are excellent with a rate of 79% compared with 75% nationally. That shows that we cannot extrapolate from the national crime figures &ndash; both the overall figures and the figures for specific groups of offences &ndash;<Col N="748" />to what the figures for particular Garda districts would or should be. We must look at the needs of particular districts and formulate a response to those needs on that basis. That is what is being done with regard to the provision of Garda resources for Donegal.</P>
    <P>As regards accommodation for gardaí at Muff, the position is that the Office Of Public Works has recently completed the legal formalities necessary to secure alternative accommodation for the station party. The board has been asked to arrange for the fitting out of the building to ensure early occupation by gardaí. While I cannot say at this point when the works will be completed, I assure the Deputy that the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible in the context of the overall Garda building programme.</P>
    <P>As regards security matters in general along the land frontier with Northern Ireland, a high level of co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland exists and within the context of the EU, arrangements will be further enhanced in the future. The reversal in the overall trend on the headline offences underlines the continued need for decisive responses to offending behaviour and the need for the criminal justice system to constantly adapt to increasing levels and evolving patterns of crime. In some instances, such as drugs offences, the increases reflect the successful results of focused operations carried out by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 3 December 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government is aware of the concerns of the Irish Government about the volume of radioactive waste stored in Britain, in particular at Sellafield. As recently as March this year, the Irish Government responded to the British Government's public consultation document of September 2001 which was entitled &ldquo;Managing Radioactive Waste Safely&rdquo;. In its response, the Government again expressed its total opposition to the spent fuel reprocessing activities at Sellafield which are responsible for increasing the volume of radioactive waste there and for which there is no final disposal route. The Government also pointed out that the unresolved problems associated with the management of radioactive waste, along with the risk of serious accidents at nuclear facilities, make nuclear power an unsustainable option for energy production.</P>
      <P>The Government is particularly concerned about both the volume and continued build up of the storage of highly active waste in liquid form in tanks at Sellafield. The storage of this waste in liquid form has the potential to lead to a major release of radioactivity as it has to be continually cooled. The British Government and the nuclear industry accept that the storage of this highly active waste in this form is not a sustainable process and British Nuclear Fuels has, for some years now, been vitrifying the waste, a process whereby it is solidified into a safer form of storage. We have been pressing the British Government for many years now to speed up the vitrification process and to cease reprocessing activities which are only adding to the volume of liquid waste. The Irish Government views as untenable the operation of the Sellafield MOX plant, and continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield when there is no final disposal route for the waste arising. We will continue to press strongly for a cessation of these activities at Sellafield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Implementation and management of the shared ownership scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for each housing authority concerned. In operating the scheme, local authorities should have regard to local circumstances in determining maximum price limits or any other conditions they believe to be appropriate. These issues are best determined by the individual local authorities. I understand Kildare County Council limits the amount of finance it will advance under the scheme to &euro;130,000, which it advises my Department is sufficient to purchase houses in the county. However, the council is prepared to exceed this limit where an applicant can demonstrate an ability to manage the corresponding increased mortgage and rent commitments <Col N="751" />involved. It is also open to purchasers to finance by way of an increased deposit from their own resources the cost of buying a house in excess of the council's limit.</P>
      <P>Government efforts in recent years to assist low income purchasers have included a number of targeted schemes such as the shared ownership scheme and the affordable housing scheme. I intend to continue to support these schemes and increased output is expected from them in 2003.</P>

Local authorities have power under section 7 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No.2) Act, 1983 to offset against moneys due by them to a person any sum which is due to the authority by that person in respect of any charges made by the authority. Having regard to the fact that authorities also have power to operate waiver provisions in respect of local charges, I do not consider that the operation by authorities of section 7 of the 1983 Act is incompatible with the terms of the Barcelona Declaration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 31 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from its national groundwater monitoring programme the EPA identified the presence of elevated levels of uranium 238 in groundwater samples taken in County Wicklow, near Baltinglass. Information in this regard was contained in a letter of 9 October 2002, copied to my Department, from the EPA to Wicklow County Council which was advised to consult with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in the matter. Advice and assistance is also being provided by the Geological Survey of Ireland and by the relevant health authorities.</P>
      <P>A standard for uranium in drinking water has not yet been established by the European Union or nationally and, accordingly, the relevant national drinking water regulations do not prescribe such a standard and monitoring for uranium is not routinely carried out. In these circumstances, the South-Western Area Health Board have advised Wicklow County Council that it would be reasonable to use as a guide the current limit of 20 micrograms per litre recommended by the United States EPA. I understand this limit is to be revised to 30 micrograms per litre in 2003. The new EU Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) provides for monitoring for radioactivity but the methods of monitoring and the list of radioactive parameters have yet to be finalised. When finalised the directive will be revised and the relevant Irish legislation will be amended accordingly.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the RPII and the South-Western Area Health Board, Wicklow County Council decided on a precautionary basis to discontinue sourcing drinking water from one of the wells serving the Baltinglass public water supply. My Department was advised of this on 13 November 2002, following subsequent consultations carried out by the council, including with the Geological Survey of Ireland. The Baltinglass supply continues in operation at reduced capacity served by other sources. The levels of uranium in the supply now in use are being monitored and are within the recommended limit of 20 micrograms per litre. Sampling and analysis of other public supplies has been undertaken by Wicklow County Council and preliminary results are that all other public supplies in the county are within the recommended limit.</P>
      <P>The EPA has been in communication with other local authorities in areas where there is a possibility of elevated levels of uranium and testing is being carried out in these areas. In addition, a circular letter was issued to all local authorities by my Department on 25 November 2002 with information on procedures for monitoring for the presence of uranium in drinking water supplies and measures to be taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 32 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The National Spatial Strategy was published earlier today and a copy has been sent to each Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The strategy represents a 20-year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to develop to its potential. It recognises that various regions have different roles and aims to organise and co-ordinate these roles in a complementary way. The strategy's objective is to allow regions to be become more competitive in terms of investment and job opportunities, while ensuring a high quality urban environment, as well as vibrant rural areas.</P>
      <P>The strategy aims to build up the strengths of different areas in order to achieve more balanced regional development and population growth. It recognises that a greater share of economic activity must take place outside the greater Dublin area. To achieve this, the strategy sets out a framework within which gateways, hubs and other urban and rural areas will act together to allow areas to grow.</P>
      <P>In completing the strategy my Department has had the benefit of an extensive public consultation process and has sought to take account of the spatial aspects of a wide range of economic, social and environmental policies in collaboration with other Departments, agencies and bodies primarily responsible for these policies. The strategy also has regard to current trends in population growth, including the preliminary results of the 2002 census, and seeks to address the issues arising from these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority now is to ensure effective implementation of the strategy. In the coming weeks I intend visiting each region to communicate the <Col N="754" />implications of the strategy for that region. Regional planning guidelines will be a key step in implementing the strategy and my Department will assist the regional authorities in drawing up such guidelines.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitments to housing and homelessness are set out in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The provision of social and affordable housing has been expanded considerably in recent years. For example, this year we will deliver the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for more than 15 years. I anticipate that total social housing output this year, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures will meet the needs of approximately 13,000 households on waiting lists which compares to just over 8,500 households in 2000. The Government will continue to maintain the highest level of housing output in 2003 and onwards to meet social housing needs within the constraints now bearing on public expenditure programmes.</P>
      <P>The issue of setting realistic targets on homelessness is particularly important to ensure that our efforts in providing resources and services yield positive results. A comprehensive data collection system is essential to set realistic targets and to monitor results. To this end the Homeless Agency is, with the support of my Department, currently piloting the LINK system with a number of service providers including those in the voluntary sector. This system tracks each person presenting as homeless to any of these service providers and this will allow a profile of people using services for homeless people to be built up. It is intended that the system will be extended to all homeless services in the Dublin area. Similar improvements to data collection and analysis on homelessness are being considered in other local authority areas where there are a significant number of homeless persons. The issue of improved data collection will also be addressed as part of the development of an integrated IT package for housing for all local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cross-department team on homelessness is examining how best to evaluate strategies on homelessness and the local action plans and I <Col N="755" />intend that the issue of targets will also be addressed in the context of this evaluation.</P>

      <P>Where it is determined that a party is not in compliance with its emissions target under the Kyoto Protocol at the implementation of the commitment period 2008-2012, the following consequences will apply: a deduction of 1.3 times the amount of the excess emissions from the party's assigned amounts for the next commitment period, that is the period commencing in 2013. In essence, a party will have to make up any shortfall in meeting its Kyoto target, plus 30%, in the second commitment period: the suspension of eligibility to sell credits under emissions trading arrangements: a compliance action plan must be developed by the party, for international review and assessment, to ensure compliance within three years. Progress reports on implementation of the plan must be submitted annually.</P>
      <P>Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit emissions of greenhouse gases to 13% above 1990 levels by the first commitment period 2008-2012.

Measures already under way in the first year are capable of yielding reductions up to 3.3 million tonne Mt CO2 equivalent of the 15.4 Mt CO2 equivalent annually set out in the strategy.</P>
      <P>We must now make significant reductions in emissions to meet our Kyoto target, and I have initiated a review of the implementation of the strategy to ensure that sufficient measures are in place for this. The review is being undertaken in consultation with Comhar the national sustainable development partnership and I hope to have it finalised by next spring.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that we are in compliance with the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>Security arrangements at British nuclear power plants, including Sellafield, are a matter for the British authorities. However, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) has been in regular contact with the UK's nuclear installations inspectorate (NII) with a view to obtaining as much information as possible in regard to security measures at such facilities.</P>
      <P>Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, the Irish Embassy in London contacted the relevant Departments to ascertain what security measures are in place at nuclear installations. The embassy was informed by the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) that it is not UK Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken at civil nuclear sites. However, DTI indicated that the UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures which are regulated by the DTI Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS). The OCNS also works closely with the NII of the UK health and safety executive which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes at nuclear installations. Furthermore, DTI indicated that security and safety precautions at nuclear installations are kept under regular review and that the regulators were reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of 11 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been further meetings between relevant Irish and UK authorities, and between RPII and BNFL, with a view to assisting further more detailed evaluation by the Irish authorities of the safety of Sellafield installations from attack by terrorists. A recent OCNS report for the DTI <Col N="759" />on the state of security in the civil nuclear industry and the effectiveness of security regulation concludes, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;stringent security precautions are being taken to protect civil nuclear sites and material in the United Kingdom, commensurate with current threats to national security&rdquo; and that &ldquo;satisfactory arrangements have also been made with the Ministry of Defence to protect civil nuclear sites from attacks from the air&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, the RPII has advised my Department that, because of UK security restrictions, neither the briefings provided, nor the OCNS report, provide sufficient technical detail to enable the RPII fully to evaluate these conclusions.</P>
    <P>A more recent meeting took place in July 2002 and was attended by the RPII, my Department, the Office of Emergency Planning and the Irish Embassy. Unfortunately, while the UK provided more information on the methodology of their nuclear security measures, the information was of a general nature and lacked specificity. Ireland's concern to have more details regarding the safety and security arrangements at Sellafield and the consequences of a terrorist attack on the facility was again emphasised to the UK.</P>
    <P>The RPII met the NII on 8 November last to discuss an arrangement for the exchange of safety related information concerning the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear installations in relation to which the NII has responsibility. During the course of this meeting, the NII indicated that for security reasons, it was not at liberty to give any further information on the Sellafield plant than had already been given.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. This plan is designed to respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK, or elsewhere, which would result in a major release of radioactivity into the environment and pose a radiological hazard in Ireland whether the disaster is caused by an accident or a terrorist attack. All the information gained by the RPII in regard to safety and security measures at British civil nuclear power plants provides constant input to our emergency planning and management response programme.</P>
    <P>An information booklet, entitled National Planning for Nuclear Emergencies, was published by my Department in March 2002, and sets out the principal features of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. An information leaflet summarising the main elements of the booklet has been distributed to every household.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen) Martin Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national hazardous waste management plan (NHWMP) relates to the period 2001-2006. It makes recommendations in respect of four main areas: implementation of a national hazardous waste prevention programme; improved measures for the collection of hazardous wastes from households, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and other sources of &ldquo;unreported&rdquo; hazardous wastes; provision of requisite infrastructure to attain national self-sufficiency in relation to the recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes; and identification, risk assessment and, where necessary, remediation of sites where hazardous wastes were disposed of in the past.</P>
      <P>Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to, recommendations in the plan. The plan recommended the establishment of an implementation committee to co-ordinate its overall implementation.</P>
      <P>In my Department's policy statement Preventing and Recycling Waste &ndash; Delivering Change, which was published earlier this year, a range of organisational and policy initiatives in support of more effective waste management was outlined. These will include the establishment of a core prevention team within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement a major national waste prevention programme, that will encompass both hazardous and non-hazardous waste and focus on both the elimination of waste from manufacturing and securing improvements in the environmental performance of products.</P>
      <P>I intend also to establish a committee to oversee the implementation of the non-prevention aspects of the NHWMP, and I will shortly invite a range of business, agricultural and environmental organisations, as well as relevant Departments and State agencies, to nominate representatives to participate on this committee.</P>
      <P>Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to infrastructure, the plan identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on export outlets. A private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy, County Cork. As an exceptional measure, having regard to the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, grant assistance is available under the NDP to support the provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes, and there are indications of interest from the private sector in the development of such capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" />The NHWMP outlined a methodology for the identification and risk assessment of closed waste disposal sites. This methodology has since been developed further by the EPA and applied as a pilot project in County Laois. Following the recent completion of this project, the EPA is expected, during 2003, to develop and publish more detailed guidance for local authorities in this matter.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme of grants to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs and has in recent years introduced significant improvements to the grant levels under the scheme. The basic maximum grant was increased in 1999 from &euro;3,047, £2,400 to &euro;3,810 and from &euro;4,571, £3,600 to &euro;5,720 for houses on specified offshore islands. The grants may meet two-thirds of the approved cost of thatching works, subject to the maximum limits.</P>
      <P>The Department also introduced a new measure to assist lower income households, for which the cost of maintaining a thatched roof imposed a particular burden. Householders with medical cards are eligible for thatching grants up to a maximum of &euro;6,350 or &euro;8,260 in the case of the specified offshore islands. In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works, again subject to the maximum grant limits.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals to increase the rate of thatching grants at this stage, my Department keeps the terms of the scheme under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question refers to the discharge of technetium-99 from Sellafield in September 2002. This matter was raised by my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland at a meeting at the end of September 2002 with UK counterparts. <Col N="762" />According to the UK authorities, discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield this year are within the annual authorised discharge limit set down by the UK environment agency. I understand the resumption of the technetium-99 discharges in September arose from a resumption of the treatment of liquid waste, which typically takes place on a batch basis two or three times a year. I also understand that the batch treatment prior to September took place in October 2001 and that a discharge of technetium-99 took place in February 2002.</P>
      <P>Ireland's concerns about radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea, including discharges of technetium-99, have been conveyed on numerous occasions to the UK Government. These concerns, particularly those in regard to technetium-99 discharges, are shared by a number of Nordic countries, notably Norway. In the statement issued by the OSPAR Ministers in 1998 when the OSPAR Strategy on Radioactive Substances was adopted, the UK ministers indicated that the concerns expressed by a number of the OSPAR states about technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield would be addressed by the UK Ministers in their then forthcoming decisions concerning discharge authorisations.</P>
      <P>In September 2001, the UK environment agency submitted to the relevant UK Ministers for consideration its proposed decision in regard to a review of the discharge authorisation limit for technetium-99. In this connection, the agency proposed a retention of the existing discharge authorisation limit of 90 terrabecquerels per annum and that this would be reduced to ten terrabequerels per annum by around 2006. The Irish Government's concerns about the agency's proposals were conveyed to the relevant UK ministers. A decision by the UK Ministers on the agency's proposals is still awaited.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's view, the proposed decision by the UK environment agency is not in keeping with the OSPAR strategy which requires a progressive and substantial reduction in discharges. While the UK Government has stressed that it is committed to implementing the OSPAR strategy, we are concerned that the UK Strategy on Radioactive Discharges, published in July 2002, on how it will implement the strategy, shows a projected increase in discharges in the short-term. Ireland will be actively involved in the OSPAR process to ensure that the OSPAR strategy is fully implemented by all contracting parties.</P>

      <P>The complementary roles of central and local government have evolved over many years and through various institutional, policy and legislative changes. In addition, the role of elected local government was formally inscribed in the Constitution in 1999.</P>
      <P>The existence of different layers of government and administration supports the operation of subsidiarity, which is recognised internationally as a principle of good governance. However, this principle does not require an unnecessarily rigid separation or demarcation between central and local government. In practice, flexible relationships and interactions between central and local government, and between them and other public sector agencies, are a normal feature of public administration in Ireland and other developed countries. I envisage that this approach will be continued.</P>

      <P>I have recently appointed a senior official from my Department to fill a vacancy in the membership of the Heritage Council, which I expect will continue to discharge its statutory duties actively and effectively. The National Heritage Plan, published in April 2002, provided for a review of the Heritage Act 1995. This is now being pursued, in association with a wider review of Dúchas which transferred to my Department in July 2002.</P>

      <P>The termination of the new house grant scheme, which was announced on 14 November 2002, arose from the necessity, in the context of the 2003 Estimates, for the Government to ensure a sustainable match between expenditure and resources, and to concentrate housing programmes on areas of greatest impact and social need. The Government remains committed to continuing with measures initiated in our previous term to increase the supply of housing and bring moderation to the rate of house price increases, including increasing investment in the provision of serviced land for housing and more effective use of that land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities. These measures have been effective in increasing output to record levels and affording greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers. Total new housing output in 2001 was more than 52,600 units, an increase of 5.6% on 2000 and the seventh consecutive year of record housing output. Prospects for housing output in 2002 are again good, with output up 5.2% in the first six months of the year compared to the same period last year.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 47 of 10 October 2002. My Department has since ascertained in discussions with the Small Firms Association that the latter's estimates for the increase in the cost of building houses may be based on the national house building cost index, published in my Department's housing statistics bulletin based on material supplied by Dublin City Council. However, the same general reservations as indicated in reply to Question No. 47 would apply to the ability of this index fully to reflect market conditions. As already stated, the rate of house price increase in recent years, resulting from strong economic and demographic growth, has been of serious concern to the Government and has led to a range of <Col N="765" />responses which have had a positive effect in increasing housing output and moderating house price increases. Average year-on-year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to much more moderate levels currently. Last year was the seventh successive year of record housing output with a total of 52,602 units completed.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1 January 1988, the normal method of financing capital projects in local authorities involved a system of loan and subsidy financing in the context of the local loans fund. The changeover to direct capital grants from this Department eliminated this system of payments and provided a simpler funding mechanism for Exchequer financed capital projects with effect from this date.</P>
      <P>As part of these changes, local loans fund loans entered into by local authorities before 1 January 1998 were written off. A relatively small number of subsidisable non-Exchequer loans remained extant, and it is the subsidy payments in respect of these loans which are defrayed from Subhead G.3 of my Department's vote. As no further subsidisable loans were approved subsequent to 31 December 1997, the requirement for subsidy payments has been declining steadily as the remaining loans are paid off.</P>

      <P>To date a single case of Phocine Distemper Virus has been confirmed for a seal found in Irish waters. The animal in question was found off the Aran Islands, County Galway. A number of other seals have been forwarded to the Veterinary College of University College, Dublin for laboratory examination. To date none of the other specimens examined has been confirmed as having PDV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have arranged that Dúchas the Heritage Service of my Department continue monitoring incidences of sick or dead seals found on the Irish coastline. I would advise that young seals are often washed up at this time of year because of heavy seas resulting from stormy weather and <Col N="766" />that individual seal deaths are not necessarily related to incidences of PDV.</P>
    <P>Officials in Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, have communicated with scientific colleagues in Ireland and abroad and with the local authorities. Dúchas officials also met representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary on 9 August and more recently on 11 November to discuss arrangements to deal with any possible outbreak of PDV in Irish seal populations.</P>
    <P>I have previously acknowledged the excellent work done by the Irish Seal Sanctuary over the years in rehabilitating small numbers of seals and my officials continue to meet the members of the Irish Seal Sanctuary. However, given the limited resources available to my Department for wildlife conservation and protection, grant assistance in this area must realistically be targeted at projects which will maximise conservation prospects. I would advise that experience in the UK indicates that few if any seals sent for rehabilitation from PDV have survived. Given the abundant population of seals in Irish waters and the fact that to date seal species in Irish waters have not been endangered in conservation terms by PDV, I do not consider that funding of the Irish Seal Sanctuary facility by my Department can be justified in relation to the circumstances now obtaining.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the National Economic and Social Forum rather than the National Economic and Social Council, recommended, some time ago, the establishment of a national housing authority.</P>
      <P>The Government's efforts in support of housing have prioritised the adaptation and strengthening of institutions and structures, increasing the funding of housing programmes and the redesign of incentives and supports, so as to secure the required levels of housing output across all tenures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to strengthening of structures, we have developed a range of administrative <Col N="767" />arrangements and initiatives, including, the creation of Cabinet Committees on Housing, Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships, and on Social Inclusion, each chaired by the Taoiseach, the setting up of the Housing Forum in agreement with the Social Partners as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board on an ad-hoc basis pending the necessary legislation arising from the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector, new organisational structures within my Department with enhanced focus on housing supply, voluntary housing, affordable housing and social inclusion and an enhanced role for the housing unit, particularly in the area of research.</P>
    <P>Our approach has delivered high levels of overall housing output and continued the major expansion of both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes. Total housing output last year, at more than 52,000 units, was the highest output ever achieved in a single year. Based on the indications available, we are likely to achieve record output once again this year. In addition, I expect local authority output for 2002 to be the highest level of completions for more than 15 years.</P>
    <P>The issue of a national housing authority was discussed at the recent meeting of the housing forum. Considerable reservations were expressed by the forum about the concept of an executive national housing authority. The consensus, which I would also broadly support, was that progress in this area would be better achieved by improving capacity for housing research, dissemination of best housing management practice etc. in local authorities, support for the voluntary housing sector and synergies between existing housing agencies.</P>

      <P>Regional and local waste management plans provide for the introduction in urban areas of source segregation and separate collection of household waste. Currently, more than 200,000 homes in the Dublin area receive a separate collection service for dry recyclable materials, and the objective is to cover 80% of homes in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar schemes are in place in Galway, Limerick and Waterford and parts of Kerry, Kildare, Louth, Longford, Meath and Tipperary. The roll <Col N="768" />out of segregated and separate collection services is contingent in large part on the availability of materials recovery facilities, where dry recyclables are sorted and aggregated for delivery to reprocessing outlets, and biological treatment facilities for organic waste. In addition, recycling by householders is facilitated by the steady expansion by local authorities of bring banks and civic amenity sites which accept a wide range of recyclable waste streams.</P>
    <P>On 7 November 2002, I announced the allocation of up to &euro;15 million in grant assistance towards the provision of recycling infrastructure. The grant scheme will primarily support the provision of &ldquo;high in waste hierarchy&rdquo; waste recovery infrastructure, which is provided for in, or consistent with the objectives of, local authority waste management plans. Eligible infrastructure includes civic amenity sites and other &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities, transfer stations and materials recovery and biological treatment facilities. This first round of allocations is intended to support the provision of more than 500 new &ldquo;bring&rdquo; bank sites around the country, compared to about 1300 sites currently, almost 20 new and expanded civic amenity sites, eight composting facilities and one expanded materials recovery facility, as well as the upgrading of many existing &ldquo;bring&rdquo; banks.</P>

      <P>These recommendations from the Heritage Council, published in May 2002, cover a wide range of issues, some of which have been implemented. Others are still under examination by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, grants additional powers to planning authorities to preserve valuable landscapes through the development plan. Objectives to preserve landscape character must be included in the development plan, where the planning authority believes it is necessary for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.

Additional restrictions on types of development that are normally exempt will apply in these areas.</P>

      <P>The 2001 annual report and accounts of An Bord Pleanála were published on 11 November 2002. At the launch of the annual report, the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála outlined the effects of the changeover to the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which took effect from 11 March 2002. The chairperson indicated that the percentage of appeals that were invalid was significantly higher under the 2000 Act than previously. This was due, at least in part, to the new requirement that third party appellants must produce evidence of having made a submission to the planning authority in relation to the initial application and also to the change in the appeal period from one month to four weeks. It is a requirement of the Act that a third party appellant must have participated at local authority level. This is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and I have no proposals to change it.</P>
      <P>Under articles 28(4) and 29(2) of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, each planning authority must acknowledge, in writing, receipt of any submission or observation received within the statutory five week period in relation to a planning application. Under section 127 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, a third party appellant who made a submission or observation on a planning application and who wishes to appeal the decision of the planning authority must present to the board the written acknowledgement received from the planning authority. During the summer, the board advised my Department that the form of acknowledgement in use by planning authorities varied considerably. Arising from this, my Department issued a circular on 7 August 2002 to each planning authority which, <i>inter alia</i>, attached a template acknowledgement form and asked that each planning authority should use this template, or a similar form, when acknowledging receipt of submissions or observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" />As planning authorities and the general public become more familiar with the new system, I anticipate that the proportion of invalid appeals will decrease significantly over the next months and I have no proposals to amend the procedures in relation to planning appeals set out in the 2000 Act and the 2001 regulations.</P>

      <P>The conservation grant scheme for protected structures was introduced in 1999. The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of works subject to a maximum of &euro;13,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards or in exceptional circumstances upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved cost of works or &euro;25,000, whichever is the lesser. Accordingly, the scheme is not intended to meet the full cost but is designed to assist owners or occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is administered by local authorities, who are required to prioritise applications on the basis of a scheme of priorities drawn up by the relevant local authority. This is a statement by the local authority of the criteria that will be used in prioritising grant applications. Each local authority is allocated a fixed amount of funding for grant purposes in each calendar year. There had been a pattern of under-expenditure on this scheme since its inception. This under-expenditure was taken into consideration when my Department made an allocation of &euro;3 million to local authorities this year. So far this year a total <Col N="772" />of &euro;1,305,487 has been drawn down by local authorities in relation to this scheme and I expect the full amount to be drawn down by year end. While there are no proposals to alter the scheme, my Department will continue to monitor its operation closely. A total of &euro;2.888 million has been included in the 2003 Estimates for this scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January this year, Regulation EC 2037/2000 has required the recovery and destruction of ozone-depleting substances contained in domestic refrigerators and freezers. In addition, European Commission Decision 2000/532/EC revised the EU list of hazardous waste to include, with effect from the same date, equipment which contains CFCs. These changes affect the disposal of fridges and freezers manufactured before 1994, which contain CFCs in insulating foam as well as in fridge coolant. While technology is available in Ireland for the removal of CFCs from the coolants, no equipment is yet available for the removal of the insulating foam. Accordingly, since 1 January fridges and freezers cannot be dealt with by the traditional method of degassing, recovering the metal for recycling and sending the remaining waste to landfill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in the absence of treatment facilities in Ireland, a problem also being experienced in other EU member states, a number of local authorities have made arrangements for the storage of fridges and freezers or for their export to appropriate European recovery facilities. Such arrangements may involve co-operation with private waste companies. In the interest of a longer-term solution and within the co-operative framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, my Department has developed an all-island approach to this issue in co-operation with the <Col N="773" />Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. Tenders were sought in September 2002 on behalf of all local authorities on the island for the provision of a service for the management of waste fridges and freezers. These tenders are now being considered, with a view to the provision of such a service as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of charging for the acceptance of waste fridges and freezers, local authorities are empowered to charge for services that they provide. It is a matter for each local authority to decide whether or not to charge for this service having regard to local authority costs in dealing with waste fridges and freezers and the overall waste recovery objectives of their waste management plans. In this regard, the current tendering process is aimed at providing a cost-effective solution to the management of waste fridges and freezers.</P>

      <P>Since 1999 the bulk of non-national road grants have been provided from the local government fund. The amount of funding for non-national roads to be made available from the fund in 2003 has not yet been determined. The recently published abridged Estimates volume provided &euro;39.957 million in my Department's Vote for the category of non-national roads to support housing and other development. This grant category is funding 42 schemes in 15 local authorities, which were approved in December 2000. The expected outturn under this grant category in 2002 is &euro;39.948 million. The level of funding available in 2003 will be sufficient to meet the projected needs of these schemes. I intend to announce non-national road allocations to local authorities for 2003, under all grant categories, early next year.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Priority Question No. 4 on today's Order Paper. This indicates that the results of the most recent statutory assessment of local authority housing need showed that at 28 March 2002 a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing. This represents an increase of 23.5% on the results of the previous assessment undertaken at end March 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need and has been responding actively to this situation by expanding on our social and affordable housing output. This year we will deliver the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for over 15 years. I anticipate that total social housing output this year taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures will meet the needs of approximately 13,000 households on waiting lists compared to just over 8,500 households in 2000.</P>
      <P>Local authority housing output, including both new build and acquisitions, amounted to 5,022 units last year, an increase of 1,815 units or 57% on the 2000 output of 3,207 units. Local authorities will complete or acquire some 5,500 houses in 2002 and approximately 4,000 houses in 2003. Voluntary bodies provided 951 units in 2000, 1,250 units in 2001 and are expected to provide 1,500 units this year and 1,750 units in 2003.</P>

      <P>On 19 November 2001, one of the parties to a joint venture that had submitted a tender to the local authority in respect of this project wrote to my Department raising certain matters in relation to the ongoing tender process. My Department's investigation did not establish that any basis existed for not proceeding with the tender process, and the local authority's tender recommendation of 30 November 2001, was approved by the Department on 18 December 2001.</P>
      <P>On December 18 2001, an e-mail communication from the original correspondent was forwarded to my Department by a third person. This alleged certain irregularities in the tender process by named persons and bodies. In the absence of consent from the correspondent to the matters referred to being taken up with the parties concerned, or any other indication that the tender process had been compromised in any way, my Department concluded that there was no basis for setting the process aside. I understand that both sets of correspondents are now the subject of legal proceedings by one of the named persons.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the other party to the joint venture, a major international company, wrote to my Department at the time to disassociate itself from the allegations being made by its partner and to confirm that there did not appear to be any substantiation to the claims of improper conduct in relation to tender procedures.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a study undertaken in January 2001 by the person referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>This study examined the development potential for some public open space in North Dublin and suggested varying numbers of housing units which could be achieved based on various assumptions in relation to the suitability of such land for housing and viable densities. A more recent study in which the same person participated, referred more generally to this issue in the context of supply of land in Dublin. The latter study referred to the need to identify underutilised land holdings in a broad range of public ownership for housing development purposes.</P>
      <P>This process is already under way. In 2000, the Government decided to establish a National Public Property Register, under the aegis of the Department of Finance. The National Public Property Register contains information on lands and buildings in the ownership of Departments and State agencies, including non-commercial State bodies, health boards, local authorities and certain education bodies and provides a basis for the consideration of the appropriate use of these resources.</P>

      <P>Over the period 1996 <Col N="777" />to 2002, there were and are three specialist staff members dedicated exclusively to bird conservation matters in my Department, two of whom have degrees, while the third has a diploma in field biology. There were no vacancies during the period in question. A wide range of research and survey work relevant to bird conservation was carried out during this period by employees of Birdwatch Ireland and by self-employed specialists, on contracts funded by my Department and supervised by its staff.</P>
      <P>The bird conservation specialists form part of a wider group of permanent specialist scientific staff, whose work contributes substantially to bird conservation, notably in the survey and designation of areas for conservation of habitats and species. For most of the period in question there were 16 such scientific staff, including the birds specialists. An increase in this number to 22 has been approved and arrangements to fill the new posts and two permanent or temporary vacancies that had arisen recently are at interview stage.</P>
      <P>The bird conservation work arising under our national and international obligations is also undertaken by an extensive national network of field staff, as an integral part of their work on conservation of habitats and species generally. These staff range from divisional managers to conservation ranger grade and include three regional ecologists. Of 118 posts approved, there are currently seven vacancies and replacement staff are being recruited to fill these posts. The work of both the scientific and field staff is supported by an additional ecologist based in the heritage policy and legislation unit of my Department.</P>
      <P>There was no budget exclusively dedicated to wild bird conservation over the period in question. This aspect of work is integral to the overall work of habitat and species conservation within Dúchas. In the overall context of the work it is not practical to separate out bird conservation work generally, or work on special protection areas, SPAs, in particular, as a cost item.</P>
      <P>Staffing and funding for conservation of habitats and species, including birds, has been built up over time to address the growing volume of work involved, including responsibilities arising in connection with implementation and enforcement of the European Habitats and Birds Directives and the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. This sector is now better and more effectively resourced than ever before.</P>

      <P>There are currently five cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action, or announced that it intends to take legal action, in areas for which my Department has responsibility. The first case concerns the Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC. Irelands defence and rejoinder have been lodged and the opinion of the advocate general and the judgment of the ECJ are awaited. The position with regard to implementation of this directive is set out in the reply to Question No. 1491 of 9 October 2002.</P>
      <P>The second case concerns the adoption of programmes for the protection of designated shellfish in waters in accordance with Article 5 of Council Directive 79/923/EEC. The directive has been fully transposed into Irish law and action programmes recently made by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources are now under consideration by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The third case concerns the Dangerous Substances Directive 76/464/EEC. Ireland is required to lodge its defence by 29 November 2002. This directive has been substantially implemented by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, and related legislation. For the purposes of this directive, water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances including certain pesticides, solvents and metals. Monitoring by the EPA indicates that the main threat to water quality in Ireland is eutrophication due to excess inputs of phosphorus and, to a lesser extent, nitrates and that dangerous substances are generally not a problem in Irish waters. It is envisaged that the directive will be further implemented in the context of implementation of the Water Framework Directive 60/2000/EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth case relates to a number of waste issues, including progress in the licensing by the EPA of municipal waste landfills, and the regulatory control of waste activities by local authorities and the EPA. Ireland's defence, which has been submitted, is based in part on the fact that rel<Col N="780" />evant requirements of Council Directive 75/442/EEC have been fully transposed under the Waste Management Act, 1996, and subordinate regulations, and that the process of licensing municipal landfills is virtually completed.</P>
    <P>The fifth case relates to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Directive 1999/13/EC. Regulations transposing the directive into Irish law are at an advanced stage of preparation and will be the primary defence in this case.</P>

      <P>A deputation from the General Council of County Councils met with me on 24 October 2002 to discuss a range of matters, including the direct election of chairs in accordance with the Local Government Act, 2001. The general council indicated some concern about the possible effects of the new provisions for directly elected chairs. In response, I undertook to complete consideration of these concerns within a short period, and well in advance of the 2004 elections.</P>

      <P>My Department has reports of the survey referred to in the question. The Government does not propose to bring forward an amendment to the Constitution in relation to a right to housing. This is in line with the 1996 report of the constitutional review group which concluded that the Constitution should not confer personal justiciable rights to freedom from poverty or to other economic or social entitlements. The group regarded these as being essentially political matters which should be the responsibility of elected representatives to address and determine in a democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent assessment of housing needs, which included a count of the number of homeless persons, was carried out by local authorities at the end of March this year. The data in relation to local authority housing waiting lists, which has been finalised and published, shows that a total of 2,468 homeless households were considered to be in need of local authority housing compared to 2,219 in March 1999. This figure does not include persons who have been assessed as homeless by local authorities but who are not included on local authority housing lists because, for example, their need is not for local authority housing but rather for long-term supported accommodation. My Department is currently finalising figures in relation to the total number of persons who have been assessed as homeless in each local authority area and this information will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>One of the key requirements of the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness was that local action plans would be drawn up by homeless fora, with representatives of the local authority, health board and voluntary sector, to detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved. Most of these plans have now been completed and they provide a clear framework for the planning and delivery of support and services to the homeless. The remaining few plans are in the process of being finalised by local authorities and health boards and should be adopted shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency night shelter accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation <Col N="782" />that is more suited to their needs, has been provided in recent years and more will be provided as part of the full implementation of the action plans. Substantial additional funding has been made available as part of the homeless strategy. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from &euro;25.4 million to &euro;50.8 million in the period 2001-05. Current funding for homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from &euro;12.6 million in 1999 to an expected &euro;43 million this year. In addition, funding is available to the voluntary sector under my Departments capital assistance scheme towards the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>The prevention of homelessness is also being addressed. The main aim of the homeless preventative strategy, which was launched in February 2002, is to ensure that no one is released from any type of State care without the appropriate measures in place to ensure that they have a suitable place to live with the necessary supports, if needed. This strategy was prepared by my Department in conjunction with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and Health and Children under the auspices of the cross-Department team on homelessness and contains measures to prevent homelessness among adult offenders, young offenders, those leaving mental health facilities and acute hospitals, and young people leaving care. The implementation of both the integrated and preventative strategies is being monitored by the cross Department team on homelessness with a view to identifying and addressing any obstacles to progress.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 168, 172, 173 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>Under the habitats directive, 364 candidate special areas of conservation &ndash; cSACs &ndash; have been publicly notified and formally transmitted by Ireland to the European Commission. In addition, a total of 110 special protection areas &ndash; SPAs &ndash; have been designated under the birds directive in Ireland. SPAs and cSACs are collectively known as Natura 2000 sites and will form part of a network of protected natural areas throughout the European Union. A list of these Natura 2000 sites is in table 1.</P>
      <P>In March 2002, Dúchas the heritage service of my Department publicly advertised and notified known landowners of intention to designate 25 further SPAs and nine extensions to existing sites; these sites are listed in table 2. Some further SPAs will be proposed in 2003, when boundary surveys have been completed. I should stress that the protective mechanisms in respect of Natura 2000 sites are effective from date of initial notification of these sites. The legal provisions are set out in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, as amended by section 75 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000. In addition, the EU Commission is now seeking to finalise a list of cSACs, except for offshore sites, for the Atlantic region of Europe, in the first half of 2003.</P>
      <P>Preparations are well advanced to complete Ireland's list of cSACs, following the evaluation of the existing list, along with those of other member states in the Atlantic region, at a meeting in The Hague last June. I intend to publish further proposals in this regard in December 2002 and January 2003. There will be a particular focus on rivers, to support the conservation of salmon and other aquatic species, and on raised bogs, fens and other wetland habitats. Under the terms of the habitats directive, formal designation of special areas of conservation must take place as soon as possible after the adoption of the list at European level, and within six years at most.</P>
      <P>There is no set timetable for designation of natural heritage areas, NHAs, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000. I intend to publish proposals in December for designation of raised bogs as NHAs. Designation of other NHAs meeting appropriate scientific criteria as sites of ecological or geological interest, or both, will proceed from 2003 onwards, as rapidly as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The birds directive has been implemented in Ireland since 1985, many of its requirements being met by the pre-existing provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976. A primary requirement of the directive, and the clearest indicator of progress in its implementation, is the designation of special <Col N="784" />protection areas, as already described. The directive also requires member states to take measures to maintain populations of all species of wild birds, and their habitats. Recurring surveys of wild birds and their distribution, such as the Irish wetland birds survey and the countryside birds survey are keys to determining priorities in this regard. Such surveys are carried out in partnership with Birdwatch Ireland, with funding from my Department and other sources. The European Court of Justice decided last June that Ireland had failed to fulfil, by June 1998, one of its obligations under the directive, with regard principally to habitats of red grouse. The programme of reduction in sheep stocking levels on commonages, commenced in 1998, is the primary measure to remedy the problem identified by the court judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of media reports regarding the alleged breaches of labour law in the treatment of non-national workers involved in the Dublin Port tunnel. The labour inspectorate of my Department has sought on two occasions over the past few weeks to meet with the employer so as to inspect records to ensure compliance with statutory entitlements under employment rights legislation. Despite leaving contact details and making enquiries from local Garda stations, efforts to meet the employer have not been successful. However, other avenues are currently being pursued and we expect to be in a position to meet with the employer's accountant shortly so as to inspect records. In the event that evidence of non-compliance with employment rights legislation is found the inspectorate will seek redress for the individuals who have been mistreated and, if appropriate, a prosecution will be initiated. The inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impar<Col N="793" />tially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality. It is important to note that our employment rights legislation, which establishes the statutory rights applicable to workers whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, is applicable to all people working in Ireland. The legislation makes no distinction whatsoever between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 to 71, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations which has the primary role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN possesses no standing military forces of its own and relies on the provision of such resources by willing members. Our Defence Forces have accumulated considerable expertise with the United Nations over the years and their contribution to missions designed to promote peace and stability are illustrative of the humanitarian values that underpin Ireland's approach to assisting those who have suffered the traumatic consequences of strife or conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently had the privilege of reporting on the participation of Defence Forces on UN operations to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence, and Women's Affairs. A copy of my report is available in the Oireachtas Library. Deputies of all sides paid tribute to the work and contribution of the Defence Forces to the United Nations and I stressed that it is the Government's intention that our contribution would be maintained into the future. I reported <Col N="794" />that, over the course of 2001, we had an average of approximately 800 personnel involved in UN or UN mandated missions, and, at any one time during the year in question, a minimum of 470 personnel were deployed on 12 different missions in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia. A key event for the Defence Forces in 2001 was the withdrawal of our largest overseas contingent in Lebanon, UNIFIL, in November, 2001. The context of scaling down and eventual withdrawal from Lebanon in 2001 ensured that we were in a position to positively respond to UN requests for deployments to Eritrea, UNMEE, and East Timor, UNTAET. Currently there are some 447 troops serving with the United Nations or on United Nations mandated missions in diverse locations around the world. For a country of Ireland's size, we have made a highly significant contribution in furtherance of international peace and greater understanding between nations.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that Ireland has a very positive role to play in contributing the expertise of our Defence Forces to the efforts of the EU to promote peace and stability. The planned contribution to the EU headline goal in no way degrades our commitment to UN peacekeeping. In fact, this contribution reinforces in a very conspicuous way our continued intention to support efforts to maximise international peace and stability.</P>
    <P>There is often some misunderstanding in relation to our contribution to the United Nations standby arrangements. Ireland's commitment to the headline goal consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to UNSAS. Accordingly, our commitment to the headline goal does not have any implications for our commitment to the United Nations. Ireland will only participate on EU peace support operations subject to specific Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo;. It is sometimes asked how the UN and the EU link together? Are there contradictions between the two approaches? The answer is that one complements the other or, to put it in another way, they are mutually reinforcing. The UN has encouraged regional approaches to peacekeeping and there have recently been discussions between representatives of the UN and the EU on peacekeeping and crisis management issues. Close co-operation between the EU and the UN is developing on these matters.</P>
    <P>Training, personnel and equipment programmes required for the reorganisation and development of the Defence Forces are provided for under the Government's White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, which took account of both the internal and external security environments. There has been no departure from the strategy framework which is provided for in the White Paper and Defence Forces training for participation in the headline goal does not have additional implications for the Exchequer.</P>

      <Col N="795" />There are no plans for Defence Forces participation in joint training between EU and NATO. The ongoing EU exercise programme covers the period 2001-06, and entails a sequence of exercises designed to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in a crisis management situation. The exercises are designed to ensure the EU structures, procedures &ndash; including consultation with the UN &ndash; and arrangements are properly tested and validated in order to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in a Petersberg task type crisis situation. In effect the exercises test the political-diplomatic and military responses to an emerging crisis. They should not be confused with military exercises which require deployment of troops. The EU does not intend to engage in military field exercises as part of the EU exercise programme.</P>

      <P>Up to two thirds of the non-forage feed materials used in feedingstuffs are imported mainly from third countries. These are principally protein sources not available in Ireland. I am satisfied that the controls on animal feed operated by my Department fulfil all the obligations under the EU regulations on animal feeds which are among the strictest in the world. The EU controls in this area are continually monitored and reviewed by the European Commission and have been intensified on a number of occasions. The controls in operation here cover both home produced and imported feed from the EU and third countries. Specific controls with regard to imported feed include initial checks by the customs officials on the type of feed; documentary check by staff of my Department; inspections of storage facilities and targeted sampling and analysis of consignments of animal feed in order to ensure compliance with the legislation. As a further control in the safeguarding of our national herd against BSE, my Department is committed to ensuring that all future imports of feed material are sampled on arrival.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office is responsible for the collection of statistics on imports of beef. From trade data supplied by that body the following amounts of beef have been imported from the USA: 1997 &ndash; 28 tonnes; 1998 &ndash; one tonne; 1999 &ndash; none; 2000 &ndash; none; 2001 &ndash; 18 tonnes; 2002 &ndash; none.</P>
      <P>Animal based products imported directly into Ireland from third countries such as the USA must be processed through one of the approved border inspection posts at Dublin and Cork ports or Shannon Airport. Products that have already been cleared through a border inspection post in another member state are considered to be in free circulation in the European Union. In 2001 the total amount of beef imported from the USA into the EU was 2,040 tonnes &ndash; (United States Department of Agriculture &ndash; trade exports).</P>
      <P>Beef imported from a third country is subject to the checks required by harmonised rules laid down at European level and must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export, regardless of point of entry on to the territory of the EU. In addition, animal products such as beef must have been produced in premises located in third countries that are approved by the European Commission and are subject to veterinary audits by the EU food and veterinary office.</P>
      <P>Countries that export to the EU must submit their residue monitoring plans to the European Commission and satisfy the Community that their controls regarding prohibited substances and veterinary medicines generally are at least equivalent to those in member states of the EU. In some third countries so called &ldquo;split production systems&rdquo; exist whereby cattle reared for export to the EU come from herds which have not been given substances that have been banned in the EU. This is also the case in respect of animal products imported from such countries.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU and national regulations on the tagging and registration of bovine animals, calves must be tagged within 20 days of birth and registered within seven days of tagging. The purpose of these deadlines is to ensure that the identity, origin and age of calves are recorded accurately on the national cattle database. Prior to acceptance of applications for calf birth registration that are submitted 60 days after the date of birth, the keeper is requested to obtain corroboration from a veterinary practitioner as to the age and identity of the animals <Col N="800" />concerned and to submit this statement of corroboration to the local district veterinary office.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, on 30 August 2002 application forms for registration were received from the keeper by the Calf Birth Registration Agency in respect of eight animals whose dates of birth ranged between 1 May 2002 and 29 June 2002. The keeper was requested by letter to obtain confirmation from a veterinary practitioner as to the identity and age of the animals and to submit this confirmation to the local district veterinary office. To date, the confirmation has not been received with the result that the registration of these animals cannot proceed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 87 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The person named included a land parcel on his 2002 area aid application which overlapped with land parcels belonging to another herdowner. Following contact by the area aid unit with the person named, the correct boundary for the parcel has been established and his 2002 area aid application has been fully processed without error and with an area determined for payment purposes of 37.11 hectares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" />Under the relevant EU regulation, herdowners must indicate that they wish to participate in extensification premium in a particular year. In Ireland's case a herdowner's intention to participate is notified to the Department on an EXPR1 form.</P>
    <P>Although the person named claims that he submitted an EXPR1 form for the 2001 extensification premium, there is no record of it having been received in my Department. Unfortunately, in the absence of a receipt issued by the Department at the time the form was lodged or a certificate of posting from An Post, an EXPR1 form cannot be accepted from the person named at this stage. I regret that he cannot be considered for payment of the 2001 extensification premium. The person named is a participant in 2002 extensification premium opting for the simplified system.</P>
    <P>The person named was written to on 24 October 2002 informing him that his 2003 ewe quota was being reduced from 12 premium rights to seven following the implementation of the commonage framework plans. However, subsequent to this letter issuing, a decision was taken to allow all farmers who were destocked to single figures to retain a flock of ten ewes on which ewe premium can continue to be paid.

      <Col N="803" />There has been a resumption in trade in younger animals to markets in the EU such as Spain and Italy. The trade in finished animals to Lebanon is continuing since that market reopened to us following the lifting of foot and mouth disease restrictions.</P>
    <P>An agreement signed with Libya in June 2000 provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement signed with Libya in so far as it relates to cattle exports is fully implemented.</P>
    <P>Regarding live cattle exports to Egypt, proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle were submitted to the Egyptian authorities in 1997 but these were not implemented. The lack of a market for live cattle exports to Egypt was, however, more than offset by the volume of trade in beef exports to that country in recent years. The Egyptian market for beef has been re-opened to Ireland following intensive efforts throughout last year.</P>

    <P>The relevant schemes referred to are, however, not intended to provide the full means by which farm pollution will be controlled. Other measures such as the rural environment protection scheme, the protocol on good farming practice and the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector are also designed to play an important role in this regard. I am satisfied that the combination of these measures is making a <Col N="804" />significant contribution to the control of farm pollution in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The rural development plan 2000-2006 sets out the targets for participation in REPS up to the end of 2006. While participation levels are some way behind target, I remain optimistic that they can be increased significantly by the end of the current plan in 2006.</P>
      <P>My Department will have received some 10,000 applications in 2002 and the level of applications continues to compare favourably with any corresponding period during the first REPS from 1994 to 1999. There is adequate funding in place for 2003 for a further increase in levels of participation.</P>
      <P>A number of factors have militated against a higher initial take-up of REPS. The foot and mouth disease crisis in the earlier part of 2001 prevented planners from going onto farms to prepare REPS plans. In some areas the volume of demand has been greater than the capacity of planners to deal with it. Surveys by my Department and other bodies have established that there are concerns among farmers about certain aspects of the scheme, including payment rates, the complexity of the application procedure and a perception that the level of inspections and penalties is higher than it actually is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently announced some administrative changes to REPS to make the application process more user-friendly for farmers and planners. I have also announced a consultation process designed to give all stakeholder groups a chance to contribute to the formulation of proposals on REPS which I intend to submit to the European Commission in 2003. In the meantime, I urge all <Col N="805" />stakeholders in REPS, especially the farming organisations, to do what they can to maximise participation in the scheme to ensure continued substantial funding for agri-environmental measures after 2006.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for flood alleviation <Col N="806" />is a matter for the local authority in the first instance. However, the Office of Public Works agreed to provide funding to the town council for a feasibility report on flooding in Arklow. That report was completed earlier this year and was presented to the town council.</P>
      <P>The report contains a number of short-term recommendations for alleviating flooding in the town and also recommends implementation of a flood relief scheme. The capital cost of the recommended flood relief scheme has been estimated by the consultants to be in the region of &euro;3.33 million. However, this estimate is based on preliminary investigations only and does not include site investigations, environmental studies, cost-benefit analyses, outline and detailed designs, etc.</P>
      <P>Funding available to the Office of Public Works for the implementation of flood relief schemes is committed to other schemes and I am not in a position to say when funding might be available for a scheme at Arklow.

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the work of the review group was complex. The group was established in 1997 and met 30 times. As part of its deliberations, the group heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and received more than 260 written submissions from interested parties.</P>
      <P>While definitions of disability vary, I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with less severe medical conditions than those which are covered by the scheme and persons with medical conditions which are not covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme. Therefore, many factors had to be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. This work and analysis took time.</P>

      <Quest>the level of Irish aid used to directly fund sexual and reproductive health programmes in developing countries; and if his Department plans to expand funding in this area.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Irish aid programme, Ireland Aid, and that of other donors is guided by the international development goals. Four of the eight goals are relevant to this area. They are: to promote gender equality and empower women, to reduce child mortality, to improve maternal health and to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases.</P>
      <P>In the Irish programme, the area of sexual and reproductive health is integral to the development of a broadly-based health service and health sector, to the creation of equal opportunities for women through the education system and also to the fight against HIV-AIDS. In the lastmentioned where the Ireland Aid approach is to mainstream the battle against HIV-AIDS across all elements of the programme in the seven countries in Africa, issues of behavioural change, family planning and mother-to-child transmission are elements of our approach.</P>
      <P>In the health sector throughout all the countries where we are engaged, neo-natal care and mother and child health are priorities and part of both direct Irish interventions and of the combined donor support given to health sector programmes in the countries where we concentrate. There is an example of direct intervention in Zambia where Ireland Aid has been involved in the construction of maternity clinics run by midwives with the aim of relieving pressure on major hospitals and providing care and instruction in reproductive health and child nutrition.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that these efforts are in large measure integrated into the programme, it is difficult to give figures for the amount spent on them. However, I can say more generally that in 2001, the last year for which we have full accounts, &euro;31.5 million was spent on health which is equal to 17% of the bilateral aid programme. It is also appropriate to mention that in 2002 a special budget-line was created to give effect to the pledge made by the Taoiseach in 2001 that an additional US$30 million would be spent each year in the fight against HIV-AIDS.</P>

      <P>The Government has a long-standing commitment to development in Ethiopia which is reflected in our having a resident embassy in that country, whose work is focused overwhelmingly on development and on aid issues. The mission is headed by a chargé d'affaires.

      <P>Ireland is not a member of NATO and did not participate in the NATO summit in Prague. Ireland does not and will not play a role in <Col N="810" />NATO. Decisions on the future expansion of NATO are a matter for the members of NATO and were taken at the NATO summit on 21 November.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, represented Ireland at the separate meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, EAPC, which took place in Prague on 22 November, the day after the NATO summit. The EAPC is the political framework for dialogue and consultation on issues relevant to Partnership for Peace which, following the approval of the House, Ireland joined in December 1999. Ireland is one of 27 non-NATO participants in the EAPC, which also includes other European neutral and non-aligned countries such as Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The EAPC meeting provided an opportunity for Ireland to continue the development of practical co-operation among EAPC participants in the peacekeeping and crisis management area. In his intervention at the meeting, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, said that we have gained from our participation in the EAPC and that Ireland is also sharing with other participating states the experience we have gained in United Nations peacekeeping and crisis management. He indicated that this co-operation is in keeping with our long-standing policy of military neutrality and our active engagement in international peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also availed of the opportunity afforded by the high-level presence at the EAPC meeting in Prague to hold bilateral meetings on a variety of European issues with the President of Finland, the Foreign Minister of Iceland and the Under-Secretary of State at the Turkish Foreign Ministry.</P>

      <P>I discussed the question of Turkish accession to the European Union with the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, in Washington last Monday. The Secretary of State encouraged Ireland, as he has other members of the European Union, to reach agreement at the Copenhagen European Council on 12 and 13 December on a starting date for negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained to the Secretary of State that the EU had established certain criteria, known as the Copenhagen criteria, which had to be met by any state seeking membership of the European Union before accession negotiations could begin. I said <Col N="811" />that Ireland would be as helpful as possible in regard to Turkey's desire to begin accession negotiations, subject to the necessary criteria being fully met.</P>
    <P>I had a conversation along similar lines with the US permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador John Negroponte, in New York on 21 November.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging to note that the leader of Turkey's governing Justice and Development, AK, Party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said that the proposal of UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, for a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus &ldquo;is negotiable&rdquo;. Ireland has publicly welcomed the UN Secretary General's proposal. I hope that it will be possible for negotiations on the future of Cyprus to proceed in a constructive and open atmosphere on the basis of the Secretary General's plan.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland has called on all the parties involved to co-operate in the process with a view to achieving a political settlement before the end of the negotiations for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council conclusions of 1999 provide that, while a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, the EU will decide on Cypriot accession without a settlement being a precondition and taking into account &ldquo;all relevant factors&rdquo; if no settlement has been reached by the end of negotiations. It is expected that a final decision on Cyprus's accession to the EU will be taken at the Copenhagen European Council on 12 and 13 December 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, some senior Turkish figures have made statements to the effect that Turkey should consider annexing the so-called &ldquo;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&rdquo; if a divided Cyprus should be admitted to the EU. Such action would be in clear violation of international <Col N="812" />law and resolutions of the UN Security Council. I am not aware of any threats by Turkey &ldquo;to annex Cyprus&rdquo; if it is not itself granted an immediate EU accession date.</P>

      <P>Following an EU-wide tender competition, Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder for the provision of the Cork School of Music under the Government's public private partnership pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>The initial advertised tender for the project was for the refurbishment and rebuilding of the school and the provision of a range of facilities management to include building maintenance, cleaning, security, grounds maintenance and specialist equipment support by way of a public private partnership.</P>
      <P>During the bidding process, the project scope changed substantially with all three final bidders independently coming to the same conclusion that a complete new building was the most appropriate solution and that the current building should not be retained. In addition, following the granting of full planning permission, an appeal was lodged to An Bord Pleanála. During the appeal process, it was not possible to progress the detailed financial, legal and operational issues until a definitive answer to the appeal was announced.</P>
      <P>In addition, my officials are in discussions with the European Investment Bank regarding its participation that would provide for the refinancing of the project two years into the operations phase, thus reducing the overall cost.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 to 118, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputy relate to a difference of opinion between an individual parent of a student and Maynooth post primary school. The issues raised have been the subject of extensive correspondence between officials of my Department, County Kildare Vocational Education Committee and the parent involved. The Deputy will also be aware that the issues he raised previously were comprehensively dealt with in a letter from an official of my Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that as a result of my Department's inquiries with County Kildare Vocational Education Committee, that the registration fee referred to by the Deputy is a voluntary contribution and that there is no question of compulsion to pay. I am also satisfied that in relation to the school's academic and teaching policy, nothing has been brought to my attention which suggests that the school's policies are in material conflict with the provision of the Education Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of cleaning duties, my Department has been assured that the type of cleaning duties referred to in the school plan, are light and are designed to assist in character formation and the development of a sense of civic duty in the students and that the electrical equipment in use is a vacuum cleaner of standard design.</P>
      <P>In summary, I do not share the view that the policies of Maynooth post primary school are in conflict with the Education Act, 1998. The Education Act, 1998, sets out a clear statutory framework within which the Irish education sector can operate and continue to develop. All schools recognised for the purposes of the Act are required to comply with the provisions of the Act. The Act identifies the key participants in the relevant areas of the education system and assigns the appropriate functions, rights and responsibilities to each participant. By virtue of section 6 of the Act, every person concerned in its implementation has an obligation to have regard to the objects in pursuance of which the Oireachtas enacted the Education Act. Therefore, all partners in education have a responsibility in ensuring that this happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 120 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the allegations in respect of a person employed as an inspector of industrial and reformatory schools, I have on a number of occasions informed this House that such allegations as have been brought to my Department's attention were referred by the Secretary General of my Department to the Garda Síochána earlier this year. In the past week the Garda has written to the Secretary General and informed him that the Garda has concluded its inquiries and that it is not aware of any complaint against the person concerned that would warrant a criminal investigation at this time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has also asked questions relating more generally to the extent to which officials of the Department of Education between 1976 and 1996 were aware of complaints of child sex abuse in three institutions. To establish precisely what Department officials did or did not know in that period would require a thorough examination of a very significant number of documents. In addition, it would be necessary to interview those members of staff who worked in the administration of the industrial and reformatory schools at the time and who are still available for interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas, through the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, established a statutory body with the powers of the High Court to undertake precisely this task, along with others. The Act specifically provides that the commission shall inquire into abuse allegations and shall determine the extent to which certain bodies including the Department, in exercising functions of inspection and regulation, contributed to abuse. It is in that forum that the kind of <Col N="817" />inquiry, which the Deputy seeks, can best be carried out. It would be neither effective nor appropriate for my Department to try to parallel the inquiries of the commission.</P>
    <P>In deference to the Deputy however, I have asked my Department to examine the records available of the period as thoroughly as possible within the relatively short time available. As a result of that exercise the officials have not found any record of a request from the Sisters of Charity for an inspection at St. Joseph's convent, Kilkenny, in 1976. I can also say that the officials did not find any records in respect of complaints or reports of child sex abuse in Kilkenny, Clonmel and Cappoquin industrial schools between 1976 and 1996. The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Cappoquin and Kilkenny industrial schools was transferred to the Department of Health and Children in 1984.</P>

      <P>Section 17 of the Act provides that a person shall be accepted by the Civil Service commissioners as qualified for appointment to a position for which a competition is held if, and only if, the commissioners are satisfied that, among other pre-requisites, the person is suitable on grounds of character and is suitable in all other relevant respects for appointment to the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question is in relation to access to higher education programmes generally. I will set out, for the Deputy's information, the schemes and measures available to assist students in higher education, which come under the heading of student support services funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>The three third level maintenance grants schemes are as follows: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. Under the maintenance grants schemes, funding is awarded to eligible students towards the cost of maintenance, tuition fees and the charge for student services, registration and examinations.</P>
      <P>There are three Irish scholarship schemes as follows: scheme of third level scholarships for students from the Gaeltacht; scheme of third level scholarships, through Irish: restricted; and scheme of Irish third level scholarships, unrestricted. Scholarships are awarded to successful candidates in respect of fees and maintenance for approved third level courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another scheme is the Easter week commemoration scholarship scheme. Winners of these <Col N="821" />scholarships are funded in respect of fees and maintenance for approved third level courses.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above schemes, there is a range of measures funded by my Department aimed at promoting access to further and higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, students with disabilities and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students.</P>
    <P>The special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as &lsquo;top-up' grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000/01 academic year.</P>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced in 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families.</P>
    <P>The student assistance-access fund makes available financial support to students, in approved third level institutions. The objective of the fund is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college.</P>
    <P>The fund for students with disabilities provides grants towards the provision of services and the purchase of equipment for students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions or post leaving certificate courses. The scheme applies to students who have serious sensory, physical and-or communicative disabilities, including dyslexia.</P>
    <P>As reflected in the recently published Abridged Book of Estimates for 2003, approximately &euro;127 million has been allocated in respect of the third level maintenance grants schemes and scholarships schemes. A further &euro;26 million has been allocated in respect of my Department's access measures targeting students from disadvantaged backgrounds, students with disabilities and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. This review will cover a range of topics relating to the schemes of student support including the level of maintenance grants, eligibility and income limits with respect to the grants, and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees at undergraduate level in approved institutions. Decisions regarding increases in income thresholds and maintenance grant levels will not be taken, pending completion of this review and, accordingly, provision to take account of such increases is not reflected in the Abridged Book of Estimates for 2003.</P>

      <P>A task force on the physical sciences was set up at the end of 2000 to address the declining uptake of the physical sciences and related issues. The task force reported in March 2002. The task force had 44 members nominated by a wide range of educational and industrial interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report identified six action areas: planning and resources; equity, teaching and learning; curriculum and assessment; promotion of science; <Col N="823" />and transition and integration into third level. The total costing of the proposals within the task force report amounted to &euro;178 million for capital expenditure and &euro;66 million for annual recurrent expenditure. The report was circulated for consultation in April with submissions on report invited up to 1 September. Some 30 submissions were received during this period. The consultation period was extended at the request of a number of organisations, which were consulting with their membership during September and October.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to advance the matter further in consultation with my Government colleagues and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a programme (details supplied), a Europe-wide programme, which pioneers research into the carbon budget and which has discovered that old forests accumulate more carbon than young plantations; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that some new forests planted on wet peaty soils will never absorb as much carbon as they release; and if this research will be factored into the way in which Ireland will comply with obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the research being conducted under the CarboEurope programme and the announcement of the initial results from the project in October.</P>
      <P>CarboEurope comprises a cluster of projects with the objective of advancing the understanding of carbon fixation mechanisms and to quantify the magnitude of the carbon sources and sinks for a range of European terrestrial ecosystems and how these may be constrained by climate variability, availability of nutrients, changing rates of nitrogen deposition and interaction with management regimes. A number of scientists involved in the Irish project CARBiFOR are also part of the CarboEurope team. Results from this programme as they become available will feed into Ireland's carbon accounting process.</P>
      <P>I would point out that results from Irish research show that the greatest annual accumulation of carbon is likely to occur during the mid stages of forest growth, when trees are growing most vigorously, typically between ages 15 to 25; certainly not when forests are old, when growth, and hence carbon sequestration, is know to fall off considerably. Work that is currently under way in the CARBiFOR project will determine these patterns more precisely. Work is also under way to determine the net effect of the afforestation of peat soils on Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forests, which are planted on soils classified as peats, comprise only a small part of forests <Col N="824" />planted since 1990. If the research that is currently under way determines that any of these forests are a net source of greenhouse gases, account will be taken of this in the carbon accounting process. Current research in Finland and Scotland indicates that over a full forest cycle most forests planted on peat soils will have a positive effect in terms of carbon sequestration and similar results are likely to be found in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The main forestry contribution to Ireland's climate change strategy will be through new forests planted since 1990. These forests will be on average, nine to ten years old by the beginning of the first commitment period of the protocol, in 2008. At that time they will be storing considerable amounts of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. The strategy anticipates, subject to afforestation levels being maintained, that they will contribute just over one million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum to Ireland's target reduction of 15.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum. Actual storage rates are likely to exceed this figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional <Col N="827" />Health Authority with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>However, I understand that all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy professionals and particularly in filling senior vacancies. My Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report therefore advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve the recommended fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade.</P>
    <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year.</P>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: the provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published April 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bacon report, I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other approaches, which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision, or an enhancement, in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has also undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including speech and <Col N="828" />language therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the over-arching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71, as amended by Regulation (EC) 2000/83, is the co-ordinating regulation covering referral of patients to another EU member state for medical treatment. This regulation requires that patients seeking to travel to another EU state for the purposes of receiving healthcare must obtain prior authorisation from their competent institution (health boards in Ireland) prior to receiving this treatment.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice has, in recent cases, ruled that EU member states are not precluded from restricting the free movement of persons for the purposes of receiving healthcare in another EU state, including the requirement to obtain prior authorisation, where such restrictions can be objectively justified. Three such objective criteria set out by the European Court of Justice are as follows: the risk of seriously undermining the financial balance of a social security system; the objective of maintaining a balanced medical and hospital service open to all; and the maintenance of treatment capacity or medical competence on national territory.</P>
      <P>A scheme of prior authorisation must however be based &ldquo;on objective, non-discretionary criteria which are known in advance, in such a way as to circumscribe the exercise of the national authorities' discretion, so that it is not used arbitrarily&rdquo;. The Department issued directions some time ago outlining the objective criteria which health boards must consider prior to referring patients abroad for treatment. All health boards and the Eastern Regional Authority apply these criteria when reviewing applications.</P>

This officer has responsibility for monitoring and quality assuring child care residential facilities in the south east region in accordance with standard 3 of the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres. In addition child care residential units operated by non-statutory organisations are inspected by the health board and units operated directly by the health board are inspected by the Social Services Inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The health board advises me that alternative care placements are used following an assessment of the needs of individual children and of the capacity of the care settings to meet these needs. In placing children in alternative care settings the health board complies with the requirements of the Child Care Regulations of 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" />The South-Eastern Health Board regional co-ordinator would be happy to meet the Deputy to discuss any concerns he might have about the placement by the health board of children in alternative care.</P>

      <P>The use of any mechanically propelled vehicle on a public road is subject to regulations, principally the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 2002 which, <i>inter alia,</i> prescribe the maximum permissible laden weights of vehicles. In the case of any individual vehicle the maximum permissible weight will be determined by a range of vehicle characteristics including number of axles, type of suspension and the vehicle's design weight. All vehicles using public roads are required to comply with the provisions of these regulations unless they are covered by a special permit under article 17 of the 1963 regulations.</P>
      <P>Article 17 makes provision for the issue of special permits by local authorities for the limited use of vehicles which do not comply with the regulations, including the weight requirements, on an exceptional basis. In issuing permits local authorities may insert any limitations, restrictions or conditions, including conditions as to weight which they consider advisable to prevent unnecessary damage to public roads or which, after consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda, they consider expedient to protect other road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Permits are issued in certain circumstances in respect of vehicles, commonly known as off-road dumpers, exceeding three metres cubed in capacity, designed and constructed primarily for use on sites of construction works for the purposes of conveying concrete, rubble, earth or other like materials and incapable by reason of their design and construction of exceeding a speed of 50 kilometres per hour. Such trucks, by <Col N="834" />their design would not comply with the provisions of the regulations referred to, and where their use on a construction site would be facilitated by limited road access they would be required, <i>inter alia,</i> to have a special permit and to comply with any conditions specified therein, by the local authority for such access.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of specific differences of opinion between local authorities and dump truck owners in relation to the issue of permits.</P>

      <P>The 1997 programme for Government included, in the context of measures to combat the drugs problem, a recommendation for the creation of a drug court system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A drug court planning committee was established in early 1999 to develop an integrated cross service strategic plan involving court supervised treatment programmes as an alternative to custodial sentences. The committee, <i>inter alia,</i> recommended the establishment of a pilot project to provide the information necessary to address their terms of reference. The committee undertook to reconvene when an evaluation of the pilot project was available to address all outstanding <Col N="836" />matters from their terms of reference and report thereon.</P>

      <Quest>the progress which has been made in implementing the NESF report on reintegration of prisoners, and specifically, recommendations 6.23 and 6.24 regarding criminal records; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>A central focus of the NESF report in question is on the barriers to reintegration and the need for targeted and coherent mechanisms to ensure that prisoners can be more effectively integrated back into the community. The report's overall conclusion is that what is required are key institutional mechanisms or models to spearhead and ensure effective follow-through on the report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Priority is being given to developing these mechanisms. A high level co-ordination group on prisoner reintegration has been established, and is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department. This group is composed of senior officials from the various Departments and statutory agencies who are identified in the report as having a role to play in progressing its implementation; and, I think this reflects the fact that, as the report makes clear, it is not only my Department but its associated agencies that will have a significant role in this regard. The group will also be drawing on the expertise of the many community and voluntary groups that have experience of dealing with the issues raised by the report. The group is currently examining the areas for action highlighted in the report and will oversee the implementation of the appropriate recommendations.</P>
      <P>The elaboration of positive sentence management, as a mechanism for effective integration and co-ordination of all services and programmes designed to meet the complex and diverse needs of offenders, is a key task for the Prisons Service. Important aspects of this task are the building of alliances and partnerships with the wider community and the development of a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of drug treatment, education, vocational training and multi-disciplinary programmes, including offender behaviour programmes. The appointment of a Director of Regimes in the Prisons Service has been an important step in this process and will provide an administrative driver for this task. It is intended to establish, in the very near future, a working group on positive sentence management within the Prisons Service comprising all the relevant agencies and bodies. This working group will be mindful of and take heed of best practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inter-agency working, the multi-disciplinary team approach and the elaboration of positive sentence management are each concepts with which my Department, the Irish Prisons Service and the probation and welfare service are already fully familiar. The Prisons Service's strategy statement 2001 to 2003, which was launched in October 2001, sets forth in some detail the strategic work programme on which the service has already embarked to dovetail these concepts into the daily workings of the service and each individual institution. Indeed many of the actions highlighted by the NESF report had previously been identified by both the Irish Prisons Service and <Col N="839" />the probation and welfare service, and work on implementing them has been progressing.</P>
    <P>The most noteworthy of these is the homeless offenders strategy team, HOST, a multi-agency accommodation directorate, which has recently been established, with the probation and welfare service as the lead agency and an assistant principal probation and welfare officer as director of the unit. The team has a national remit in relation to both offenders under probation and welfare service supervision in the community as well as those in custody and provides a focus for identifying and redressing pathways into homelessness associated with offending and imprisonment. Dublin City Council has already seconded one staff member to work on a full-time basis with the team. Since its establishment, the strategy team has set about enhancing existing contact and liaison with the voluntary and community sector, in particular with organisations concerned with the provision of accommodation and related supports and services to prisoners and ex-prisoners.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific sections in the NESF report referred to by the Deputy and the subsequent recommendations, I wish to advise the House that section 6(4) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which came into operation on 18 October 1999, provides as follows: &ldquo;The Minister shall review the operation of this Act, within 2 years of the coming into operation of this section, with a view to assessing whether there is a need to add to the discriminatory grounds set out in this section.&rdquo;  A similar provision was subsequently included in the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>As part of the review of the 1998 Act, a discussion paper was produced by my Department, and a round table conference involving the social partners, relevant Departments, the Equality Authority, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations and the Labour Court was held in September 2001.</P>
    <P>At the round table conference, some participants argued that the Employment Equality Act, 1998, should be amended to include the new ground of criminal conviction/ex-prisoner/ex-offender as well as three other new grounds: socio-economic status, including social origin or social origin as a separate ground, trade union membership and political opinion. It was acknowledged that these new grounds are complex in terms of definition and that the practical implications of the proposed new grounds would require detailed examination.</P>
    <P>It has been decided to carry out a survey of international experience of legislation in the above mentioned areas. A contract has been awarded to carry out this research. The research will be completed by the end of the year and published shortly after. The findings of this research and the information obtained through the Department's consultations in relation to the review will inform any future policy decisions.</P>
    <P>It is an overall aim of my Department to provide and maintain a secure, efficient, and pro<Col N="840" />gressive system of containment and rehabilitation for offenders. The National Economic and Social Forum report provides a timely and well-researched contribution to the development of this policy aim.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>Meath County Council which is directly responsible for the M3 project, under NRA supervision, consulted extensively with my Department's heritage division at the route selection stage of this project. The environmental impact statement for the proposed M3 motorway was formally provided to my Department on 4 March 2002 and comments were forwarded to An Bord Pleanála on 22 April 2002.</P>
      <P>With regard to nature conservation, my Department was satisfied that the route proposed would not have a significant adverse impact on any designated area. The proposed route will cross sections of the Boyne and Blackwater Rivers which are under consideration for designation to protect salmon and its habitat. My Department, recommended therefore that the construction work should be carried out in consultation with the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, and also recommended mitigation measures to minimise any environmental impacts on habitats and species.</P>
      <P>With regard to archaeology, my Department was satisfied that the route chosen was the most appropriate, in the context of the known rich archaeological heritage of this part of the country. My Department enclosed the archaeological mitigation measures proposed in the EIS, as well as recommending a number of additional measures, to include pre-development archaeological testing and assessment at various points along the proposed route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Departmental staff attend inquiries of this nature if it is considered necessary to clarify advice <Col N="843" />on the protection of the built and natural heritage. In this case, while there had been full consultation with the Department about the project and our advice was already available to the inquiry and did not require further clarification, an archaeologist from the organisation did attend the inquiry on two dates, 21 August and 11 September.</P>

      <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were published on 25 March 1999, are intended to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the development of the greater Dublin area. The guidelines were addressed to the local authorities in the greater Dublin area and to the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides that these guidelines are now deemed to be regional planning guidelines as provided for in that Act. Under the provisions of the 2000 Act, the implementation of the guidelines is primarily a matter for the two relevant regional authorities and the seven relevant planning authorities which must have regard to the guidelines when making and adopting development plans.</P>
      <P>The imminent publication of the national spatial strategy will provide a context and structure for the review of the strategic planning guidelines. I would expect that work on this review would be commenced by the regional authorities as soon as possible following the publication of the national spatial strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the increasing replacement of paper packaging with plastic in the agricultural sector, particularly in the areas of animal feed and vegetable packaging. Article 18 of Directive No. 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging that satisfies the provisions of the directive, which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in annexe II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, necessary measures are required to ensure that systems are set up to provide for the return and/or collection of used packaging, and for the reuse or recovery, including recycling, of the packaging waste collected, to assist in meeting the packaging waste recovery and recycling targets set for Ireland in Directive No. 94/62/EC. Producer responsibility initiatives already operate in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, such as Repak in the case of packaging waste and Irish Farm Film Producers Group in the case of farm plastics, for example, silage bale wrap and sheeting. In these cases producers are required to take steps to recover waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question.</P>
      <P>My Department will keep the use of plastic packaging in the agricultural and other sectors under review and will consider whether further arrangements are required to improve its collection and recovery.</P>

      <P>At present my Department is dealing with 19 complaints which have been registered by the European Commission and which, to one extent or another, involve Council Directive No. 74/442/EEC on waste. The circumstances of each case differ and in some instances a number of issues arise for consideration. These complaints concern the transposition and interpretation of Directive No. 75/442/EEC, the siting of waste facilities, the granting of and compliance with waste licences and permits, and unauthorised waste activities.</P>
      <P>The European Commission registers all complaints made to it. The registration and subsequent referral of a complaint to the member state concerned does not indicate, <i>prima facie,</i> that the complaint necessarily is well founded.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector recommended the introduction of a four year security of tenure measure and the consequential abolition, after a transitional five year period, of the right to claim, for the first time, a lease under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. The Government accepted this recommendation, as it did virtually all of the Commission's recommendations. The housing private rented sector Bill currently being drafted will provide accordingly.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Bill when enacted will be to confine the ability to claim rights under Part II of the 1980 Act to a period of five years from the commencement of the legislation. This will apply equally to successor tenants in the formerly rent controlled sector and to tenants in the uncontrolled sector. Where a tenant does not exercise such rights before the end of the five year period it is the intention that the provisions of the housing private rented sector Bill will apply.</P>

      <P>The then Government decided against implementing the central recommendation of the Kenny report, that local authorities should have power to designate and acquire land for development at existing use value plus a percentage of that value.</P>
      <P>An Oireachtas joint committee subsequently examined this matter in 1988. It concluded that there would be constitutional and practical problems in implementing the Kenny recommendations, and that the issues would be better dealt with by other means.</P>
      <P>Subsequent Governments and the legislature have sought to deal with land development issues through a range of measures, including taxation and improvement of planning mechanisms to permit greater levies on development and the application of community gain to social and affordable housing.</P>
      <P>The most effective way of dealing with house prices is to increase housing supply. This has been the thrust of our approach, in particular through the measures set out in Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Part V also seeks to obtain gain for the community from the increased land values arising from zoning through the requirement that up to 20% of residentially zoned land be made available to the local authority at existing use value rather than at market value. At present Part V is being reviewed to ensure that it is meeting its objectives in relation to the supply of social and affordable housing. I expect to announce the outcome of that review shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recycling of post-consumer plastic beverage containers and other types of plastic packaging is generally more problematic than the recycling of other packaging materials, due to the light weight to volume ratio, sorting and pre-treatment requirements, high end market specifications and associated costs involved. Accordingly, the recycling rate of plastic packaging is generally lower than that of other packaging materials.</P>
      <P>Against this background the local and regional waste management plans, which are now being implemented, provide for a significantly increased network of bring facilities to facilitate increased collection of recyclables, including plastic beverage containers. Receptacles for the deposit of such containers are already in place in a number of counties. It is envisaged that similar arrangements will be extended to all regions in the near future.</P>
      <P>The local and regional waste management plans also provide for the progressive introduction of segregated household collection of dry recyclables in urban areas. Segregated collection services, serving over 200,000 households, are already available throughout the Dublin region and also in areas of Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick, Louth, Meath, Tipperary and Waterford. The collection of plastic beverage containers under such arrangements is contingent on the availability of material recovery facilities at which dry recyclables are sorted and baled for onward delivery to reprocessing outlets. On 7 November I announced the allocation of &euro;15 million in grant assistance towards the provision of waste recovery infrastructure, as the first round of allocations under the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme announced earlier this year. This will support the development, <i>inter alia,</i> of bring banks and civic amenity sites, and the expansion of an existing material recovery facility, facilitating increased collection, and recovery of plastic beverage containers and other recyclables in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" />In addition, as was indicated in the recent policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, further initiatives to facilitate additional recovery-recycling of specific materials, such as PET beverage and other plastic containers, will be targeted with support from Repak and local authorities. The policy statement also provides for the establishment of a market development group to drive a new market development programme for recyclable materials.</P>
    <P>My Department has contact with the companies named, one of whom received capital grant aid for recycling infrastructure under the operational programme for environmental services 1994-99, and with other interested parties regarding measures to promote plastic recycling.</P>

    <P>The new part L regime is projected to reduce CO2 emissions by 300,000 tones per annum by 2012. This is the end of the period for delivery on our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. I plan to publish a draft technical guidance document proposing higher thermal performance and insulation standards for non-residential buildings, including factories, offices, and shops, in spring 2003.</P>
    <P>A proposed EU directive on energy performance of buildings, which is expected to be adopted by the end of year, provides for, <i>inter alia</i>, the mandatory energy performance certification of new and existing buildings being sold or let. My Department will co-ordinate the development of detailed proposals, in consultation with other relevant Departments and agencies, for: the introduction of legislation to give effect to the Directive by the proposed EU deadline of end 2005; and the practical implementation of the mandatory energy rating certification system no later than end 2008.</P>
    <P>Copies of the national climate change strategy and the progress report on implementation of the strategy, together with the amended part L and the related technical guidance document L, are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Government chose to omit from national anti-poverty strategy targets on youth homelessness, emergency accommodation or transitional accommodation for homeless people which were negotiated with the social partners and published in the framework document which accompanied it; and if targets will be included to end homelessness in the mainstream NAPS agenda.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24117/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen) Martin Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In developing the revised NAPS, launched in February, the Government recognised the cross-cutting nature of poverty and exclusion and set key targets in a wide number of policy areas. In relation to homelessness the key target was that, by the end of 2004, sufficient and appropriate emergency accommodation would be available to rough sleepers, in conjunction with appropriate outreach services to enable them to access it.</P>
      <P>Provisions in An Agreed Programme for Government to ensure that the comprehensive strategies on homelessness now in place are implemented and that homelessness, in particular rough sleeping, are tackled in a co-ordinated manner in all parts of the country, further underscore the Government's commitment to provide for the needs of homeless persons.</P>
      <P>The revised anti-poverty strategy acknowledged that a number of subsidiary targets, identified during the course of consultation with the social partners and outlined in the framework document, could involve significant additional costs over the period of the strategy and would have to proceed in the light of the availability of resources. While there are no proposals to incorporate further targets on homelessness in the mainstream NAPS agenda, the issue of setting realistic targets in this area is particularly important to ensure that our efforts in providing resources and services yield positive results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive data collection system is essential to set realistic targets and to monitor results. To this end the Homeless Agency is, with <Col N="855" />the support of my Department, currently piloting the LINK system with a number of service providers including those in the voluntary sector. This system tracks each person presenting as homeless to any of these service providers. It will allow a profile of people using homeless services to be built up. It is intended that the system will be extended to all services for the homeless in the Dublin area. Similar improvements to data collection and analysis on homelessness are being considered in other local authority areas where there are a significant number of homeless persons. The issue of improved data collection will also be addressed as part of the development of an integrated IT package for housing for all local authorities.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental team on homelessness is examining how best to evaluate the strategies on homelessness and the local action plans. I intend that the issue of targets will also be addressed in the context of this evaluation.</P>
    <P>The issue of youth homelessness is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I recognise the need to improve data on homelessness and in particular data on persons who may be moving into and out of homelessness and the services accessed and required by homeless persons.</P>
      <P>In Dublin the Homeless Agency, with the support of my Department, is currently piloting the LINK system with a number of service providers including the Fáiltiú day centre, Dublin Simon and Focus Ireland street outreach teams, Focus Ireland coffee shop, Cedar House, the De Paul Trust and the health board's multidisciplinary teams.</P>

      <P>The interest rate on <Col N="858" />local authority housing loans, including affordable housing loans, is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. The current variable rate to borrowers, excluding mortgage protection, is 4.3%. The current fixed interest rate available on local authority loans, excluding mortgage protection, is 5.3% for a period of five years. These rates compare favourably with the equivalent rates charged by commercial lending agencies and are adjusted in line with any movement in ECB rates.</P>
      <P>The shared ownership scheme consists of two elements, a mortgage portion which operates as a normal annuity related loan and a rental portion which is index linked in nature. The mortgage related portion would be subject to the same rates as those that apply under the affordable housing scheme while the rental portion attracts a rental charge of 4.5% to the borrower and the capital is indexed by reference to movement in the consumer price index. There is no link between the rate charges on the rental portion and the rates quoted in the European market and therefore no adjustments can be anticipated in line with ECB movements.</P>

      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta has not instigated a policy of selling off all of its properties in the Uibh Ráthach Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>The property referred to by the Deputy consists of one building subdivided into three residential units which has been in Údarás ownership for many years. The building is not suitable for its general objectives and, despite best efforts, has remained largely unoccupied over the years. This led to the decision in 1995 to sell the property which has been on the open market since.</P>
      <P>In 2001 Údarás acceded, by way of a caretaker's agreement, to a request from a local business supported by Údarás for the use of part of the premises on a temporary basis. This agreement obliged the company to deliver up possession when required to do so and did not confer any special privilege in the event of the property being sold.</P>
      <P>The property was available for sale on the open market and this fact was widely advertised in the area. An agreement has now been reached to sell the property in question to the highest bidder.</P>

      <P>The current campaign on the personal public service number is designed to promote public awareness of the number and its value as the key to accessing public services. The decision to run this campaign was taken as a result of a survey in 2001 which showed that knowledge of the PPS number among the public was very low.</P>
      <P>The PPS number replaces the RSI number and its use is part of the general drive to modernise Government services. It will provide a basis for the delivery of online public services and improved service delivery over the phone. It will also allow greater integration of services across agencies.</P>
      <P>The cost of the PPS number campaign is approximately &euro;310,000. This amount is made up as follows: television &euro;120,758, radio &euro;44,819, newspapers &euro;132,328. All these figures include VAT. The remaining amount is to cover agency costs.</P>
