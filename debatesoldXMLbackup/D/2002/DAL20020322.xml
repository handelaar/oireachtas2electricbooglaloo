      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the background to this Bill. The Government has approved in principle the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry into allegations of misconduct on the part of certain members of the Garda Síochána in Donegal. The Government also decided to have amending legislation drafted to enable the tribunal to con<Col N="2" /> duct its inquiry without prejudicing various court proceedings which have already been instituted in relation to the alleged misconduct.</P>
    <P>When dealing with parliamentary questions or motions on alleged misconduct by gardaí in Donegal, I have consistently made it clear that I was not opposed to holding a public inquiry on the issue but that there was a real concern about the danger of prejudice to criminal and civil proceedings. I mentioned this problem specifically to the House on 23 May 2001 and advised Deputies that I was seeking the advice of the Attorney General. His advice confirmed that holding such an inquiry at that time could prejudice the civil and criminal proceedings which had been instituted as a result of the alleged misconduct and that, on the basis of the information then to hand, the best course was to let the criminal and civil proceedings run their course. If matters were not fully ventilated during those proceedings, then a tribunal of inquiry could be set up.</P>
    <P>Neither the criminal nor civil proceedings advanced very quickly and there was real concern, which I shared, over the length of time it was taking to bring the various inquiries and pro<Col N="3" /> ceedings to finality. On 13 November 2001, I announced to the House that I was appointing an eminent legal person to look into the matter. Mr. Shane Murphy, senior counsel, was shortly afterwards appointed by me: to conduct an independent review and undertake a thorough examination of the action taken and of relevant papers held by the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform relevant to allegations that members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour, particularly in the context of the investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron and with regard to the finds of bomb-making equipment; to advise taking into account relevant criminal, civil and disciplinary aspects and, mindful of the public interest, whether all appropriate steps had been taken with due diligence and expedition; to advise what further measures, if any, may now be taken to bring those who have engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour to account at the earliest opportunity so as to address public concerns; and, in this regard, to submit a report to me as a matter of urgency. I received Mr. Murphy's report on 30 January 2002. While recognising the need to ensure that civil and criminal proceedings are not compromised, Mr. Murphy endorsed the view that &ldquo;a Tribunal of Inquiry represents the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve outstanding issues of fundamental public importance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will allow a tribunal of inquiry to be established to look into matters in Donegal without prejudice to criminal proceedings. I am pleased that Mr. Frederick Morris, former President of the High Court, has agreed to be the sole member of this tribunal. I will send the Government's proposed terms of reference to the Opposition spokesmen very soon and I look forward to consultations on the text of an appropriate resolution. I will try to facilitate the parties opposite by taking on board any suggestions of theirs which could help us reach as broad a consensus as possible as well as a final, satisfactory conclusion to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>A further consideration underlying this proposed legislation is that the sole member of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments asked that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts be amended to state clearly that a tribunal may be made up of more than one member and to provide expressly for a reserve member. Mr. Justice Flood suggested that this was necessary to avoid any possible challenge to the process of the tribunal. He also suggested that it should be provided that, where any of the full members of the tribunal is unable to act for any reason, the tribunal should be able to proceed to hear evidence on the basis of the remaining two members and the reserve member. This Bill responds to Mr. Justice Flood's requests.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to outline the provisions of the Bill, I refute certain criticisms which have <Col N="4" /> been made of me on the grounds that I did not consult parties opposite about its provisions. The position is that all Stages have to be taken today so that the Bill can be passed and sent to the Seanad for consideration next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>The Bill has to be enacted before the Easter recess so that this House can pass the necessary resolution pursuant to it, which will be tabled by my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to provide for the appointment of additional members and a reserve member to the Flood tribunal. The Bill has been considered and drafted carefully but with as much expedition as possible and the critics have to make up their minds whether they want us to facilitate the enlargement of the Flood tribunal at an early date so that it can proceed with its work. This is aside altogether from the fact that the Bill is necessary to establish the Donegal tribunal of inquiry. In response to contacts made with my Department on behalf of the Labour Party last week, and in view of the inevitably compressed time scale for consideration of the Bill, I decided that my Department should brief Opposition spokespersons on its contents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>However, Deputy Howlin declined this opportunity.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, I will furnish to the Opposition parties the Government's proposed terms of reference for the Donegal inquiry and I look forward with interest to their views. It will be clear from what I have said, however, that the schedule for dealing with the Bill in both Houses is the only one compatible with the passage of the necessary Dáil resolution on the Flood tribunal before the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the contents of the Bill which has two main purposes. First, it will facilitate the work of the tribunal of inquiry into the Donegal allegations by ensuring that a risk of prejudice to any pending criminal trial will not arise from the tribunal's proceedings. Second, it will provide a clear legal basis for the appointment of additional and reserve members of tribunals as requested by Mr. Justice Flood. The Bill also provides that a tribunal may appoint investigators to assist it in carrying out its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard interpretation provision. Section 2(<i>a</i>) of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 provides that a tribunal can exclude the public from its proceedings where in its opinion it is, in the public interest, expedient to do so for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given. Section 2 of the Bill before us amends this by adding a provision that a tribunal can, in particular, avail of its power to exclude the public if there is a risk of prejudice to criminal <Col N="5" /> proceedings. Thus, it elaborates on the existing power to exclude the public by making clear that one of the circumstances in which this can be done is when there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings. It should be noted that this provision applies to proceedings which are in existence at the time the tribunal is hearing the relevant evidence, not possible future proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the situation which would arise if a tribunal reports at a time when criminal proceedings are pending in respect of a matter connected with the tribunal's inquiries. This is a situation which is not adverted to at all in the tribunals of inquiry legislation as it stands. Subsection (1) provides that the person to whom the tribunal reports, for example a Minister or the Clerk of the Dáil, may apply to the High Court for directions regarding the publication of the report if he or she considers that publication might prejudice the criminal proceedings. Subsection (2) provides that, before determining the application, the court may hear the Attorney General &ndash; whose duties include representing the public interest before courts and tribunals &ndash; the Director of Public Prosecutions and the defendants in the criminal proceedings. Subsection (3) provides that the court may direct that the report or any part of it be not published for a specified period of time or until the court so directs. Subsection (4) provides that the court may, if it considers it appropriate, hear an application under this section otherwise than in public. There would be little point in having a provision to facilitate non-publication of a report because of the risk of prejudice to a criminal trial if the contents of the report were disclosed during the very proceedings the purpose of which is to determine whether publication should take place.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with membership of tribunals and inserts six new subsections in section 2 of the Act of 1979. The new subsection (3) provides for the appointment of additional members to tribunals at any time after the tribunal is appointed. The existing section 2(1) of the 1979 Act already provides for the appointment of more than one member when the tribunal is initially established in that it states that a tribunal may consist of one or more than one person. The new subsection (4) provides that, subject to section 6 of the 1979 Act, a decision or determination of a tribunal may be that of a majority of its members and, in the case of an equal division, the chairperson shall decide. The phrase &ldquo;may be that of a majority of its members&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;shall be . . .&rdquo; is to take account of the possibility that decisions and determinations may be unanimous. The phrase &ldquo;Subject to section 6 . . .&rdquo; means that decisions on the award of costs are to continue to be made by the chairperson if the tribunal consists of more than one member, as provided for by that section.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the appointment of a member to replace the chairperson if he or she is unable to continue to act. It also envisages the situation in which the chairperson may step down <Col N="6" /> from the chair but continue as an ordinary member. Subsection (6) provides that the appointment of additional members under subsection (3) and the designation of a new chairperson under subsection (5) shall be done by way of an amendment of the instrument by which the tribunal was appointed in accordance with section 1A of the 1921 Act, which was inserted by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1998, except that consent of the tribunal to the identity of appointees will not be required.</P>
    <P>I will explain this in a little more detail. The 1998 (No. 2) Act provides for the amendment of the instrument establishing a tribunal in two situations, first where the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment following consultation between it and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister in question and second where the tribunal has itself requested the amendment. This provision was, essentially, intended to deal with changes in terms of reference, that is the matters which the tribunal is to investigate. The two circumstances mentioned in the Act arose in relation to the Flood Tribunal and gave rise to this provision, as Deputies will recall. However, while it is appropriate to require the consent of the tribunal to the appointment of additional members and to a change in the list of matters it is to investigate, it would be wrong to require its consent to the identity of the new members or new chairperson.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, subsection (6) provides a procedure for the appointment of new members or a new chairperson by way of a modification of what is provided for in the 1998 (No. 2) Act for the amendment of instruments generally. Most important from the point of view of this House is that the amendment of any instrument shall be made pursuant to a resolution of both Houses, so the Dáil and Seanad will have the opportunity to debate the changes proposed for the tribunal. Subsection (7) provides that a member of a tribunal who is unable to act shall be deemed not to be a member for the period of that inability. With reference to subsection (8), one of the points made by Mr. Justice Flood was that it should be provided that, where any of the full members of the tribunal is unable to act for any reason, the tribunal should be able to proceed to hear evidence on the basis of the remaining members and reserve member. Subsection (8) is relevant to this proposal in that it provides that a tribunal may continue to act, notwithstanding one or more vacancies, if it is satisfied that the legal rights of any person affected would not be unduly prejudiced. An example of where a tribunal might consider that it should not continue to act because the legal rights of a person would be unduly prejudiced would arise if the original tribunal member has left the tribunal and that person was the sole member when particular evidence was heard, while the additional member(s) were not members or reserve members at that time. The tribunal might, in those circumstances, conclude that it would unduly prejudice a per<Col N="7" /> son's legal rights were it to make findings on evidence it did not hear and to which it has access, perhaps, only in the form of transcripts. On the other hand, the tribunal might consider that it would not unduly prejudice a person's rights if it made findings in a situation in which a member was not acting as such for a brief period. It will be a matter for the tribunal to decide.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with reserve members. Subsection (1) provides for the appointment of reserve members by the instrument establishing the tribunal or an instrument amending that instrument. So, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will, assuming the appropriate resolutions are passed by both Houses, make an instrument appointing a reserve member to the Flood Tribunal and, similarly, one or more reserve members can be appointed by the instrument setting up any future tribunal on any subject. Subsection (2) sets out the role of a reserve member. He or she may sit with the tribunal during its proceedings, consider oral evidence, examine documents that are produced or sent in evidence and be present at deliberations of the tribunal. However, he or she may not otherwise participate in the proceedings or deliberations and may not seek to influence the tribunal in its decisions or deliberations. The principle on which this provision is based is that the reserve member, though not a member of the tribunal, will be fully <i>au fait </i>with its work and will be in a position to replace a full member if that becomes necessary. This model for the role of the reserve member is taken exactly &ndash; except for drafting changes &ndash; from that set out in resolutions of the Dáil and Seanad, passed on 5 July last, in relation to the appointment of a reserve member to the Flood Tribunal at a stage when it was proposed to proceed with the appointment of such a member on the basis of the legislation as it stands. Subsection (3) provides for the appointment of a reserve member to be a full member, if a full member is for any reason unable to continue to act as such.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) &ndash; again in line with the Dáil and Seanad resolutions of last July &ndash; provides that the appointment of a reserve member as a full member may be deemed to be operative from a prior date. This shall not be earlier than the date on which he or she became a reserve member. This provision can be best understood in the context of a tribunal whose work can be divided into two or more modules. The reserve member might be appointed as such during the hearing of evidence part way through the first module and, in the course of the second module, it might be necessary to appoint him or her to be a full member. In that case, it would be appropriate to backdate the appointment as a full member to the beginning of the second module. The appointee would be regarded as a full member for the whole of the second module but it would not be necessary or appropriate to deem him or her to have been a full member during the whole or part of the first module since that might already have <Col N="8" /> been the subject of findings and a report by the tribunal as it was then constituted.</P>
    <P>Where the appointment as a full member is backdated, subsection (5) provides that this shall not affect decisions or determinations made before the actual appointment. Were it otherwise, a situation could arise in which a decision of the tribunal, validly taken by a majority at the time, might be later regarded as invalid because it would not be the decision of the majority when the new member's appointment is backdated. As I have already outlined, section 4 provides that a decision of a tribunal consisting of more than one member is to be that of a majority. The final paragraph of section 5, subsection (6), provides that the appointment of a reserve member to an existing tribunal, or of a reserve member to be a full member of a tribunal, shall be by the same procedure as I outlined earlier in relation to the appointment of additional members and of a new chairperson. That is, the instrument appointing the tribunal will be appropriately amended pursuant to resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 6, on investigators, is designed to remedy a defect in the existing legislation in relation to the power to compel a person to co-operate in a tribunal's preliminary investigation. It is well recognised in the case law that has built up over the past decade or so in relation to tribunals of inquiry that the work of such tribunals involves a number of stages, namely, a preliminary investigation of the evidence available; the determination of what is considered to be relevant; the service of such evidence on the persons likely to be affected by it; the public hearing of witnesses in regard to such evidence and the cross-examination of witnesses by or on behalf of the persons affected by their evidence; and, the preparation of a report and the making of recommendations based on the facts established at the public hearings. In 1999, the Supreme Court held in the case of Lawlor <i>v.</i> Flood, 1999 3 IR, that the principal powers of a tribunal under the legislation were to enforce the attendance of witnesses, to provide for their examination before the tribunal and to compel the production of documents and that the examination of witnesses, particularly those who were not willing to co-operate during the initial stages, was not a matter which, in the absence of express statutory authority, could be delegated by a tribunal to any other person or body. In other words, while a person can be compelled to attend before a tribunal itself to answer questions, she or he cannot be compelled to answer questions of the tribunal's legal team in the course of the preliminary investigation. Section 6 deals with this by providing for the appointment of investigators and for their duties and powers.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (1), a tribunal may appoint investigators with the approval of the Minister who appointed the tribunal and the consent of the Minister for Finance or the approval of the Government if the Government appointed the tribunal. Subsection (2) provides that the <Col N="9" /> appointment of investigators shall be for such term and subject to such terms and conditions as the tribunal may determine with the approval of the relevant Minister or the Government, as the case may be. Subsection (3) specifies what the role of investigators is to be. This is to assist the tribunal in the performance of its functions by carrying out preliminary investigations into matters relevant to the inquiry. In doing this, they are subject to the direction and control of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that investigators will have power to require persons to give information, produce documents and answer questions and it imposes a duty on persons to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, under subsection (5), a person's answers may be reduced to writing and the investigator may require the person to sign the document. There are a number of precedents of this type of provision, one example being section 10 of the Companies Act, 1990 in relation to company inspectors.</P>
    <P>The most notable characteristic of the powers being given to investigators is that they parallel the powers of the tribunal itself, except that they will be used at the preliminary investigation stage. Accordingly, I do not propose that the investigators should examine persons on oath &ndash; that is for the tribunal itself if it decides that the answers given by a person to the investigator merit the calling of that person to give evidence at a public hearing of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides that if a person refuses to comply with the requirement of an investigator, the latter may, with the consent of the tribunal, apply to the High Court which may order the person to comply with the requirement, thus making further non-compliance a contempt of court. This method of enforcement of the investigator's requirements is essentially the same as that provided for in relation to tribunals in section 4 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (7), a person who is required by an investigator to give information, produce documents or answer questions shall be entitled to the same privileges and immunities as a witness before the High Court. For example, such a person, if sued for defamation as a result of what he or she says to an investigator or what is in a document produced to an investigator, would have the same privilege as if they had given this evidence or produced the document as part of High Court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) protects the confidentiality of information obtained by investigators subject to the overall control of the tribunal. It will frequently be the case that the preliminary investigation discloses material that is of no further interest to the tribunal, perhaps because it falls outside its terms of reference. The confidentiality of this material must be respected and subsection (8) so provides. Subsection (9) provides that an investigator shall be furnished with a warrant as <Col N="10" /> evidence of his of her authority to exercise the very significant powers of the office.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes it a summary offence for a person not to comply with the requirement of an investigator or to obstruct or hinder him or her. The penalty for such an offence will be a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 and-or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months. The point to note in relation to this section is that we are not providing for trial on indictment which is provided for in the 1979 Act for broadly similar offences in respect of a tribunal. I believe that section 7 and the power to seek a High Court order under section 6(6) represent adequate and proportionate enforcement mechanisms to ensure that investigators will be fully effective in carrying out their functions on behalf of tribunals.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that a statement or admission made to an investigator cannot be used as evidence against the person making it in any criminal proceedings. This again parallels section 5 of the 1979 Act which deals with tribunals themselves and, as such, it is also necessary in respect of investigators.</P>
    <P>Section 9 increases the maximum fines for offences relating to non-co-operation with or obstruction of a tribunal from £500 to &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and from £10,000 to &euro;300,000 in the case of conviction on indictment. I note that Deputy Shatter has a Bill on the Order Paper which contains provisions which are not dissimilar to these. The fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction is the maximum appropriate amount according to the advice of the Office of the Attorney General. The increase in the maximum fine on conviction on indictment is over 20-fold and, even allowing for the length of time since the maximum was set in 1979, is by any standards a very significant increase which will show how seriously this House regards the offences to which the penalty applies. This section applies in respect of offences committed after the passing of the Act, irrespective of whether the tribunal concerned was appointed before or after such passing.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the application of the Act which, with the exception of sections 4, 5 and 9, shall apply to tribunals established after its passing. That is to say that the provisions on membership of tribunals, reserve members and increased fines will apply to existing tribunals while the sections on the exclusion of the public and publication of reports where this might prejudice criminal proceedings shall apply to future tribunals. It is not considered necessary to apply these provisions to the existing tribunals which have been functioning satisfactorily under the present law on these aspects. The provisions on investigators are expressed by section 10(3) not to apply to existing tribunals unless such application is provided for by an amendment to the instrument appointing the tribunal. In other words, existing tribunals could use investigators provided their instrument of appointment is amended appropriately under the procedure in <Col N="11" /> the 1998 (No. 2) Act which, of course, involves prior resolutions of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is a standard provision stating that any expenses incurred by Ministers in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 12 is a standard provision dealing with the short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>This measure achieves a number of important objectives in that; it will ensure that the tribunal of inquiry in relation to the Donegal allegations can function properly having regard to the existence of criminal proceedings; it provides the legal base for the planned enlargement of the Flood tribunal; and the benefits of the provisions in respect of both these objectives and of the provisions on investigators will be available generally to tribunals in the future. Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds will be taking the last five minutes of my time. It is an extraordinarily appropriate epitaph to the term of office of the Government that in the dying days of the Administration, in what is likely to be the second last week of this House sitting before the general election, we are dealing yet again with tribunals of inquiry.</P>
      <P>When it comes to be written in the future, the story of the Government will be one of sleaze, corruption, and gross incompetence. It will be the story of a Government which had to be bludgeoned into acknowledging the need to address issues of major public concern. It is particularly appropriate that we have the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 2002, before us. There have been more motions before the Houses of the Oireachtas relating to the establishment of tribunals of inquiry, the amendment of their terms of reference and provision for new statutory mechanisms concerning tribunals of inquiry, during the lifetime of the Government than ever before in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary reason we now have a plethora of inquiries in place at a cost of millions of pounds to taxpayers is due to the corruption endemic in the Fianna Fáil Party over a number of years and the Taoiseach's failure to even notice obvious difficulties in the context of ministerial appointments. He refused to publicly pursue serious issues raised in regard to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke, who was forced to resign. There is a whole series of other issues relating to Fianna Fáil Members of the House. One particular Fianna Fáil Member, who now adopts the Independent designation while regularly supporting the Government on votes, is Deputy Lawlor. Deputy Lawlor has single handedly ensured the tribunal of inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice Flood is prolonged and frustrated in reaching conclusions on issues of public concern. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of additional public money <Col N="12" /> is being spent trying to get to the truth of issues to which he is central.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us should not be rushed through the House. It originates for a number of reasons. In June of last year Mr. Justice Flood stated the need for additional members to be appointed to the tribunal of inquiry and it has taken until today for the Government to bring forward the legislation required to meet that need. In the context of Garda misconduct in Donegal, Members on the Opposition side have been calling for an inquiry for over three years to address issues of major public concern in an appropriate forum which can provide answers. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is guiding this legislation through the House today, resolutely opposed an inquiry and stood in the way of addressing these enormously serious issues, which cast a shadow over the Garda, in a reasonable period of time to avoid serious damage being done to the Garda's public credibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>That was damaging to the morale of the overwhelming majority of the force who go decently about their work on a daily basis, placing their lives at risk for the sake of the community and the security of the State. They found themselves under clouds of suspicion which was unfair to them. The Minister allowed the Donegal issues to continue to fester for a period that went way beyond what ministerial caution could provide an excuse for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this tribunal of inquiry legislation, I am very conscious of not saying anything that might prejudice criminal proceedings which are before our courts this week. Suffice it to say, the evidence derived from a criminal case currently before our courts, as reported in the daily newspapers, clearly illustrates the folly of this Minister in failing to come to terms with the seriousness of allegations being made about Garda misbehaviour in the Donegal area. If even a portion of what is being said in court turns out to be true, it is the greatest scandal in the history of the State relating to the Garda Síochána. The second greatest scandal is that we have had a Minister who has been paralysed by indecision for over three years and was incapable of addressing the issues that arose. The issues and concerns arose in the first year of this Minister's term of office, but out of charity to him I criticise him for not doing anything in only his last three years in office. In the context of the confused messages he was probably getting about this issues from the different areas from which messages come  &ndash; the Garda Síochána or from within his Department &ndash; I understand that it may have been difficult, initially, for him to unravel the truth of the matter. However, after being in office for 12 to 18 <Col N="13" /> months the conflicting messages he was getting and the oddity of some of what was happening behind the scenes should have led him straight to the only possible conclusion, that the legislation before the House today to facilitate partially addressing these issues should have been brought forward three years ago.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister has dealt with this issue in the last three years is indefensible and if he says that he dealt with it in this way because of advice received from the Attorney General, then the Attorney General has serious questions to answer to this House. He has serious questions to answer as to why, only after the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought advice from outside counsel, he suddenly changed his mind and there was movement. What went wrong with the advice the Minister received from the Office of the Attorney General which led to years of paralysis? Why is this issue only being addressed now? In November last a motion was presented to this House on an all-party Opposition basis by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party, calling for the establishment of a tribunal to investigate allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal. Why did the Minister oppose it vehemently then, when he now acknowledges the need to address the issues? There is little doubt that if that motion had not been debated, with the consequent massive public criticism levelled at the Minister, we would not have seen this legislation today and there would have been no question of an inquiry into what happened in Donegal. We would be watching aghast the television news bulletins this week and reading in the daily newspapers reports of what is happening in the criminal trial that I have to be careful not to refer to in any detail.</P>

      <P>The evidence in relation to it will clearly be of direct relevance to any new tribunal that is put in place. It illustrates starkly the enormous extent of the problem this Minister has sat on for an unconscionable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet again in this Chamber we are doing our business in a manner that is not in the public interest. This Bill was published on Wednesday this week. It is complex, technical legislation with profound implications, not only for any tribunal established to investigate the issues that arise in Donegal, but for existing tribunals or others that may be established. In the context of an area that has given rise to so much public difficulty and in the context of tribunals investigating unprecedented private corruption and public scandal, we should not be taking All Stages today. At the very least, only Second Stage should have been taken, with the remaining Stages taken some time next week after everyone has had an opportunity to reflect on today's debate. A plethora of court cases have been brought by those required to come before the Moriarty and Flood tribunals to give evidence of the wheeling and dealing they <Col N="14" /> engaged in over many years. Through the courts, they have resisted tooth and nail being called to account and I predict that this legislation is going to give birth to a further plethora of legal challenges when existing or new tribunals seek to rely on the powers it confers.</P>
    <P>From my study of the Bill in the brief period it has been available to me, it is clear that there are substantial anomalies and defects in it. There is not going to be a serious Committee or Report Stage today. There will be a cosmetic exercise and should the Opposition table a whole series of amendments, those amendments will be given short shrift. We might get to discuss one amendment before a guillotine is brought down. In the small number of amendments I will table on Committee Stage I have tried to highlight some of the real problems in the legislation, but this is not the way to deal with a serious issue.</P>
    <P>In the context of Mr. Justice Flood seeking new legislation since last June, serious questions must be raised as to why this legislation is being pushed through the House in one day, one week before the Easter vacation and in what is likely to be the second last week of the sittings of this Dáil before a general election is called. The only reason this legislation is before us today is so the Minister will be able to say, when the election is called, that he did something about the issue, even if what he did was incompetent and badly thought out. However, the issue is far too serious to treat it in that manner. In the experience of this House, rushed legislation is always defective and bad and, in remedying one problem, may create a myriad of additional problems that the Minister of the day has not anticipated.</P>
    <P>I will refer to some aspects of the Bill about which I have great unease and serious reservations. This measure allows a tribunal of inquiry in new circumstances to sit in private. The circumstances detailed in section 2 apply where there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings. One of the reasons the Minister gave in the past for not investigating the issues in Donegal was the fear of prejudicing criminal proceedings. Interestingly, that defence, used by the Minister for two and a half years, was used at a time when no criminal proceedings had been brought against anybody. Even more interestingly, the Minister tells us this Bill is only designed to address criminal proceedings in being, not criminal proceedings anticipated.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill is not sufficiently explicit in the way it deals with that issue. While there is a need to ensure that criminal proceedings are not prejudiced, there is also a substantial need, where there are allegations of corruption or public scandal, to ensure those allegations are addressed in public, that persons give evidence in public, that their evidence can be read by others who may know of those events but who may not, at the time a tribunal is sitting, have considered giving evidence to a tribunal, that the glare of publicity is available to ensure people are accountable for the evidence they give and that <Col N="15" /> their evidence, if it can be challenged for truthfulness, is appropriately challenged. How many witnesses now offering to give evidence to the Moriarty and Flood tribunals are doing so only as a consequence of reading in their daily newspapers evidence given by previous witnesses and knowing it to be untrue? How much additional information has been given to both tribunals as a consequence of the glare of publicity for evidence heard in public? I believe only a portion of what is currently available to both tribunals would have been furnished if the tribunals had been sitting in secret.</P>
    <P>I have a particular concern about this procedure. It may be that it is the lesser of two evils. In the context of the issues arising in Donegal, it might be the only way to come to terms with the matter. However, the major criticism of the Minister is that a tribunal could have been put in place three years ago, in respect of which this difficulty would not have arisen in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained that neither of the main Opposition spokespeople, myself and Deputy Howlin, have yet been consulted about the terms of reference to be given to this new tribunal or on the motion he will bring before the House. Will the Minister clarify if that motion will be brought before the House next week or will it be left until after the next election? Given that the Bill is being dealt with in the House today, those consultations should have taken place by now. There should have been agreement by now on all sides of the House as to what the terms of reference should be to deal with allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal.</P>
    <P>In the weeks that have passed since the November debate in the House, I, like other Members, have been the recipient of allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal in cases that have no direct connection to the McBrearty family or the other cases that were referred to by various Deputies last November. If there are serious allegations of Garda misconduct which relate to the manner in which the gardaí conducted themselves in the Donegal area, it is important that the terms of reference are wide enough to enable the new tribunal to properly address the serious bona fide issues that arise.</P>
    <P>I have huge reservations about section 3 of the Bill and I have already detailed my reservations about section 2. Section 3 is extraordinary. It creates the possibility that a tribunal of inquiry could have completed its work over a one to three year period and its report could then be suppressed for years. It could be a decade before it is published because of the possibility that criminal trials may be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1) refers to where a person &ldquo;considers that the publication of the report might prejudice any criminal proceedings&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;might&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;would&rdquo; is used. The same phrase is used in subsection (3), which provides that &ldquo;the Court may, if it considers that the publication of the report concerned might prejudice <Col N="16" /> any criminal proceedings, direct that the report or a specified part of it be not published&rdquo; for a specified period or until the court otherwise directs. Whatever about taking evidence in private to avoid prejudicing criminal proceedings in being, when a tribunal of inquiry has completed its work, its report should be published. It should not be published in part, because a portion of it is censored, or suppressed in total for an unspecified period at the discretion of a court. That is not in the public interest or in the interest of any person who might be called before such a tribunal to give evidence in public or in private. Where there is an allegation of misconduct, corruption or scandal which impacts on the public good or directly affects individuals in their health and welfare, the complete report should be published. There should not be any discretion with regard to any aspect of that.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Minister wants to confer a discretion on the courts, he should provide, at a minimum, that for a court to decide that a report should not be published, the court should be required to conclude that its publication &ldquo;would&rdquo; prejudice criminal proceedings, not &ldquo;might&rdquo; prejudice them. The court would have to form a specific view in that regard. The legislation is seriously defective in that context and will give rise to substantial public unease when its full import is understood. It could create a situation where the issues arising in Donegal are the subject of a tribunal of inquiry that might complete its work in 18 months but whose report might not be published for up to five years. That is not in the public interest or in the interest of the Garda Síochána and it is grossly unfair to those people who allege they have been the subject of Garda misconduct and whose lives have been seriously and fundamentally impacted by such alleged misconduct.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is interesting. It makes provision for investigators to be attached to a tribunal. That may not be a particularly complex issue if the investigators are investigating financial matters and what the tribunal requires, in effect, are accountants or financial analysts to go through papers. It may not be an unduly complex matter in the context of the conduct in which existing tribunals have engaged, where they have sought, through their legal teams, to take evidence or obtain information in private before sitting in public. I acknowledge that this section would get over the difficulty raised as a consequence of the Lawlor <i>v</i>. Flood court case in which, first, Deputy Lawlor objected to being asked to give evidence in private to the Flood tribunal and the courts held he could not be required to do so, and he was compelled to give it in public. Of course he later complained he had to give it in public and said he should be allowed to give it in private, but that was just an indication of the extent to which he played ducks and drakes with the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In other areas, however, this is an ill-conceived and badly drafted section. Does it mean a tribunal can recruit its own private police force to <Col N="17" /> conduct investigations if it wishes to do so? It may well be, in the context of the Donegal issues, that a private investigation of some description may be required during which some allegations may be made. Can a tribunal ask that members of an outside police force be temporarily attached to it to conduct investigations?</P>
    <P>What is the breadth of the investigations which can be conducted under this section? If a tribunal is appointed to investigate issues of public importance and if the tribunal determines that to do so it requires the appointment of investigators, why should the Government of the day be able to veto such appointment? If the tribunal judges it is in the public interest, why should the appointment of investigators require the approval of the Government or the approval of a Minister, and what will be the position if a tribunal says, &ldquo;We want investigators appointed&rdquo;, and the Government says, &ldquo;No&rdquo;? What would be the position if the tribunal requires a particular level of resources for investigators and the Government refuses to provide the full resources required? What would be the position if a tribunal is actually investigating alleged misconduct on the part of an existing or former Minister of the party which is in Government? Have any of these issues been thought out or addressed, and what answer does the Minister have as to how this House can deal with them?</P>
    <P>In the context of a tribunal of inquiry into matters relating to the Garda Síochána, if this new tribunal seeks to appoint new investigators from an outside police force or otherwise to investigate, how is that reconcilable with existing provisions in the Garda Síochána legislation? The very first thing I would anticipate is an Abbeylara-style court challenge to members of the Garda Síochána being investigated and questioned by investigators appointed to assist a tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an issue of huge importance and this section, as drafted, does not in any way adequately address it. I would predict that if this section is invoked in the context of the Donegal issue, we will find court challenges by some of those members of the Garda Síochána who are asked to give evidence to the tribunal delaying its work.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a far more comprehensive section setting out how investigators are to work, the extent of the work they can do, and how, in the context of a tribunal investigating matters relating to the Garda Síochána, these powers interact and apply with other provisions contained in the Garda Síochána legislation.</P>
      <P>Sir, I am conscious of my time and I want to let Deputy Reynolds in, but I just want to make one further point and will come back to other issues later on today.</P>

      <P>The penalty the Minister provides for non-compliance or failing to co-operate with investigators in section 7(3) is a fine of &euro;3,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. There are plenty of people who are reluctant to co-operate with investigators in relation to tribunals who would be quite willing to take these risks. The penalty is not sufficiently serious. There should be the possibility of a charge on indictment, certainly in the context of the person who, having been fined a first time, continues to refuse to co-operate with investigators. That issue is not adequately addressed in the Bill either.</P>
      <P>The fact, Sir, that I now must conclude what will probably be the lengthiest contribution I have an opportunity to make on a Bill of this seriousness, is an indictment of this House and the manner in which we are dealing with these issues. Between now and Committee Stage, which is due to commence in about an hour, I hope the Minister might reflect on some of the points I have made and that there might be some possibility of some amendment being made to this Bill other than the two technical amendments he has tabled. However, I very much doubt if that will occur and I have grave concerns that this Bill will simply give rise to a plethora of additional litigation and court challenges and will not adequately address the very serious issues which need to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>In that case, I will omit part of my speech. My concern has to do with what will be the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into the investigation of Garda misconduct in Donegal. I have been given a file by a family of a person facing trial for murder in which key elements of the Book of Evidence are refuted and in which allegations are made of misconduct by the gardaí. Other allegations include that gardaí investigating the murder tampered with crucial evidence and also question the accuracy of statements taken by the gardaí in the course of the murder investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The file raises serious allegations and contains serious concerns of the family of the individual who is facing trial for murder. I do not want to pre-judge or prejudice any forthcoming murder trial, but I am concerned that the terms of reference of the tribunal will not be broad enough to deal with the allegations made against members of the Garda who were involved at any time in the investigation of the McBrearty case or related cases but who now are not necessarily still members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal Garda district but have been transferred to other areas. The terms of reference of the tribunal would need to be broadened to allow for the investigation of gardaí who have been involved in <Col N="19" /> the McBrearty case and who are not necessarily based in the Donegal Garda district. If there are concerns over other investigations, particularly murder investigations, in which these gardaí have been involved, such investigations should also come under the terms of reference of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>When drawing up the terms of reference, I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to take those issues into consideration because some of the information I received gives me cause for great concern. I do not want to be in the position of bashing the Garda Síochána, but if confidence is to be restored in the Garda, the terms of reference are broad enough to allow investigations of this type go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed feelings as I rise to address this legislation. I suppose there is a sense of satisfaction that at long last the day has dawned when this issue, which has been forcibly and compellingly brought to the Minister's attention for years by this side of the House, is finally, if appallingly belatedly, being addressed. However, that sense of satisfaction is tempered by the mechanism being employed by the Minister in addressing this.</P>
      <P>The way in which this issue was dealt with characterises, in the best possible way, this Minister, his approach to justice issues and his handling of his portfolio for five years. No matter what he says to the contrary, I have heard him trying to rewrite history, not for the first time. I could quote chapter and verse his other historic revisions, but he is now saying he never set his face against a tribunal of inquiry. He voted it down and argued against it repeatedly for years on end when questions were put, when Adjournment debates were tabled and, finally, when the entire Opposition put their names to a motion demanding action and an inquiry. He set his face against it. He had the brass neck to go further and state, as reported in column 598 of the Official Report of 20 November 2001, that he was gravely suspicious of its motivation and the motivation of the people in this House. How dare he. However, his tone now suggests that he was never against it, but that it was difficult. At the time, he said there were two compelling difficulties. That was the latest in his list of excuses. He said his opposition was based on the fact that it might prejudice the right of individuals to a fair trial. He has come up with a formula now, it was impossible to come up with a formula then.</P>
      <P>I quoted at that time, in respect of that argument, the view that a tribunal of inquiry might prejudice a fair trial. I quoted at the time the judgment of the Chief Justice in the case of Moriarty <i>v</i>. Haughey. The Chief Justice of Ireland approved the words of Lord Justice Salmon as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, exceptional cases in which such procedures must be used to preserve the purity and integrity of our public life <Col N="20" /> without which a successful democracy is impossible.</P>
    <P>The second argument at the time was that it would impede civil cases. Again, I quoted the case of the Supreme Court judgment by Mr. Justice Costello in Goodman International and Hamilton. Mr. Justice Costello said there is nothing in the Constitution which prohibits the two Houses of the Oireachtas from directing that a tribunal of inquiry be established to inquire into allegations of matters the subject of current civil proceedings. He said such an inquiry does not infringe on the principle of the separation of powers and that the Minister may validly act on such a direction, and the tribunal may validly inquire into such allegations. It could not be plainer.</P>
    <P>The reason we have not had this matter addressed for three years is that the Minister is incompetent, caught like a rabbit in the search lights of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and incapable of action. He was full of bombast on this side of the House for years. His record has been one of tinkering with the law and posturing in a macho way by claiming he would increase sentences and build more jails. That, when it all boils down, is the sum total of his legacy.</P>
    <P>No structural reform and no courage or bravery to change the structure and accountability of An Garda Síochána have been exhibited. Despite resisting for years appointing an accountable police ombudsman, he has promised again in his dying days new legislation which he knows he will never introduce because he cannot wait for the opportunity to shake the dust of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from his feet. He cannot get out of there quickly enough. We know it and the world knows it. The Minister's legacy, meagre and all as it is, will be further impacted upon by future tribunals of inquiry and future analyses which will bring his inaction and obstruction to public attention.</P>
    <P>This Bill was produced on a Wednesday. The Minister promised faithfully in this House that there would be cross-party discussion on the terms of reference and its mechanisms, like all tribunals of inquiry, which are instruments of the House. On Tuesday, my office was notified that a briefing was available, not consultation as promised by the Taoiseach in this House or consultation as promised by the Minister. I was not going to give any shred of respectability to the Minister's reneging on his promises and commitments to the House by having somebody read a Bill to me. I think I am long enough in the House to be able to read legislation without having somebody read it for me. What I wanted and expected was consultation where real inputs could be made into the shape of the legislation. The official who spoke to my representative could not have been more blunt. The Government had decided on the nature of the Bill. We could look at the contents of it, but our opinions of it mattered not a damn. For good measure, it <Col N="21" /> was to be rushed through the House on a Friday morning in a matter of three hours.</P>
    <P>This is complex and important legislation. Of all the issues that have riveted public opinion and this House over the years, that concerning the establishment and conduct of tribunals of inquiry and the legal framework within which they operate must be one of the most compelling. One would imagine that a Minister would want to take some modicum of care and time to allow proper scrutiny and analysis by the Members of this House on all sides and a proper timeframe during which outside scrutiny and advice could be obtained. One would expect a Minister to allow sufficient time for Committee Stage to see if we could improve the Bill. This is not normal Government legislation, it pertains to the structure of the House, because a tribunal of inquiry is an instrument of Parliament making inquiries in the name of the public.</P>
    <P>It is not the Minister's instrument &ndash; it is the instrument of Parliament and the Oireachtas to look into matters of public importance. What have we got? The Bill was published on a Wednesday and rushed through on a Friday. A few amendments landed on our desks this morning. I did not even get them until I arrived in the House. They are technical amendments. This Bill is cobbled together such that the Minister, who published it on a Wednesday, has tabled his own amendments to it by Friday. I never heard tell of it. He reneged on his commitment to this House to consult. I was told belatedly that we would consult on the terms of reference. I expect that, but the terms of reference are predicated on the law so the shape of the terms of reference are determined by the Bill. I hope we are allowed look at the terms of reference and even have an input into them &ndash; I have, at least, another promise to this effect, although the worth of the current Minister's promises is a matter of debate. The legislation on which the terms of reference will be built lawfully is decided already and the views of the Opposition are neither sought, required nor welcome. It is shameful but it is part of the way this issue has been dealt with from the beginning. The Bill deals with a number of issues because it deals with tribunals in the round, and I will speak about a broader range of issues than the McBrearty case. However, it is the McBrearty issue which has brought this matter to a head.</P>
    <P>When will we have the terms of reference? Is it intended that they will be brought before the House before the end of next week? We already have a full schedule for next week. Is it the Minister's intention that the terms of reference will be brought before the House before the conclusion of the Dáil? What level of consultation will there be? Will meaningful inputs be made or will there merely be another charade?</P>
    <P>Garda accountability is critical to any democracy. We have argued this trenchantly from this side of the House and a long list of issues have caused concern. I have just been informed that Paul Ward won his appeal against his conviction <Col N="22" /> for the murder of Veronica Guerin in the Court of Criminal Appeal this morning. These matters and the conduct of these inquiries must be of importance to the Minister if there is to be any confidence in the administration of justice. The facts of the Paul Ward case are well known. They are part of a pattern of issues which the Minister has refused to address.</P>
    <P>The substantive investigation into the situation in Donegal was only one of the matters we asked the Minister to examine. Deputy Jim Higgins and I went to see the Minister in the summer of 2000 and on foot of information Deputy Higgins and I gave to the Minister an investigation was established. I hold in my hand my statement to the senior members of the Garda Síochána who called to my house in Wexford to take a statement from me. They were assistant commissioner Fachtna Murphy and detective superintendent Pat Breheny. I have heard nothing more.</P>

      <P>I gave the statement on 4 July 2000. In his speech to the House last November the Minister referred to ongoing investigations, but these investigations disappear into the ether. Does the Minister understand that the establishment of an investigation does not mean the job is done? There was an investigation by a senior Garda officer into the Dean Lyons case. Where is the result? The Minister has to understand what transparency and accountability mean in a democracy. Appointing someone to examine an issue is not the end of the matter. That is not accountability.</P>
      <P>I share many of the views expressed by Deputy Shatter. This Bill deserves careful analysis. It is important to the functioning of our democracy because tribunals of inquiry have, unfortunately, become an important instrument of public policy and of finding truths which cannot, apparently, be uncovered by any other means. We know from bitter experience that lawyers representing those who do not wish to facilitate early disclosure will ensure every loophole is explored. In legislation of this kind it is doubly important to get it right technically, because we know that every sentence will be parsed and analysed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said the Flood tribunal request as well as the McBreary affair has brought the Bill to the House. It is numbing to hear this. The McBrearty affair has continued for years and the request from Mr. Justice Flood was made in June 2001. Why are we dealing with the response to his request in three hours on a Friday morning in the second last week of this Dáil? What has been happening since June 2001 to prevent the matter being dealt with until now? Why is the Minister dealing with the matter in a way which does not permit proper scrutiny and analysis and does not allow time for comment outside the House by Opposition spokespeople? The Bill was published on Wednesday. Opposition justice spokespeople were in committee for <Col N="23" /> most of Wednesday dealing with the Estimates for the Minister's Department and were in committee for most of Thursday dealing with two motions from his Department and with submissions from the Bar Council and the Law Library. The Minister knows how busy Opposition justice spokespeople were in the past 48 hours, yet he produced a technical Bill for which amendments had to be submitted within 24 hours of its publication. There was no time for analysis or to hear outside opinion on a critical issue which will certainly come before the courts for determination in the future, if it is enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 2 proposes to amend section 2(a) of the 1921 Act, &ldquo;by providing that a tribunal may exclude the public where there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings&rdquo;. I am fearful of the exclusion of the public but I have indicated that I am willing, to a limited extent, to go along with this measure if it is the only way we can get at the truth. The explanatory memorandum notes that, &ldquo;this provision applies to existing proceedings, not possible future proceedings&rdquo;. This was re-stated by the Minister in his speech a few moments ago. However, section 2(a) mentions only criminal proceedings and does not specify existing criminal proceedings. I refer this to the Minister. Is he sure the limit of this measure to existing criminal proceedings is ring-fenced and that it cannot be used as a shield against potential future proceedings? If this is not crystal clear to him will he accept an amendment on Committee Stage to insert the word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; before &ldquo;criminal proceedings&rdquo; so that there is no ambiguity? I ask the Minister to reflect on this.</P>
    <P>Section 3 permits the High Court, on the application of the person to whom the tribunal reports, either the Clerk of the Dáil or the Minister who signs the instrument, to postpone publication of the report in certain circumstances, either for a specified period or until the court directs otherwise, if the court is of the view that such publication might prejudice any criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I will address two elements of this proposal. I fear the coach and four that can be driven through this enactment by lawyers in that they can apply to the court to postpone the publication of a report if in the view of the court it might prejudice any criminal proceedings. Those who would be adversely affected by the report and findings of a tribunal of inquiry might well seek to use that as a shield to prevent publication.</P>
    <P>Another element of the same proposal is that application to the High Court would be <i>in camera</i> where the court considered it appropriate. The practice of the courts since the foundation of the State is for proceedings to be held in public except in specified family law cases, about which exception I have the gravest reservations. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 3(3) will presumably ensure that the exercise of holding it <i>in camera </i>will be exercised judiciously so as not to circumscribe the absolute right of the public to be informed of the determination of a tribunal. The <Col N="24" /> tribunal is paid for by the public and brought into being by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Anything that prevents the full truth or the findings of the tribunal from coming into the public domain has to be very carefully weighed and evaluated and the notion that even the evaluation of whether to publish it might be <i>in camera </i>gives me cause for grave concern.</P>
    <P>We have very little time to debate and reflect on these matters. I hope the Minister will not simply dismiss the views expressed by Deputy Shatter and me as irrelevant and bulldoze through these proposals. We might live to regret it dreadfully if long tribunals of inquiry are stymied at the last hurdle by court cases that arise from this section.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the appointment of reserve members of tribunals and for the possible elevation of such reserve members to full membership. In the short time available to me I have given this some consideration and I am struck by the perceived use of such members by the Minister. He sees them as substitutes that are involved in being present for all witnesses, hearing all the evidence and having all the documentation, but having no function in coming to a determination or even in the formulation of ideas with the tribunal unless they are promoted to become a full members of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have not fully thought through my position on this matter. However if a distinguished judge or other legal person is present for all the proceedings and hears all the evidence, the inputs that person might make in the general discussion, while not being part of the conclusions, might be useful to the tribunal in coming to a determination on a certain matter. He might have a particular expertise in an area under discussion that might be much greater than that of the formal members of the tribunal. It would be a shame if that person were precluded from input into the deliberations or advising the tribunal unless he is promoted to become a full member.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that failure to comply with the requirement of a tribunal investigator or to obstruct or hinder him or her in the performance of his or her functions shall be a summary offence. A person could be theoretically liable to imprisonment for contempt under section 6. A person can be imprisoned for contempt of court, as has happened. The person could be prosecuted again for the same offence under section 7. Does that form some type of double jeopardy? The Minister might say that strictly speaking, contempt of court is not an offence, but we have seen that it does and can result in imprisonment and a formal sentence. Is it possible for somebody to face imprisonment for contempt under section 6 and imprisonment for obstruction under section 7 for the same offence?</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have more time to tease out a number of other issues in the debate on this important legislation. I want to see it improved, but I also want to see the tribunal of inquiry established into the happenings in County Done<Col N="25" /> gal, the so-called McBrearty affair. I hope, what will probably be the final dialogues, between the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and those of us in opposition trying to hold him to account for a number of years, will be conducted in some mutual respect. The Minister should respect that we have important views to put forward and will make propositions worthy of consideration. They should be considered properly and where appropriate adopted and not brushed aside. Despite assurances and promises, we had no consultation in advance.</P>
    <P>My 30 minutes on this important legislation are complete. I regret I cannot wholeheartedly welcome legislation that will lead to something that I have sought for a long time, a proper inquiry into events in County Donegal. When we come to deal with the issues, I hope there will be a more respectful response from Government to the importance of this House, the rights of Members of the House and ultimately the constitutional prerogative for us to shape legislation and not the Executive.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I will be very brief because it is important to reach Committee Stage as quickly as possible in order to tease out the very valid issues raised by Deputies Shatter and Howlin. The establishment of this tribunal is welcome, but with the considerable reservations mentioned by the Deputies. Although it is welcome, it comes much too late for the McBrearty, Barron, Divers, Shortt and Gallagher families. It comes extremely late from the point of view of salvaging the badly damaged reputation of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I was first contacted by Frank McBrearty senior three years ago, I have pressed the Mini ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a tribunal. On numerous occasions, Deputies Howlin, Shatter and I have stressed in this House that the only way the truth could be established in regard to the twisted, tangled web of illegal Garda misconduct in Donegal was to set up a tribunal of inquiry, presided over by a senior judicial figure, where witnesses and documents would be subpoenaed and where evidence from witnesses would be taken under oath in full public view. Time and time again, I stressed that the process of gardaí investigating Garda colleagues and friends was neither tenable nor credible and would go nowhere. Time and time again, we collectively pointed out to the Minister that the numerous so-called &ldquo;Garda inquiries&rdquo; were nothing other than a charade or a deliberate and calculated attempt to tread water in the hope and expectation that if the process was dragged out for as long as possible, the issues would somehow go away or certain members of the force would escape to the safe haven of retirement, with their pensions secure and in tact and, hopefully, evade disciplinary action. However, the Minister resisted our arguments and pleadings. He contented himself with the meaningless utterance <Col N="26" /> that the Garda inquiries under way must be allowed to proceed to finality. Despite the mounting evidence of Garda misconduct, the dropping of murder allegations against the McBrearty family and Mark McConnell and the dropping of over 160 charges of alleged breaches of the liquor licensing laws, the Minister refused to intervene to wind-up the farce and set up a tribunal. As he has done so often in the past, he simply stood idly by and refused to act.</P>
    <P>As has been said, last November the Labour Party initiated a Private Members' motion in this House, which was co-sponsored by the other Opposition parties, designed to set up such a tribunal. The Minister flatly rejected the proposal by putting forward a list of unsustainable arguments as to why such a move was not possible. He was relying on the advice of the Attorney General who gave such advice without having seen the files from the DPP. He contended there should not be a tribunal because it could cut across pending or future criminal proceedings. However, the only such proceedings at present are those before the Sligo court this week such as the charges against Garda informer, Bernard Conlon. The only pending charges are those against four other Garda informers and detective sergeant John White, charges relating to the illegal possession of a firearm. They have absolutely nothing to do with the McBrearty affair or the other Donegal cases.</P>
    <P>Had the Minister acted as he should, and on time, these people would have been before the tribunal three years ago before any charges were brought. No charges have been brought against the real culprits in this sorry sordid saga, the members of the Garda Síochána who acted so irresponsibly in deciding that a road traffic death was to be switched to a murder investigation with such horrific consequences for those wrongly arrested and accused of murder, destroying their lives, reputations and businesses. No charges have been brought against the Garda Síochána who destroyed the lives of the Divers family in Ardara by accusing them of planting explosives on an MMDS mast. No charges have been brought against the Garda Síochána who wrongly accused publican, Frank Shortt, which led to his spending all but 14 days of a three year prison sentence. No charges have been brought against the Garda Síochána who wrongly accused the law-abiding Gallagher family of having explosives on their land, who ploughed up the farm, authorised the permanent presence of a helicopter over the farm, leading to their sheep being destroyed and losing their lambs by running against the wire fences and by putting their machinery contracting business out of business and literally to the wall. No charges have been brought against the gardaí who were involved in the alleged planting of explosive devices across the Border in Northern Ireland. Instead of disciplinary action and charges, the only sanctions levelled against such gardaí was to transfer them to high profile posts and, in some cases, they were actually promoted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" />The whole basis of the Minister's refusal to establish a tribunal last November is demolished by the Bill before the Dáil today. What was impossible a mere four months ago has suddenly become possible overnight. Last November the Minister did exactly what his subordinates in the Garda Síochána tried to do for so long, that is, to buy time. He asked the chairman of the Bar Council to nominate a legal person to undertake an examination of the actions taken, of the papers held by the Garda in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to advise what measures should be taken to bring those members engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour to account. There is little doubt in my mind but that by assigning this task to senior counsel, Shane Murphy, the Minister hoped and assumed we were talking about a six month project and that the general election would be over by the time Mr. Murphy reported back. Instead, thankfully, it turned out to be a six weeks project. Mr. Murphy examined the files and found an unholy mess and a mass of contradictions. He offered the opinion that the only way the entire saga could be properly examined was by way of a tribunal of inquiry. Effectively, Mr. Murphy told the Minister the last thing in the world he wanted to hear.</P>
    <P>This House is extremely grateful to Mr. Murphy for the expeditious and decisive manner in which he undertook his assignment. He has served this country, the Barron, McBrearty, Divers, Shortt and Gallagher families well. He has served the other individuals and families well who may well come forward, as Deputy Shatter said, with yet further allegations when the tribunal advertises its existence and terms of reference. Mr. Murphy has also served the Garda Síochána well. The Minister's prevarication in failing to grasp this particular nettle has done irreparable damage to the collective reputation of the Garda Síochána. He has also damaged the morale of the force because of the negative impact of the ongoing spate of undealt with revelations. I would say to the Minister if he were here, but he has absconded, hopefully <i>pro tempore</i>, that he has damaged very badly public confidence in the force &ndash; zero tolerance indeed. He has been utterly indecisive, totally negligent and appallingly and unbelievably incompetent.</P>
    <P>The main reason we will now have a tribunal of inquiry is because Shane Murphy delivered before time. The other reason we will have a tribunal of inquiry is to save the Minister's hide. At least, we will now have a tribunal, albeit at the 11th hour. It is important that the tribunal hearings get under way as quickly as possible. I would like the Minister to clarify the location where it has been decided the tribunal will sit. Are we talking about a Donegal location, a Dublin location or it is possible that some of the proceedings may, in fact, take place in Donegal with the balance taking place in Dublin? I share my Opposition colleagues' reservations that some of <Col N="28" /> the proceedings may happen in private session. All proceedings of tribunals of inquiry should be held in full public view and gaze.</P>
    <P>I wish the tribunal well because it is what we have been pressing for. However, we want to know who killed Richard Barron and why the investigation into his death was so cruelly mishandled. We want to know why the McBrearty, Divers, Shortt and Gallagher families were deliberately victimised and who was responsible. We want to know who organised the planting of bombs across the Border. The members of the Garda Síochána responsible must be identified, brought before the tribunal and ejected from the force. The Garda Síochána is a good force that has stood the country and its citizenry in good stead since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>This legislation is clearly of considerable importance but there have been a number of misrepresentations during the course of the debate which clearly were made for political reasons. I would like to deal in a calm fashion with some of the more outlandish allegations which have been tossed around the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter accused me of refusing to establish a tribunal of inquiry in the past and he, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Jim Higgins sought to create the impression that I had opposed the holding of an inquiry throughout. No Deputy was able to produce any document of record in this House to state that I was against holding an inquiry. Throughout, I explained <i>ad nauseam</i> how I was open to the idea of an inquiry, that I did not seek to close off that possibility, but that there were legal difficulties.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Deputies opposite, I have responsibilities relating to advice I receive from the Attorney General. I acted in accordance with the best legal advice I could obtain. There is no doubt that criminal proceedings could be prejudiced by holding an inquiry in public. This was not just the view of the Attorney General. In his report Mr. Shane Murphy spoke categorically about the need to preserve the integrity of proceedings.</P>

      <P>There may be others. A number of gardaí is being investigated in the context of disciplinary issues. The suggestion by Deputy Higgins that I appointed Mr. Shane Murphy, Senior Counsel, as a delaying tactic is so blatantly outrageous that it is laughable. I was anxious that Mr. Murphy would report as quickly as possible. The venue of the tribunal will be a matter for the tribunal itself to decide.</P>
      <P>In the course of his contribution, Deputy Shatter made statements in relation to section 6. He misrepresents the provision that the appointment of investigators would be subject to the approval of the Government when he says that the Government would, for improper purposes, prevent their appointment.

      <P>I note Deputy Howlin's point about reserve members. The role of such members is, in substance, the same as set out in the resolutions of this House on 5 July 2001. They are, in effect, substitute members whose role prepares them to become full members if that becomes necessary. Deputy Howlin asked about whether criminal proceedings must be in existence for sections 2 and 3 to apply. I am advised by the Attorney General that the term &ldquo;criminal proceedings&rdquo; itself implies proceedings in existence. That is to say, pending or ongoing. I am satisfied that this wording is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept what Deputy Shatter says about the section on investigators, that the functions should be spelt out in greater detail. These functions are stated as precisely in section 6(4) as <Col N="35" /> the functions of tribunals themselves in the 1921 Act.</P>
    <P>The right of each human being to a fair trial is something which has been acknowledged by the Supreme Court as one of the most fundamental constitutional rights. In that context, whether publication takes place is a matter which will be decided by the courts and not by a Minister. To do otherwise would be to set at naught the right to a fair trial. What this means is that the person in question would not be made amenable to the criminal courts. All that would remain would be findings of fact by the tribunal but no one would ever be punished on foot of those findings.</P>
    <P>This legislation will prove to be efficient and effective. I am deeply interested, perhaps more than anyone else &ndash; although I would not assume that unto myself, unlike others &ndash; in ensuring that the reputation of the Garda Síochána is maintained and upheld. I am equally anxious to ensure that if there are matters that require to be dealt with either in the criminal courts or by way of discipline, these matters are dealt with. It is of immense importance that this is the case and that is the objective of this exercise. It is grossly unfair and misrepresents the position for people to come to this House and pretend, despite the fact that we are enacting the legislation setting up the tribunals of inquiry, that it is possible to start a public inquiry and prejudice people's right to a fair trial.</P>
    <P>It is equally unfair to suggest that there was an attempt to sweep this matter under the carpet. There were several Garda investigations in relation to aspects arising out of the events in Donegal, files were sent to the DPP and matters were complained of to the Garda Complaints Board. One would have hoped that any one of these independent investigations might have yielded a conclusive result, but that did not happen. It was not a member of the Opposition who decided to bring in Mr. Shane Murphy, SC to examine this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a decision which I made on foot of a recommendation I made to the Government. A central principle of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 2001, is that the proceedings of tribunals should be in public save in exceptional circumstances which are provided for in section 2(<i>a</i>) of the 1921 Act. There have been occasions when tribunals have used section 2<i>(a)</i> to exclude the public from proceedings. Indeed, there have been some recent cases where persons appearing before tribunals have unsuccessfully challenged in the courts decisions of the tribunals not to exclude the public. In such cases, the courts have placed a heavy emphasis on the need for tribunals to conduct their proceedings normally in public. There is a clear logic to this because, for public disquiet to be allayed, it is important that the inquiry is held <Col N="36" /> in public to the greatest possible extent. I accept that and that is consistent with the principle and the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The change which section 2 makes is that it refers to a specific instance in which a tribunal may exercise its discretion to exclude the public where there is a risk of prejudice for criminal proceedings, to which I have referred, in effect, where the right of a person who is before the courts to a fair trial might be prejudiced, bearing in mind that this right has been described by the Supreme Court as one of the most fundamental constitutional rights afforded to persons.</P>
      <P>The tribunal of inquiries legislation dates back 80 years and in the interim it has been amended four times. This, therefore, is the fifth amendment. In general, all the amending measures were occasioned by some specific need that emerged from the experience in relation to sitting tribunals or tribunals which had just concluded their work, or the anticipated needs of tribunals about to be established.</P>
      <P>At this stage there is a need to look at the tribunals code in a comprehensive way and perhaps develop proposals to amend and consolidate it. I am pleased to note that the second programme of the Law Reform Commission includes among the topics which will be given priority an examination of the law on tribunals of inquiry. I understand that the commission hopes to publish a consultation paper on the subject by the autumn and I look forward to this with interest.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it has been a characteristic of modern times that a number of matters of urgent public importance have arisen which have resulted in this House and the Seanad having to determine that tribunals of inquiry should be established. That all too many matters which have caused grave public disquiet should have emerged in the past decade is damaging to national morale and to the confidence which the public should have in public figures and institutions. What is vitally necessary in this situation, however, is that scandals are not allowed to fester and that measures are taken to get to the root of those matters of public concern and establish the truth of what did or did not happen. Here the tribunals mechanism has proved its worth over the years. The amending legislation which has been passed since 1979 has made it more effective as the courts, in interpreting the legislation and having regard to the Constitution, have ensured that the basic rights of persons who are the subjects of inquiries are always respected, consistent with the need to allay the public concern which has given rise to the establishment of the tribunal. I am confident that this Bill is another important step in enhancing the effectiveness of existing and future tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the debate on Second Stage has at times been bad tempered and while false allegations and misrepresentations have been made, in particular by Deputy Higgins here in the House, I hope that the legislation will have the intended effect. I sincerely hope that this legislation will <Col N="37" /> succeed in establishing a tribunal which will get to the root of what occurred in Donegal. In that context, the late Mr. Barron and his family have often been forgotten in the course of debates here and elsewhere. For the sake of the late Mr. Barron's family and society generally, I sincerely hope that we will ultimately find out precisely how Mr. Barron died and who, if anybody, was responsible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. <i>aa</i>1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 30, before &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;existing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the issue I raised during my previous contribution. I heard the Minister's response in which he said that the word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; was not required because the advice of the Attorney General was that it was implicit. There is no doubt that this legislation will be put under a microscope and this provision, which might be focused on by lawyers, should be as clear and unambiguous as we can make it. It is clear that the intention of the Minister is to exclude only where there is a risk of prejudicing existing criminal proceedings and to encompass a private session only where that would be at issue, not criminal proceedings which may not be current or existing. That is certainly the Minister's intention as he explained it to the House, and I think it is also the intention of the House. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment for the avoidance of doubt and to give absolute clarity to legislation which will undoubtedly be subject to the closest scrutiny. We should be as clear and unambiguous as we possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Howlin has said. In my speech earlier this morning I drew attention to this issue. Unless this amendment is made and what is explicitly stated to be the Minister's intention is contained in the legislation, it is inevitable that there will be litigation in which it will be suggested that anyone at risk of a prosecution should be allowed to give evidence in private. The risk of a prosecution may be used in <Col N="38" /> the context of seeking to suppress a report ultimately published by a tribunal. That is not something that should be left to be based on the advice of the Attorney General, particularly concerning this issue. Until this year, the Attorney General's advice has been that no tribunal should investigate these issues because of the possibility of future prosecutions that have not yet been instituted. I am not sanguine in relying on the advice of the current Attorney General on this issue. If the Minister's intention is that existing prosecutions, or prosecutions already initiated, are to be the subject of matters related to sections 2 and 3, the section should be so amended. I predict that if it is not so amended difficulties arising from the phraseology will inevitably delay the workings of the tribunal because of the inevitable court cases that will be brought in the context of what is contained in the Bill as presented.</P>

      <P>I dealt with Deputy Howlin's question earlier and this is also the subject matter of his amendment. He asked whether criminal proceedings must be in existence for sections 2 and 3 to apply.

      <P>I regret the Minister will not accept this amendment and I genuinely think it will be a mistake not to do so. The Minister says he agrees with what I intend to do, which is simply to ring-fence existing criminal proceedings rather than potential or future criminal proceedings as the reason the tribunal should be in private. If that is the Minister's intention, what burden is it to insert the word &ldquo;existing&rdquo;? Is there a compelling reason? The issue of it being superfluous is neither here nor there. For the avoidance of doubt we inserted our own phraseology. In legislation like this it is extremely important to be clear. If that is the Minister's intent, I urge him to accept the word &ldquo;existing&rdquo;. Sometimes good ideas come from this side of the House. Inserting that word will do no damage to the legislation and might prove to be a valuable insertion.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Superfluous&rdquo; is the word, and Deputy Howlin used it himself. I recognise the intention behind the amendment but it is superfluous. The difficulty with inserting words which are excess baggage or superfluous to legislation is that they can create a doubt about previous or subsequent legislation where the word does not appear. In the circumstances, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment which, I realise, was put forward in good faith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the amendment proposed by the Minister, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as amended in section 2(<i>a</i>), would read as follows:</P>
      <P>A tribunal to which this Act is so applied as aforesaid&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) shall not refuse to allow the public or any portion of the public to be present at any of the proceedings of the tribunal unless in the opinion of the tribunal it is in the public interest expedient so to do for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given and, in particular where there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings . . .</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the section, which was originally drafted in the early part of the last century and employs the type of language popular at that time, was expressed in a somewhat complex manner. The words we are now adding will make it that bit more difficult to understand. It is regrettable that we do not yet have a consolidated Tribunals of Inquiry Act, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
      <P>Based on the way the section will now read, is it proposed that the public can be excluded by a tribunal simply where there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings? Will a tribunal only be in a position to exclude the public if it is in the public interest expedient to do so for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry and, in particular, where there is a risk to criminal proceedings? Is it possible that a situation could arise where a tribunal might acknowledge that there could be a risk of prejudice in criminal proceedings but, nevertheless, that public interest demands that matters be dealt with in public? It seems that this is the intention of what is proposed. The tortuous language in which it is proposed and the addition at the end of the subsection will result in this issue also being the subject of litigation at some stage.</P>
      <P>If the intention is that, despite the possibility of prejudice in criminal proceedings, the public interest may override that consideration to still permit a tribunal to conduct its business in public, in such circumstances the legislation does not delineate either the criteria the tribunal is to apply in making those decisions or the weight to be given to the public interest. That brings us back to the quotation to which Deputy Howlin referred in respect of previous litigation in which the court, in the person of the Chief Justice in the case of Moriarty <i>v</i>. Haughey, confirmed the statement made by Lord Justice Salmon to the effect that &ldquo;There are, however, exceptional cases in which such procedures must be used to preserve the purity and integrity of public life, without which a successful democracy is impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" />I have already expressed concern that issues which should be the subject of evidence in a tribunal to which the public has access should also come under the glare of publicity. The latter may well be in the public interest because it is important that persons who have not yet been called before a tribunal but who may be able to assist it know of the evidence being given to that tribunal. Will the Minister indicate to the House the circumstances based on the proposal before us, in which he envisages that a tribunal, despite the possibility of prejudice in criminal proceedings, may nevertheless determine that it is in the public interest that the public not be excluded?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>Section 2 amends section 2(<i>a</i>) of the 1921 Act by adding a provision that a tribunal can avail of its power to exclude the public if there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings. To that extent, it elaborates on an existing power, but it should be noted that the provision applies to proceedings which are in existence at the time a tribunal is hearing the relevant evidence and not possible future proceedings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter inquired about the circumstances in which the public interest might override the right of an individual to a fair trial in the context of the proceedings being held in public. I am not in a position to provide specific examples in relation to that matter and the circumstances would have to be examined by the tribunal itself. The fundamental objective of holding proceedings or hearings in private is to preserve the right to a fair trial. I will not seek to pre-empt what a tribunal might or might not decide in respect of a given set of circumstances. I do not doubt that the tribunal will decide on these matters in due course and perhaps then some of Deputy Shatter's questions will be answered. However, I am not in a position to pre-empt any of those replies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister informing the House that he is bringing legislation before it which he is unable to explain? The Minister should be able to outline, at least in theory, some instances in which he envisages that the public interest may require that matters be dealt with by a tribunal in public in circumstances where there may be prejudice to a criminal trial. If the possibility of prejudice in a criminal trial is to override the public interest in its entirety, the Minister is completely undermining the views as expressed to date by the courts about the importance of the spotlight of publicity focusing on issues of major public importance in a constitutional democracy where there are serious allegations of transgression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very least, this House should not abdicate its role in this area to the courts. The Minister should be able to indicate the factors to which the courts will have regard and the extent to which these are to be weighted in determining <Col N="41" /> whether the public interest is to override the right to a fair trial. By introducing this new concept, the Minister is creating a hornet's nest of difficulty and uncertainty which will lead to the emergence of huge problems in the workings of tribunals. Such problems will be compounded by the fact that he failed to take on board Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at all stages presented this issue on the basis that the fact that there are existing criminal proceedings will mean, in effect, that a tribunal should not sit in public. It is now clear that this matter is more complex than that. However, the Minister does not know how his proposal will work in practice. It is important that he should outline the position to a greater degree. I presume that, in the context of the legislation being prepared, some attention was given to circumstances in which the public interest may require that matters be dealt with in public. Will the Minister indicate whether we are to assume that, when an issue of this sort arises and when it is argued before a particular tribunal on behalf of a witness that proceedings should be heard in private, there will be lawyers available who will argue that, despite the possible prejudice, the public interest demands that the tribunal continue to deal with matters in public?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it and as I have outlined it on many occasions in the past, the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right and has been recognised as such by the Supreme Court. That right has to be jealously guarded and I have explained that on numerous occasions. I honestly believe there are very few occasions when the public interest will override the right to an individual's fair trial, having regard to the Supreme Court ruling in the matter. We have allowed a degree of judicial discretion in this Bill which could be described as a safeguard. I am anxious that the tribunal would have the opportunity of proceeding and that it would not be inhibited from doing so. I also wish to ensure that a certain amount of discretion would be allowed to the tribunal. I am also deeply conscious, as I have been throughout, of the necessity for an individual to have a fair trial and I do not believe the provision, as it now exists, would allow, willy nilly, for the individual to have his or her case heard in public where it would prejudice that individual's right to a fair trial.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Shatter that the reason bookmakers make money is that they are asking the questions, not answering them. I am certainly not going to pre-empt what circumstance might arise. Perhaps one might say &ndash; I want to be particularly careful here &ndash; that if the offence in question were of a particularly innocuous nature, in those circumstances a tribunal might feel the public interest took precedence. However, I am not going to speculate. My responsibility is to legislate for as many eventualities as I can in the context of this tribunal of inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an important point of clarification. The Minister referred to the right to a fair trial being damaged. It is important to understand that what was implied in the judgment of the Chief Justice in the case of Moriarty <i>v.</i> Haughey, in re-echoing the comments of Lord Justice Salmon, was not just for the avoidance of a confusion. The issue was not that, in some case, the right to a fair trial would be impugned in any way but that, in certain circumstances, the public interest was such that there should be no trial. It is extremely important that we are clear there can be no circumstances in which a person's right to have an independent arbitration would be in any way compromised before the courts of this land. The net issue is that there might be circumstances where the public interest is clearly and overwhelmingly that no trial should take place or be available because a public matter of such importance needed to be ventilated.</P>

      <P>While I understand the point Deputy Howlin has made, I must point out that there is a right to a fair trial but there is not a right to a trial. My point is that the Director of Public Prosecutions decides whether there will be a trial &ndash; neither I nor Deputy Howlin has that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that there could be circumstances where information brought into the public domain could &ndash; I emphasise could &ndash; prejudice a person's right to a fair trial. Therefore, the offence would not be prosecutable in that circumstance. That is the net issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made an interesting comment a few moments ago. He said the public interest may override possible prejudice in a criminal trial in circumstances where the criminal proceedings that are raised as creating the difficulty may be of a minor nature. I would understand, if there are allegations of a very serious nature relating to Garda misconduct, or allegations of a very serious nature to be investigated by a tribunal in relation financial impropriety, or in relation to corruption in the planning process, a tribunal may well take the view that it is in the public interest to have those matters dealt with in public and that pre-existing criminal proceedings of a minor nature before a District Court, through which someone may be subjected to a relatively minor penalty, should not be used to prevent matters being dealt with in public. If that is the Minister's view on the matter, that is reasonable and I do not disagree, but it raises an issue to which I referred earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should not this amendment list particular factors, issues or circumstances under which the public interest in favour of matters being dealt with in public overrides the issue of prejudice? For example, why could the section not prescribe that, where a person is being prosecuted for a summary offence, as opposed to an indictable <Col N="43" /> offence, there should be no possibility of that prosecution being regarded as so prejudicial as to override the public interest in public hearings by tribunals? If the offence being prosecuted could not result in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment of more than six months, or the imposition of a fine at a particular level, why could those issues not be prescribed as taking secondary importance to the public interest? If the Minister suggests there is a constitutional difficulty in that regard, I suggest the constitutional difficulty fails to have regard to the overriding constitutional imperative of preserving this State as a constitutional democracy.</P>
    <P>In issues where current or former Members of Parliament are being investigated by a tribunal, or where individuals employed by State agencies, the Garda Síochána or any other body are being investigated, the overriding public interest is to preserve, as the case may be, the credibility of the institutions of this House or the credibility, in the eyes of the public, of the particular State institutions, such as the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I put it again to the Minister &ndash; I am conscious of the time and I will not come back to this issue again &ndash; that, in the context of raising this issue, if he had more time, he might well come back to the House in a week or two, having thought through the matter more fully. The difficulties which arise with this issue shine the spotlight on the folly of dealing with important legislation of this nature in such a short period of time and, perhaps, focusing on only one or two issues to which we know it is relevant, such as the proposed tribunal on matters in Donegal or existing tribunals. This could cause major problems in future in other areas where tribunals may be required. Since the Minister is part of a Government which has given birth to so many tribunals, if by some mischance he is back in Government after the next election, we may continue to have government by tribunals, crisis management by tribunals and investigations by tribunals into administrative mismanagement or allegations of corruption or misconduct. It is important that we get this legislation right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am back in this position after the general election it will be because of the constitutional prerogative of the Irish people and there will be no mischance about it. I have the greatest faith in their ability to discern the correct thing to do. I am loath to bring forward measures in legislation of this nature, which would place strictures on the Judiciary. The difficulty to which Deputy Shatter has referred is best pointed out by his own contribution. He outlined that circumstances could be put into the legislation where the public interests could override the individual's right to a fair trial in terms of having a public hearing and he said that perhaps we could specify the circumstances. That would be an extremely dangerous thing to do and the Deputy adverted <Col N="44" /> to the fact that this might not be constitutional. In the circumstances it would be extremely foolish of me to seek to second guess the Judiciary on an issue of such fundamental importance. The right to a fair trial, as I have said, <i>ad nauseam</i>, is fundamental and one no democracy can abandon. Accordingly I would prefer the courts or the tribunal to deal with it in their own way, not because I am afraid to be specific but because I truly believe that the interests of justice are best served by the Judiciary coming up with their own solutions to a given circumstance, and we are dealing here with a given circumstance or set of circumstances.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. <i>a</i>1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 4, to delete &ldquo;might&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;would&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of comments I made on Second Stage. Section 3(1) provides:</P>
      <P>If, on receipt by the person to whom a tribunal is required, by the instrument by which it is appointed or any instrument amending it, to report of an interim or the final report of the tribunal, that person considers that the publication of the report might prejudice any criminal proceedings, that person may apply to the court for directions regarding the publication of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the previous section we dealt with the issue relating to criminal proceedings as opposed to existing criminal proceedings and I believe that will give rise to a difficulty where a person considers that it simply might prejudice any criminal proceedings &ndash; not that it would, it just might. It would be helpful if we took this amendment in conjunction with amendment No. <i>b</i>1, which relates to subsection (3). This states that the court, where such application is made, may if it considers that the publication of the report concerned might prejudice any criminal proceedings, direct that the report or a specified part of it be not published for a specified period or until the court otherwise directs. In those instances the application can be initiated and the court can make a decision if it is felt that the publication of the report of the tribunal might prejudice criminal proceedings. &ldquo;Might&rdquo; is a very ill-defined word based on speculation. If we have to deal with matters in the manner in which the Minister is insisting, &ldquo;might&rdquo; should be replaced with &ldquo;would&rdquo;. That means that when the matter is being adjudicated upon by the court as to whether a report prepared and completed by a tribunal, be it interim or final, should be published in full or in part or the entire thing suppressed, there would be a heavy onus of proof on the applicant seeking to suppress the report. The only circumstances in which it could be sup<Col N="45" /> pressed should be where the court forms a firm view that the report's publication or any of its contents would &ndash; not might &ndash; prejudice proceedings.</P>
    <P>This could be used as a weapon by those who have been investigated by tribunals to seek to suppress the report of the tribunal and will inevitably result in High Court and Supreme Court cases. On the basis that tribunals are only asked to do a job of utmost urgency in regarding an issue of major public importance it is not in the public interest that the situation could arise where the publication of a report could be delayed indefinitely by a court. Nor is it in the public interest that this weapon be given to those investigated by tribunals to facilitate the report of a tribunal being delayed by the bringing of spurious court proceedings. I will ultimately be opposing this section in full.</P>
    <P>Let us assume for a moment that the report into the Donegal affair is available in 18 months time and some of those who have given evidence to the tribunal, in public or in private, want to postpone the publication of the report because they are concerned about its implications. This will result in an application to the High Court on the basis that the report might prejudice them and I predict that application will be brought, whether or not criminal proceedings exist, because it does not refer in the section to existing proceedings. It will probably take the High Court six months before the case is heard from the date when proceedings are initiated. It will then take another couple of months, or longer, before a judgment is delivered, and that may be appealed to the Supreme Court, which may deal with it six or seven months later and maybe two or three months after that deliver a judgment. Even if, at the end of the day, the Supreme Court says the report should be published, it is a mechanism to delay publication by 18 months. This is not just relevant to an inquiry that may be ordered into allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal, it will apply to any future tribunal of inquiry that is established by this House to investigate issues of public importance.</P>
    <P>This section is emasculating the facility of tribunals to promptly report on issues of public concern and introducing an unprecedented concept of censorship in our laws. It is introducing something that may well be in violation of the Constitution, is anti-democratic and is completely undesirable. There is not even provision that the report could be furnished to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who ordered the tribunal of inquiry in the first place. Provision could be made that would allow the report to be furnished to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas but for some period of time exclude the media from commenting on or publishing some part of the report. I am not advocating that and it is not something I want. I disagree with it, but even that is less draconian than what is proposed here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" />Has this proposal been proofed against the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms? Has any consideration been given to its implications in regard to the general public or the rights of Members of the Oireachtas? What consideration has been given to that? Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas formulate the terms of reference for a tribunal of inquiry, but on completion of the tribunal's work is the House to be deprived of knowing its conclusions? Does the Minister understand the implications, in the context of a constitutional democracy and of the administration of Government, if that report has serious conclusions regarding the manner in which Government operates or regarding particular decisions made by Government in relation to issues of public expenditure? In what way can it be suggested that censoring the report, or entirely suppressing it and introducing legislation which allows its suppression for an undefined period left to the discretion of the courts, serves this House?</P>
    <P>This proposal also violates the separation of powers. This House should jealously protect its legislative and parliamentary remit and tribunals of inquiry have been recognised and acknowledged by the courts, going back over 100 years, as performing a function for the Houses of the Oireachtas. A tribunal is an inquiry ordered by Parliament, undertaken at its request to make available information on matters of major public concern so that such action as is necessary can be taken in the public interest. Whatever about the Minister's proposal to allow certain types of evidence to be given in private, this section can be abused to prevent the publication of a report prepared by a tribunal for many months in circumstances which may be spurious, yet require extensive litigation. It can be utilised to deprive Members of this House of the capacity to redress major public wrongs or issues of public concern. It is seriously detrimental to the well-being of this State, to our concept of parliamentary democracy and our ability to ensure that we have mechanisms of public accountability in place.</P>
    <P>It is not right that we have to deal with all sections of the Bill today, particularly this one, when this legislation has received no public notice. No groups or organisations have had time to make presentations on it and the print media is so engaged with the latest Government scandal arising from the Taoiseach's Bertie bowl project, that it has not yet had a chance to digest the implications of what is proposed here. What this proposes to Members of the Oireachtas, the public and the media is that the entire report of a tribunal of inquiry into an issue of serious importance, which completes its work, draws conclusions and proposes reforms, can be suppressed indefinitely. Has the Minister considered what would happen if such a report were leaked and published by the media in circumstances where proceedings were brought against a tribunal? <Col N="47" /> Would reporters be dragged before the courts for contempt?</P>

      <P>What would happen if someone got access to the contents of such a report and published it on the web where the public had access to it? What action would be taken? What would happen if the report was published by a publication that operates outside this State or if its conclusions and recommendations were published by a satellite television channel? The Minister does not understand the difficulties of policing this, the dangers of it and its implication. This is a seriously dangerous provision which should not form part of our law. We should not create circumstances in which the reports of tribunals can be suppressed and the work that tribunal has done rendered completely irrelevant in resolving the issues it was asked to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly regret that there are only 15 minutes left to deal with very important Committee Stage work. A coherent case has been made in relation to section 3 of the Bill which amplifies some of the concerns I began to mention in my Second Stage contribution.</P>
      <P>All sorts of difficulties and anomalies will arise if there is a provision to suppress the report of a tribunal of inquiry. This is a charter for secrecy and secrecy has been one of the things that has characterised the issues arising from the McBrearty affair, which this legislation seeks to address. The Minister has told the House umpteen times in the past two years that there are ongoing inquiries &ndash; three of them so far. However, no report has come into the public domain from any of the inquiries that have taken place. The reason the most comprehensive report, that of the McCarthy investigation, was not put in the public domain was that to do so might prejudice prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Will there never be a mechanism of finding the truth and bringing it into the public light of day? Is that not a very profound question for our democracy and for our law? It is a most essential question, yet in section 3 the Minister provides for a new charter of secrecy. It will facilitate those who would go to court to suppress the report of the very instrument we feel can discover and publicise the truth on the principle that not to do so might prejudice criminal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could and should have a very detailed debate on this because only some of the vistas that potentially flow from the provision have been enunciated by Deputy Shatter. When the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights was charged with examining the Sheedy affair, which the Minister will recall, it looked at the various options available to advance its investigation &ndash; there were several. One of them was to request that this House constitute the committee as a tribunal of inquiry <Col N="48" /> under the 1921 Act. Had that course of action been followed and if it is followed in a future case, under this legislation a sub-committee or committee of the House engaged in public business could be prevented by an application to the court from publishing its own report. Where does the separation of powers stand in that instance? A committee of the House, charged by order of the House with tribunal of inquiry powers under the 1921 Act, could be prevented from exercising its constitutional role leading to a constitutional crisis where the powers of the court directly abut on the powers of the Oireachtas to be independent.</P>
    <P>This is not thought out. We have ten minutes of Committee Stage left and we have only dealt with three sections of this Bill so far. It is an ill thought out charter for secrecy and whatever the words the Minister used today, I sense the unease that this will come back to haunt us. It is a bad way to make law.</P>
    <P>In the minute left I want to refer to two principles. I am fundamentally concerned with the general principle of this section. It enables those who wish to apply to the court to prevent publication of a tribunal of inquiry report. When all the sifting and analysis is done, involving perhaps years of work and enormous costs, a person who feels he or she can present a sustainable case that a prosecution for criminal proceedings might arise against them could seek to prevent the report's publication. It might not even be a serious criminal matter. The consequences of the truth being published might have infinitely more impact on the individual than the criminal charge that might be the subject of the application to the court yet the truth would be denied to the public and the report would remain secret.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the issues Deputy Shatter outlined in relation to modern communications mechanisms making a nonsense of it anyway and how it would be difficult to take action against people in those circumstances. The net issue is allowing the results of a full investigation that has taken its course, involving witnesses being evaluated by a tribunal of inquiry, all the evidence and the colossal expense, to be kept secret forever or for a protracted or critical period on application to the court.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not moved by the compelling arguments we have made on the general principle and by the clear difficulty that will arise with regard to constitutional matters such as the separation of powers, he might at least look at the amendment put down by Deputy Shatter. It seeks to change the phrase from &ldquo;might prejudice&rdquo; to &ldquo;would prejudice&rdquo;. My preference is a different formulation of words and, if I had the time, I probably would have tabled the required amendment. I prefer to use the words &ldquo;is likely to&rdquo; prejudice criminal proceedings. If the Minister does not accept the principle, will he at least retreat to that additional safeguard, so a clause with the word &ldquo;might&rdquo; could not stop the publi<Col N="49" /> cation of a tribunal of inquiry's report, given all the effort involved in producing it?</P>
    <P>If this Bill becomes law before next week, I presume it will apply to current tribunals of inquiry. We know how long some of these inquiries have taken and of how individuals have obstructed them. One individual has gone to jail three times for obstruction. Is it likely that there would not be a challenge to the publication of the final report by some individual if this provision is enacted? We must make a choice and the Minister, in the dying days of his Administration, is charged under the Constitution with defending the public good. Balances and checks will always have to be taken into account but the fundamental right of a democracy to function and to know the truth must have a high priority in the scheme of things. This section will strike a mortal blow at that principle.</P>

      <P>There is no question of reports being suppressed. Publication or otherwise is a matter for the court. The court may direct non-publication if it considers that publication might prejudice proceedings. There is, therefore, an element of discretion in the court.

More importantly, perhaps, no court can decide that something would prejudice a criminal trial.</P>

      <P>Whether prejudice would occur is not something a court can decide. The court, like the tribunal, under section 2 can only decide what might happen, what there is a risk in relation to or that there is a risk of something happening. I must therefore reject the two amendments.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="50" />I will put the converse scenario to the Deputies. Let us say a person does not make an application to the courts in relation to a given report, the report is published and it is abundantly clear that an individual or individuals had a <i>prima facie</i> case or cases to answer in relation to serious matters. If the publication of the report were to lead to the conclusion that their right to a fair trial had been interfered with, it must be clear that criminal proceedings, which might be more than well merited, could not be taken against the individual or individuals concerned. That should concern the Deputies. It certainly concerns me.</P>
    <P>The argument that any individual can make an application of this kind is patent nonsense. Subsection (1) is explicit. It refers to the individual to whom the report is made. In normal circumstances, this would probably refer to the Minister or the Clerk of the Dáil. It does not mean any person could decide to make an application to the court for suppression.</P>

      <P>The position in section 3(1) is clear. It states:</P>
      <P>If, on receipt by the person to whom a tribunal is required, by the instrument by which it is appointed or any instrument amending it, to report of an interim or the final report of the tribunal, that person considers that the publication of the report might prejudice any criminal proceedings, that person may apply to the Court for directions regarding the publication of the report.</P>

      <P>I do not have any foreboding about to this section. Nobody can predict what will happen with any legislation but in so far as I, my officials and the Attorney General are concerned, this is the correct way to proceed. It would be farcical if, for example, one were to hold part of an inquiry in private so an individual's right to a fair trial would not be prejudiced, and then publish the report of the matter which was held in private and end up prejudicing the right of the individual concerned to a fair trial.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;300,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert an additional subsection in section 7. Section 7 provides for the offences in circumstances where a person, by act or omission, obstructs or hinders an investigator attached to a tribunal in the performance of his or her functions, or fails or refuses to comply with a requirement made to the person.</P>
      <P>The Bill prescribes, in section 7(1), that a person who so acts is guilty of an offence. Prosecution can only be brought, under subsection (2), by or with the consent of the DPP. Under subsection (3), it is prescribed that a person guilty of such an offence shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than &euro;3,000 and-or 12 months imprisonment.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I made the case that the penalties were too low, in particular, in circumstances where someone might have refused to co-operate, been through the courts and fined, and then still refuse to co-operate, and that there should be a possibility of bringing a charge on indictment in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discovered that the penalty of £10,000, which was originally in the Tribunal of Inquiries Act and which could be imposed for failure to co-operate with the tribunal itself, was far too low <Col N="54" /> and it took the judgment in the proceedings involving Deputy Lawlor to deal with that issue. Approximately one year later, the Minister is providing for a far larger fine of &euro;300,000 to address that issue as a consequence of the Private Members' Bill, which I published on behalf of Fine Gael, which sought, before we reached euroland, to increase the fine to £250,000. There should be a similar possible offence on indictment, particularly for people who repetitively fail to co-operate with investigators.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I propose that section 7 be amended by the inclusion of the following subsection (4), which reads: &ldquo;A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;300,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.&rdquo; That would give the Director of Public Prosecutions an option whether to proceed summarily in the District Court or by way of indictment in a higher court against a person who fails to comply with the requirements of an investigator properly appointed and operating functions prescribed by this legislation. I ask the Minister to take the amendment on board. Taking it on board will create an option for the DPP in circumstances where a failure to co-operate has a particularly serious impact on the working of a tribunal. The DPP should have the option of taking summary proceedings or proceedings on indictment. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment in the terms in which it is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my address on Second Stage, it is appropriate that if a person does not co-operate with an investigation, he or she could be the subject of summary conviction. Most importantly, the investigator can seek a High Court order compelling co-operation. Therefore, if the person in question is unco-operative, he or she runs the risk of unlimited penalties at the hands of the High Court. In addition, if a person fails to co-operate with an investigator, the logical consequence is that the tribunal itself would take the view that there is something to inquire into. The tribunal can use the powers vested in itself to summarily examine that person. If he or she continues to be unco-operative, then he or she would expose himself or herself to conviction on indictment or summary treatment or further application for a High Court order. Therefore, the Deputy's amendment is, in a practical sense, superfluous and could be viewed as disproportionate. The analogy to Deputy Lawlor is invalid because his circumstances pertained not to an offence but to contempt.</P>

I have here the normal list of amendments which were circulated today. I also have an amendment which was circulated yesterday evening and which appears to be in connection with the proposed changes in the use of mobile phones in cars. This has already attracted an amount of public attention. The Minister of State announced regulations on Tuesday and stated that he intended to ban the use of mobile phones in cars. Since then there has been a degree of public confusion as to what the Minister of State is doing. The gardaí have stated that the measure is not enforceable. The announcement was made in advance of the amendment relating to the same matter being considered in the House. The regulations which were made on Monday are prejudicial to the debate we are about to have on the primary legislation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Minister of State who announced these regulations is not present. Regulations were announced on Tuesday, an amendment relating to the regulations was circulated only yesterday evening, there is public concern and confusion about the entire issue and the Minister who is responsible for all of this is not present.

      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide for the introduction of a driving disqualification linked directly to the penalty point system. The section establishes the general provision that a person who accumulates a certain number of penalty points will be disqualified from holding a driving licence for a period of six months. This disqualification will take effect automatically and administratively and without the need for a court order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's proposal to amend this section provides that the imposition of a six months disqualification resulting from the accumulation of 12 or more penalty points would be subject to a decision of the District Court to <Col N="58" /> postpone or waive the disqualification. To facilitate this the Deputy proposes the insertion of two new paragraphs to the section.</P>
    <P>The intended effect of the penalty points system is to instil greater caution and responsibility in motorists in relation to their driving. It is also intended to see the transfer of most of the enforcement of a large number of traffic offences from the courts to the administrative system. At its core is that penalty points will in most cases be incurred through the acceptance and payment by motorists of fixed charges imposed by the Garda. If the motorist takes the option and pays the charge he or she is accepting the consequences of that action. If the matter proceeds to court, upon conviction the person will face the endorsement of a greater number of penalty points.</P>
    <P>The administrative system will in all cases where penalty points are endorsed inform the motorist of the overall position in relation to the total number of points on his or her record. Thus the motorist will have a clear opportunity to avoid the consequences of reaching the threshold of 12 points that will automatically trigger a disqualification. In that context, a court does not impose the disqualification. It is the result of a person's continued poor driving behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Acts provide that a person may apply to the court to have the commencement of a disqualification imposed as a result of a conviction in a court postponed. In addition, a person can apply to the court to have a period of disqualification reduced. However, in considering such applications, the courts are being asked to consider the effects of a disqualification imposed following one particular incident which gives rise to a conviction for an offence by a court. In addition, there are strict parameters applying to the grant of a reduction in the length of a disqualification. For example, the period of a consequential qualification cannot be reduced to less than six months. Through this section the period of disqualification that must be served by the person as a result of recurring poor driving behaviour over a period of time is set at six months in terms of the level of deterrent and the factors that lead to the imposition of the disqualification imposed under this section. I consider it is reasonable that a person should be required to face a loss of the use of his or her licence for the period specified in this section. I therefore ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" />In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>8.&ndash;The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 11:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;11A.&ndash;Without prejudice to section 11 of this Act, a person shall, when using windscreen wipers, drive a vehicle in a public place with the dip head lamp illuminated.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was debated with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, may be aware that the motor manufacturers organisation, which represents those who manufacture and import cars into the European Union, took a decision last November that from next year vehicle lights will automatically be turned on. For the past five years the Minister has promised much but delivered little. He promised a review of dip lights on cars, but we are still awaiting that review. The motor manufacturers organisation has superseded the Minister and will import cars with dip lights on. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated on Committee Stage, the international research literature on daytime running lights indicates substantial differences of opinion of the effectiveness of daytime running lights for improving road safety. The European Commission has given detailed consideration to this complex question, but to date it has not adopted a definitive position. It has, however, included daytime running lights among road safety priorities to be progressed at EU level. This is likely to involve additional research and considerable further debate before a consensus evolves.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Naughten referred to daytime running light practice in Florida. That provides that lighted lamps are required from sunset to sunrise, including the twilight hours and during rain, smoke or fog. There is no obligation to maintain lights operational in daytime other than in rain, smoke or fog, nor is there any explicit link between the use of wipers and the use of lights. No definitive information on the road safety effects of these requirements can be ascertained. Dublin City Council is finalising arrangements for its pilot programme on daytime running lights and will carry out an assessment of its effects on safety. The results will be used to inform decisions about whether a statutory basis would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Motorcyclists Action Group, MAG, is firmly opposed to the introduction of daytime running lights on a mandatory basis for all vehicles. It believes such an arrangement would reduce the benefit to its members of using daytime running lights on a voluntary basis by reducing the overall impact of using their lights in daylight. At the heart of the discussion is that while <Col N="60" /> daytime running lights can have some safety benefits for the motor vehicle that will use it, its use may lead to additional deaths and injury for more vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists because these are relatively less visible when vehicles are using daytime running lights.</P>
    <P>For these reasons it might be prudent not to proceed as proposed in the amendments. If as a result of the research, work and discussions being progressed at EU level, specific positive proposals emerge, adequate legislative powers are available under the Road Traffic Act to address the issue. In these circumstances, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 24, to delete lines 12 to 48 and in page 25, to delete lines 1 to 4.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this issue on Committee Stage and I do not propose to repeat myself. I am seeking the deletion of section 14. That section would allow the Minister by regulation to effectively privatise every service which is performed either by his Department or by any local authority in connection with road traffic matters. The only function which is not open to privatisation is that of the Minister in relation to policy making matters and in relation to the making of regulations. Any other functions, such as the licensing of motor vehicles and the driver testing service about which there is considerable concern in view of the Minister's intention to privatise it are so open.</P>
      <P>It would also include any function of a local authority, any road traffic matter performed by a local authority, road safety or functions performed by a road safety officer of a local authority. It would include any function performed by the Garda Commissioner. For example, this section could provide for the establishment of a private traffic corps and the functions taken away from the Garda. It is a remarkably wide-ranging section enabling the Minister to privatise any of or all the functions relating to road traffic which are currently done by the Minister, the Garda Commissioner or the local authority.</P>
      <P>I received correspondence from IMPACT, which represents staff in the driver testing service, in which it drew my attention to a recently published independent consultant's report on the driver testing service. That union expressed concern at the prospect of this service being privatised arising from the enactment of section 14. I propose that the entire section 14 should be deleted from the Bill. There should be no question of the privatisation of these services and I specifically ask the Minister of State to give an assurance that the driver testing service, in particular, about which there is considerable concern at present, will not be privatised.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 20, like Deputy Gilmore, we independently spotted this as one of the most worrying aspects of the entire Bill. How it may be implemented and enforced worries all of us. Since Committee Stage I have taken legal advice on the issue which is that this section is a departure from the established principle of administrative law, that is, that the delegate of a function may not, in turn, delegate it. For that reason it needs to be approached with extreme caution. The Bill purports to allow even functions closely related to the administration of justice to be delegated. In other words, the Bill is a licence to privatise by stealth. The Bill would <Col N="65" /> allow even the most important functions of the Garda Commissioner, including approval, for instance, of the road traffic apparatus under section 20, to be delegated to a private contractor.</P>
      <P>The problem is that the section is far too broad. One should nominate the particular powers being given to the Minister to delegate or the section should be omitted, or each and every contract should be laid before the Dáil. I recognise that would be a time-consuming exercise and many of them would need to include companies with contracts for clamping and so on. As this is a very important power which is being given to the Minister, he must take on board the concerns expressed on Committee and Report Stages by Deputy Gilmore and me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that Deputy Gilmore's amendment would result in the removal of this section from the Bill. The purpose of section 14 is to strengthen and clarify the existing statutory basis for alternative ways to deliver certain public services. A Department of State is not always the ideal vehicle to deliver a particular service. Approaches such as a separate agency, commercial company or a partnership approach involving the public and private sectors working together may be more appropriate in some circumstances. The national car test and the driver theory test are two cases in point. The section allows the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to enter into an agreement with a person or company for that person to provide specific services under the Acts. Agreements may provide for any fees or payments to be made and for the disposal of those moneys.</P>
      <P>The section underpins the accountability of the Minister to Dáil Éireann by providing that an agreement under the section does not remove or derogate from the Minister's responsibility to Dáil Éireann for the function. It also provides for the general superintendence and control of a conferred function to remain with the Minister or other person on whom the function was conferred in the first instance. Consequently, accountability would not be weakened by the operation of the section and the ultimate responsibility of the persons and bodies mentioned in the last subsection remains unchanged. The proposed amendment with regard to laying a draft of an agreement under the section before each House would run counter to the purpose of the section.</P>
      <P>Most such agreements will contain confidential data such as intellectual property and sensitive financial information. The publication of such data could leave a party to an agreement at a considerable commercial disadvantage. That would militate against the effective application of the section in most cases. I, therefore, oppose both amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very restricted in regard to our speaking arrangements on Report Stage. The Minister of State's reply confirms absolutely that it is the Government's intention to privatise <Col N="66" /> these services. He omitted to say anything specifically about the driver testing service. I invite him to state on the record of the House whether it is the Government's intention to privatise the driver testing service about which there is immediate concern.</P>
      <P>The reasons he gives for rejecting Deputy Mitchell's amendment confirm that it is the intention to privatise the service. If the intention was to establish separate State agencies and issues of commercial confidentiality and so on, it would not arise in the case of laying a draft before the House. However, I do not accept that should arise unless we are going to do with the road traffic functions of this State what has been done with the establishment of the pool in Abbotstown where deals are done and the details of those deals will be withheld from the public and the House. It would be much better if the nature of some of these arrangements were put before the House and examined before commitments were entered into which ends up with the State and taxpayers being caught for large dollops of money in very dubious circumstances.</P>
      <P>I will be pressing the amendment because I do not wish to see the services of the State in regard to road traffic, including the driver testing service or any of the other services, privatised. The House should decide the issue.</P>

      <P>The essential purpose of the section is to provide that a power that has been vested in the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, be transferred to local authorities. The power relates to the determination of the location of bus stops on designated routes for buses. It has no added value from the perspective of the enhancement of road safety at the identified locations. It would be inappropriate to extend this provision to address services other than those on the scheduled bus routes. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>By agreement, we have progressed on the 35 previous amendments in order to allow us some time to discuss this issue. This amendment relates to the proposals by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, to ban the use of hand held mobile phones by drivers and, as a consequence, introduce penalty points in connection with that. As the House is aware, this matter has received much public attention in the past few days since the Minister of State announced his intention to introduce the ban.</P>
      <P>This amendment was not proposed on Committee Stage nor was there any specific information given to the committee in respect of the Minister of State's intentions. I acknowledge that, at the end of Committee Stage, he gave a general indication that it was his intention to introduce on Report Stage an amendment in relation to mobile phones. However, there was no discussion on Committee Stage about the introduction of penalty points in connection with the ban on hand held mobile phones. Therefore, it is necessary that the amendment be recommitted to allow for that discussion to take place.</P>
      <P>It is not in order that a significant change is being made to road traffic legislation by regulation and through the introduction of an amendment on Report Stage of a Bill which will have only limited and restricted discussion. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to agree to this amendment being recommitted. It is the last amendment on our list and we have an hour and a half in which to discuss this although we may deal with it in a shorter period of time. We are not under pressure of time in relation to recommittal having regard to the guillotine that is on the debate and I ask the Minister of State to agree to recommittal. It is necessary to recommit because there was no discussion of the substance of this issue on Committee Stage. This is a parliament in which we make laws and it is not acceptable that laws are made without being fully teased out and debated. I ask that the Dáil give full consideration to this issue; the only way it can do so is if the Minister of State agrees to recommittal.</P>

Since it was not debated on Committee Stage it must be recommitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does so, I ask the Minister of State to carefully reconsider his disposition towards the recommittal of this amendment. As Deputy Naughten said, there was no substantive discussion of this issue on Committee Stage. I do not know where it would leave the legislation by way of challenge if the House were not to follow its own procedures in relation to dealing with a Bill. There is a requirement that an amendment that has not been discussed on Committee Stage is recommitted. We are in an unusual position in that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who is not present for this debate, made regulations earlier this week relating to this matter in advance of the primary legislation being considered in this House. I do not know where that leaves the regulations he has made, about which he did not give the committee notice. He made the regulations three days in advance of the primary legislation being discussed and has avoided the debate and scrutiny of this issue in the House.</P>
      <P>As we know, Report Stage debate is restricted. This is &ldquo;Scarlet O'Hara&rdquo; legislation. The Minister of State introduced a regulation on Monday about which there is public outcry. The gardaí have said it cannot be implemented and there is confusion as to what is intended and how the regulation is to be implemented. The Minister of State responsible is not here and the substitute Minister of State who is here to take the Bill has indicated he will not agree to recommit it which means we will have a restricted, stunted Report Stage debate on an issue of current public debate. That is not acceptable to me as a Member of the House, it is not acceptable to the public and it is not the way to make legislation. The Minister of State cannot be allowed to make regulations, only to disappear into the night without allowing an opportunity for debate. I again ask the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, in an effort to be non-confrontational about this and to avoid subsequent embarrassment to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Government, to agree to a Committee Stage debate on this issue for which we have ample time.</P>

      <P>This regulation, from which the amendment arises, has caused much confusion among the general public and the Garda Síochána, as well as within the Government and in the Department. The Department of the Environment and Local Government probably became the most popular Department this week given the amount of telephone calls it received on this matter.</P>
      <P>The proposal contained in the amendment was originally considered by the Minister three years ago when he established a review group to consider amending legislation on the use of mobile telephones. At that stage the review group recommended that no change should be made. The Minister subsequently established another review which recommended that there should be a change in the legislation and as a consequence the Minister has brought forward the regulation and this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been examining this issue for the past three years and on Monday he made the announcement concerning the regulation and the proposed amendment. That night, the Taoiseach stated that the use of mobile telephones in cars was a significant contributing factor to accidents. He referred to a fatal accident before Christmas that was caused by the use of a mobile telephone. How the Taoiseach or anyone else could calculate that this is a significant factor is road accidents is beyond my comprehension because we do not carry out accident investigations in this country. Given the amendment that is before us, the Minister of State should substantiate that claim.</P>

    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, had an opportunity, in respect of this Bill, to allow for accident investigations by Garda PSV licensing inspectors but he failed to take it. He is, for some unknown reason, absent today and has sent Deputy Dan Wallace to the House in his stead. <Col N="75" /> Perhaps he is not prepared to defend the regulation he introduced and, to date, he has been shy about making statements in the media. On Tuesday morning, however, he indicated on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the Garda could prosecute a person who had a mobile phone in his or her pocket while driving. Later that day, however, he issued a clarification to the effect that the Garda would not be able to do so because its members do not have the power to search individuals. The Minister of State appears to be confused in relation to the amendment before us and the regulation that came into force earlier in the week.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify the position in respect of the offence we are discussing which consists of &ldquo;the contravention of Article 4 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2002&rdquo;? What is the actual offence? Is it having a mobile phone in one's pocket? Using a mobile phone? Having a mobile phone beside oneself on the passenger seat? Having a mobile phone turned on or turned off? What is the exact nature of the offence? No one, including the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who is not prepared to come into the House to defend the statements he made or the statutory instrument he introduced earlier in the week, appears to know. Will someone indicate what is the actual offence?</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána appears to be as confused as everyone else with regard to the relevant regulation. The Garda authorities stated publicly today that drivers will not be prosecuted and that they are seeking legal advice in respect of this matter because they do not know how the regulation should be interpreted or what constitutes an offence. The Garda press office is quoted in today's newspapers as saying that it is unlikely there will be any prosecutions in respect of the regulation or the penalty points amendment before us. What is the point in bringing forward more road traffic legislation which is unenforceable? There is already enough such legislation which is not enforced at present without bringing forward a Bill such as that before us which the Garda authorities have stated is unenforceable.</P>
    <P>Will members of the Garda Síochána, the ambulance service or the fire brigade service lose penalty points for using two-way radios if the amendment is accepted? There seems to be major confusion in relation to this matter. The Minister of State neglected to inform any of the three services about the regulation and the amendment or explain to them what will be the implications thereof for their members. Regardless of the fact that he did not exempt them, he should have had the courtesy to inform the authorities as to how they should proceed in respect of this matter. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, could shed some light on the matter? As of yesterday, <Col N="76" /> the ambulance service was not aware that two-way radios will be illegal under the terms of the amendment and the regulation.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are also quoted in today's newspapers as saying that they are seeking clarification regarding the implications the amendment and the regulation will have for members of the force. We are, therefore, faced with a situation where the individuals who will be responsible for enforcing the provisions of the amendment and the regulations are seeking clarification from the Department of the Environment and Local Government regarding the implications those provisions will have for them. If they do not know how the provisions will impact on them, how will gardaí be able to enforce them in respect of the general public? They have already admitted that they do not intend to enforce them. As a result, another item of legislation and the pertinent regulation will be left to sit on the shelf and gather dust rather than being enforced. That has been the major criticism in respect of road traffic legislation to date.</P>
    <P>The principle behind the Bill before us is to ensure that the provisions, as they stand, will be implemented. However, the Minister of State, in his first major initiative on road safety, is intent on banning the use of mobile phones when it is clear that no one, including himself, knows what he is doing. Will Deputy Wallace clarify the position?</P>
    <P>Does the provision relating to penalty points relate to first, second or third offences or to all three together? The system relating to the fines associated with the penalty points provision is graded and goes from &euro;190 to &euro;435 and-or three months in jail. Will the Minister of State elaborate on this matter? Will he clarify the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the definition of a mobile phone and personal communication system, in which is included a reference to &ldquo;other similar apparatus&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State also clarify a definition in the regulation which will have a direct impact on the amendment? What does the term &ldquo;on or about the person&rdquo; mean? Would it not make more sense to refer to &ldquo;someone who is using a mobile phone&rdquo;? There appears to be a contradiction between the regulation and amendment No. 36, which refers to the &ldquo;use by driver of vehicle of mobile phone while in the vehicle in a public place except when the vehicle is parked&rdquo;. Either the amendment is wrong or the regulation is wrong. Both of them cannot be right. Any sensible person would agree with the wording contained in the amendment. However, that wording is not used in the regulation which refers not to the use of a mobile phone but to such a phone &ldquo;on or about the person&rdquo; of an individual.</P>
    <P>Hands-free mobile phone units with earpieces, which are the most common in use in this country, are banned under the regulation. No mention <Col N="77" /> is made of that fact in the amendment the Minister of State has introduced.</P>
    <P>There is major confusion about this matter. The regulation and the amendment before us are riddled with confusion and ambiguity. The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, was subjected to the ire of members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party at yesterday's meeting in respect of the level of confusion surrounding this matter. Will someone please indicate what will constitute an offence under the regulation and the amendment? The clarification issued by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, confused matters even further.</P>
    <P>Is it intended to amend the regulation as it applies to the emergency services? At this stage, those services do not have access to hands-free two-way radios. If a person in Dún Laoghaire has a heart attack and is being rushed to hospital by ambulance and if the driver wants to radio ahead to the hospital to report the condition of the patient, he or she will be obliged to pull in to the side of the road in order to do so. What is the logic behind that? The few public comments the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has made have led to an increased state of confusion. He said one thing on Tuesday morning, while his clarification later that day appeared to say the exact opposite. As a result, we are still no wiser with regard to how the regulation will be interpreted. The gardaí are also confused and nobody seems to know what is going on. The Minister has been reviewing this for the past three years, yet the gardaí do not know about it.</P>

      <P>This has to be one of the most bizarre legislative attempts made by Government in recent times. In the dying days of the Dáil, a proposal to ban mobile phones and introduce penalty points is being rushed through the House on a Friday afternoon. Why? The Government has been considering new road traffic legislation since 1998, when the high level group reported to Government. The legislation arising out of that report was published almost 12 months ago to the day &ndash; the Bill which we are discussing was published on 26 March 2001. An entire year has gone by in which, in the normal way, the Government could have proposed a ban on the use of mobile phones, have it debated here in the Dáil and considered in committee so that all the impli<Col N="78" /> cations could be teased out, but that did not happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, did not even introduce the proposal when this Bill was at Committee Stage, when there was an opportunity to give it detailed consideration. He did not produce the proposal until the week in which the Bill is at Final Stage in the Dáil. Having announced it on Monday, he disappeared and has not come into the House to defend it. I have no problem with a Minister not coming into the House &ndash; Ministers have many commitments and there may be a very good reason for the absence of the Minister of State with responsibility in this matter, Deputy Molloy. If that is the case, his colleague and fellow Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, has not given an explanation to the House as to why Deputy Molloy, the author of this proposal, has not appeared in the House to deal with it. I am reluctantly drawn to the conclusion that the Minister of State has made an unwise regulation, it has blown up in his face and he has run away from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>He has gone to ground and has failed to come here to defend his proposal. It is reasonable to ask why the banning of mobile phones is suddenly elevated to the most important measure that needs to be taken to ensure safety on our roads? Let me mention a few of the things the Government has rejected in the course of this debate. It has rejected my proposal that the speed limit in urban areas, housing estates and places where children play should be reduced to 20 miles per hour. It rejected my proposal on joyriding. It rejected a proposal arising from a Private Members' Bill which my colleague, Deputy Broughan, put forward some time ago in relation to the release of vehicles by unscrupulous people in the motor trade to youngsters who drive them in urban areas, residential areas, sports fields and public parks, endangering themselves and anybody with whom they come into contact. Obviously, those proposals were not important enough to be considered by the Government in relation to road traffic legislation. On Committee Stage, we were told these matters could be considered when the next report on road safety is before the Government. Matters such as joyriding or reducing the speed limit are not of urgency for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is urgent for the Government? Banning the use of mobile phones is, apparently, an urgent matter. Will the Minister of State explain to the House why a ban on the use of the hand held mobile phone has suddenly, in the course of the past week, assumed an importance greater than reducing the speed limit, ending joyriding or dealing with the scandal of motor vehicles being released by the motor trade to youngsters, sometimes at knock-down prices. The reason is clear, as one newspaper pointed out this week. It is a high profile public relations stunt by Government <Col N="79" /> to pretend it is doing something about road safety when, in reality, it has sat on its hands for the past four years without advancing the Bill before us. It has also failed to put in place the administrative and computer systems necessary to implement the penalty points system for which we are legislating today.</P>
    <P>Having delayed until the eleventh hour, the Government still could not get it right. There is a case for addressing the use of mobile phones in cars. I have no problem with legislation or regulations to deal with the use of hand held mobile phones in cars. However, if we are to deal with it, we need to do so in a sensible way. Deputy Naughten has drawn attention to the anomalies in these regulations as between the mobile phone and two-way radio systems used by the Garda, the ambulance service, taxis and so on. I could also draw attention to the difference &ndash; there is a difference &ndash; between a person briefly answering a mobile phone while stopped at traffic lights or a person attempting to dial on a mobile phone while speeding at 60 miles per hour on a dual carriageway. Those are two entirely different sets of circumstances but the regulations make no distinction.</P>
    <P>The regulations are daft, confusing, unimplementable and, indeed, laughable in some respects. Let us consider the definition of a mobile phone, &ldquo;any device which is being used directly by a person for the purpose of communication by way of mobile and personal communications systems&rdquo;. It is clear from that definition that the two-way radios used in ambulances, Garda vehicles, various emergency vehicles and taxis are comprehended by that definition. The Minister of State may say that the ban does not extend to fixed hands-free units in cars and that if the two-way radio is attached to the vehicle, it is not covered by it. However, it is covered if the ambulance driver, garda or taxi driver picks up a hand-held unit to answer a call. We need clarification as to how, from this week onwards, ambulance drivers, Garda drivers and taxi drivers will be affected. For example, if a taxi driver gets a radio call about a fare and picks up the hand-held unit to answer it, will that constitute a breach of the law? The Minister of State should answer those questions in the House.</P>
    <P>As to the implementation of those regulations, it is stated that &ldquo;the person shall not hold, or have on or about their person, a mobile phone or other similar apparatus while in the said vehicle, except when it is parked&rdquo;. What does that mean? Does it mean they cannot have it in their clothing? If it is left on the passenger seat or on the dashboard, is that &ldquo;on or about their person&rdquo;? The Minister of State has said the regulations do not apply if the phone is switched off. Therefore, if a person has a mobile phone in his pocket and it is switched off, it is not prosecutable. In those circumstances, an unfortunate garda would have to take a very close look at the driver's pocket to see if the mobile phone was vibrating. That is in <Col N="80" /> the realms of &ldquo;Is that a mobile phone or are you just glad to see me?&rdquo; legislation. This is crazy.</P>
    <P>The regulations also state that it is not open to a garda to search a driver for possession of a mobile phone. A driver might say the device in his pocket is not a mobile phone but something else &ndash; perhaps a pencil case &ndash; and the garda cannot do anything to establish what it is. Even if a person is seen with a mobile phone held to his ear, it is easy to turn it off at the touch of a button.</P>
    <P>If one spots a garda out of the corner of one's eye, one need only press the &ldquo;off&rdquo; button. If the garda says he saw you with the phone to your ear you can say you were just scratching your ear with the aerial. Implementation of this regulation will be impossible. It is laughable stuff because it was rushed through and has not been properly considered by the Legislature. The Minister of State has run away.</P>
    <P>There is a case for addressing the use of mobile phones from a road safety point of view. It is certainly a problem if a person is travelling at high speed and attempting to use a mobile phone, or if they are in heavy traffic and attempting to hold a mobile phone, steer, change gear, manage the hand brake and so on. We need regulation and legislation that is sensible in dealing with the problems that exist and is capable of being implemented. This looks like a regulation that was written on the back of a cigarette packet and that has been rushed out in order to meet a public relations deadline or a political requirement on the part of the Minister of State, rather than to address a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should withdraw the regulation and bring it back to the House as primary legislation in order that it can be examined calmly. We need to take advice on this matter from the Garda and to consult with the emergency services. The advice of the National Safety Council is also required in order to have a considered debate in the House which would result in the introduction of sensible, enforceable regulations which will be understood by the public. Otherwise this will make a laughing stock of the Government, the Minister of State who introduced them and, ultimately, the country. If we end up with a measure that makes no sense, is riddled with inconsistencies and anomalies and is incapable of being implemented, the country will become a laughing stock. Will the Minister of State please withdraw the regulations and the proposal before the House today and let us deal with it in a calm and sensible way?</P>

      <P>I do not know about that. It is interesting that a similar debate is taking place in the UK at the moment. On a Sky news programme this morning, a poll showed that 80% of respondents were in favour of banning the use of mobile phones while driving, a result which has changed very little during the day. On the same programme a woman was interviewed whose child had been run over by somebody who had been on the phone and did not see the child on the street. The person in question admitted their guilt, was fined £200 and had six penalty points awarded. If this woman were to give evidence to the committee, she would have other thoughts about the matter.</P>
      <P>I am most concerned at the use of mobile phones by drivers. I have witnessed people crossing dangerous junctions while on the phone and, even worse, I have seen huge container trucks hurtling along at 50 or 60 miles an hour while their drivers hold mobile phones to their ears. Not only are they using the phones inappropriately, they are also exceeding the speed limit in many cases.</P>

They are among those who are most interested in trying to prevent regulations such as this being passed by the Dáil. I urge the Deputies to ask their constituents what they think as most people admit to a concern about it. Several remarks were made which were a little bit low in regard to the officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government who obviously prepared these regulations. It was implied that no consideration was given and things are being read into these regulations that are not there. No judge is going to find a person guilty who had a phone in his or her pocket or on the car seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a hands-free unit in my car which has an automatic answering device. It answers automatically after two rings &ndash; one does not even have to press a button to answer it.

I would be interested to know how many reports have been made to the Garda about people driving dangerously with mobile phones and how many accidents have been caused as a result &ndash; not where people are injured, but just damage to cars because people were not looking where they were going. I have seen people on junction boxes holding up the traffic while speaking on their phones. It is absolutely outrageous how some people behave on the road.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation as will the public. We have all been horrified at the number of accidents on our roads and I only wish there was more enforcement by the Garda. If I am critical of the Garda for anything, it is for the lack of enforcement of the laws on speeding. I travel here via the Chapelizod bypass and only one morning every three or four months will one see a garda with a radar gun pulling somebody over to the side of the road. Container trucks and cars fly along at 70 miles per hour in a 50 miles per hour zone. If one can catch the people who exceed the 30 miles per hour speed limit in towns the number of accidents will reduce. Whatever about a 20 miles per hour limit, most of those who are speeding are travelling at speeds well in excess of 30 miles per hour.</P>
      <P>I have longed for the speeding fine to be increased to &euro;500 as it is paltry at the moment. If one really wants to get the message across, a substantial fine of &euro;500 will make people pay attention. Any firm that intends to pay a fine for its employee, particularly if they are higher management, will balk at that sum. That is the only way to do it. Speed kills, as does inattention while driving. I know from experience that even pressing a button on the dashboard when driving requires that one to take one's eyes off the road. It is very dangerous and we should welcome the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies should seek their constituents' opinions on this matter and should not expect members of the press to support this measure. It will not because of its vested interest. Journalists often have to take calls on their phones; they have to be on the spot wherever they think a story is going to break.</P>

      <P>This debate has taken on the appearance of high farce. It has convulsed the media, everybody seems to be thrown into confusion and there is great hilarity about the whole thing. There is inconsistency between ministerial <Col N="84" /> announcements from one day to the next and the announcements of the Garda. No one in this House seems to know what is being proposed and the Garda has said that it will not be able to prosecute anyone under the legislation.</P>
      <P>While people have talked about this with great hilarity, it is a serious issue and it will reflect badly on all of us if we cannot ensure that legislation enacted by this House is enforceable. People are entitled to clarity about the law. They are entitled to know when they are breaking it and when they are obeying it. Deputy Briscoe seems to think we are opposed to a ban on the use of mobile phones in cars, but we are not. We do not want people to use their phones when driving, but this provision will not achieve that. The Garda has said that it will not be able to enforce it.</P>
      <P>The point that has been missed is that this offence will incur penalty points, to be imposed automatically. It is not up to the Garda to decide if there is to be a prosecution or not. One cannot tell the camera on which the offence is recorded that one was only scratching one's head with the phone. One will not get the chance to make one's defence until one gets to court, at which point one will already have attracted penalty points. In the case of anything that is going to attract automatic penalty points it is important to be clear about whether an offence has been committed.</P>
      <P>For reasons best known to himself, the Minister has made a total dog's dinner of this. God knows, he has thought about this long and hard enough. Deputy Naughten said that this was first spoken about three years ago and the Minister himself spoke about it last autumn, yet he is introducing this amendment at the last minute. Why is it a rush job? What on earth possessed the Minister to bring in this last minute amendment, particularly as he is not even here to defend it? One can only come to the conclusion that he wants to mask the fact that we are passing legislation to introduce penalty points when there is no system in place to impose them, nor will there be for several years. The Minister introduces the headline grabbing issue of mobile phones but makes a dog's dinner of it. In blaming the media for this, Deputy Briscoe went a little bit far.</P>

      <P>I do not know where the Minister is today, but perhaps he has legitimate business elsewhere. Even if he were here, he could not defend this regulation. As Deputy Naughten pointed out, the regulation is inconsistent with the Bill before the House. It is a complete mess and the only way to go forward is to withdraw it. At the very least the activity should not incur penalty points even if it has to remain an offence which, as the regulation has been signed, is a matter for the Minister to decide. However, let us not pass further legislation to compound the problem the Minister has created.</P>
      <P>It cannot be made a criminal offence to carry or transport a mobile phone, yet it appears that is what is being attempted. Use of mobile phones is a very important safety issue for women, a number of whom have contacted me in the past few days extremely upset to find they are not allowed to have their mobile phones in their cars. I sought to reassure them that, surely, that is not what the Minister intends. We have discussed whether the phone should be kept in our pockets or in our handbags and have decided that if we kept it in the boot we could not be arrested. These things must be made clear to the public. For women it is important, as a safety issue, that they are allowed to transport mobile phones and to have access to them near, or about, their persons should they run into difficulties.</P>
      <P>We owe it to the public to introduce clear and enforceable legislation. People should know when they are breaking the law. I know we have made jokes about it, but it is a very serious issue. I ask the Minister of State to withdraw this amendment to allow us to go back to the drawing board to consider this matter.</P>

      <P>I have sourced information for Deputy Naughten which I did not address at yesterday's meeting. On 19 March, regulations were made which are intended to prevent the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving about which there has been considerable speculation. The regulations clearly establish the offence of use of mobile phones by persons driving mechanically propelled vehicles. Driving while using a mobile phone is a safety risk because of the inherent distraction. The distraction is compounded in the case of a hand-held set and, for that clear reason, the regulations focus on the use of such sets. It is not an offence for drivers to have switched-off phones in their pockets. The House will be interested to note that, as reported on RTE this morning, research carried out by the transport research laboratory in the UK indicates that the use of hand-held mobile phones creates a definite risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" />The Garda Síochána has issued a formal statement welcoming the regulations and confirming that they will be enforced. It states: &ldquo;The Garda Síochána welcomes any legislation which is designed to reduce road carnage.&rdquo;  The statement goes on to say that the new legislation concerning the use of mobile phones in cars came into effect at midnight on Thursday, 20 March, and is being examined by the Garda. The content of the regulation will be disseminated through the organisation for the purpose of enforcement.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers to the penalty points. The regulations are in place. They are law and they are being enforced. Deputy Gilmore said that joyriding and speed limits were not a priority for the Government. These issues are covered by existing legislation&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the regulation and the offence relates to the use of mobile phones. Paragraph 4 of the regulation states that the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle that is in a public place shall not hold or have on or about his or her person a mobile phone or any other similar apparatus while in the vehicle except when it is parked. There is no mention of the word &ldquo;use&rdquo;. It simply refers to the phone being on or about the person.</P>
      <P>The amendment before the House makes sense in its general description but it contradicts what is in the regulations produced by the Minister. The word &ldquo;use&rdquo; does not occur in the regulation. This is something that has been pulled out of the hat by the Minister, Deputy Molloy, at the last minute to cover up the fact that he has failed to introduce the road safety strategy over the past four and a half years. He is not even here to defend the regulation. Solicitors will have a field day with this regulation. It is a smokescreen. I urge the Minister to amend the regulation so that it specifies use of the phone rather than the phone being on or about a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the introduction of regulations which would control the use of mobile phones in cars. There is a road safety issue which must be addressed. The problem is that the way <Col N="87" /> the Government is doing it is ineffective, confused and will lead to problems. It is also belated. The Minister's response to the debate does not shed light on the subject. He referred to the Garda statement. That statement does not appear to be enthusiastically endorsing these regulations. The statement welcomed any measure which will lead to road safety. It went on to say that the organisation is examining the regulations and will pass them on to the gardaí. That is not exactly a ringing endorsement of what is being proposed.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's comments on the use of mobile phones or having possession of a mobile phone with regard to the issue of safety, particularly for women. It is an important consideration. The way these regulations are drafted means we are not talking about the use of the mobile phone. What is being penalised is not answering or making a call while driving but having a mobile phone which is turned on in the car. Somebody who has a mobile phone in a handbag on the passenger seat or on the dashboard or inside the door pocket of the car is therefore liable to prosecution. What we have is legislation that has not been fully thought through.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe accused Members on this side of the House of criticising the officers of the Department. I did not do so and I did not hear any other Member commenting on the staff of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, for whom we have enormous respect. The Minister has political responsibility for these regulations. He signed them, announced them and introduced them. It is his problem. It is a bad regulation and bad legislation. I predict that the House will have to come back to this issue within the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>I welcome the statement from the Garda. The regulations are drafted by the officials and the Minister always takes responsibility for what is put before him. I do not consider these regulations half cocked. They are sound and examination will show that. However, I hope the Minister clarifies the point about possession of a phone in a car. All members of my family have mobile phones, particularly my daughters. In the event of a woman being under attack or fearful, she can call the gardaí in an emergency on her mobile phone. This should be covered by the regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify that point? I am not sure that he will satisfy the Deputies opposite, particularly in Fine Gael. Deputy Gilmore, as a former Minister of State in that Department, understands how the Department works. It would be helpful if the Minister of State would clarify the point about possession of a phone in a car or on one's person and, second, the issue of whether somebody is exempt from the regulations in the event of an attack and if they are dialling an <Col N="88" /> emergency services number. I do not believe the police will prosecute if one is dialling the emergency services.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I apologise for being a little late. I thought, based on the way business was going on here, that it would last until 4 p.m. This is a very short but important Bill and I hope it can be dealt with expeditiously by the House. As set out in section 3, it is proposed to increase the maximum State shareholding in Arramara Teoranta to &euro;1.2 million to enable a major rescue and refinancing programme for the company in line with Government decisions and agreement between the shareholders.</P>
      <P>Arramara Teoranta was established as a joint venture in 1947 to produce seaweed meal for use in the alginate industry. The company is 51% owned by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources on behalf of the Government, with the balance of shares held by ISP Alginates, UK, which is based in Scotland. The company has experienced trading difficulties in the past few years due to a downturn in the global alginate market. The company had, until recently, operated two facilities, one at Cill Chiaráin, County Galway, and another at Meenmore, County Donegal, and directly employed 34 staff, with up to 400 people involved in seasonal seaweed harvesting along the western seaboard. Consequent on major changes in the international marketplace, Arramara Teoranta ran into trading difficulties starting in 1999, which accelerated in 2000 and 2001, with mounting financial losses which are reflected in its accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a detailed examination and a thoroughgoing evaluation of the company's position carried out by a team of business advisers <Col N="91" /> appointed by the Department, the Government agreed to a restructuring of the company's operations, which involved closure of the company's plant in Donegal and the loss of 15 jobs. The restructuring was carried out with the full backing of the shareholders and was undertaken with a view to restoring the company's financial health and ensuring its long-term viability. I hope the measures taken to date and those planned will help to develop the company and secure its position.</P>
    <P>As part of the restructuring measures, the Government, in association with ISP Alginates, the minority shareholder, has approved a significant financing package for the company based on a detailed business plan covering the period up to 2006, drawn up by the company with the help of its business advisers. Over &euro;500,000 has been applied in meeting redundancy costs, incurred as a result of the plant closure, together with other awards by the Labour Relations Commission, LRC. This amount has been funded in the interim by bank facilities negotiated by the company. A further &euro;800,000 is required to upgrade the factory premises at Cill Chiaráin and to install new equipment there to meet future development needs to allow the company develop and diversify into added-value products. The necessary arrangements are currently being put in train and will be fully activated subject to the Bill being approved by the House.</P>
    <P>The current economic contribution of the Irish seaweed industry is estimated to be as much as &euro;11 million in value annually. Some 87% of this turnover can be accounted for in export sales. The intention is that Arramara Teoranta, as the largest indigenous seaweed producer in the country will be well placed to take advantage of emerging trends in the value-added and high-tech sector.</P>
    <P>I am confident, moreover, that with this much needed investment, Arramara Teoranta will have a bright and financially secure future and that the jobs in its plant and those of its suppliers, who are mainly located in Gaeltacht areas, can be secured. It is clear that Arramara Teoranta has suffered over time from chronic underfunding and lack of strategic business focus which has militated against levels of investment, re-equipment and planning to meet the changing requirements of the global seaweed market. What is being proposed now should set the company on a firm course for the immediate future and into the longer term.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to secure an alternative enterprise for the Meenmore plant involving the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, who has devoted much time to this project. In discussions with her today, she assured me that she intends to continue to <Col N="92" /> find a replacement industry. Helped by Údarás na Gaeltachta, Arramara Teoranta is continuing to source supplies of seaweed in Donegal. In recent months, the company has experienced difficulties in getting hauliers to undertake transport of the seaweed at realistic and commercially competitive rates. The company is currently working to develop alternative, satisfactory arrangements. These proposals are critical to the future of Arramara Teoranta and the Irish seaweed sector. I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is canvassing and I am here, I will be very annoyed, but I do not think so. The Bill is significant because it enables the Minister to invest up to &euro;1.2 million. Any venture of that scale is of significance both to the taxpayer and ourselves. It deserves fairly close attention and scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State clarify a number of issues for me because I had not heard of the existence of this company until yesterday? It came as a surprise to me, not least that we were considering a fairly significant investment in it. It surprised me that there was such a State company and that the State was such a major shareholder in this company. The overwhelming question that occurred to me concerns why, in 2002, the State is involving itself in the processing of seaweed. Furthermore, why is it considering further involvement in the processing of seaweed?</P>
      <P>This company is older than me, and there are not many such companies in the country. I can understand why, in the 1940s, when there were precious few other investors available, the State became involved in a project such as this and why it took the initiative, particularly because it could capitalise on any potential for employment offered by a natural resource that was freely available. That was understandable at a time when there was little employment in the area and considerable emigration. We have moved on and the State is now divesting itself of State and semi-State companies with varying degrees of success. It is now generally recognised that competitiveness, efficiency and employment are all better served and that the customer gets a better product and service from private competitive companies than through direct State provision or State financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could this 50 year old company not look elsewhere for investment rather than to the nanny State? I would ask this question whether the company were successful or in need of help. Would it not be better for future employment prospects, <Col N="93" /> for the better use of a natural resource and for the general success of the company to allow it the market freedom and drive to competitiveness and efficiency which the private sector can bring? I ask these questions with no preconceived ideas about the company, about which I confess I know nothing other than what the Minister of State has told us.</P>
    <P>This measure appears to be contrary to the views on the efficiency of the private sector being expressed by the Government, particularly by the Progressive Democrat element. I cannot believe that after 50 years the State has developed any particular expertise in the use of seaweed. The State's contribution to this enterprise is merely a financial one. There is no shortage of investors for an enterprise with any prospect of profitability and a private partner would probably be more successful than the State.</P>
    <P>This is enabling legislation but I assume from what the Minister of State has said that the State intends to make the full &euro;1.2 million investment and to take the full shareholding. This is not quite clear from the legislation. I understand that the State is currently a 51% shareholder. If it is now to increase its shareholding, is it not reasonable to expect a concomitant investment from the other principals involved in proportion to their current share in the company? Are the other shareholders making no investment at all? Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify this point.</P>
    <P>What are the main features of the business plan on which the restructuring and the capital development plan is based? Until last year, another plant was operating in Donegal employing 20 people, all of whom lost their jobs at that time. They received redundancy payments when the company decided to concentrate its activities in the Galway plant. The harvesters of seaweed, who had been supplying for more than 30 years, are aggrieved that promises made to them have not been fulfilled and they regard the citing of transport difficulties as an excuse not to take their product. Does the planned restructuring involve an expansion of output? This would mean there would be a greater demand for seaweed and it would then be commercially viable to transport seaweed from Donegal to Galway. That would be welcome news to the harvesters of Donegal who have lost their livelihoods, and an expression of the seriousness of the commitment given to them when the Donegal plant was closed.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the general direction in which the company's new plans will take it. Does it intend to diversify and engage in new product development? The Minister of State has told us that &euro;800,000 is to be spent on upgrading the plant. Is the plant to be revamped for the purpose of diversification? All companies must look to the future and be alert to changing markets for their products. Seaweed is a versatile product widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. Health care <Col N="94" /> is a growth industry and there could be a great future therein for seaweed.</P>
    <P>The company also manufactures fertiliser and I am concerned about the market for seaweed as a fertiliser. As a result of the EU water quality directives the dumping of sewage into the sea is now prohibited. The Dublin Bay area plan, for example, does not allow for the emission of untreated waste water. More significantly, waste solids can no longer be dumped at sea. They are now heat dried, formed into granules and sold as fertiliser, primarily in the south-east of the country. This process will become extremely widespread. It is the only option for the disposal of waste solids, which all local authorities must dispose of. There will be little demand for fertiliser from any other source, in Ireland or elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose the Bill. The company has outstanding debts of &euro;500,000 and needs to be restructured. I regret that the other shareholders appear to be depending entirely on the State to provide both for the company's debts and for its future viability. However, I return to my contention that the State should not be involved in such a venture. It has no expertise in this area and no strategic justification for its involvement. The investment is necessary but only as a step towards putting the company on a sound financial footing so that it can be sold to the private sector where it might prosper and thrive.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for staying around. There are not too many people in the House this afternoon. I compliment her on that and on being so frank and honest about her knowledge of the subject. If one does not live in a coastal area it is difficult to know what is going on. I live on the Hook Peninsula in County Wexford. When I was growing up I saw farmers take seaweed off the shoreline. It was called wore and was used for fertiliser. It is a natural resource and we should use it.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach appointed me to my current position, he said I should create as many jobs as possible in remote rural areas and I set about doing that in the areas of aquaculture and fisheries generally. Seaweed is a resource that should be tapped into and I am pleased the Government did so as far back as 1947. It has used a natural resource to create a number of jobs in remote rural areas and allowed parishes in such areas to remain alive. It is bringing in reasonable wealth to such parishes. The seaweed industry is worth &euro;11 million annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell asked some very pertinent questions. Because &euro;11 million is not a small sum and because it goes into remote rural areas, that in itself is important. It is very difficult to find private investors. As a consequence of building up the industry and giving it new prospects, I hope we will be able to secure private funding, and that is the Government's intention. However, we cannot force anyone to do so and in the meantime the Government must keep the seaweed <Col N="95" /> industry alive because of its contribution to the remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>ISP, which stands for International Specialty Products, is based in Scotland. We are lucky to have a partner and I hope it will remain with us. It has invested about &euro;300,000 in this new scheme. Its product is used for food. After extraction and purification alginates are used to produce thickeners, stabilisers and gelling agents. It is also used in animal feed and organic fertiliser. In these days people like to hear of organic materials and this is an ideal way to go back to the future. It is also used in the mushroom industry and for prescription medicines, and iodine can be extracted from it. Algin can be used as cattle food and for soil <Col N="96" /> conditioning, and because it is organic it should be more widely used.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for coming in and for her contribution. The Bill is necessary to keep the industry alive.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
