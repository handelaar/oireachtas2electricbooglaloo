    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, and Question No. 26 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 11 on 5 February, the agenda for the Barcelona summit has yet to be confirmed. However, Spain has set five priorities for the Barcelona European Council. These are the financial markets action plan; labour market mobility and the reform of the labour market; life long education; energy liberalisation and telecommunications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considered this issue before <Col N="575" /> Christmas and it is clear that Ireland's priorities are strongly in line with the Spanish Presidency's. At Barcelona, we will aim to give added impetus to the work for sustained economic growth, with increased sustainable employment opportunities and greater social cohesion. We will also call for tight deadlines to make the financial services internal market a reality, as this will make access to capital cheaper, give pension funds more scope for investment and profit, and boost our financial services sector. We will also raise the issue of consumer protection in this sector. Ongoing and detailed consideration is being given to other issues that can be progressed at Barcelona.</P>
    <P>Since the Lisbon European Council in 2000, spring European Councils have focused on progressing the work programme set at Lisbon. This is a wide-ranging programme aimed at making the EU the most dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010. While the question of Ireland's ratification of the Treaty of Nice will not be a matter for formal discussion at Barcelona, this matter is obviously of considerable interest and importance to all EU member states and the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>I expect, therefore, that I will have an opportunity in Barcelona to share with my colleagues at the European Council the efforts being undertaken through the political process and the work of the National Forum on Europe to listen to the views of the Irish people so that the Government can be in a better position to identify genuine concerns which need to be addressed and decide how best this can be done. It would be inappropriate to hold substantive discussions at this time with my EU colleagues on procedures that would be followed if Ireland does not ratify the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>As regards the Laeken European Council and the priorities of the Convention on the Future of Europe established at the Council, I refer the Deputy to my statement to the House on the matter on 30 January. Prime Minister Blair and I did not have detailed discussions at this meeting. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has nominated Ray MacSharry as Government representative to the convention and Bobby McDonagh, Director General of the European Union division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, as alternate. The convention can play a crucial role over the next year in making the EU more relevant to the people of Europe. I am certain that Ray MacSharry, with his vast experience and excellent record in European affairs, will make a positive and constructive contribution to the work of the convention on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the nomination by the Oireachtas of Deputies Proinsias De Rossa and John Bruton as Ireland's parliamentary representatives to the convention. I congratulate Deputy John Bruton on his election to the presidium of the convention. I also welcome the nomination of Deputy John Gormley and the <Col N="576" /> Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, as alternates. The procedure employed in selecting Ireland's parliamentary representatives is a matter for the Oireachtas itself and, as such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the selection process.</P>
    <P>On 6 February I met Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia on his first visit to Ireland. Our meeting afforded us the opportunity to review the excellent relations between our two countries. I was able to reaffirm Ireland's deep commitment to Africa and Ethiopia in particular and to the tackling of poverty and exclusion. There is firm support among the Irish people for helping developing countries to break out of poverty traps. Ethiopia is a priority country for Ireland Aid and Prime Minister Meles was able to brief me on the ongoing projects funded by the Irish Government. These projects help to provide much needed services in health and education. Prime Minister Meles expressed his appreciation for our help and assistance over the years, particularly by Irish missionaries and linked NGOs. Both the Government of Ireland and the Government of Ethiopia are satisfied with the level of partnership and co-operation under the assistance programmes.</P>
    <P>On 19 February I received a visit from the Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr. Viktor Orbán. He departed for Brussels immediately after our meeting. The Prime Minister and I discussed our excellent bilateral relations and noted that trade between Ireland and Hungary is rapidly expanding. We both welcomed this positive trend. I congratulated the Prime Minister on the progress of Hungary's European accession negotiations. Hungary is one of the leaders in the enlargement negotiations and we are fully confident that it will be among the candidate countries to join the EU in 2004. In this context, we discussed the Commission's proposals for transitional arrangements for the candidate countries. I offered the Prime Minister all practical assistance necessary towards facilitating a smooth integration process. The Prime Minister is satisfied that the outstanding issues in the accession negotiations can be resolved by the end of the year. The Prime Minister and I discussed the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty. I emphasised that Ireland remains strongly committed to the European Union and to the enlargement process. The Hungarian Government firmly believes that ratification of the Nice treaty is essential if enlargement is to proceed.</P>
    <P>On 20 February I had a short meeting with the Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr. Benita Ferrero-Waldner. We discussed our excellent bilateral relations and looked forward to full co-operation in progressing the European agenda in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The cost arising to my Department to date from my official visits to Brazil from 18 to 22 July and to Argentina from 22 to 24 July is &euro;149,303, but has not yet been finalised. In addition, an air taxi was chartered by the Department of Defence <Col N="577" /> for travel within and between Brazil and Argentina. The cost of the air taxi was &euro;242,455. A breakdown of the costs to date is available in the following table, which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in congratulating those who have been nominated to the European Convention and the alternates. I congratulate Deputy John Bruton on his election to the presidium of the convention. The former Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, is the Government representative. Will the Taoiseach tell the House what mandate the Government has given him? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. MacSharry's role will be to work and build on the Irish agenda which has been put forward by me and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a number of public speeches. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has outlined it in the House on a number of occasions. We would prefer if most of the discussions stayed within the four or five categories which have been designated for discussion on the future of Europe, but we accept and acknowledge that these will expand into other areas. From our perspective and that of the country, it will be important in the debate on the future of Europe that, while accepting that we are planning for the development, evolution and extension of the EU with a possible eventual membership of almost 30 countries, we must also accept that the way we operate must undergo substantial changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe in the current system and the strength of the Commission. We are working to ensure that the Commission retains its predominantly strong role. The Commission has always been important for small countries such as Ireland and we want to see it maintain that position and enhance its role. The latter is a necessary step. We want to develop our relationship with the European Parliament in a way which will ensure that the Parliament becomes more accountable, transparent and accessible to people living in the European Union. A number of pro<Col N="578" /> posals and suggestions have also been put forward with regard to how the European Council and the subsidiary councils should operate.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacSharry will be outlining our position in respect of these matters &ndash; I have already placed such information in the public domain. He will be articulating our view on the importance of the Commission, our relationship with the Parliament and the role of the European Council, and indicating how we believe these institutions can work and interact with each other in the future. This will be done in the context of the agenda set down at Laeken by the European Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach stating that Mr. MacSharry, in representing the Government, will be putting forward its view and not advancing his personal view? If, as I understand from the Taoiseach's reply, that is the case, will he indicate for the record three or four of the Government's specific priorities on which Mr. MacSharry will place emphasis at the convention? I know he will refer to the Parliament, how it relates to Ministers etc., but will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government has specific objectives and, if so, what are they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume Deputy Noonan is aware that four or five areas have been set down for discussion when the debate opens. We will have to see how the debate evolves and develops. No one has yet indicated how it is intended to approach the debate. We are not merely discussing the Parliament and the Commission, we are concerned with Europe as a whole. The debate will focus on how we interact with Parliament, how the European Council interacts with it and how the Commission will develop. We will also be concerned with discussing how the role of the Commission can be protected and enhanced and that recent efforts to rein it in will not be allowed to continue. We will take a strong stance in terms of supporting the role of the Commission.</P>
      <P>These are the fundamental issues around which the debate will revolve. A number of leaders, Foreign Ministers and others participating in the convention have made speeches about the role of the Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the other councils. The kernel of the issue is how we are going to manage the expansion of membership of the European Union from 15 to 27 and how the new Union will develop and function. When expansion takes place, for example, will we be able to continue to operate as we do at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan is correct that Mr. MacSharry &ndash; Bobby McDonagh will be our alternate representative &ndash; will be emphasising the Government's position and not his own. We must watch how the debate evolves. We have been considering what the chairperson and some of the members of the new presidium have been saying. The convention begins on Thursday. If the Deputy is asking what is our most fundamental <Col N="579" /> point of interest in this debate, it is our support for the evolving role of the Commission in the future. Having monitored the operations of the European Council in the 15 years since I first became involved in it, I believe that the matters to which I have referred and the right of initiation of the Commission are of fundamental interest to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to put to the Taoiseach arising from his comprehensive reply. First, following on what he has said, is it the intention of the Government to publish a position paper or other documentation which the Government representative, former Commissioner, Minister and Deputy, Mr. Ray MacSharry, may include in the debate in the convention so that we would see from this perspective what is the formal Government position beyond what the Taoiseach has touched on in his reply? My second question relates to the Barcelona summit of the Council. It is quite obvious there will be an informal discussion at the Council as to progress with regard to ratification of the Nice treaty in all member states. No doubt, the Taoiseach will be asked to update the situation in Ireland with the other member states. What does he intend to say to his colleagues, the Heads of Government, in Barcelona as to how Ireland intends to proceed to enable enlargement to take place following the report of the Forum on Europe which Senator Maurice Hayes published yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's first question, I believe the best approach is for the Government representatives and parliamentary representatives to liaise on what we are doing. As the group representing this country is relatively small, the more co-operation and co-ordination we can achieve in relation to our plans, the better. If that means publishing material on some of the issues, that can be considered but the group should work closely together. It will be a demanding and very time-consuming task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach regard the Government representatives and their opposite numbers as constituting an integrated group? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not. I have made it clear in my reply that they are two separate groups but it is in the interests of the country that the small group we have should co-operate in this matter rather than work against each other. Even if they do not agree on everything, as no doubt they will not, they should still work together as, to my knowledge, the Government and parliamentary representatives of other countries intend doing.

      <P>In relation to Nice, I hope to have an opportunity to bring them up to date. I <Col N="580" /> do this through bilateral meetings and by telephone contact whenever I have the opportunity, which occurs regularly. I will bring them through what we have done since last summer, particularly since last Christmas. I will make them aware of the report published yesterday and of the proceedings of the forum, which their Ambassadors have been following with interest, as the Deputy is aware, through their regular attendance at the forum. I will also brief them on our research, the results of opinion poll surveys following the Nice referendum and the issues about which people were concerned. I believe the position of people on the enlargement issue is now quite clear and I will also deal with the other issues. I will convey my view that the majority of people do not wish to block enlargement, that we must proceed to ratify the Nice treaty and facilitate the arrangements which must take place before the end of this year and that it is our intention to work to that agenda. I also hope to explore, perhaps informally, some of the areas, format and procedure on which it may be possible to get the agreement of other member states. We know the areas on which we will not get agreement but there are some legal issues we need to explore to see if we can get agreement on them.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend telling his colleagues in Barcelona that Ireland looks to the emergence of a declaration from the Seville summit at the end of June to allay Irish fears expressed during the course of the Nice campaign with regard to military engagement, conscription and forced participation in some European military organisation? While they were not part of the contents of the Treaty of Nice they were nevertheless part of the debate that surrounded it here.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to indicate to his colleagues in Barcelona that Ireland is expecting a declaration &ndash; perhaps subsequently a protocol &ndash; and will he outline what that declaration might contain because it is presumably not his intention to allow the other member states guess what we want? Rather, I imagine it is his intention to indicate to them what he believes we need to ensure the successful ratification of the Treaty of Nice and to allay the fears which were clearly expressed in the course of the referendum campaign this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn knows I have already made a number of those suggestions and proposals elsewhere and the general answer to his question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Precisely how that can be done will have to be discussed and explored with the legal services &ndash; centrally around the issue of neutrality. As I have said numerous times in the forum process as it moved around the country, whatever we do we need the agreement and support of the other member states and they have indicated time and again that they will support us once we are not opening up the negotiation of the agreement. I have no doubt the legal services <Col N="581" /> will make it clear to us that we cannot start changing the Treaty of Nice in any way. However, as the Deputy says, these are issues which were not part of the Treaty of Nice but formed part of the decision made by people who rejected it.</P>
      <P>In the European Cabinet subcommittee we have been working with officials and examining how we might best go through this. In the best interests of the organisation of this, at Barcelona I will probably get a brief opportunity to convey where we are at and where we want to go but it will be the Seville summit before the negotiations are complete.</P>

      <P>I am trying to clarify what the Taoiseach said because he was asked if the group would act together and he said he did not accept that. I want to clarify this since there is a view that the people who rejected the Treaty of Nice are not represented in numerical terms in that convention membership.</P>
      <P>In relation to the discussions the Taoiseach will have in Barcelona regarding ratification or otherwise of the Treaty of Nice, I assume there will be discussions on the possibility of the Irish people ratifying it, but will there be discussions on the implications if there is a second rejection of the treaty particularly following the comment by Senator Maurice Hayes as chairman of the forum that there is widespread frustration over the possibility of the Treaty of Nice referendum being re-run unchanged? Will the Taoiseach give us an indication of the views he will express if the treaty is rejected? </P>
      <P>In relation to the subject matter of the Barcelona meeting, as the Taoiseach referred to earlier, it will be economic issues only that will be dealt with. I understand from reports from the director of the European Environment Agency that the Barcelona summit was to include both economic and environmental issues but that only economic issues will be presented. Will the Taoiseach comment on his view of the seriousness of the information given by the European Environment Agency which, to quote the director, has some unpleasant facts on environmental developments &ndash; particularly in relation to greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; which may not now come to light? Is the Taoiseach aware of that? I believe Commissioner de Palacio is to go to Barcelona to seek a commitment on pushing the development of nuclear energy in the European Union. Is the Taoiseach aware of that? Is there an Irish position and, if so, what is it?</P>

      <P>Other than that, these people work well together. The agenda issues have been set by the Presidency, however, since the Lisbon Summit when the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr. Guterres, got agreement that at the spring session, Europe should concentrate on the agenda to make Europe the most dynamic economy and a council framework was set out for this. The intention is to concentrate on such issues as competitiveness, technology, education and a host of other related areas. Each period since then, some of these issues have been the focus of getting agreements, and then people benchmark their progress against them. This process is to continue throughout this decade up to 2010.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the issues for priority are the financial markets plan which has been under negotiation for some considerable time, the change in labour market mobility due to the enlargement process and the agreements that have been based on that, the reform of the labour market itself, life long education, energy liberalisation and telecommunications, which has also been on the agenda for some time. The Spanish President, Mr. Aznar, is particularly trying to make progress on the latter point.</P>
      <P>They have been on the agenda for some years. That does not change any of the other issues on the Kyoto Protocol or any of the other environment issues that are being discussed and, as Deputy Sargent knows, are getting a great deal of attention at EU level through the environment ministers.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Taoiseach has said the Spanish Presidency wants to push the liberalisation of labour laws and the deregulation of industries such as energy. Is the Taoiseach aware that this is code for an attack on workers rights within the EU and for further wholesale privatisation of public assets? Publicly owned companies such as Aer Lingus and the ESB can be sold to trans-national corporations removed from the social control of the Irish people. Is the Taoiseach aware that the Californian experiment has proved that deregulation of the energy market has been disastrous? If so, why is the Government going along with the EU herd in this regard, rather than standing up and pointing out some truths about the problems that will appear down the line?</P>
      <P>When he described the priorities of the Spanish Presidency, why did the Taoiseach not mention that the Spanish Prime Minister spoke to the European Parliament recently of a core issue of converting the so-called fight against terrorism into the task of a European military force? Is the Taoiseach aware of the possibility of the EU rapid reaction force being drawn into this fight against terrorism, which is being led by the USA, a country that feels free to attack Iraq and others? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Spanish Government wants to place anti-globalisation protesters in the same category as terrorists who fly planes into buildings?</P>
      <P>In view of these points, is the Taoiseach aware of serious concerns among many here arising from the stated intention of the Spanish Defence Minister that there should be a European arms industry? What is being mooted is that the EU should keep pace with the arms spending of the United States of America, in other words, he wishes to start a new arms race, this time between Europe and the USA. Will the Government go along meekly with this push toward militarisation or will it stand up and reflect the views and concerns of the majority of people who are against it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally disagree with the Deputy in the matter of his first question. The rights of workers have been enshrined in EU law since the Treaty of Rome enabling them to make substantive progress. Success in the fight for health and safety, equality and protection of workers' rights would not have been achieved were it not for the enhancements in EU law. Social policy has been one of the great issues of <Col N="584" /> progress in Europe. The Social Affairs Council has been very progressive, working with employers and trades unions for decades, certainly since Dr. Hillary, ex-President and former Member of this House, took office as Commissioner with special responsibility for social affairs. Every subsequent Commissioner continued to enhance and extend the rights of workers. I compare that to the old regimes of eastern Europe where workers were given a few hours' work with no rights. They were given peanuts and told they were part of the system of labour. I disagree entirely with the Deputy.</P>

Has the Taoiseach undertaken negotiations with his European colleagues with a view to identifying the best options in those circumstances?

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the issue of what should go into the declaration is primarily one for debate in this House and, indeed, in the Forum on Europe? Is it his intention, following the completion of the first phase of the Forum on Europe with yesterday's publication of the report of Senator Hayes, that the Government will indicate the content of a declaration in dialogue with those participants in the forum who opposed the Nice treaty on the grounds that, in <Col N="585" /> their eyes, it compromised our neutrality?

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept it has been as plain as a pikestaff from the beginning, since last June, that one of the major issues of concern to people abstaining or voting against the Treaty of Nice was neutrality and the militarisation of the EU? Whether this was a perception or a misconception, call it what one may, it was there, and does he not agree that to deal with that perception or misconception action has been and is necessary and is becoming more necessary by the day? There is a need for action at European level in the form of a declaration, possibly coupled, following the Danish precedent, with a commitment to a protocol but, more importantly, at domestic level possibly, with an amendment of the Defence Act or a White Paper on neutrality. Has the Taoiseach considered doing these things and has he considered the time which would be needed to put these measures into operation? Does he not realise that the window of opportunity is closing by the day, with the general election and the summer recess approaching, the referendum will be held and then it will be autumn?</P>

When the Taoiseach goes to Barcelona will he broach the subject of the possibility of rejection as well as of ratification of the treaty? Will the scenario of rejection of the treaty be outlined so that the people and the other EU partners will have some idea about what is the next stage, in other words, renegotiation, a declaration or, preferably, a protocol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of questions. Deputy Durkan asked a number of questions about scenarios after a possible second rejection of the Nice treaty. We are not contemplating that happening and therefore we are not contemplating any such scenario, although there has been plenty of debate and discussion about what might happen in such circumstances. All our efforts are going into achieving a position where we can reflect on where we are. Having reflected on what happened last year, we are giving people an opportunity to reflect on it and allowing public debate on it. We set up the forum and are having extensive discussion on the matter. The forum has increasingly become more relevant with every passing week, in both attendance and the quality of the people involved. It is clear neutrality is a major issue, although not the only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn that we must build consensus on this issue as best we can so that the people are in favour of it and are prepared to agree with the protocol. I do not know if that is to be done in the House or in the forum. I under<Col N="586" /> stand the forum intends to reconvene and continue discussions after the recess. Given the timescale, it may be necessary for some of those to take place in the House rather than at the forum. Wherever discussions take place, we should try to build consensus around our position.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I do not wish to take issue but his position last autumn was to urge me to accept the reality, move on and put the treaty to a vote again immediately. I thought that was a flawed position.</P>

      <P>We have taken all the steps. To have proceeded so quickly would have been a mistake. We first had to analyse people's views. That has been done professionally and the analysis and that of many other experts has made very clear that neutrality is the number one issue. Other issues include the bureaucracy of Europe, the parliamentary system and what we in the House are doing to make the European agenda more relevant. The Cabinet committee is examining the neutrality issue and will engage in discussion with the legal services, a process we have not yet formally begun but which we must undertake. We will discuss what happened in Denmark, and clearly a declaration will be an issue with the possibility of becoming a protocol at a later stage. We must tackle all these issues and reach agreement on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>): To return briefly to the substantive issue, will the Taoiseach admit that what he said in regard to consulting the people on the Nice treaty by way of a referendum is a charade since he said everything is dished up and we possibly cannot contemplate any change? Therefore, the question will be put in exactly the same way. Will he agree that the appointments to the convention on the future of Europe fly in the face of the principles under which the Forum on Europe has been set up in this country, whereas there is fair representation of all the voices, particularly those who are opposed as well as those who are in favour? In the convention the two full representatives are proponents of the Nice treaty, proponents of the common, foreign and security policy and of the rapid reaction force, and therefore, the views and concerns of large numbers of Irish people are not getting <Col N="589" /> through to this level of the convention on the future of Europe.</P>

Given that concern, have they offered him assistance or advice on achieving the objective whereby enlargement can take place?</P>

      <P>It is not a question of concern. The other member states which wish to be helpful and work with us are satisfied that is what people in this country are doing.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Higgins's question, the issue of parliamentary representation must be based on how Parliament is made up, which is what the positions were based on. The Government and Parliament in general have been more than helpful in this regard, which is the correct way to proceed. The parliamentary representation is a fair reflection, or the best that can be done, with four people to represent Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the consumer price index is published on a monthly basis by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>The latest published CPI report relates to December 2001. It highlights that the average annual rate of inflation for 2001 was 4.9%, down from the average for 2000, which was 5.6%. The CPI for January will be published later this week.</P>
      <P>It is projected that the average rate of inflation in 2002 will be 4.2%. Budget 2002 provided for substantial increases in all personal and qualified adult social welfare rates as well as for child benefit. The level of increases represent real increases, well ahead of projected inflation for 2002.</P>
      <P>Among the significant increases in the budget are: increases in weekly personal rates of payments of between 7.4% and 11.8% &ndash; this represents significant real increases, ahead of projected inflation; and increases in weekly rates of qualified adult allowances of between 12.6% and 14.9%. This too represents real increases ahead of projected inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, these increases applied from the beginning of January. This means that in 2002, those receiving social welfare payments will receive their increase 23 weeks earlier in the <Col N="590" /> budget year than when this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I am also providing once again for record increases in child benefit, thereby continuing our policy of record investment in children. These increases, payable with effect from April are from 37.1% for each of the first two children to 34.9% for the third and subsequent children. This comes on top of increases of 59% and 54%, respectively, in 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government has delivered substantial increases for all social welfare clients during its period in office. These increases, announced in the recent budget, not only fully protect all recipients from projected inflation in 2002 but provide substantial real improvements in their standard of living.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. He has already admitted to the House that we do not yet have the figures on protected rates of inflation for January and February. Is the Minister oblivious to the fact that, since the introduction of the euro, many people on social welfare have seen a drastic reduction in their living standards as a result of escalating prices? Is he not aware of the report from the Consumers' Association of Ireland that shows an increase of around 15% in terms of many foodstuffs, medical costs and services? Is he not aware that many low-income families, particularly those dependent on social welfare, have been ripped off as a result of the euro? Is the Government considering any additional measures over the coming months to compensate people for the loss of their real income as a result of the introduction of the euro?</P>

Those on the lowest incomes and those who depend on social welfare have been severely hit as a result of those increases in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister carry out a study or a random survey on a sample of maybe 1,000 or 5,000 social welfare recipients to assess the impact of the introduction of the euro on their weekly and monthly living standards, in conjunction with Deputy Tom Kitt, who has asked Forfás to carry out this work? That would be a much more useful and productive way to spend moneys within his Department, as against the self-promotion that he engages in from time to time. Will he consider that proposal and report back to the House? Despite the <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> depiction that he gives to the House, the reality is that many low income people and those dependent on social welfare have been badly stung as a result of the introduction of the euro, something he is unaware <Col N="592" /> of and about which he does not want to do anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2002, for the first time, increases in weekly social welfare rates provided for in the budget were effective from the beginning of January. Increases in short-term weekly payments such as unemployment and disability benefits were implemented from the first pay-day in January. However, book-based payment systems, which are the chosen payment option for the majority of pensioners and other long-term weekly beneficiaries, are less flexible than other payment methods and require longer lead-in times to implement increases. Budget increases for those customer categories were paid via lump sum payments in February, with full retrospection <Col N="593" /> applied to the effective date of the increases in all cases.</P>
      <P>Customers on schemes where books were renewed in February were paid a lump sum in respect of the six weeks increase due from the start of 2002 in payments issued on 14 and 15 February. Customers on schemes where new books are due in April 2002 also received a lump sum during February containing six weeks' backdated payment to the start of 2002, plus an advance payment of the increase for seven weeks to bring them up to the date on which their new books arrive.</P>
      <P>Because the manner and date by which customers received their increases differed depending on their payment category, it was essential to ensure that all customers were fully aware of when and how their increases would be paid. It was also essential that, where payments were being made via lump sums in February, the relevant customer groups should be made aware that retrospection was being applied so that they would receive the full benefit of the increases effective back to the start of January.</P>
      <P>To that end, my Department implemented a range of measures to ensure that our diverse range of customers was fully aware of the arrangements for payment of budget rate increases. These measures included television, radio and national newspaper advertising, a freefone service for customer inquiries and a mailshot delivered during late January and early February 2002 to 588,944 customers in categories which received their increase via lump sum payments in February. The mailshot explained the payment arrangements for the increases and provided departmental contact details for further inquiries arising.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information.</i>It was particularly important to ensure that an appropriate range of public awareness measures were in place regarding the arrangements for payment of budget increases in the situation where euro notes and coins were also being introduced from the start of January so as to reassure customers that no one would lose out either as a result of the arrangements for payment of budget increases or on the changeover to the euro. By implementing these measures, my Department ensured that all our customers were provided with the necessary clarity and reassurance about how and when their budget increases would be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a sheaf of copies of the Minister's letter which irate constituents have sent to me. They felt the mailshot was unnecessary. I note that the Minister did not tell us how much it cost people on social welfare benefit to send these letters relating to the changeover to the euro and the payment of benefits on 1 January. Does the Minster not agree that this could have been avoided if he and the Minister for Finance had listened to the advice of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs <Col N="594" /> to present the budget last October? If this had been done the payments could have been made on 1 January without difficulty.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister's action not blatant electioneering? He has taken four or five opportunities to hit almost every household in the country, particularly in County Louth. Should this matter not be raised with the Public Offices Commission? It was totally unnecessary and confusing. Many Deputies received queries from people who believed that child benefit increases would also be paid from 1 January but, of course, this is not the case and people are still waiting for their increases. Is this action not merely a publicity scam by the Government and could the letter not equally have been signed by regional officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs rather than by the Minister?  </P>

      <P>Advertising of social welfare and related services is an essential part of the responsibilities of my Department. Effective advertising is of particular importance in informing people where changes are being made in services or in relation to major developments affecting their payments, such as the introduction of the euro. Advertising is also vital in ensuring that citizens are fully aware of their entitlements across the range of social insurance, social assistance and other supports available to them.</P>
      <P>The bulk of advertising expenditure in 2002, as in previous years, will be in connection with general advertising of payment arrangements for budget increases, information in relation to departmental grant schemes and issues such as relocation of departmental offices and industrial relations issues where they arise during the course of the year. Apart from advertising costs <i>per se</i>, there are associated costs for items such as design, exhibitions and seminars where information on the Department's services is made available.</P>
      <P>In addition to general advertising on promoting and raising awareness of departmental schemes and services which will arise during the course of the year, a number of media campaigns are under consideration. These include a campaign on the personal public service number designed to promote awareness of it and its use as the key to accessing integrated public services and e-government &ndash; this will be a major campaign utilising both print and broadcast media; a joint campaign with the Department of Finance aimed at promoting the implementation of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, which comes into effect from April this year and in which the Department will have an involvement; a campaign to promote awareness of the lo-call service and to advertise its planned extension during 2002 to additional offices in my Department &ndash; lo-call provides telephone access to Government offices for the cost of a local call; and campaigns to enhance public awareness and understanding of the supports available through marriage and couple counselling services and the family mediation service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to predict in detail the level of advertising which will be necessary over the course of the year in that this will depend to some degree on issues which arise during the year. At this stage, however, I estimate that overall expen<Col N="596" /> diture by my Department on advertising during 2002 will be in the region of &euro;1.85 million.</P>

Is it true that in the first two months of this year the advertising budget of the Minister's Department exceeded the total amount spent by the Department in 1998 and 1999? Is it not unusual for the Opposition to put the charge to the Minister that he is using this money as leverage to win votes in advance of the general election? There is a fundamental distinction between giving basic information to social welfare recipients and using public funds for party or political advantage. In the past 12 months the Minister has scandalously used huge sums of money to have his name and picture associated with these advertising campaigns. Will the Minister desist from this personalised campaigning between now and the general election? It is an abuse of taxpayers' money to claim that he and Fianna Fáil are responsible for these payments and that the money does not belong to the people.</P>
      <P>What criteria were used for the Minister's euro advertising campaign as distinct from his budget increases campaign? His name was on the advertising campaign for the euro but not on that for the budget increase.</P>

      <P>I will list what it will be spent on. The PPSN campaign will probably not take place before May. During my time in office, as Deputy Hayes may or may not find out if he is in government, I was given an estimate of what the Department would allow me to spend in each incoming year. In none of the years that I have been Minister have I overspent the advertising estimate. The estimate in relation to last year was considerably increased to take into account the euro changeover. As I said in a previous answer to the Deputy, I and the senior officials in the Department were worried that there would be confusion with the confluence of the euro changeover on 1 January and the significant policy initiative of moving payments from mid-June to 1 January. Thankfully, as a result of the publicity campaign and the excellent work of my Department in delivering the lump sum payments&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fraud against the social welfare system can arise in a number of different ways, for example, where persons claiming social welfare payments make false declarations or conceal material facts to obtain payment, where there is deliberate failure to notify the Department of a change in circumstances or failure by an employer to comply with PRSI regulations.</P>
      <P>In 1998, there were 14,193 overpayments amounting to &euro;13.6 million, while in 1999, 15,094 overpayments amounting to &euro;15.4 million and in 2000, 12,625 overpayments amounting to &euro;14.3 million were attributed to fraud or suspected fraud. The figures for 2001 are currently being compiled and will be available by the end of March. My Department has a comprehensive range of measures in place to ensure that fraud is kept to a minimum and that only those who are entitled to a payment actually receive it. All departmental staff who are involved in making payments have a responsibility for the prevention of incorrect payments and the detection of fraud.</P>
      <P>There are 600 staff specifically engaged on control activities at local, regional and national level. These officers investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare payments, carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, review customers' means for assistance payments and monitor their ongoing entitlement to social welfare payments. It is my Department's policy to try to recover all moneys incorrectly paid and every effort is made to recover overpayments in full, having regard to the provisions of a code of practice which is in place to regulate this process. Overpayments which result from fraud are given greatest priority and their recovery is vigorously pursued.</P>
      <P>Prosecutions are taken against persons who defraud social welfare payments schemes and against employers who fail to honour their obligations under the PRSI system. All cases involving fraud are examined with a view to initiating legal proceedings. This involves striking a balance between the need to vigorously pursue serious fraud, while at the same time having regard to the individual circumstances of each case.</P>
      <P>During the period referred to in the question, 1998 to 2001, a total of 1,027 cases were forwarded by my Department to the Chief State Solicitor's office for prosecution. A total of 716 were finalised by the courts and, at the end of 2001, there was a further 471 cases awaiting a hearing in the courts.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that social welfare fraud is a problem for his Depart<Col N="599" /> ment and that the figures he gave relating to the years 1998 to 2000 constitute a significant loss for the Department? Does he have an estimate of the figure for last year? There was newspaper speculation earlier this year that &euro;27 million was paid out incorrectly by the Department on the various schemes it operates. Is there a unit in the Department to deal exclusively with social welfare fraud?</P>
      <P>Recently, a suggestion was made that those who are convicted of social welfare fraud or who are involved in sponging from the social welfare system should have their names published. A judgment list is issued by the Revenue Commissioners and, in local authorities, those who commit litter fines have their names published. What action is the Department taking to ensure those who are involved in social welfare fraud are made known to the public so this practice can be rooted out of the social welfare system?</P>

      <P>I do not have the figures for 2001. They will be available by the end of March. There are 600 staff, out of a total staff complement of 4,200, specifically engaged in control activities, which include fraud. Those staff are at every level &ndash; local, regional and national. In relation to publicising cases, the cases are taken by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the majority of them come before the courts. There are some changes in the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, which we will discuss later, in relation to PRSI and other issues. The issue of publicising cases has not come up before but perhaps we could examine it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a total of 716 convictions were secured against people directly involved in this activity. How much of the money involved in each of the years was successfully recovered by the Department as a result of those convictions? Is it the case that the money lost as a result of fraud is lost forever and is not recovered directly by the Department? While the Minister cannot give an exact figure for 2001, can he say if the claim in a recent newspaper report that &euro;27 million was defrauded last year from the social welfare system is way off or close to the mark?</P>

      <P>I do not know to what report the Deputy is referring. Perhaps he would bring it to our attention so we can have it checked. I do not have figures other than the figures I gave the Deputy earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control activity includes fraud but also includes other cases where, for example, people were inadvertently claiming two different social welfare payments at the same time. The total figure for the past number of years has increased from £158 million to £211 million or &euro;268 million. They would be savings which the Department of Finance and my Department would agree. Much of that money would be paid back by social welfare recipients on a drip basis. People who <Col N="600" /> defraud social welfare would, generally, be people who would not be able to repay large sums of money so they tend to repay the amounts at £5 per week or whatever other sum is agreed. That is what occurs in relation to people who are not suspected of fraud. If people are suspected of fraud, the Department will obviously seek full payment in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group was established to examine the range of complex issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. The group comprised representatives of the social partners and relevant Departments and was chaired by an independent chairperson, Professor Kieran Kennedy, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>
      <P>The group began its work in December 2000, produced an interim report in April 2001 and completed its work with a final report in September 2001. In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government was committed to increasing the rate of the old age pension to £100 or &euro;126.97 by 2002. This commitment was later extended, in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium midway through the Government's term of office, to cover other payments made to people over 66 years of age, and in the case of widows and widowers a further commitment was made to increase the contributory payment to the same level as the old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The current rate structure, which comprises an under 66 and over 66 rate, was introduced in 1998 and since then widows and widowers over 66 years of age have received a number of special increases in pursuit of the commitments and objectives I have outlined. At this stage, those over 66 years of age have received increases amounting to almost 50% since 1998 while those under 66 years of age have seen their payments grow by about 31%. With the increases granted in 2002, the initial commitment in relation to payment rates for those over 66 years of age has been met in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of social insurance, cover for widows' and orphans' pensions is encompassed in the standard PRSI contributions. The rate at which PRSI is levied is not related to <Col N="601" /> the final payment a person can expect. Information on the different rates which apply to various schemes is, of course, available in the Department's information literature.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister accept the differentiation between widows aged under 66 and those aged over 66 is a major bone of contention for those whose husbands paid into PRSI schemes? They were not warned that a distinction would be made between widows aged under 66 and those aged over 66. Widows aged under 66 are likely to have more expenses because their children still depend on them. For example, if a widow is aged 46 or 50 her children will still depend on her whereas a widow aged over 66 will have reared her children and in many cases they can look after her. Does the Minister accept it is totally unjust to differentiate between both groups, particularly given that those aged under 66 are more likely to be in more need of the payment?</P>

      <P>We examined carefully what we could do to assist widows aged under 66 and I gave careful consideration to proposals over the past two or three years because of the increases that had been introduced, which were linked to relativity.

    <P>If one does anything in regard to widows aged under 66, one is open to the accusation of not addressing other single parents and my Department received strong advice that changes could <Col N="602" /> not be made to the payments for widows aged under 66 without incurring knock-off effects in regard to other lone parents aged under 66.</P>

      <Quest>his views on including in the treaties of the European Union the social inclusion chapter, which was originally agreed at the Lisbon Council in March 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Combating exclusion is one of the main social objectives for the European Union and the member states, as set down in Article 136 of the treaty. Exclusion is a multi-faceted phenomenon and combating it involves action in a number of fields, including social protection, employment, education and housing. The main direct responsibility for combating exclusion lies with individual member states. However, provision has been made in the treaty to enable the EU in specified areas to support and complement the activities of the member states in combating exclusion and in achieving the other objectives set down in Article 136.</P>
      <P>During the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam an Irish proposal enabling the Council to adopt measures designed to encourage co-operation between member states to combat social exclusion was adopted and is now included as the last sub-paragraph of Article 137(2) of the treaty. An Irish proposal in the negotiations on the Treaty of Nice that this co-operation process be extended to modernising social protection was adopted and is now included as paragraph 1(k) of a revised Article 137 in the Nice Treaty. Ireland also proposed a basis in the treaty for a social protection committee to co-ordinate the co-operation process in the fields of social protection and social inclusion. This proposal was also adopted and is included as a new Article 144 in the Treaty of Nice. The committee is already up and running.</P>
      <P>These provisions are designed to ensure that achieving &ldquo;greater social cohesion&rdquo;, which is part of the new strategic goal for the European Union adopted at the Lisbon Council, is given equal weight along with the economic and employment dimensions of that goal. Much progress has been made under the new co-operation process in the field of social inclusion since the European Council in Lisbon. The European Council in Nice agreed common objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion in December 2000. National action plans setting out strategies to meet these objectives and the actions to give effect to them over a two year period were submitted by all member states in June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>These plans have been fully reviewed and a <Col N="604" /> joint Council-Commission report was submitted to the European Council in Laeken in December 2001. Indicators to assist in measuring progress on combating social exclusion were also adopted at Laeken. A Community action programme to encourage co-operation between member states to combat social exclusion, administered by the Commission, has been adopted and was launched in January 2002. The conclusions of the Lisbon Council do not require that any further treaty provisions to promote social inclusion are necessary for what is essentially a national responsibility. However, the position will be kept under review and, if further such provision is considered necessary, appropriate proposals, as in the past, will be made.</P>

      <P>It must have been quite embarrassing for the Minister last month when, according to figures published by EUROSTAT in regard to the 15 EU member states, Ireland was at the bottom of the league in the area of social protection. The percentage of GNP spent on social protection is abysmally low by comparison with many other EU member states. In that sense is it not true that we have not seriously tried to contribute to the social inclusion debate at European level? Was it not also very embarrassing for the Minister that the very rushed anti-poverty plan that he submitted has been fairly severely criticised both in the European Parliament and the Commission for a lengthy list of omissions and its failure to address some of the major issues in Irish poverty, particularly the lack of a minimum income standard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision on a claim to social welfare payment made by a deciding officer of my Department or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowances has a statutory right to appeal.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and fair consideration. While there is an inevitable time lag in such a process, which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements, it enables a speedy resolution of the appeal in some circumstances.</P>
      <P>Where an appeal is received, the social welfare appeals office refers the case to the deciding officer for his or her comments on the arguments made by the appellant, including any new evidence submitted. As a result of this process over one fifth of such cases are revised in the person's favour by the deciding officer, mainly because new evidence became available that warranted revision.</P>
      <P>It is my Department's policy to ensure that persons who receive an unfavourable decision are provided with the means to have such decisions reviewed as quickly as possible. What we want to achieve is that where new evidence becomes available after a decision is made, that evidence is submitted directly to the deciding officer in the first instance so that the case can be re-examined quickly and, if appropriate, the decision revised without having to go through the more formal appeals process. To this end, my Department is developing systems to review decisions in light of further information brought to notice following the initial decision and to ensure that claimants are advised of their right to seek such a review. Where conflict remains, however, the person has the right to have his or her claim dealt with by way of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time taken to process an appeal has been commented on by the chief appeals officer in his annual reports in recent years. During the three-year period to 2000, the number of appeals received increased by over 25%, which put considerable pressure on the resources of the social welfare appeals office. Notwithstanding this <Col N="607" /> increase, average processing times were broadly maintained over the period at around 22 weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While this compares favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of improvement is a major objective of the office.</P>
      <P>Additional resources have been assigned during the past two years to cope with the extra numbers and the number of appeals on hand has decreased from 7,537 at the start of 2000 to the present figure of about 6,700. Given the necessary formal nature of the appeals process and the number of appeals received, it is considered that a figure of about 4,000 would be consistent with a desired level of service.</P>
      <P>Resources alone are not the only answer and apart from the revised procedures by my Department mentioned above to provide an early review of unfavourable decisions, management of the appeals office is arranging for a consultancy study of the office, which will include an examination of all the processes involved in dealing with claims to the appeals stage. Any procedural improvements, which are identified in the course of this examination, will be implemented.</P>

      <P>I am certainly not insinuating that things have got worse since the Minister assumed office, but does the Minister agree that the situation is highly unsatisfactory? This is the poorest section of the community, many of whom are illiterate or elderly and are unable to fight their own cases. The Minister did not give his standard reply that they have the right to go to a supplementary welfare officer to get money. However, that is simply going round the merry go round. It is not good enough that poor disadvantaged people must wait for months on end. I am told that the average waiting time for lone parents to get their applications processed is six months. Does the Minister not agree this is totally unacceptable?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy that my Department and the appeals system, which is independent of the Department, endeavour as much as possible to try to reach decisions as quickly as possible. However, the Deputy must accept that in many cases of delay the fault is not on our side. It can happen that requests for information are made and that information does not come in as quickly as it should. Our average processing time of 20 to 22 weeks compares very favourably with other countries. For instance our neighbouring country, the UK, has an average waiting time of 26 weeks. In the past two years we have increased the complement of appeals officers to 17.5, which is an increase of 3.5.</P>

Did he give consideration to a full statutory basis for the appeals system whereby social welfare customers, as he calls them in his letter, could have real confidence they were getting an independent hearing and were not being struck off without recourse or representation?

      <P>The carer's benefit scheme is intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. It is a weekly income support payment, which is based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer.</P>
      <P>The maximum duration of the carer's benefit scheme is set at 65 weeks. This time period should be sufficient to facilitate carers to temporarily care for an elderly or infirm person or to make long-term arrangements. It is also considered that employers would experience difficulties in preserving an employee's rights for a longer period. The 65 weeks carer's leave may be claimed as a single continuous period or in separate time periods. However, it is important to note that a carer may claim carer's benefit for a different care recipient for another 65 weeks later in their working life. In the event of a person's carer's benefit expiring and the need for income support still existing, it is open to the carer to apply for carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Carer's benefit was introduced in October 2000 and 680 carers have benefited to date, of which 460 carers are currently receiving benefits. It is estimated that there could eventually be in the region of 6,800 people on carer's benefit once the scheme reaches maturity. The number of recipients of carer's allowance increased from 3,355 in 1991, its first full year in existence, to 19,000 after 12 years of the scheme's operation. It may take many years before carer's benefit reaches maturity and it is expected that the scheme will only have in the region of 500 to 1,000 recipients in the first number of years.</P>

It is not a significant method of operation for a worker to take time off to care for an elderly parent or a disabled child. The Department carried out a fine study of carers and found that the average length of time taken was three and a half or four years. The 15 month period is a severe disadvantage to workers. They should be able to think in terms of taking a more lengthy period off work. During the debate on the Bill the Minister's colleague extended it.  </P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the small take-up of the scheme is an example of its restrictive nature, despite his propaganda? The current estimation that 460 people benefit from the carer's scheme is small. Has he any plans to be more flexible about the current waiting time limit to ensure that a greater number of people can apply for the benefit, which is an employment based benefit to which they are entitled? </P>

      <P>My Department is committed to the provision of a high quality service to all its customers and to ensuring continuous improvement in the standard of service provided. As part of the Civil Service modernisation programme, new principles of quality customer service were approved by the Government and published in 2000. I assure the Deputy that the implementation of the quality customer service principles across my Department's schemes and services will continue to be a priority.</P>
      <P>Over recent years my Department has made significant strides in this area and has put a plan in place to create a more open, friendly and informal environment in which services can be delivered. To ensure that the approach meets the needs of customers, my Department constantly consults with and seeks feedback from customers through methods such as customer panels, customer service surveys and comment cards. In addition to consulting directly with customers, from time to time my Department commissions independent research into customer satisfaction levels. Last year, the Market Research Bureau of Ireland was employed to carry out a customer reaction survey, one of the objectives being to measure the reaction of customers to the services provided. The research findings show that overall satisfaction levels with the standard of service being provided remain high. In particular, the survey shows that there is recognition of improvements in public office accommodation.</P>
      <P>My Department has a total of 57 social welfare local offices countrywide where members of the public may apply for social welfare entitlements. The provision of privacy facilities has been a priority in the design of new offices and the refurbishment of existing offices in recent years. The seated waiting area is sufficiently removed to ensure that confidential information may not be overheard. Background music has also been installed in a number of local offices to further enhance privacy. I accept we must continue to make progress in this area and my Department is currently considering the recommendations of a working group set up on foot of the MRBI findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>In addition to these offices, my Department also has 68 branch offices around the country which are situated in smaller towns. These offices, which offer a more restricted service to the public as they are confined to claims in regard to unemployment payments, are operated by branch managers employed on a contract basis. In general, the standard of accommodation being provided by branch managers has not kept pace with improvements in my Department's offices. While this is acknowledged by both my Department and <Col N="612" /> the branch managers, who are endeavouring to improve the standard, the matter is kept under review.</P>

      <P>There has been considerable improvement in this area. However, there is still a problem with privacy. There is nothing more demeaning for a member of the public than to have to spell out his or her circumstances in front of an audience. Does the Minister agree that is undesirable? The fact that it is happening is borne out by the fact that there was consternation in the Minister's office when the question was tabled.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach is probably aware, earlier this afternoon the result of the INO vote on strike action, called for as a result of difficulties in accident and emergency units, was announced and 93% of nurses represented by that organisation have voted for industrial action on 13 March. In another development, the IMO, which represents 5,200 doctors throughout the country, stated that standards in accident and emergency units do not even reach minimum standards of quality. I put it to the Taoiseach that this is an appalling indictment of the Government's health policy and that the statement by the IMO and the actions of nurses represented by the INO is a public indication that health professionals have no confidence in that policy.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the past two and a half years there has been a marked deterioration in the delivery of health services and that this is manifest in today's decision to which Deputy Noonan referred? What explanation can he provide for this internal collapse in the administration of the health services? What has gone wrong? Why is it that, notwithstanding the substantial additional increases in taxpayers' money provided, the system appears to be in a daily state of chaos? Is the Taoiseach in a position to offer an explanation? Does he agree it might be better if he visited more accident and emergency wards and fewer official openings of pubs in order that he might discover, firsthand, what has gone wrong?</P>

      <P>These are state of the art facilities that are well staffed with excellent people who work hard. Unfortunately, however, that does not apply to every hospital. It would be nice if industrial relations difficulties did not occur, but that is not the case. The result of the ballot of nurses announced today means that they will engage in industrial action to secure improvements in accident and emergency services and their action is aimed at particular places. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, recently met union officials and outlined the initiatives he had already taken. These were welcomed by the representatives. He also outlined those that would be taken to alleviate the diffi<Col N="615" /> culties being experienced in accident and emergency departments. He asked the union to postpone its action to allow negotiations on the outstanding issues to continue and emphasised that a number of additional consultants and staff has been deployed at accident and emergency hospitals. After the meeting, the Minister requested the chief executive officers of the voluntary hospitals providing accident and emergency services and the chief executive officers of the health boards to engage with the Nursing Alliance in each accident and emergency department with the aim of addressing current difficulties. There is no doubt that such difficulties exist and that in some hospitals they can be alleviated while in others they remain acute.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers' Agency is hosting a meeting with the relevant parties on Thursday at which will be discussed the issues arising in relation to the difficulties in the service provided in a number of locations which have been highlighted by the INO. Following a recent announcement by the Minister, arrangements are under way for the establishment of a forum to consider these areas. He has already outlined the steps he believes should be taken to alleviate current difficulties. It must be pointed out, however, that the type of difficulties to which I refer do not arise at numerous hospitals. I hope the meeting to take place on Thursday will lead to useful debate on the areas in respect of which substantive difficulties continue to obtain.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that on days when he visits a hospital, the management of the institution will, that morning, have removed trolleys from corridors and cancelled appointments so that what he sees is not the reality? Is he aware that this is a reasonably well documented practice? Industrial action normally occurs because those intent on taking it are trying to improve their pay or conditions, but in this instance circumstances are entirely different. These nurses, supported by doctors, are taking industrial action for the benefit of patients because accident and emergency services are in chaos. Is the Taoiseach aware the forum on accident and emergency services of the Minister for Health and Children is the 74th such review, committee or forum he has announced since he took up his portfolio? I accept that the Minister leads a charmed life, but is the Taoiseach aware that nothing ever happens to improve the situation or that action is not taken? Given that nurses are taking industrial action in the interests of patients, will the Taoiseach make a commitment to accept the INO's ten point plan and request the Minister to implement the ten point plan, as proposed by the Nursing Alliance, in order to alleviate the crisis in accident and emergency services?</P>

There has also been the establishment of the 24 hour GP operative service as part of strengthening one of the areas in which major difficulties have occurred, namely, primary care. This has helped to reduce demand because patients treated under the scheme would otherwise have to attend accident and emergency departments and this creates much of the pressure on the system</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputies Quinn and Noonan on the industrial relations issue, the Minister for Education and Science is well aware of the situation for weeks past and has been dealing with the teachers' unions as best he can in an effort to find acceptable proposals. If the management and principals of the schools are allowed to operate the system whereby people will be employed &ndash; more than enough people across the country have indicated their willingness to take up those positions &ndash; it may not be ideal but it will certainly provide supervision. In relation to Deputy Quinn's point, I discussed it with the Minister and he will try to establish a comprehensive position across the schools, although it is difficult enough to do that. It was easier when we only had a handful of schools involved in major capital projects but there are now about 200, as well as many others at design, planning and approval stages. The resources which have been put into the capital programme are four times greater than they were and this is greatly improving our schools infrastructure. Furthermore, there are several thousand additional teachers in our educational system today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider visiting the Department of Education and Science, for a change, and will he take personal responsibility, as Taoiseach, for the chaos that now reigns there? For example, in relation to the 850 schools, is he aware the Minister and his Department are giving identical written replies to questions in relation to each and every school, as if they were all at <Col N="618" /> the same status and the same level? Can the Taoiseach give a guarantee to the pupils, parents and teachers of this State that he will not allow the education services to disintegrate in the same way as he has allowed the health services to disintegrate? Since the Minister for Education and Science has failed in the promise he made on 13 February, 13 days ago today, to meet the teachers' unions, will the Taoiseach now agree to meet the teachers' unions, all three of them, in a crisis meeting to avoid this catastrophe occurring next week when there will be an unprecedented withdrawal of supervision, with all that entails?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recognise there is a crisis in two key areas of public service provision, health and education, our schools and our hospitals? Is this the final triumph of the McCreevy-Harney axis in the Government, after five years, with contempt for public services, that, notwithstanding the level of resources, the public realise, feel, sense, believe and experience crisis in our public services? Is that the Government's legacy?</P>

      <P>I believe that the Minister for Education and Science would look more to the fact that we have smaller classes, more modern facilities and proper help for students as core elements of a record in education of which we are rightly proud, in addition to a 70% increase in resources. Class sizes have been reduced to the lowest level ever &ndash; there are 3,500 extra teachers, improving staffing ratios both in primary and second level schools. The supply of teachers is better than ever before. The Minister and I are, of course, in touch with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the teachers' unions with a view to achieving some success with this issue. However, Deputy Quinn is well aware of the background to this dispute and the difficulties involved in it. The Minister will continue to consult the teachers.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring my sixth Social Welfare Bill before the House. This is the second of two Bills before the House to implement the record £850 million increased social welfare package in budget 2002. Deputies will recall that a separate Bill was enacted in December last to give effect to the substantial increases in weekly social welfare payments from the beginning of January and to PRSI changes from 1 March next. This Bill implements a number of key improvements in social welfare schemes such as increases in child benefit and improvements for carers, as announced in the budget and includes a range of other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" />I am proud to say that during its period in office this Government has more than fulfilled its commitments on social inclusion made to the people in our programme for Government. Over this period, unemployment has been reduced to one of the lowest levels in the EU. Almost 100,000 people have left the live register. Despite this, there has been a massive increase in spending on social welfare from £4.5 billion in 1997 to more than £7.4 billion, &euro;9.2 billion, this year &ndash; an increase of almost two-thirds in five years.</P>
    <P>There have been substantial increases in child benefit rates to more than treble what was being paid in 1997 and substantial real increases in social welfare pensions with old age contributory pensioners now receiving &euro;147.30, £116, per week compared to £78 in 1997. There have been significant improvements for carers with the result that there are now more than 19,500 carers receiving a carer's payment compared to 9,000 in 1997 as well as the introduction of new family services to protect the family and support the stability of family life.</P>
    <P>As Members will already have considered it in detail, I will focus on a number of key provisions. Child benefit is a universal payment made directly to families. As such, it is the most efficient and effective way in which the Government can channel help to children. Before we came into office expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. The increases announced in Budget 2002 and provided for in Section 2 of this Bill bring investment in 2002 to &euro;1.44 billion, £1.14 billion approximately, almost three times the 1997 figure.</P>
    <P>The monthly rate for the first two children is being increased by &euro;31.80, £25.04, per month and the monthly rate for the third and subsequent child is being increased by &euro;38.10, £30.01, per month. These increases bring the monthly rates to &euro;117.60, £92.60, and &euro;147.30, £116.01, respectively. From April next a family with three children will receive &euro;382.50, £301.24, compared to £221 at present &ndash; an increase of &euro;101.70, £80, 36% per month. These substantial increases fulfil the Government's commitment set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The move towards £100 for the third and subsequent children will be fully implemented from April next. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased threefold from £30 per month to £92.50 per month in the lower rate and from £39 to £116 in the higher rate of payment. In 1997 the child benefit increase for a family with three children was £7 per month; last year and this year the same family will get an increase of £80 per month in each year.</P>
    <P>In the past two budgets alone child benefit increased by £50 overall, 118% for each of the first two children and by £60 overall, 107% for the third and all subsequent children. If returned to office, we will continue to give record increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>These increases of £25 and £30 compare starkly with the £1 and £5 increase given by Deputy <Col N="627" /> Quinn as Minister for Finance in the last rainbow government.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may get an opportunity to be first in favour of something for a change. The Bill brings forward the effective date for the 2002 increase to April next. However, the first pay-day in May is the earliest date from which it is possible for my Department to pay the increased rates. The majority of child benefit payments are made by means of books of payable orders which run from June to May. The new books from June next will contain orders at the increased rate in the normal course. The increase for April and May has, therefore, to be paid separately and May is the earliest date from which it is administratively possible to make this payment to these families.</P>

I remind those Deputies who criticise us that last year we brought the effective payment date forward by three months, from September to June 2001 and this year we are again bringing it forward by a further two months. I mentioned earlier the increase of £1 and £5, given by Deputy Quinn in 1997. I remind those Deputies that these miserly increases provided by the rainbow government were announced in December 1996 but not paid until September 1997 &ndash; a full 10 months later. So do not criticise this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also introducing changes in the arrangements for entitlement to child dependent increases payable with short-term social welfare payments such as disability benefit and unemployment benefit. At present such increases cease to be payable once the child reaches his or her 18th birthday. Section 7 provides that from April next, where the child is receiving full-time education, these increases will continue to paid untiI the following 30 June. This is a first step in implementing the commitment in the programme for prosperity and fairness towards increasing the age limit to 22 years in line with the current arrangements for long-term payments.</P>
      <P>This Government, over successive budgets, has introduced measures to develop the types of services and supports which provide practical assistance to this country's carers. As a result of changes introduced over the past five budgets, the number of carers receiving carer's allowance and carer's benefit has more than doubled from 9,700 to more than 19,000 and, expenditure has increased by more than 180%.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are continuing to honour our commitments supporting the valuable work undertaken by carers. In previous budgets I promised to move towards the stage whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan keeps interrupting, but his party in office did little or nothing for the carers. His party's record is abysmal and now it is promising the sun, moon and stars. The so-called socialists are promising things that even Fine Gael, to be fair to it, is not promising this year.</P>
      <P>In line with this commitment, I have again increased the disregards so that from April a couple can have a joint income disregard of &euro;382 per week. This measure will increase the payments to 2,300 carers and ensure that an estimated 3,400 additional carers will qualify for a payment. This measure will be implemented by way of regulations with effect from April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant, payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to those who care for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. Section 3 of the Bill provides for a further enhancement of this payment through an increase in the amount of the grant from £400 to &euro;635, or £500. In addition, carers caring for more than one care recipient will be entitled to a double respite care grant of &euro;1,270, £1,000. These increases will become effec<Col N="629" /> tive in June 2002, which is when the grant is next due.</P>
    <P>The health strategy, which was recently launched by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, also bears out our commitment to improving services for older people, people with disabilities and their carers. This document proposes to reform existing arrangements, including the carer's allowance, to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. The Department of Health and Children is working with my Department to develop proposals in this area. In addition, the strategy proposes that a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people be developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The strategy puts forward a number of other proposals relating to care planning, greater availability of short-term respite care and the development of primary care services, such as domiciliary care and day-care services. I look forward to playing a part in this integrated approach to developing better services for carers and the people for whom they care.</P>
    <P>In late 2000 I initiated a study into long-term care funding, in both the private and public sectors, with a view to developing a strategy for future action. The study will examine the strategic issues involved in financing long-term care and will assess alternative financing and funding approaches and their feasibility. The study will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs in the community and in institutional care, and the potential of the private sector or a combined public-private sector approach to developing new initiatives. Again, we have adopted a cross-cutting approach with the study being undertaken in consultation with the Departments of Health and Children and Finance, with which policy proposals arising from the report will be developed. I expect that the report to be published shortly after Easter.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill updates the rate of widowed parent grant in primary legislation which was increased by regulations from £1,000 to &euro;2,500, or £1,968, with effect from budget day, 5 December last. Sections 5 and 6 give effect to two other budget improvements aimed at assisting people who returned to the workforce but were subsequently forced to reapply for their original social welfare payments. Section 5 provides for the linking of disability benefit claims of five years' duration or more for up to 13 weeks in relation to periods of incapacity for work. This measure will ensure that people who return to employment following a prolonged illness and find after a short time that they are unable to continue with it can reapply for disability benefit without the need to satisfy the conditions for requalification.</P>
    <P>Section 6 disregards periods spent on pre-retirement allowance for the purpose of linking <Col N="630" /> two claims to unemployment assistance and for linking two claims to pre-retirement allowance, provided they occur within 52 weeks. Cases have arisen where people on pre-retirement allowance have resumed employment, but subsequently became unemployed. Under existing arrangements they must claim unemployment assistance and serve three waiting days before receiving payment. To avoid this disincentive it is now intended to allow such people to resume claiming pre-retirement allowance where the period spent in employment is less than 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 changes the qualifying conditions for entitlement to maternity and adoptive benefits by self-employed people. The main effect of the changes is to allow self-employed women greater flexibility in satisfying the PRSI contribution conditions for the benefits concerned and to bring them more into line with those applicable to employees.</P>

      <P>Section 11 deals with the PRSI arrangements for the proposed personal retirement savings accounts &ndash; PRSAs &ndash; being introduced under the Pensions Bill, currently before the Seanad, and for other personal pension plans. The PRSAs will be a low-cost, easy-access, long-term personal investment account designed to allow people to save for their retirement in a flexible manner. It is proposed that payments toward such pensions will be treated like contributions made to existing occupational pensions for PRSI purposes, that is they will be exempt from PRSI. Where payments to such pensions are made through the payroll system, the necessary exemptions will be provided for under regulations governing the PAYE system. Section 11 deals with cases where the premium payments are made outside the payroll system. It provides for a refund of the PRSI contributions deducted from such payments over the course of a tax year.</P>
      <P>Section 12 provides for the introduction of a public service identity to enhance the effectiveness of the personal public service number as a public service identifier. In the action programme for the Government, we promised to modernise public services to make them more relevant to the citizen and to improve access to public services by providing them electronically. This is a key element of our e-government strategy. Our aim is to put the customer first, rather than the supplier of the service, and to integrate services to make access to them as easy as possible. People want to be able to contact public services in the manner most appropriate to their needs, whether in person, by phone or letter or, increasingly, by going online. They want to be able to transact their business seamlessly without having to go from one agency to another repeating the same information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve this the Government has approved <Col N="631" /> a new model, known as the public service broker, for the delivery of public services electronically. The broker is being developed by the Reach agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department and it will co-ordinate access to the full range of public services in a variety of ways, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The building blocks for this new service were put in place through legislation I brought before this House in 1998. That legislation provided for the personal public service number as a public service identifier and as a framework for the sharing of information between agencies for specified services. I am proud to say that these arrangements have proven very effective in delivering social services to the public.</P>
    <P>Section 12 introduces a further building block for this process with the introduction of a public service identity to act as a unique and secure identifier for public service customers. From the customer's point of view, the public service identity will be a speedy and efficient method of establishing who they are for the purposes of accessing and dealing with public service agencies. It will also mean that their identity can be better protected from inadvertent disclosure, theft or misuse by other persons. Section 12 defines the elements of the identity which will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the person's name, address, date of birth, sex, nationality and his or her PPS number. Where this data is collected from customers in their dealings with public service agencies, it will be used to maintain their identity in the event of a change, such as a new address. In addition, it is proposed that personal data collected at birth registration will also be used for this purpose. My Department will be responsible for managing access by public service agencies to a person's public service identity as part of its management of the existing PPS database. This measure will lead to improved administrative efficiency and effectiveness across all public service agencies, reduce bureaucracy and begin the process of eliminating red tape.</P>
    <P>Section 14 strengthens the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the collection of PRSI contributions. It allows the Revenue Commissioners to offset repayment of taxes against outstanding liabilities for PRSI and extends the provisions of the Taxes Acts regarding publication of the names of tax defaulters where the settlement is greater than &euro;12,700 to PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for an amendment to the Charities Acts, removing the financial limit attached to the use of the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine. In the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity, published in September 2000, the Government announced that responsibility for charity regulatory matters and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests would transfer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to my Department. This transfer of responsibilities was effected last July. The White Paper also <Col N="632" /> recognised the need for a more modern legal framework for the charity sector and stated the Government's commitment to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fundraising. The work of reviewing the legislation, currently under way in my Department, will be accompanied by broad public consultation on the appropriate regulatory framework and the nature and extent of the legislative reform required.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of this process of reform, I take this opportunity to address a matter which is of considerable concern to many charities. The Charities Acts allow the Commissioners to frame so-called &ldquo;<i>cy pres</i>&rdquo; schemes, which allow the original objectives of a charity to be altered, usually because these objectives can no longer be carried out. This may arise in the case of funds left to an orphanage which no longer exists. In such circumstances the Commissioners could use the <i>cy pres </i>provisions to divert these funds to the nearest contemporary use, such as the children's ward of a local hospital. This is a very valuable service for charities and is provided free of charge by the Commissioners. However, there is currently a monetary limit of £250,000 on cases in which the Commissioners have discretion to alter charitable provisions. In cases above this limit charities are obliged to take the matter to the High Court and bear the considerable costs that can be associated with this course of action. This proposal will increase the powers of the commissioners by abolishing the current monetary limit on their determination of such applications and in doing so will provide a valuable service to all charities. Resulting savings can be directed towards charitable purposes rather than legal fees which could significantly deplete such transfers.</P>
    <P>Parts IV and VIII of the Schedule to the Bill amends the Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts to facilitate the initial implementation of a new computerised system of registering life events. Civil registration touches on each and every one of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our births and ending when our deaths are registered. In between those events, civil registration affects us during our lives, both directly, as in the case of getting married, or indirectly when certificates are required for many of the services that are available in our society such as enrolling a child in school, getting a passport, taking up employment or claiming a social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>Due to the importance of civil registration and recognising the changing needs of customers, the Government gave approval for expenditure of some £7.3 million on a programme to modernise the Civil Registration Service. While there has been little change to the basic registration procedures since 1864, there have been many changes in our society, major developments in technology and increased expectations by citizens in how public services should be delivered.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, has been <Col N="633" /> engaged in the review of the entire registration system, including registration law. The review also examined the structure of registration on a national basis to identify the changes needed to capitalise on the use of modern computer technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration. The objective is to implement a modern and customer focused service geared to the needs of the 21st century. The modernisation of the registration service will benefit all citizens by providing increased flexibility, in accessing and delivering the service.</P>
    <P>It is intended to publish a comprehensive civil registration Bill later this year which will provide a framework for new administrative structures for the General Registrar Office the introduction of new registers of divorce and civil nullity and changes in the procedures for registering the events &ndash; births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 104,000 events registered each year &ndash; 52,000 births; 500 stillbirths; 16,000 marriages; 31,000 deaths; 500 adoptions; 2,000 re-registrations; and 2,000 amendments. In addition, 400,000 certificates are produced and 1.2 million searches-inquiries are carried out each year.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 and 1996, and the Marriages Acts, 1844 and 1863, provide for the manner in which births, deaths and marriages may be registered and for the maintenance of a permanent record of vital events by An t-Árd Chláraitheoir. These Acts also set out the manner in which the public may access the records and obtain certified copies of individual records. The Schedule to the Bill provides for the amendment of the registration Acts to facilitate the introduction later this year of the electronic registration of births and deaths which will represent the first phase of the modernisation programme.</P>
      <P>The Bill also includes provisions to allow for the capture and storing in electronic format of all registration records created since 1845, about 20 million records in all. The electronic capture of historical data is of fundamental importance to the success of the modernisation programme. Currently, a person can get a certificate only in the district in which the event was registered, or from the GRO. When the records are computerised it will be possible to get a certificate at any registrar's office around the country for any event registered in the State. For example, at present if one were born in Donegal and lived in Cork, one would have to write or call to the registrar in Donegal or to the GRO for a birth certificate. When the records are computerised one will be able to call to the local registrar in Cork for such a certificate.</P>

      <P>Building an Inclusive Society, the revised national anti-poverty strategy, is the culmination of a year's work in this area. The process involved a review of the methodology underlying the strategy as well as a review and revision, where appropriate, of existing targets. In addition, new targets in the areas of child poverty, women's poverty, older people, housing-accommodation and health are also included.</P>
      <P>After the economic progress we have seen in the past few years, it was deemed necessary, in the light of the substantial achievement of the original targets, to reinvigorate our policies on social inclusion. This required a root and branch review of the national anti-poverty strategy in consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>Working groups were established under various themes to facilitate the review process. The reports of the working groups were compiled into a framework document from which the new strategy has drawn extensively. The results will allow us to refocus our efforts to eliminate poverty and the revised NAPS represents the best possible plan to do so.</P>
      <P>It is a balanced and thorough assessment of our current economic and social situation, recognising the problems that remain and setting targets and policy actions to address these. It reinforces the belief that cross-cutting problems require cross-cutting solutions. Our commitment to strengthening the institutional mechanisms which support the NAPS will help to ensure these solutions can be implemented effectively.</P>
      <P>I hope the House has benefited from this outline of the key provisions of the Bill. I look forward to the debate on it and commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>As usual, the Minister likes to portray himself and the Government to the <Col N="635" /> House and to the people as a gigantic tooth fairy going up and down the country handing out huge sums of money to people, but what he has forgotten is that this money belongs to the Irish people. It is not his money. It does not belong to the Fianna Fáil Party. We have come through an unprecedented period of economic growth in recent years, of which all Governments should be rightly proud. The fundamental question we must ask ourselves in the context of this and every other Bill dealing with the area of social exclusion is whether we have created a fairer society. That is the question we will address as we draw closer to the general election. When that question is put to the people, their answer will be that we have not got a fairer society as we enter the new millennium than that which existed in 1997. That is the acid test we must put to the people in due course but we will leave that to another day.</P>
      <P>After nearly five years in office thankfully this is the last Social Welfare Bill this Administration will present to the House.</P>

      <P>Despite the more balanced approach taken to social welfare spending this year, the overall spending programme of the Government from 1998 to 2002 clearly demonstrates there is a fundamental bias at the heart of the Government in favour of the better off and wealthy in society.</P>
      <P>I do not want to live in a country where people on modest incomes cannot afford to buy a house. I do not want to live in a country which corrals poverty into well-defined geographical urban and rural areas. I do not want to live in a country where the individual counts for more than the family, yet this is the reality. This Government has put more money into the pockets of many people in this society but has failed to bring about a fairer society in the past five years. It has had an unprecedented opportunity to transform public services so that the most vulnerable are protected. As the housing list multiplies and the two-tier nature of our health system becomes more evident, the Ireland of 2002 is a greedier and disintegrating place in which to rear a family thanks to the actions of this Government. Life has become harder rather than easier for tens of thousands of families.</P>

      <P>Despite the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, to deal with the ever growing income gap between rich and poor, he knows and we know that the policymakers who hold most sway around the Cabinet table are the Ministers, Deputies McCreevy and Harney. It is their obsession with an unfair tax policy, which has allowed public services to fall behind, with social spending propping up the bottom of the league table of our EU partners. Unfortunately, Boston has won out in ideological, economic and social terms in the past five years. What of the opportunities the Government had in 1997 when it was handed an economy that was the envy of Europe? No other Government in the history of the State has been in a position to root out poverty. Unfortunately, we have had five wasted years.</P>
      <P>The Bill will make little difference to poor people who have to struggle to make ends meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That struggle was accurately described in the analysis carried out before the budget by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. It is a struggle where many families do not have adequate incomes to provide healthy food options each week and which sees more than 50,000 households without proper heating systems. Is it not amazing that, in today's wealthy society, these basic requirements are still regarded as a luxury for thousands of people?</P>
      <P>I understand the Government will tomorrow publish the next phase of the national anti-poverty strategy, first adopted by the rainbow Government in 1997. Setting out a vision for the next five years, when this Administration has wasted the past five years, does not hold out much hope for people struggling to survive. The chance to make a difference was when the economy was flush with money. Many will see tomorrow's announcement as a cynical attempt to find favour with those who have been let down in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the first to recognise that poverty is more than just the issue of income. However, without a proper basic income linked to real income power within the economy, poverty will flourish. That is <Col N="637" /> why it is vital that the majority recommendation of the social welfare benchmarking group be at the heart of the proposal and the project to be announced by the Minister and the Taoiseach tomorrow. The next phase of the national anti-poverty strategy will be worthless unless a commitment is made to move the lowest rate of social welfare significantly in the direction of 30% of gross average industrial earnings by 2007 at the latest.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks, the Minister referred to the increase in social welfare for this year and, in part, to last year. The commitment the all-party Oireachtas committee wants is not for one or two years but over a period whereby those on the lowest incomes can see a real increase in their income share. We must ensure that is part of the strategy. We know of the implacable opposition of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the report when it was first produced. That is clearly documented in their officials' reports which set out the assessment of the Department of Finance. Unless something dramatic has changed since then and there is a move in the direction of the all-party committee recommendation made some months ago following a motion put by me and other colleagues, the national anti-poverty strategy will not be worth its salt. Tomorrow we will see the contents of the Minister's announcement. I expect that recommendation to be a central feature of the national anti-poverty strategy. If it is, I will welcome it. If not, I will condemn the Government for failing to implement a strategy which I know the Minister and his officials support. Otherwise, we would not have seen officials sign up to the report when it was first produced.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's assertion that the record &ndash; his word, not mine &ndash; increase in social welfare benefits will help fight poverty, the latest information from the incomplete household budget survey highlights the extent of the widening income gap in society. It shows that the disposable income of the lowest 10% of households increased by only 33% compared to 62% for the highest 10% of households. Also, when the income of pensioners is considered, it shows that 38% of pensioners live in the lowest 20% of households in terms of income compared to 30% five years earlier. Poorer households are not keeping pace with average earnings. While we have seen significant reductions in consistent poverty, something of which we should be proud and which I am the first to recognise, on which I congratulate the Government and the previous Administration, the real problem is relative income poverty which has grown significantly in recent years. It is not good enough to say it is a function of employment. Taxation and social welfare policies are central if something significant is to be done about relative income poverty.</P>
    <P>Poverty is wider than income. In many key areas of public policy, the gap between rich and poor has grown in the past five years. We have a <Col N="638" /> two-tier health system, more than 120,000 people are unable to obtain any form of social housing, the lack of child care for poorer families prevents access to employment, too many poorer communities have become no-go areas for the Garda, carers are treated with contempt and public transport locks out many from participating in wider society. The real record of the Government and of the Minister responsible for developing an anti-poverty strategy is one of failure in the past five years.</P>
    <P>I want to shine a light on an Ireland the Government refuses to see. Ministers turn their backs and walk away from this reality. Tonight, tomorrow night, next week and in the weeks ahead almost 5,000 people will sleep in doorways, on park benches and under bridges in cities and towns throughout the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 5,000 homeless people, almost 2,000 are mentally ill. As a result of their mental illness, their lives are confused and chaotic. They are among the most vulnerable people in our community, yet they have been abandoned by the State. Their abandonment is highlighted by an unbelievable procedure which is straight from a novel by Kafka. On the one hand, they cannot be officially classified as homeless by health boards unless they live in a hostel for three months, while <Col N="639" /> on the other hand, they are not entitled to a place in a hostel unless they are classified as homeless.</P>
    <P>It is the story of people who are homeless which, more than any other, exposes the hypocrisy of the Government when it suggests that poverty has been a priority of its period in office. All the reports and the fine aspirations we have had to endure cannot explain the abject failure of the Government to provide the most basic right of all, the right to shelter. No anti-poverty strategy can explain why people in a rich country have to go without a home.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass without referring to the elaborate advertising campaign that has been launched by the Minister in the past six months. He fails to understand the fundamental distinction between giving information to clients of his Department, &ldquo;customers&rdquo; as he calls them, and the naked abuse of public funds for his own political ends. We all agree members of the public have a right to know their entitlements, and many of us in Opposition inform them of decisions taken by the House, regardless of whether we agree with them.</P>

      <P>The effective date of payment for the child benefit will go from September in 1997 to be effective from April in 2002, the earliest date from which it was administratively possible to introduce these increases.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question from me in the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs on Wednesday, 12 December, he replied in page 230 as follows:</P>
      <P>The reason for this legislation is to ensure payments are made quickly. Child benefit and other increases will not take effect until 1 April and, thus, can be taken under next year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>I then put it to him that this would require legislation, to which he replied as follows:</P>
      <P>Yes . . . the payments will not be paid until 1 April and the budget dictated that.</P>

      <P>We would not do ourselves a service in this House as Opposition Deputies if we did not point out this fact. The Minister thinks he will get away with this but the people will see through this kind of shabby deal. His strategy document makes a commitment to ensure the early delivery of payments under all the schemes operated by his Department. Here is an example where he told the House last December he would make the payments in April but, suddenly, a few months prior to the election, he decides to transfer payments to May to ensure Fianna Fáil and others get the maximum hit for the measure. That is not the way to conduct public policy or deliver payments. It is against the strategy of his own Department and I suspect Deputy Broughan and I will return to this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal that in just two months of this year more money has been spent by the Minister on advertising than throughout the entire 12 month period of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in child benefit rates is welcome and will over time provide the basis for a proper rate of child support for all children. The target set out over 2002-03 is only catching up with progress that should have been made earlier in the lifetime of this Administration. In 1997, 17% or approximately one in six Irish children were living in severe or consistent poverty. Though this rate has been falling in recent years and is now estimated to have dropped to one in eight, Ireland still has one of the highest rates of child poverty in Europe. We need to address the issue of child poverty not just from the perspective of income but from the perspective of many other related areas of public policy. The welcome <Col N="642" /> increase in child benefit does not target increased expenditure on children who live in poorer families. This Bill and the 2001 Social Welfare Bill have done nothing to target additional support to families living on social welfare. This side of the House has repeatedly requested the Government to reform the existing child dependant allowance scheme. The only way to target and provide a financial cushion to children from poorer backgrounds is to significantly increase child dependant allowances and to standardise the rates as a priority payment. It is disgraceful that no progress has been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Not enough is being done to help poorer communities provide child care facilities at a subsidised cost so that a parent or parents can take up employment. The small increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme does not address the considerable costs involved in sending children to school. The difficulty involved in sending poorer children to college has not been addressed during the lifetime of this Government. Equally, the expansion of breakfast clubs has been at a snail's pace and this initiative is recognised as one of the more effective anti-poverty measures which the Government can bring about. In health, as in education, the past five years have seen a further deterioration in the ability of poorer communities to access decent health care strategies. This is particularly the case when children are considered.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister for Health and Children told the House last week, the policy of the Government in respect of medical card entitlements following the increase in social welfare payments has led to widespread confusion among the general public. I often wonder does the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs speak to his colleagues, Deputies Martin or McCreevy. The lack of communication became evident over the Christmas period as we all discovered that some social welfare recipients were set to lose their medical cards because their increased social welfare payments outstripped the new income limits for medical cards. I want to give examples of this, which I understand were first exposed just last week at Cabinet.</P>

      <P>Following that, the Minister for Health and Children hurriedly sent out a memo to chief executives in various health boards informing them of this. For instance, prior to 1 January 2002, the contributory pension payment to a widow or widower aged 66 to 69 was &euro;129.51 and the medical card income limit exemption for a single person, living alone, aged between 66 and 69, was &euro;138.40. Therefore, that person qualified for a medical card. Since 1 January, as a result of the social welfare changes, the payment increased to &euro;144 but the income limit threshold for the <Col N="643" /> medical card was &euro;144. The same applies to invalidity pension, disability allowances and unemployment benefit. There was absolutely no communication between the Minister's Department and the Department of Health and Children. Therefore, for a period of at least three months people wondered whether the increased social welfare payment would mean they would lose the secondary benefit of a medical card.</P>
      <P>People in my constituency, and I suspect in other constituencies, were asking this question. Suddenly the Government realised there was a particular problem and, following a high level meeting, either at Cabinet or somewhere else, it decided it would have to square off the problem. That is an example of the lack of co-ordination on issues of poverty and social exclusion on which a Cabinet sub-committee is working on a daily basis. When the gaffe was discovered, all and sundry went to ground and an embarrassing memo was hurriedly sent to all health boards. This episode highlights the complete lack of co-ordination surrounding issues that affect poverty. What discussions had the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, about this? Was there no early warning system within the Minister's Department that could have alerted his officials to this discrepancy? If some of the 78 press advisers employed by the Government were helping to co-ordinate policy instead of carrying out a Stazi-like monitoring of the media, we would all be in a better position.</P>

      <P>I want to point to another lack of co-ordination, which I pointed out on 10 January last. The Minister is aware that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister referring to those over or under 66, because he claims credit for the ones under 66 as well? The Minister is aware that, as a way of compensating for tax individualisation, the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="644" /> McCreevy, introduced the home carers tax credit some years ago. It was a way of compensating one-income households as against two-income households. It was a tax credit that could be given where a spouse was at home looking after a family relation or friend. It allowed that person to work for a short period of time in any week, up to a maximum income limit of £5,000, as it then was, while still being able to claim the home carers tax credit.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of income, social welfare rates are regarded as income, admitting that this excludes carer's allowance and carer's benefit. Every other pound or euro of social welfare payment is regarded as income. Thousands of people who are currently getting the home carers tax credit &ndash; the husband or wife, depending on who is the principal income earner in the household &ndash; will lose it because the increases in social welfare rates have not been matched by an increase in the income threshold for the home carers tax credit. My party has tabled specific amendments to the Finance Bill today in regard to this issue. The Minister for Finance has not taken them on board, despite the fact that he gave me a commitment in December that he would consider the issue. I speak of another example of a lack of co-ordination between the Minister, who increases social welfare, and the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for another area of policy that delivers small increases to people's incomes. We will return to that matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provisions in the Bill, I welcome unreservedly the respite carer's grant increase. It is right and proper. However, I do not believe the problem concerns grants but finding respite care beds for people. The Minister knows that as much as any of us in the House.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the widowed parent grant. That was a good measure, for which I compliment the Minister. I am not overtly negative just for the sake of it. I have repeatedly encountered widows who have not been aware of the availability of this grant. The take-up on this grant is not as high as it should be. We have to address it by way of some form of additional&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will have a chance on Committee Stage of looking at Part 3 of the Bill. I echo what Deputy Broughan said in his response to the Minister earlier. We were promised the Civil Registration Bill. It now seems that some of the provisions the Minister is bringing forward in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are directly taken from that Bill.</P>

      <P>One of the issues I have raised continually is the amount of time it takes to get a child benefit payment. I should declare an interest in this regard. When my wife and I applied in late November, I wondered how long it would take before we were paid, and we have not been paid yet. A problem exists in terms of speedy payments of child benefit. If this section ensures that there is a much easier way to initiate the child benefit payments from maternity wards all the way through to the registration office &ndash; from my reading of it, it will &ndash; it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>This Bill is important not because of what it says but because of what it does not say. My party and I have argued consistently that the focus on income power should be directed at those who need it most. Apart from the issue of income, in terms of a number of public services that are affecting people in this country, we have not seen a fairer society. I will be calling for substantial amendments to this Bill. I know the normal course for Social Welfare Bills makes it virtually impossible for the Minister to accept amendments from this side of the House. We will do our best to point out the deficiencies that exist in this Bill and the failure on the part of the Government, over five years, to spend the wealth of the Celtic tiger in a fair and equitable manner.</P>

Many would ask why we needed this second Bill and why we could not have had, in the normal course of events, a comprehensive Social Welfare Bill both to increase rates of payment and to reform some aspects of the social welfare code, which requires reformation.</P>
      <P>The Bill forms a part of the cynical and unnecessary manipulation of the social welfare changes by the outgoing Government and the outgoing Minister. This has been highlighted in the letter I quoted earlier to the Dáil, concerning County Carlow and other parts of the country, in which the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, addressed all his customers.

It seems the Minister has opened up a can of worms in the sense that he could have adopted a straightforward approach last year. He did not do so because the Minister for Finance overruled him, as he always does. With his fellow Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáiler, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Finance overruled the Minister and did not allow him to have an early budget or facilitate social welfare recipients. He insisted that payments would have to be backdated by special arrangement early in 2002. The same was done to the child benefit increase. It appeared to many that child benefit was also to be backdated to 1 January. That impression was given to constituents and media commentators.</P>

The social partners agreed in the national development plan that we would move to a comprehensive tax and social welfare year from 1 January 2002. I believe it was a Government, of which the former Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, was leader, which pushed a number of social welfare benefits to the latest possible date in the operational year in order that the impact on the Department of Finance would be as small as possible in the calendar year.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Bill is being debated during a period of cynical electioneering by the Government.

      <P>This Administration has been lethargic and lacklustre.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the euro has impacted on social welfare recipients and their families. The Government has not put in place a system of joined up government. Departments do not consult each other or work closely together. The Government had no plan of action for the introduction of the euro, probably one of the most important issues in the history of the Irish nation. A changeover board was appointed and the manufacture and distribution of the coinage and notes was succesful, but no action was taken regarding the impact of the new currency, particularly on low income families. Througout his period in office the Minister has been a grotesque failure with regard to poverty proofing of Government actions. This was seen clearly in budget 2002, when only a page and a half of basic poverty proofing was presented by the Minister for Finance, but there was no major analysis of the impact of the budget on the poorer sections of society.</P>
      <P>It was my experience throughout 2001 that there was massive inflation in several areas, particularly the retail grocery trade. Basic grocery items increased significantly in price, particulary in the grocery retail chains, but no one appeared to be watching this. My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, repeatedly recommended that the Government take a supervisory role and, in desperation, even called for a price freeze. As he pointed out, the other 14 countries were carefully monitoring prices. Our country was in the unique situation that our old currency unit was larger than the new one. This is the reason our wallets are now full of what some of my constituents call a pile of washers. Throughout last year there was serious inflation which had a negative impact on the poorest people. Newspapers such as <i>The Irish Times</i> monitored prices for a week or two before and after the introduction of the euro and found no change, but the change was happening throughout last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there has been massive inflation in a range of goods. I compliment the Consumers Association of Ireland, the <i>Irish Independent </i>and <i>Sunday Independent</i> which have highlighted what they rightly call a euro rip-off in a range of goods, <Col N="649" /> including insurance, medical care and dispensing machines. Business people, out to make a quick buck, have surreptitiously increased prices by 10 or 20 cents on a range of goods. The effect of the &euro;10 increase in social welfare payments has already been completely eroded and this is only late February.</P>

      <P>As I told the Taoiseach a few weeks ago, the miserable increase of &euro;10 has already been wiped out. There has been significant and deliberate price inflation under the guise of the introduction of the euro.</P>
      <P>A responsible Government would have closely monitored this situation and, if necessary, imposed a price freeze. We should have had a price freeze for several months beginning on 1 January, but the Minister and his colleagues did nothing about this problem. The work of the Vincentian Partnership and other studies of the income and expenditure of low income families show that much of the increase given in the budget has been evaporated in the introduction of the euro and by the Government's failure to invigilate it properly.</P>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has been given the task of examining what happened. This is a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. What will the Minister of State tell us? He could have told us six months ago that every other equivalent Minister in the other 14 governments in Europe was trying to ensure that the rip-off that happened in rip-off Ireland under this rip-off Government would not happen. It need not have happened but it did. The net result is that this Bill and its predecessor have been largely negated by the grotesque inflation that has occurred across a range of goods.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable this matter was not taken more seriously by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The changeover was one of the great and significant changes in the life of this nation and, given the experience that is said to have happened 30 years ago with the introduction of decimalisation, we could have expected this problem. However, this is a lethargic, lacklustre Government. It is a time serving Government which just tries to get from day to day without making a significant attempt to improve people's lives.</P>
      <P>The enduring legacy of this Minister will be that he presided over the biggest growth in the gap between rich and poor in any society in Europe over the past five years. The level of relative income poverty in a large section of the community continued to grow and the gap between the top two and bottom two or three deciles expanded dramatically during his term of office. That will be his enduring legacy.</P>

That is based on one of the studies by ESRI and the National University of Ireland in Maynooth. A few years ago, in the middle of the Minister's term of office, the bottom 10% of the population enjoyed less than 2% of the total disposable income whereas the top 10% consumed 26%, over a quarter, of total disposable income. The top 50% of the population had 77% of total income while the bottom 50% had only 23%. The Minister has played a role in that. He is significantly responsible for the growth in inequality.</P>

      <P>Throughout the Minister's period of office, income inequality has grown and every piece of research graphically indicates this. In the 1970s and 1980s there was a decline in absolute inequality. Certainly, the two Governments in which the Labour Party and Fine Gael played a part presided over the introduction of significant new social measures. However, that was not sustained and certainly was not sustained under this Administration. The Minister's overall legacy will be, unfortunately, a major growth in the gap between rich and poor in this society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was Seán Lemass who said a rising tide lifts all boats. However, this clearly did not happen in the era of the Celtic tiger under this Government. The growth of inequality in social cohesion, security issues, local crime rates and even in terms of economic growth has been deplorable. There have been many fine studies in recent years <Col N="652" /> of the desperate struggle of families to live on low income. Earlier my colleague referred to the study carried out by the Vincentian Partnership for Justice called &ldquo;One Long Struggle &ndash; A Study of Low Income Families&rdquo;. The clear conclusion of the study is that the reason for the poverty of poor families struggling to exist on miserable rates of social welfare is not their inability to manage but the levels and rates of social welfare which have been set by this Government in the richest era of our history.</P>

      <P>A range of recent studies, including the fine study by the Vincentian Partnership for Justice, clearly show that our social welfare rates are fundamentally inadequate for a large segment of families in terms of having an adequate life. Look at the rates in the legislation with regard to unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance, pre-retirement and one-parent family payments. These categories of social welfare recipient are paid the princely sum of &euro;118.80 per week on which some recipients are expected to support a number of dependants. The Minister correctly asks what did my outfit do when in government. Since my first contribution on the Social Welfare Bill nine years ago I have consistently said social welfare rates are a total disgrace. I have given the Minister some commendation for the improvements in recent years, particularly last year when he was under pressure from the social partners and a reasonable increase was provided for.</P>
      <P>The head of a family is expected to live on &euro;118.80 per week while the adult dependant allowance is &euro;78.80 per week in categories such as unemployment assistance, SWA, PRETA and one-parent family allowance. All the payments provided for under the social welfare code are absolutely deplorable. Carer's allowance is &euro;122.50 per week; prisoner's wife's allowance, &euro;118.80; non-contributory pension, &euro;134; carer's benefit, &euro;132; disability benefit, &euro;118.80; and invalidity pension, &euro;123.30. Those incomes are still grossly inadequate. This fundamental issue has not been addressed by the Minister during his tenure. The rates of payment for adult dependants are insulting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister promised to bring adult depend<Col N="653" /> ant payments into line with primary payments, a promise on which he has not acted. He attempted to move towards a 70% rate, but the basic adult dependant rate is &euro;78.80, an inadequate income, as has been pointed out in every study conducted in this area. Child dependant allowances are also incredibly low, notwithstanding the recent increases in child benefit. Throughout the Minister's tenure life for many families has been one long desperate struggle to survive, as the report from the Vincentians states.</P>
    <P>Since we are conducting an end of term review of the Minister's performance, I will refer to perhaps the one bright spot, which was that he met his target of increasing the old age pension to £100 per week, for which he deserves commendation, but he has failed to achieve adequate income levels through the other increases he has provided for. He has failed to address the constant struggle of the families to which I referred as they try to survive on a weekly basis. They must often juggle with debt. There has been a total lack of provision of credit facilities in this area.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking indictment of the Minister that he has not been innovative in terms of legislation. He could have addressed a plethora of issues. Throughout his time in office there has been a list of Bills sponsored by his Department, one of the most significant of which was the money advice and budgeting service Bill which, with a host of others, will not be implemented until the next Administration takes office.</P>
    <P>The Minister's most graphic failure has been his inability to cope with income adequacy issues. He told us that he will launch a plan for social inclusion tomorrow with the Taoiseach, which will include a number of election promises, but over the past five years his approach to the national anti-poverty strategy has lacked energy and determination and he has not addressed some of the key issues involved. Like Deputy Hayes, I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister will make a commitment to minimum income standards and refer to the report from the benchmarking committee as we wait to ascertain whether the Government is serious about introducing such standards.</P>
    <P>I will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to consider a number of amendments. The increases in child benefit are welcome, but the rates of child dependant allowance are deplorably low. The increase in the respite care grant is also welcome, but the Minister will still be considered a failure by carers because he has not addressed the fundamental issue of the means test for carer's allowance. The reason a number of representatives of carers and other people with disabilities will run in the general election is because they are deeply unhappy with what the Government has delivered over the past five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Pat Carey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to discuss the legislation in a calm <Col N="654" /> and rational manner, unlike the previous speaker and Deputy Hayes, who were very reluctant to bring forward proposals. I was surprised at Deputy Hayes because he is one of the younger and brighter Fine Gael Members and did not bring forward a single proposition regarding how Fine Gael would deal with these issues in office. The party has made some outlandish proposals in terms of expenditure in this area in recent times. They were not costed and if the party was given the opportunity to implement them, there is no doubt the social budget would have to be severely curtailed. The public is entitled to hear about Fine Gael's proposals before the general election.</P>
    <P>The legislation contains a number of constructive proposals, which address areas that have not been touched for many years, including the registration of births, marriages and deaths. It is no harm to update the procedures in this regard in order that electronic records are kept and additional personnel appointed to deal with delays being experienced by members of the public. I encourage the Minister to decentralise the offices dealing with the registration of births, marriages and deaths when he introduces the new enhanced procedures in order to make such certificates more freely available. I cannot understand the reason people cannot obtain such certificates in their local post offices. The Minister should also examine the problems relating to long and short certificates and the confusion created in this regard. Perhaps he will address these anomalies, which have existed for years, in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the Minister's achievements since he took office. Any calm and rational assessment of his performance would point out he has been an outstanding success and introduced a wide variety of innovative and novel changes which have been very beneficial to those for whom he has responsibility. If the people in Labour and Fine Gael do not believe this, all they will have to do is await the verdict of the people. Throughout the country there are people on welfare payments, elderly people and carers who fully acknowledge and appreciate not only the substantial increases in payments that have been made by the Minister, but acknowledge and appreciate all the work done in extending services, modernising a system that was to a large extent archaic and forging ahead at a time when it was possible to do so because of the economic climate we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the economic climate, without a Minister in this Department who is innovative, forward looking and constructive in his approach to these issues, no advances would occur. In any rational calm assessment, whether relating to the increases in the widowed parent's payment grant, child benefit or the carers allowance, one must recognise substantial change has taken place. This has been acknowledged by the people who have been very loud in their praise of the work in this Department in recent years.</P>
    <P>I find it strange that Fine Gael in particular <Col N="655" /> would criticise the provision of information to the public about welfare entitlements and benefits. If there is a single area where there is a necessity for more information, leaflets and communication rather than less, it is in this one. On today's Order Paper there are about 30 parliamentary questions from various Deputies dealing with various aspects of the social welfare budget because there is a necessity to impart information to people who depend on these allowances and who look to the Department and the Minister in particular for guidance and information about these benefits.</P>
    <P>Modernising the structures in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has been a great achievement. People may have forgotten that I was Minister for Social Welfare for a while. It was a very short period and although it was a difficult time from a financial point of view, it was a most enjoyable experience. It was a Department that was very much behind the times in communicating with the public. This has been transformed and a large measure of credit must go to the political head of the Department but also to the officials who responded to the demands of the public for more information, communication and literature about the various schemes available. For the first time since the foundation of the State, with the development of internet communication and websites, there is now a very good system of information available to people who require it. Those of us who have been in the House for some time know that we receive more queries about welfare entitlements, benefits, social welfare payments, etc., than we do relating to any other Department.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the desirability of having closer liaison between the Minister for Education and Science and him in relation to the extension, especially to mature students, of some of the novel schemes that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has brought forward in recent years. That Department has introduced a number of innovative schemes to enable students to continue their education, especially to get mature students to go back to college to get further qualifications. The way to eliminate the poverty trap is through more investment in education. This is acknowledged both here and internationally. The more dialogue there is between the two Ministers and their Departments, the better chance we will have of getting more young people and mature students into education. In the long-term, this is key to tackling the poverty and deprivation that many people have suffered through lack of educational opportunity and qualification. The social welfare budget should embrace issues other than just the payment of carer's allowances, unemployment benefits, disability pensions, etc. There are fundamental issues such as education in which this Department can have a big influence.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs could also influence other Depart<Col N="656" /> ments like the Department of Environment and Local Government. There are many elderly people who live in isolated rural areas that do not have basic sanitary services or a decent house in which to live and this needs to be tackled. Access to some of these houses is a problem. In the western part of my constituency, there are a number of elderly people living in isolated rural houses where not only are the houses of an inferior quality but the roads to them are almost impassable. This needs to be dealt with by Departments other than the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. However, this all relates to having a better standard of life and a better environment, in which people can live, work and retire. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in liaison with the Departments of Education and Science and Environment and Local Government and some of the local authorities can make a meaningful contribution to the development of services, especially for elderly people living in isolated areas.</P>
    <P>I will commend some people who work in the community. I express my appreciation of the work of Clare Care. I also compliment Fr. Sean Healy of CORI for the work he is doing. CORI does not always agree with the policies proposed by this Department, but everybody must acknowledge the contribution made by people like Fr. Sean Healy in the development of community welfare and social services in recent years. I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister for his contribution to this area since his appointment.</P>

      <P>In the evaluation of the record of a Government at the end of five very successful years, it would be foolish to think that politics would not raise its head and some of the issues would not become political footballs. Normally I expect to hear Deputy Broughan, who is now absent, fulminating rather fiercely on issues relating to social welfare. However his contribution this evening was spectacularly restrained. I must conclude that he is quite happy with what has been done.</P>
      <P>If we are at the end of a review, it is only fair to place on record the achievement of this Government. Like other speakers, I pay tribute to the Minister for being very enlightened and innovative. I also pay tribute to his officials who have been efficient, courteous and at all times supportive of the work, which we try to do as public representatives. I have the honour of working with some of the Minister's officials in the Finglas Cabra Partnership, the local drugs task forces and other local fora. I find them extremely supportive and enlightened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the rainbow government was in power, it increased old age contributory pensions by just 9.9%. The present Government has increased them by 48.7%. When inflation is taken into account, the rainbow government increased old age contributory pensions by just 4% and we have increased them by 23.9%. The widow or <Col N="657" /> widower's pension was increased by just 10.2% under the rainbow government. The present Government has increased it by 36.6%. Unemployment and disability benefit was increased by just 10% under the rainbow government. The present Government has increased it by 38.6%. Old age non-contributory pensions were increased under the rainbow government by 10%. The present Government has increased them by 85.3%. Long-term unemployment assistance was increased under the rainbow government by 10.7% and the present Government has increased it by 36%. The rainbow government increased short-term unemployment assistance by 14.6% and the present Government increased it by 43.1%. The measure of any government's concern for its community is how well it treats its most vulnerable citizens. The Government has gone a long way towards achieving the goals we set when in opposition. Targets have been set and achieved in most cases.</P>
    <P>Child benefit increases are at a record high level, which is as it should be as it is important to support families. In the absence of widely available good quality child care it is important to provide families with opportunities to access available child care. It is rich to hear some Opposition Members say that child benefit payments should be brought forward to May. I would like them to be brought forward to January. Deputy De Rossa announced increases in his last budget in December 1996 when he was Minister for Social Welfare, but they did not take effect until the following September, ten months later.</P>
    <P>The target of £100 for old age pensions was ambitious at the time, but exceeded by the Government, which is as it should be. It is our duty to support those who worked hard in difficult circumstances to make the nation what it is. It is the obligation of everyone in all parties to ensure payments to the elderly are at least at their current level. When Fianna Fáil returns to government after the next general election it will continue to give major increases in the area of care and support for the elderly. That will also be the case for medical cards which were introduced for those over 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the fact that I made a contribution at our parliamentary party to the introduction of the pre-1953 pension. The Minister took a risk with his own officials, but was enlightened and brave to do so. It redressed a wrong which had continued for a number of years. It was wrong that people who had worked prior to 1953 &ndash; they are all in their later years now &ndash; were deprived of adequate pension entitlements. This has been redressed by the Minister. I am sure there are more up-to-date figures available, but the last time I asked the Minister a question about this issue I was told that the Department had identified 13,500<i> pro rata </i>old age contributory-retirement pensioners who could qualify for the pre-1953 old age contributory pension at a higher rate than their existing rate of pension. I remember debating the issue at our parliamen<Col N="658" /> tary party meeting when the Minister assured us it could be introduced, but would be costly. He said it could cost approximately £6 million. His officials will probably confirm that figure is now closer to £20 million. I am pleased to note that people I know living in the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout the world can qualify for an Irish based pension on the grounds they worked here in insurable employment prior to 1953.</P>
    <P>On taking office the Government changed the name of the Department to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Many thought that was a gimmick at the time. However, the provision of services by the Department is like a three legged stool in that one without the other would be a lop-sided service. I am satisfied that social welfare improvements, such as those in child benefit, pensions and carer's allowance, underpin the service in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>An unsung part of the Department's work was adverted to, namely, the community dimension. I see the valuable work which groups such as the Community Action Project in Ballymun, the Finglas South Community Development Project and the Finglas West Community Development Project do to energise, inform and alert people and communities about their entitlements and the direction in which they should go. They are providing a tremendous service, as are the money advice bureaus. The Minister provided £200,000 for the Finglas money advice bureau before Christmas to defray its mortgage on its premises and carry out improvements. That service, which is part of a network involving the Department, the credit unions, St. Vincent de Paul, FÁS, etc., is invaluable. Many communities, such as those in which I work, would not manage without it.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Department for the enlightened way it has promoted the return to education programmes. It would leave the Department of Education and Science standing in the way it has been creative and innovative in promoting its schemes. Thousands have returned to education and got their junior and leaving certificate and university degrees. I am delighted to have met a number of people who are lecturing at university level and teaching at second level as a result of the intervention of the Department in vocational training.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of Comhairle, the citizen information service. People need to have access to points of information. Comhairle and organisations such as the Finglas citizen information centre provide a service which is badly needed. Some think it will make Deputies redundant, but I do not believe that. It will help to ensure the people who come to us are clearer in their demands and more focused on what they require.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to commend the Minister at the end of a successful five year period in office. I thank him for the work he has done. As was said elsewhere, much has been done, but more needs to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. The Bill affects a large number of both young and old people. I welcome many of its changes. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has given support to community groups which have done a tremendous job, particularly for the elderly by bringing them out for meals, etc. I welcome the role the Department has played in this. I welcome many other aspects of what the Minister has done over the past five years.</P>
      <P>I take umbrage at the Minister over the lack of support for farming, an issue I have raised with him on a number of occasions. Departmental officials have heard me speak on numerous occasions about farm assist and the damage it has done to the farming community. My party and I wanted family income supplement to be extended to farming groups, small shopkeepers and small private industries. That would have ensured everyone was on a level playing pitch. However, there seems to be a view in Government that farm accounts cannot be trusted. Perhaps when one remembers the recent stories about the activity of some accountants &ndash; I can think of a former Taoiseach who did not keep his accounts well &ndash; one will realise the reason there is mistrust about farm accounts.</P>
      <P>It is unfair that farmers are not treated in the same way as everyone else. I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider the position. Farmers are as entitled as small shopkeepers and other small business holders to claim family income supplement. Singling out farmers is discriminatory.</P>
      <P>Up to 40,000 farmers marched through the streets of Dublin in protest and one of the guarantees they received &ndash; which was designed to keep them quiet &ndash; was that the farm assist scheme would revolutionise the system of supports to small farmers. What has happened? Very few additional farmers obtained payments under the scheme and some lost out. I fully appreciate the reasons for that. Some were transferred from disability benefit to farm assist payments because it was slightly beneficial, while others were transferred from widows or widowers pensions. However, there was only a minor increase in the total number of payments. As a result, massive numbers of people have had to abandon farming. The figures will show that there has not ever been such a move away from farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people are no longer prepared to enter farming because they realise there are no real supports on which to rely if hard times occur. Four agricultural colleges have closed down during the lifetime of the Government. There is no doubt that the suggestion by a group established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, that there will be no more than 20,000 full-time farmers by 2010 will become a reality. That is one of the commitments the Government made which will actually come to pass. Farming will become a thing of the <Col N="660" /> past because no worthwhile safety net was put in place. Safety nets were put in place for others, but not for farmers.</P>
    <P>During my time as a member of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, I was glad to be involved in ensuring that some level of pension would be paid to those who did not have ten years' worth of stamps paid following the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988. We received agreement from the Minister that these people would be paid pensions on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. However, when the matter finally came before the House for finalisation, it emerged that only a half pension would be paid to those who had paid PRSI for five years or more. Is it fair that someone who has paid ten years worth of stamps should be paid a half pension? I accept that these people may not have been working full-time for ten years after 1988, but many of them paid the full ten years worth of stamps. They were glad to receive some form of payment, but just because they were born two or three days on the wrong side of 5 April they lost out and received no recognition for the other five years worth of stamps they paid. At this late stage I beg that this matter be reconsidered and that these people should be paid pensions in respect of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth years in respect of which they paid stamps.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of elderly farmers and old age pensions, I received a telephone call today from a farmer in my constituency whose animals were taken away by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and slaughtered at Henshaws. The man in question did not even know where they were going or what was going to happen to them. He trusted the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This old age pensioner has in his possession a cheque for £1,500 which is not worth anything to him. He has had no promise from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, whose officials removed his animals, when or if he will be paid. If we are to be sympathetic towards people such as the man to whom I refer and if we want to ensure the survival of rural areas, we must ensure that they are treated with courtesy, decency and honesty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in child benefit payments. It is approximately four years since my party's leader, Deputy Noonan, our then spokesperson on finance, suggested that the only way of dealing with child care problems would be to dramatically increase the level of child benefit payments. Such an increase has been granted this year and we welcome that fact. However, a large number of child care places have been lost because of a lack of co-ordination between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science and others. There is a need to reconsider the position in this area. Female partners in couples on low and middle incomes are finding it difficult to remain in work <Col N="661" /> because of a lack of affordable child care. Action must be taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about carers. I appreciate that changes have been made in the carer's allowance in recent years. It was not recognised for a long period that these people needed support and much remains to be done. If there is not sufficient money available to provide support to all carers, more serious consideration should be given to the cases of those who are in real need. I was approached by a home carer recently who informed me about a woman for whom she cares whose daughter-in-law must provide care on a 24 hour basis. Her husband works in an ordinary job and works overtime to try to maintain the family. As a result, they are disqualified from receiving carer's allowance. It is sad that someone who provides 24 hour care receives no recognition. This woman can only travel to town to shop when her husband is at home.</P>
    <P>I will comment on the situation of people who were obliged to travel abroad in the past in search of work who are entitled to free schemes, etc., if they are on a pension from the UK, Germany or some other country. I came across an anomaly the other day involving a person with a UK pension who has been living here for several years who is not entitled to claim living alone allowance. That is unfair. The woman in question was informed that because she was not receiving any payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, she was not entitled to the £6 living alone allowance. She was obliged to leave Ireland in the 1950s because there was no work here for her and she is costing the State nothing now. I urge the Minister to ensure that the position is rectified. I do not believe that, under the Bill, the living alone allowance is available to the person in question who is living on her bare pension. That should not be the case. This woman has no other income or means and simply because she is not entitled to apply for an Irish pension she cannot obtain the living alone allowance.</P>
    <P>The position of widows and widowers has improved in that either is now entitled to obtain a pension. I welcome the increase in the dependant allowance that can be made as a once-off gesture, after death, to the surviving spouse. However, a major problem continues to obtain because widows are still linked to carers. If a widow is in receipt of a contributory pension, either on foot of her own contributions or those of her spouse, there is nothing to stop her from taking a full-time or part-time job. However, if she remains at home to care for one of her in-laws, for example, she is not entitled to claim an allowance. There is a law which says that if a person is a carer and is in receipt of social welfare payments, no allowance can be paid. That is something which a Government claiming to be so generous in relation to social welfare must take into account and must make sure is available. I welcome one change made during the course of this year whereby, if a husband or wife dies some weeks <Col N="662" /> before 5 June and the other partner is a carer, that person will get the respite grant. I appreciate the courtesy of the Minister and his officials when I raised that matter and I hope it will apply on a permanent basis. I am aware of a situation in which two ladies were caring for two gentlemen, one a spouse and the other a neighbour, and both died on the one day. The neighbour carer got the £400 respite grant, as it was then, but the widow who really needed it was transferred to the widow's pension and would not have got the respite grant. I am glad the Department's response was generous and I hope that will be carried through in the regulations for this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his backbenchers have highlighted the great increase in the amounts of money paid in recent years but they failed to recognise the costs. The cost of housing has increased dramatically during that period, as has the cost of rented accommodation for people on social welfare. That is a major problem. As Deputy Daly has already said, many elderly people in rural areas are still without toilet facilities. While the means to deal with the problem are available, it often takes so long to put it into operation that the person has died in the meantime. A much more co-ordinated effort is needed in that regard. While the problem does not rest directly with the social welfare people, it is indirectly a social welfare problem. There is often extra cost as a result of people not being housed properly and not having carers at an earlier date. The lack of bus services in many rural areas is another issue which needs serious attention. There is a major problem of loneliness which puts great pressure on people to go into homes for the elderly when that is not the best solution for them.</P>
    <P>I particularly noted Deputy Daly's comments on education. The education grants for people coming off social welfare are beneficial. However, for those who have not ever been on social welfare, but whose families have been on it, the education grants are entirely unsatisfactory. In the case of a single mother or a family on disability benefit who are trying to educate a son or daughter at a third level college in Dublin or elsewhere, the only grant available is in the region of &euro;2,000 and a small increase was given last year. This needs to be completely reviewed. In my Constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, there is one of the highest levels of drop-out from third level education and that is partly because people cannot afford to continue. That forces people into the dole queues. In the event of a downturn in the economy, as is now the case, those without a CV showing an adequate level of education find it much harder to get employment. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and his Government colleagues must look more closely at that situation. A low level of participation in third level education leads to many problems for families.</P>
    <P>I will turn to another issue which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle may say is not the responsi<Col N="663" /> bility of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, but it is relevant to the situation in Cavan. I refer to problems in relation to medical cards, which were available to approximately 37% of the population when this Government took office. Prior to the introduction of medical cards for over 70s, that figure had dropped dramatically because the means test has not been increased to take account of increases in income and social welfare rates. The Minister for Health and Children said the increase in social welfare rates would not cut off people from the medical card system and that, if they were cut off, they could re-apply. However, the reality is that a person with an income of £101, or less than &euro;130, is not entitled to a medical card. A person on an income of around £200, with a spouse and three children, is not entitled to a medical card. This is a major problem, especially in rural Ireland, including the constituency I represent. A person who has not got a medical card cannot get a bus ticket for free travel. That is just one of the benefits linked to the medical card, without which people are forced into a poverty trap and enormous pressure is placed on families. I would have expected the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to see this difficulty and try to deal with it. It is absolutely essential to have that situation rectified.</P>
    <P>In general terms, I pay tribute to the officials in the social welfare system. There have been great advances and there is now a much more courteous and helpful attitude towards people seeking social welfare services. It was disappointing that it took such a long drawn out process to resolve the industrial dispute in Letterkenny, which caused great problems for people awaiting their entitlements, including child benefit. I urge the Government to ensure that the appeals service works better. I know of a person who has had to wait for months on end to have an appeal heard in relation to the farm assist scheme. People who are living in poverty need to have their cases dealt with promptly. I urge the Government to provide sufficient personnel to ensure that the appeals system operates properly. While I welcome many elements of this year's budget, we have still a long way to go in eliminating poverty traps. I look forward to the opportunity which parties on this side of the House will have after the general election to rectify those problems.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Cecilia Keaveney. The Bill under discussion provides for increases in child benefit, improvements in respite care grant, extending payment of child dependant allowances for certain children of recipients of short-term social welfare payments and changes in linking arrangements for claims to disability benefit, unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance. The Bill also provides for a number of miscellaneous changes to the social welfare code. As the 28th Dáil draws to a conclusion, it <Col N="664" /> is appropriate to reflect on what has been achieved by Fianna Fáil in Government. In the 1997 general election campaign, Fianna Fáil put social inclusion at the top of its agenda. We have delivered on our commitments in that regard across a wide range of Departments.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann, acknowledging the contribution of sub-post offices to the commercial and community life of the country and to sustaining the rural and urban communities which they have served for many decades, deplores the decision by the Minister for Public Enterprise to disregard the recommendations of the report of Mr. Phillip Flynn which recommended &ldquo;that all necessary steps be taken by the Government to maximise the amount of business channelled through the An Post network&rdquo; in favour of the interdepartmental report which will lead to the forced closure of up to 900 sub-post offices and calls on the Government to ensure the following: </P>

      <P>I wish to share time with my colleagues, Deputies Browne (<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>), McGinley, Connaughton, Belton, Timmins and Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago An Post announced the laying off of 1,100 staff. What a retrograde step for a company which has a total monopoly of the postal service, been part of what we are for generations, a national institution and such unrealised commercial potential. Here is a company which, until a few years ago, had a full ministry all to itself, the Department of Post and Telegraphs, <Col N="665" /> and which, like Eircom, was subsequently established as a company with a view to enabling it to modernise, expand and become more business-like but which has limped lamely along rather than rising to the challenge and availing of the huge market opportunities there for the taking.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is the main shareholder in An Post, yet she has allowed it to drift helplessly with huge projected losses beckoning on the horizon. Last October in a reply to a Dáil question, she stated the interdepartmental group's report, commissioned by her and published last July, forecast accumulated losses in the post office counter service over the four year period 2001-04 at nearly £80 million. She went on to state the scale of these losses is unsustainable and represents a serious threat, not only to the post office network, but the An Post group. What a gloomy prediction for a company with such enormous potential.</P>
    <P>Instead of sketching out a positive business plan, based on the findings of the Flynn report, the Minister decided to establish yet another think tank grandiosely titled a &ldquo;partnership forum&rdquo;. The forum was established last October, but to date we have received no report from it. All the while post office staff, both those employed directly by An Post and those in the sub-post office sector, have been left wondering and waiting what their eventual fate will be. The announcement of over 1,100 redundancies was sprung on the Communication Workers Union without consultation, let alone agreement. I spoke with its officers today who were adamant that there had been no consultation with them on this announcement. This has damaged and prejudiced the possibility of consensus.</P>
    <P>There should be no need to lay off staff in An Post. Instead of laying off staff, An Post could retain the bulk of its existing staff, expand its range of services and become an extremely attractive alternative to the existing commercial banks. What other sector of the public service has a network of 1,916 staffed offices located strategically throughout the length and breadth of the country, penetrating right into the hearts of every urban and rural community? Never before were the market opportunities more glaringly available for an expansion of its range of services than at present.</P>
    <P>During the years the post office service has, apart from a few relatively minor developments, shied away from building on its range of activities. Fine Gael in government would change all that. The ten point plan which we put before the Dáil this evening would transform the post office structure into a thriving and vibrant service and commercial outlet.</P>
    <P>At the top of our agenda would be the development of An Post banking services. During the years An Post savings schemes such index linked savings, instalment savings and saving certificates have proven to be much more attractive than those on offer from the commercial banking sector. In terms of yield to the investor, it could and <Col N="666" /> does beat the banks hands down. If it could do so in the savings area, then why can it not take on the banks in offering a current account facility broadly similar to the current account arrangements which the banks used to offer but which they have abandoned in their quest for so-called greater efficiency and larger profits? </P>
    <P>No longer can one walk into a bank and simply cash a cheque &ndash; even a Government cheque. One must first lodge the cheque and then make the withdrawal from one's current account. No longer are banks prepared to offer to their customers the traditional bill paying services which millions and millions have availed of over the generations. No longer are banks prepared to see their role as having even any minor kind of social dimension. The relentless pursuit of better than last year end of year results has become the absolute imperative of all banks. The result is small branch closures, leaving both urban and rural customers having to travel miles to avail of services. In many areas the banks pull out and close their branches giving only minimal notice and do not even leave an ATM service in their wake.</P>
    <P>The result is that thousands of loyal customers, incapable of adapting to the new methodologies and practices, are left abandoned and feeling unwanted. This vacuum left by bank closures presents a huge window of opportunity for An Post. Fine Gael will ensure An Post will allow present disenchanted bank customers to lodge money to An Post current accounts. Customers would have standard cheque books in order to enable them to make payments from their accounts. The new restrictive bank practice of lodging cheques before one can withdraw would not operate.</P>
    <P>Post offices would have ATM machines in order that customers could withdraw from bank accounts seven days per week provided they were in credit. The An Post bank would be a customer focused institution with a business thrust, available nationwide and serving communities abandoned by the banks. Huge numbers of disillusioned bank customers would switch their business to such a consumer orientated State owned institution. Billions of euros would flow from the banks into the coffers of An Post current accounts. Not alone would it be self-financing, it would generate huge profits for the company, part of which would be used to improve, expand and augment its existing and new services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, as the main shareholder, is incapable of seeing the obvious potential of the An Post network over which she presides. She turns a deaf ear to the sensible expansion proposals recently announced by Muintir na Tíre. An An Post banking service operating six days a week from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. would attract enormous business, seriously challenge the banks and turn the predicted losses into substantial profits.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the deal negotiated between the AIB and An Post in regard to the facility to cash <Col N="667" /> AIB cheques in An Post offices. I put it to the Minister and the House that this is a very watered down version of what could be realised if An Post had its own current account arrangements.</P>
    <P>One of the mainstays of the existing post office service is the payment of social welfare entitlements. It is absolutely imperative that these continue to be part and parcel of the core business of all post offices and sub-post offices. ESB bill payments are coming on-stream in the next month or so in post offices, but this represents only a fraction of the potential, in terms of the bill paying facility that An Post offices could offer, if the service was made available. An Post offices and sub-post office staff would be more than capable of taking on board a range of services such as the payment of water, sewerage and refuse collection charges on a fee per item basis. There is absolutely no reason post offices should not be used for the renewal of driving licenses and motor taxation. They could easily become one-stop-shops for central and local government information and transactions, all of which would involve payment on a fee per item basis which would generate business and profit for the company.</P>
    <P>The An Post network must adapt to the rapidly changing demands of Irish society. The e-commerce revolution opens up a host of new possibilities which must be exploited by the unique nationwide reach of the An Post network. Post offices should have Internet services enabling their customers to use the Internet, draw down information and engage in commercial transactions.</P>
    <P>In order to provide the expanded range of services it is obvious that training modules must be put in place. The general perception is that the bulk of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are in the elderly category who would be incapable of adapting to the demands and challenges of a vastly expanded range of services. I found to my surprise that this is untrue. At the various meetings that I attended since the sub-post offices came under threat I was pleased to observe that the majority of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were in the middle or younger age group. They are educated, ambitious, enthusiastic and extremely confident of their own abilities to deliver any business or service opportunity that the company would send in their direction. There is a cohort of elderly sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses who would not see themselves as capable of meeting the challenges of the new enhanced and expanded post office. These are people who during the years have provided their local communities with the existing range of services. The least An Post could do for them is to offer them a reasonable gratuity in recognition of their service to the company during the years.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, some post offices would have an accommodation problem in regard to accommodating and providing new services because of the lack of space, the structure of the building or the <Col N="668" /> failure to modernise them during the years. To meet the new service requirements An Post should put in place a low interest scheme repayable over ten years for the modernisation and upgrading of sub-post office premises. I have spoken to individual sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and all of them, without exception, have indicated that they would welcome and avail of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>What Fine Gael is proposing is not fanciful, but practical, pragmatic and achievable. It is a survival plan based on an evaluation of the existing national branch network, its staff and potential. It would transform and invigorate the local post office and secure the post office forever as a cornerstone of the community.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>: </b>I support the motion before the House and the proposals of Deputy Jim Higgins in trying to bring modernisation to sub-post offices, especially in rural Ireland. Every one of the almost 2,000 post offices is not viable. Some are located in very small communities without the necessary population to support them, but a balance must be struck as post offices located in isolated areas need to be maintained from a social point of view.</P>
      <P>I was once part of a delegation to the GPO which made a great case for the preservation of post offices in rural Ireland. When we were finished the officials told us that the post office in question dealt with two old age pensioners and three children allowance books, which blew our case apart. That is the exception, but there are many post offices that can be upgraded and are in a position to save people travelling into or even to the far side of town.</P>
      <P>Last week business at Carlow town post office was interrupted due to staff sickness, resulting in a queue out on the street for most of the afternoon. If the post office in Graiguecullen, almost a town in itself, which catered for thousands of customers, was reopened, customers from the post office at the top of Carlow town could be redirected to it to balance out the situation. Customers can pick their post office, but it would be sensible for those at the northern end of a town to deal with the post office in that area, likewise with other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past school pupils bought special savings stamps and prizes were given to the schools which had made the best effort at encouraging saving. Many years ago Mr. Hall presented a plaque to the school in which I taught &ndash; at a time when young people saved money rather than spent it the minute they got it. Post offices have such a role to play. The saving certificates scheme they offered, a great value investment, has been stopped. The scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance is being advertised by the banks as their own. The Minister is looking puzzled. I am referring to the SSIA. Perhaps if the post offices had been left with their own saving schemes, it might have helped them. There is no end to what can be done with post offices and the need to <Col N="669" /> have them located in so many parts of rural Ireland because they are a focus point which should be upgraded. It is, however, hard to defend a post office if the locals are travelling to the nearest town and leaving it with very little business. I support the motion to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion. My youth was spent around a rural post office as my late father was sub-postmaster in Kenagh. Looking back over the years I can recall the local postmen, the late Ted Brown, Sam Hall, Con Daly and Larry Kelly. They are all gone to their glory now, but they arrived at work at 7 a.m. to pack their bicycles and take off in hail or snow and did not return until 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. That was service. The only telephone in the area was to be found in the post office. My mother, who is hale and hearty at 92, was a human computer taking messages for everybody &ndash; doctors, veterinarians and those who wanted to be collected from the railway station. The post office was a major part of life. It generally doubled up as a shop or public house and was the main focus in all villages and smaller towns.</P>
      <P>Things have changed as many of the shops attached to post offices disappeared with the advent of shopping centres and supermarkets. In some cases sub-postmasters found it difficult to survive, but the service they provide is still vital in rural areas. We have a Minister of State running the CLÁR scheme, the policy of which is to bring people back to rural areas. He did not have any funding for a while, but has found some now and has a few bob to spend. I plead with him to press home how important the post office is in a rural context.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins for moving the motion. Its proposals certainly sound good and I look forward to what the Minister has to say about them. I am sure that, in terms of where she comes from, she supports what the motion outlines. Its proposals are very realistic and spell out what can and should be done. It is a fine motion which I hope is supported by all Members.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the chance to speak on the motion. One of the important factors in this debate is the simple fact that unless we are able to attract more business to the post office system, we will not be able to save it. I say straight to the face of the Minister across the chamber that she has not been able to do so, nor has the senior management of An Post. That is disheartening. It is as plain as the nose on her face that, over the past ten to 15 years, major changes have not been made. Those on the ground knew all about it because they were not able to make a living from the business they conducted in their post offices. I will give an instance later of just how frustrated a person can become at the discovery of how little is thought of their activities when they try to take redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" />The postal service is highly regarded, particularly in rural areas. As Deputy Jim Higgins and others said, we must make post offices commercial. Many things will have to be done simultaneously to accomplish this. One will not attract the public into run-down premises, therefore it is important that low interest loans are made available to those who want to improve their post offices. One does not see the banks in the main streets, or the credit unions &ndash; fair play to them &ndash; situated in bad buildings. One would not want to see post offices in poor premises either.</P>
    <P>There is a whole range of banking activities, which I do not have time to describe in the few minutes granted to me to speak, that the post offices could take on. If the credit unions could come up from nothing to be the power houses they now are, could not the post offices do the same? The credit unions were not backed by powerful financiers. Post offices have a history of banking in their own right. If one asked any person outside the House with what they associated the post offices, they would first answer &ldquo;letters,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;saving certificates&rdquo;. That business is transacted from one generation to another. What Deputy Jim Higgins and Fine Gael want to do is to build on this. It is not as if the post offices would be starting out afresh.</P>
    <P>I welcome the connection with the AIB, but why did it not happen years ago? The AIB was closing its sub-offices five years ago, just as the other banks are doing now. People did not think of doing it and others did not want to do it. I remember when An Post took its first steps towards breaking with the State. I thought that there would be all sorts of new initiatives, but the management let us down. The Minister must believe that there is no future for it, because if she did not, she would have done what one would have expected the main shareholder to do, but that was not done. In the forthcoming general election, whatever else will be said about the Government, it will not be given credit for anything that has happened with our post offices.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that the franchise for the payment of social welfare entitlements is held by An Post. Among those in receipt of such payments is a cohort of persons who are elderly and not very mobile. Going to the local town or village to pick up their payment is their day out. That is an important aspect of the matter. I particularly like the Muintir na Tíre proposals which are based on a great deal of good sense. A great amount of commerce would be conducted in our post offices if they became a reality. Water charges collection, e-commerce and Internet services would form part of them. I know many postmasters and postmistresses would be only too delighted to be trained in these areas to which they would give their all because this is the business they want to be in. They would prefer not to have to get out of it, if possible.</P>
    <P>There are some post offices in sparsely populated areas with elderly inhabitants which it would be very difficult to make economical, but <Col N="671" /> how does An Post treat those who have stood behind their counters for five and a half days per week? They are about the only people who work that many days. A particular lady called me in a couple of weeks ago and told me that we politicians did not know how bad her pay was. She works for £88 for a five and a half day week. She has to be in the post office as she cannot afford to pay anyone else and is the mother of a young family. She got the post office nine and a half years ago when it came to her through her family. She rang An Post a couple of weeks ago to ask what redundancy money she would receive if she closed the door. She was told she would receive £700, in old money. What an insult to somebody who has worked for ten years and devoted herself to this service. Can the House imagine how low the morale of post office staff is?</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity which can be found in what Deputy Jim Higgins said here tonight and what Fine Gael proposes for the future of the post offices. It will not be easy and there are many problems along the road. Unless the Minister and the top brass in An Post get it into their heads that this is needed and can be supplied profitably, we will reach a point in five years where there will be fewer post offices. Deputy Belton mentioned the CLÁR programme for the disadvantaged areas. One can imagine what will happen if one Minister is hell bent on closing down services and another Minister is hell bent on opening them? Considering they are both members of the same Government, this says much about their strategic planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I always wondered where Deputy Belton got his feel for politics, but now I know. I can picture him in Kenagh with the handset up to one ear, running down to the local railway station with a message for the doctor. It is certainly a training which has stood him in good stead. It is not that we ever underestimated him, but now we know the secret behind his success.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister here this evening because it is difficult to get a response from her or the Department on matters dealing with An Post. I have tabled many questions but she has the shield of the Ceann Comhairle's office. Maybe that is an incorrect way to put it, but my questions are always disallowed. As there are a few issues I want to raise, I am glad the Minister is in a compliant mood. She might respond to these issues in her contribution.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the concept of the one-stop-shop. In every local newspaper one picks up nowadays there is a cry from the community for a one-stop-shop. In the midst of such calls, the Minister is closing down many one-stop-shops. This is a timely motion. There is tremendous scope for the development of the post offices, both in rural and urban areas.</P>

    <P>The motion mentions ATM facilities. In recent years the major banks have developed a tendency of pulling out of communities. Over the past 15 <Col N="672" /> years they have reduced their services from three days a week to one day a week and a trend evolved where many people moved to the county town to do their business. As a result we have seen towns like Letterkenny, Sligo and Kilkenny grow at the expense of the smaller towns. However, many of these smaller towns are beginning to hit back. The people are shopping locally and banking locally, and they certainly want to do their post office business locally. There is great scope for the services of An Post in such areas. In these communities anybody with a bit of common sense would ask the Minister why motor tax applications cannot be processed in the local post office. The Minister might well respond that one can process motor tax applications by post, but many people prefer to do so in person.</P>
    <P>In my county the post offices could be useful to deal with issues such as planning. The county office is in the region of 40 miles from my home and many people throughout the country live a similar distance from their local office. The planning office in the county of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Keaveney, is in Lifford. I do not know if there is another planning office in the county but it is difficult for people to travel from the south of the county to Lifford, which is a good distance. On issues like motor tax applications and planning files, there is great scope for tying in the local authorities and the post offices for the purposes of disseminating information on these local authority matters.</P>
    <P>In addition, the post office certainly adds to the social fabric of a community. For example, ten years ago there were six post offices, that is, one main post office and five sub-offices, in Bray which is in my constituency. As recently as this time last year, there were perhaps five and now there are three. There are queues of people, many elderly, outside the main post office on the Quinsborough Road every day of the week, not just on Thursday, and an effort is being made to divert certain facilites, which that post office does not undertake, to the sub-offices. In a period when the population of the town increased threefold from in the region of 10,000 to 30,000, the number of post offices decreased from six to three. Therefore, there has been a 200% increase in population and a 50% decrease in the number of post offices. Can the Minister throw any light on that and can she solve that problem?</P>
    <P>The post office in Delgany closed down just before Christmas. The difficulty was that it was not economically viable because the rent on the premises was too high. It is difficult to rent property in the area, but how can these offices compete with other businesses when the scope of their involvement is limited? The Minister should open up the post offices to the services to which I referred. I am not saying the service should be run like the Simon Community or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. They must be economically viable, but let us give them the opportunity. I would appreciate it if the Minister in her response could update me on the current position with <Col N="673" /> regard to the post offices in Bray and Delgany. However, I support this motion wholeheartedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Fine Gael for tabling this motion which I support passionately. The maintenance of post offices within a reasonable distance is a key element in guaranteeing a reasonable quality of life for many people, particularly elderly people, in towns and rural areas. I speak as a long-standing loyal customer of An Post. I pay my telephone bill and my gas bill at the local post office and I look forward to paying my ESB bill there in the near future.</P>
      <P>Is í oifig an phoist an t-aon ionad airgeadais inar féidir le daoine a gnó a dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge agus is rud mór é sin do dhaoine atá ag tógáil clainne le Gaeilge nó atá ag plé le gaelscolaíocht. That should not be forgotten at this time when it is difficult enough to find outlets where one can do business through Irish. Not unlike many gaelscoileanna and other schools, oifigí an phoist are key facilities in any town. The post office is similar to a library, dispensary, hospital or church. Their importance is greater for elderly people, as previous speakers have said.</P>
      <P>The post offices in my area of north County Dublin are important, in places like the Naul where there is no bus service to the larger towns like Balbriggan and Swords &ndash; this is something which, given her responsibilities, would be of interest to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke &ndash; and in villages like Ballyboughal where pensioners depend on them. Likewise in St. Margaret's and Oldtown everyone depends on the post office.</P>
      <P>In larger towns like Rush, Skerries, Balbriggan, Malahide and Portmarnock the post office is not only an important facility, but also a major tourist attraction, a landmark and a key support for the traders in the area. The chambers of commerce regularly are in touch with me, the Minister and An Post in regard to postal services and other important services provided by the post offices.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the post office in the main street of the growing metropolis of Swords was faced with closure recently and the postmistress had to get involved in a war of words. There was a psychological battle of brinksmanship as to whether it would be possible to continue with a post office in the town, which is so huge its population is growing on a daily basis. It had got to a stage where, according to An Post, a town like Swords, the population of which has grown from 35,000 to 50,000 within a year or two, could do without a post office and the company was prepared to let that happen. It is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feelings of being taken for granted, which I know were felt deeply and hurtfully by the postmistress in Swords, are shared by many members of the Post Office Workers Union who I met outside the gates of Leinster House. The workers feel they are not only working as post office employees but also as local advisers and, indeed, translators because for many immigrant workers the post office is the first port of call in terms of interfacing with Irish bureaucracy. The post <Col N="674" /> officer worker definitely provides a vital facility and should not be taken for granted. Indeed, remuneration should reflect that they do a valuable job, and that is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>Not only have the post offices been the backbone of the community, but the commercial life of many villages depends on them. It must be recognised that they are part of an infrastructure without which commercial life would find it very difficult to carry on. Ba mhaith liom a mholadh do mhuintír An Post go mbeidh sé an-tábhachtach amach anseo go gcoiméadfadh siad an polasaí dhátheangach atá acu, go mbeadh an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla, ní ar foirmeacha difriúla ach ar an fhoirm chéanna i dtreo is go mbeidh eolas ar fáil go dátheangach. Is rud luachmhar é agus is rud faoi leith é a choinníonn An Post chun tosaigh, agus molaim é dá bharr sin.</P>

All of us, whether we come from rural areas, as I do, or urban centres, would agree with many of the sentiments expressed. I was interested, as were others, in Deputy Belton's contribution. I often wondered about his knowledge of so many matters. It is clear he got it from his mother who worked as a postmistress for many years and did much good for her local community.</P>

      <P>He asked me about Bray where there were six post offices, but now only three. I did not come armed with information about post offices in Bray, but will write to the Deputy on the matter. I know the post office on Quinsborough Road because, many years ago, I went to school in Bray for six years as a boarder. I did not realise there were once six post offices there. I know the population of Bray has expanded hugely. I do not have the information with me, but will give it to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate what I stated clearly when assuming office in 1997. There will not be any forced closures of post offices. The Government has underlined this policy in the White Paper on Rural Development published more than four years ago. This commitment is unambiguous and explicit. The White Paper clearly recognised the <Col N="676" /> important role the post office network plays in the lives of communities.</P>
    <P>However, we should not fool ourselves. There are major challenges ahead, not least the growing losses which face the network. If we sit on our hands and do nothing, post office network losses will amount to a total of &euro;100 million in two years' time. That is a huge amount of money and I did not hear anyone bring forward a proposal to subsidise An Post to the tune of that amount. Anyone who would give such a commitment in a pre-election fever or post-election euphoria would be hard-pressed to fulfil it. Those are the figures for projected losses which An Post has given. It is clear there are huge challenges.</P>
    <P>We see advertisements every night on television for the United Kingdom postal service with its fancy new name, Consignia. There will be 100,000 job losses in that service. The United Kingdom is a huge country in comparison with Ireland, but the company is losing £11 million a day or something of that order. It appears to be advancing the deregulation to which we have all subscribed. I hope the measures I outline and which the Opposition bring forward will have a fruitful outcome for An Post, but it will be a difficult matter. We need change which must be managed in a partnership approach in order that we retain the services but perform our task in a more imaginative and modern way.</P>
    <P>I took two important decisions with a view to ensuring the continuation of a viable and competitive post office network. I asked Phil Flynn to act as an independent chairperson to advance discussions between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union which represents sub-postmasters and postmistresses and to devise possible options for the sustainable development of the network. I established the interdepartmental working group to assess the options for the long-term viability of the network in the light of the Flynn report.</P>
    <P>In his report Mr. Flynn set out a wide range of options, conclusions and recommendations, not just the single recommendation set out in the motion to which I will return. These options included an increase in the remuneration of sub-postmasters, which I was glad to be able to do, the determination by Government of a financial framework to ensure the viability of the existing post office network or an agreed modified one, the progression of negotiations on the conversion of sub-post offices to an agency status, investment in the rural network as well as Government taking the necessary steps to maximise the amount of its business channelled through the network.</P>
    <P>There was no question of disregarding the recommendations of the Flynn report. If anything, it has provided the template for what has followed. It was Mr. Flynn's urging that Government increase its role in the provision of services at post offices that led to the establishment of the interdepartmental working group to see how this could be developed. Both reports are complementary. It was never a question of choosing to <Col N="677" /> adopt one report over another. The interdepartmental report published in July last year has provided the framework for the development of a viable post office network service which meets the requirements of both the customer and the operator. I am sure the Opposition is not seriously suggesting that we set about improving the range of Government services available at post offices and not involve other Departments.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental report recommended that An Post move to commence operating as much of its network on an agency basis rather than on a fixed cost basis and a commitment by the Government to the establishment of one-stop Government services agencies. The Government, in line with the Flynn recommendations, agreed to the introduction by An Post of postal agency arrangements and to increase the share capital of An Post by &euro;12.7 million on the basis that this would facilitate the implementation of the overall package of reforms, especially through payment of the increase for sub-postmasters.</P>
    <P>With the agreement of the Irish Postmasters Union, a pilot scheme for the conversion of 26 post offices to an agency basis and voluntary severance terms is being introduced by An Post. This has been worked out in agreement through the forum between An Post, the Department and the Irish Postmasters Union. The purpose of the restructuring process is to bring about a situation where the provision of postal services is perceived as an attractive business opportunity operating on a viable financial footing and meeting the needs of the community, both in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>Many of the suggestions brought forward by Deputy Jim Higgins and others are being implemented and there were many fine ideas. We are all of one mind that no Government of whatever form can give &euro;100 million over four years or accept the possibility of continuing such subsidies. We are clear we want to maintain post offices, but we cannot do so unless a viable framework is introduced to enable them to survive.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons many rural post offices to which two or three Opposition Members referred are not conducting much business is because the local population does not use them. In many cases they do, but in many cases they do not. People travel to neighbouring major towns for work or for medical, social or commercial reasons and conduct their business in those towns in many cases. As a result, local post offices languish because of a lack of business. Deputy Browne spoke about meeting the hierarchy of An Post in the GPO and being told that the extent of the business being done related to three old age pensions and four children's allowances, or something of that nature. He said it stopped them in their tracks. If people do not do business in their local post offices, the post offices will languish.</P>
    <P>All parties agree that the basis for determining postmasters' income has to be restructured if we are to avoid closures and continue to provide a comprehensive high quality service. The pay <Col N="678" /> increase for postmasters implemented in November 2001 is part of restructuring of the operators' income level. The increase in share capital by &euro;12.7 million, which is subject to approval by the EU Commission, is also expected to be cleared shortly. To oversee those developments and the implementation of the other recommendations, I established the Partnership Forum in which the Irish Postmasters Union, An Post, and all the relevant Departments participated. The work of the forum concluded last month. Under its auspices the terms of agreement for the 26 postal agencies were agreed with the IPU and services which could feasibly be transferred from Departments were identified. A progress report on the ongoing consultations, which are taking place between An Post and the Departments, including local authorities, the Garda Síochána, FÁS, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners is expected next month.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to overlook the positive side of developments in the network in the face of the undoubtedly severe financial difficulties An Post is experiencing and which were clearly anticipated in those reports. Business has grown more than 34% in An Post since it was established separately as a commercial State company. Prudent investment in automation has equipped the company to be at the forefront of the electronic payments revolution. This progress is reflected in the interest among banks and other institutions to utilise the postal network, the agreement with the banks in 2001 in regard to bill pay facilities and the company's success in winning the contract with the ESB for counter payment services. A further positive development is the joint initiative with the AIB, giving the banks customers access to their accounts through the automated network.</P>
    <P>This is just the beginning. I am confident more business will follow, specifically in relation to Government services as a result of the work under the forum and the implementation of the Flynn recommendations. Furthermore, An Post is developing enhanced financial delivery services under the Government's e-commerce initiative. Many of the business developments, which the Opposition motion calls on the Government to ensure, are either already in place or, following the report next month, will be in place. The Government has already directed that the social welfare payments contract with An Post should continue. In regard to the PostPoint outlets, there continues to be some misunderstanding as to the nature of this service. An Post won this contract in the face of stiff opposition from other competitors. The company should be applauded not criticised for this. As politicians, we cannot continue to urge the company to seek new business opportunities, on the one hand, and then criticise it when it does that. I am not saying Deputies did so, but it is criticism which is often made and one may then find it is the business for which it has competed and won which is successful.</P>
    <P>Under the PostPoint contract, An Post is to <Col N="679" /> install and operate 4,000 credit card terminals in the company's network of &lsquo;Ready to Go' agents. The implementation of this service has been under way since 2000 under a legally binding contract. Let us be clear, if An Post had not been successful in winning the contract, it would have been set up and operated by competitors. Such a service is already provided by An Post through the company's 1,000 automated post offices and this was considered crucial to its winning the contract. There is no question of supplanting or by-passing the post office network as is widely perceived.</P>
    <P>I stress that the Government recognises, as does An Post's management and unions, that the company is facing severe financial difficulties which have worsened as a result of a number of factors, including the recent downturn in the economy. However, I notice one hopeful aspect. It is being paid five times the normal cost to deliver the referendum information booklet because it was decided at a very late stage. That is a little windfall and there is no doubt the election will bring a further windfall when we will be sending out our literature.</P>
    <P>All parties recognise the urgent necessity for cost reductions and other measures to ensure the company overcomes these difficulties. The losses forecast by An Post were anticipated. It was in this context that a transformation agreement concluded with the unions was to have resulted in savings to meet the projected losses. Unfortunately, the targets required were not achieved. I accept it was disquieting to see both on television and in the newspapers that there appeared to be a complete divergence of views in the ongoing debate between management and the unions as they sought to work through this transformation agreement. It is my wish that both sides will get together. Rushing to appear on television or to the newspapers, as happened in the beginning of the debate, was not the right thing to do. I would have thought the debate should have begun between the parties. I wish what I read in <i>The Irish Times, The Irish Independent</i> and heard later on television did not happen. However, I hope they will proceed to do their business in an ordered and structured fashion.</P>
    <P>It is primarily a matter for the board of management of An Post, in negotiations with the unions, to determine how the cost savings will be made. I am confident a new agreement will be reached and that it will be in the context of the Government's commitment to the post office network and the interests of the An Post Group and its employees. I have a very firm commitment to the post office network. I am sure people from Dublin and Cork have the same commitment. However, people from rural Ireland appreciate the role and status of post offices within a community. The level of probity and very fine character of the men and women who continue as postmasters and postmistresses is extremely high. There are very few examples in post office history <Col N="680" /> of anything going wrong financially. Like parish priests or teachers within local communities, postmasters and postmistresses are regarded as people of standing and sagacity who approach business in a proper fashion. I hope that will continue to be the case. I thank Deputies who attended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McGuinness.</P>
      <P>The greatest strength and weakness of the post office network is that it is a vast network of mostly small stations located throughout the country. I am speaking from a rural perspective as someone who spends most of my time in Dublin. Given the growth of credit unions which provide a vast array of services throughout the country and the commercial development of the Trustee Savings Bank movement, there is both a challenge and an opportunity for the post office network to carve out a niche for itself. I commend the Minister for tabling the amendment. There is no doubt that the post office network and the post office division of An Post are facing enormous challenges. Any division facing losses of &euro;15.2 million in 2001 and &euro;11.8 million in 2002 is in a difficult position and this clearly needs to be addressed. I am satisfied with the engagement of the union interests and the excellent staff in the post offices. I agree with the Minister that the services provided by sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses throughout the country and cities are second to none.</P>
      <P>Clearly, a new strategy is necessary so the An Post division can be restored to profitability. That strategy, as I understand it, has been largely agreed between the stakeholders. However, it involves repositioning An Post in the community as a leading service provider, providing a range of over-the-counter financial services. For example, such services would provide for bill payment, social welfare payments, savings schemes etc. Many of those are traditional services provided by An Post, but they need to be developed.</P>
      <P>The newer developments, which include the automation of 1,000 offices, the partnership approach adopted with other financial institutions and the agreement with the Postmasters Union on the introduction of the 26 agency arrangements in the sub-post office network comprise a template for the way forward. When that basic network is in place, it will be possible for a wide variety of services to be provided using the post office network.</P>
      <P>One of the services that could be provided is one I see in the Minister's amendment, the availability of Internet access points in post offices. Many of the commercially provided Internet access points in Internet cafes etc. are extraordinarily expensive. I am not suggesting for a minute that An Post should be asked or would be able to provide cut-price Internet access. It is one of the services that would be very appropriate to An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement negotiated between An Post <Col N="681" /> and the post offices division in November 2001 to provide third party banking services on behalf of AIB through the Service Plus post office network is an excellent development. Services would include personal account lodgements and withdrawals, AIB credit card payments, business lodgement services etc. The payment of ESB bills, for example, which was achieved through successful public tendering, is an example of what An Post is able to offer. Those of us involved in local authorities will be aware that the rent payments and mortgage payments etc. for local authorities are, and have been for a long time, payable through the post office network.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent upon Departments to develop their services through the post office network. That includes services provided by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I see no reason in the world, for example, that planning fees cannot be paid through post offices. With regard to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I cannot understand why on-the-spot fines cannot be paid through post offices. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs certainly has a well developed relationship with An Post. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS have a reasonably developed relationship with An Post, but it certainly has greater potential.</P>
    <P>The working groups that have been established at interdepartmental level constitute a way forward. I do not think, for the sake of the future of An Post, that goodwill is enough. Policy decisions need to be taken. The Government's decisions regarding not having enforced closures of post offices and voluntary engagement in new technology signify the way forward. With the proposed partnership approach, sooner rather that later it will be possible for An Post to return to profitability.</P>
    <P>With regard to letter post &ndash; I do not want to hog Deputy McGuinness's time &ndash; the competition that exists with the private sector through courier services etc. needs to be considered. I see no reason the excellent swift post service operated by An Post cannot be developed into a broader service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the work she has undertaken in respect of this issue. In the very beginning, when we met representatives of the network and the union involved, both in Leinster House and in our own constituencies, we discovered they were coming from a position of considerable misinformation and perhaps uncertainty, which were fuelled by comments by the media. Having met the representatives locally, everyone in this House will agree that they constitute a dedicated group of people who are providing a service, sometimes in family-run operations, in the provision of which they contribute far beyond the call of duty. They work many long hours to fulfil their contracts or deliver services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" />Many of the representatives were concerned about their own future in terms of their employment and family commitments. In some cases, family commitment included involvement with the post office network for generations. We all know the value of the post office network, particularly to the rural communities. With the advent of information and communication technologies, if handled properly, these post offices can be given a new lease of life. We have to reposition the post office network in the marketplace, review all the services it delivers and make it profitable. We are returning a greater loss in 2002 than 2001, but there is still time and goodwill on the part of both the Government and An Post to reverse that trend.</P>
    <P>All that needs to be done to improve the lot of the post offices is look at the type of services that are currently being delivered by local government, for example, and look at the number of State agencies that are currently opening outreach centres for all sorts of services. Payment of bills, interaction with the South Eastern Health Board, completion of forms of one kind or other etc. could be done through technology by way of the local post office. Where one is remote and can gain the access one needs to a central location or database, surely that is technology working for the community.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity to develop these services in the post office network and the will exists on both sides to do it. Investment by the Government of &euro;12.7 million indicates that it is not just willing to speak about the issue, but to address it by way of the forum between the different Departments. It is willing to invest money. That one can pay utility bills and ESB bills in post offices proves that post offices can be used for many functions beyond the traditional ones that we have seen up to now. It has been proven that one can access the various services in respect of social welfare and pay one's bills and that the post office is the centre of any community.</P>
    <P>There is a very important connection between Irish life and post offices. The customer base has confidence in local post offices and supports them. We should exploit that confidence and restore a greater confidence to customers by showing that these services can be delivered and that we have a plan to expand and develop every post office. Again, I would review the matter in terms of local authorities and find out from health boards how we can best manage the delivery of their services by way of form completion and payment of bills through the post office network.</P>
    <P>One issue in respect of our approach to the post office network concerns post office closures and post offices going out of business when someone decides, for whatever reason, not to continue the service. In an approach to An Post after such a situation there seems to be a very firm closure of the door. In County Kilkenny Clara post office was closed down and Dunbell post office closed down soon afterwards. A suitable applicant was available to reopen Clara post office, but he was <Col N="683" /> not given the opportunity to make a case for replacing the post office in a community which was willing to support it. This is wrong. I ask the Minister to insist that An Post review every application of this kind.</P>

I compliment Fine Gael, Deputy Jim Higgins in particular, for selecting the sub-post office network as the subject for the Private Members' motion to be debated over the next two nights.</P>
      <P>Mr. John Hynes, the chief executive of An Post, has signalled what he considers the need to reduce the costs of An Post by &euro;70 million over the next three years. The company also wants to shed 1,140 jobs by 2004, through redundancy and redeployment. By the end of 2002 An Post is predicting &euro;37 million in overall losses. The forecast losses for 2001 are &euro;7 million. Over the next three years &euro;125 million is expected to be spent by way of capital expenditure on modernisation. The expected loss this year is some &euro;15 million which the company is blaming on the rural post office network. An Post's cash reserves of &euro;200 million are expected to be exhausted by 2004.</P>
      <P>According to Mr. Hynes, there are three main factors giving rise to the present difficulties of An Post. He firsts cites the delays in securing letter tariff increases &ndash; jargon for stamps &ndash; from the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The director, however, has defended her performance and that of her office in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month the director issued a consultation paper on the application by An Post to increase the price of reserved postal services. This brings me to the issue of universal delivery, an issue on which we should focus in this debate. Reserved post, that is, the post with which An Post deals and on which there can be no competition, will be reduced by 1 January 2006 to mail of 500 grammes or less or 2.5 times the basic tariff. On the one hand, we have major concerns in relation to the survival of the sub-post office network, but, on the other, there is a grave concern that predatory postal companies from outside Ireland might cherrypick the postal business and make it unviable for An Post to provide a next morning delivery throughout the country. This concern should be addressed and vigorously pursued at European level by the Minister. The postal market is gradually being liberalised. There will be a change on 1 January 2003 and a further change on 1 January 2006. The market is not standing still. The effect of liberalisation on the rural and more isolated areas of the country is a cause for great concern. An Post has applied for approval to the ODTR for an interim increase in the postal charge, pending more detailed work. This <Col N="684" /> includes an increase in the price of the domestic postage stamp from 38 to 41 cent.</P>
    <P>Second, Mr. Hynes has expressed concerns regarding the failure to achieve cost savings of &euro;9 million each year in relation to the ESOP agreement and the programme of savings in An Post. However, the Communications Workers Union, which represents the vast majority of the staff of An Post, has stated there is no agreement between it and the company on reducing staff numbers by 1,140. The general secretary of the CWU has stated that what makes An Post's position even more difficult to understand is that the company has presented the union with written proposals to recruit in excess of 500 people.</P>
    <P>The third main factor cited by Mr. Hynes regarding the present financial difficulties is the ongoing losses in the operation of the post office network. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has stated the sub-post office network lost £4 million in 2001, is expected to lose &euro;15 million or £12 million in 2002 and, on present trends, will have lost £100 million by 2004.</P>
    <P>Recently the Irish Postmasters Union, notwithstanding the absence of proper reward for its members, has accepted the requirement to be sensitive to the wishes of local communities and with the two other parties involved, the Government and An Post, agreed to a trial involving 26 offices, on a purely voluntary basis, in which post office business will be transferred to an agency concept. The IPU has agreed that if the agency approach proves to be successful in the coming months, further discussions will take place between it and An Post to agree its extension to other post offices. However &ndash; this is one of the matters which concern me &ndash; the 26 sub-post offices have not yet been identified and the IPU sees this trial as a very limited experiment.</P>
    <P>The Minister laid great emphasis on this new model. She has repeatedly stated there will be no forced closures of post offices. This commitment is fine in so far as it goes. However, sub-post offices are closing and not reopening. This natural wastage approach will continue unless meaningful interventions are made to provide a decent standard of living for sub-postmasters, subpostmistresses and sub-post office staff.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group recommends a Government commitment to a safety net of a guaranteed continued Government service presence in communities in the minority of cases where a post office service would not continue under the proposed arrangements. This is seen as an important part of the proposed overall solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the group which is looking at what services can be transferred to the post offices is to report next month.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the 26 post offices have been selected for what the IPU, the Irish Postmasters Union, sees as a limited experiment, the other issues seem to pale into insignificance. If the pilot scheme does not take place, we will not <Col N="685" /> have a considered view quickly as to its effectiveness and appropriateness. I have given the figures for the projected losses for An Post and there is a great need to address the difficulties in An Post sooner rather than later. I ask the Minister to ensure that the 26 post offices that are due to take part in the pilot scheme are selected at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I propose to examine in detail the motion proposed by Fine Gael. The motion starts by recognising the important contribution, both commercially and in terms of community life, the sub-post office network has made and continues to make in rural and, indeed, urban communities. The first proposal in the motion, which is an attractive proposal, is the operation of a current account system in post offices on a model similar to that of the banks. This is described as the universal account. It can facilitate cashless payrolls. In other words, salaries, social welfare payments and so forth could be made electronically and directly into accounts. Obviously, this type of streamlining could be of great assistance to people in rural areas. I would welcome this development. I understand An Post is actively pursuing this matter and I hope it will come to fruition.</P>
    <P>The second proposal is the provision of ATM facilities at each sub-post office. Obviously, that would be an important facility for the public. However, I have reservations with regard to how effective it would be as a cash stream for post offices. It would have to be costed and examined in the context of its effectiveness and general viability. The Irish Postmasters Union is seeking new activities that will generate income and ensure a decent standard of living for those who operate the sub-post office network.</P>
    <P>The retention of the payment of social welfare entitlements at sub-post offices is important. In fairness, no Government would wish to remove that activity from the sub-post offices. However, there are aspects to this which could, in time, prove to be beyond the power of the Oireachtas. One is the issue of open competition within the European Union and this particular contract has already been the subject of attention in that context. The proposal regarding the renewal of driving licences and motor taxation is also attractive. My home town of Tramore is over 30 miles from Dungarvan and for a number of years I sought to have a motor taxation office located in Tramore. The greatest logistical difficulty related to files. If the renewal of driving licences and payment of motor taxation were operated through a service similar to the passport express service that is currently operated by An Post, it would be a viable approach. It would generate income for postal services and, at the same time, provide an additional service for the people of the locality.</P>
    <P>The development of e-commerce facilities would be attractive. Indeed, the party spokespersons were happy to facilitate the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, in the speedy passage of the e-commerce Bill. However, the roll-out of e-commerce nationally is slower than I anticipated. In <Col N="686" /> regard to this proposal, which would be a welcome addition to the sub-post office services, a working group should be set up to examine how this additional facility could be applied to post offices in a viable way to generate a worthwhile income while providing a useful service for the public. The concept of a low interest loan scheme, repayable over ten years, for the modernisation and upgrading of sub-post office premises has much merit. However, I spoke to a postmaster about it this afternoon but he was more inclined towards the idea of grants than loans. Nevertheless, I agree with the principle although I am not sure to what extent An Post would be free to make grants available. There might be particular cases where grants would be appropriate while in other cases loans would be the best option.</P>
    <P>The motion proposes a retraining programme. There is always a need for retraining in areas of economic activity, particularly in areas such as those proposed in the motion, such as the development of e-commerce facilities, where an amount of retraining would be required. Retraining is a good thing, not alone in terms of the particular skills that are required, but also because involvement in courses can broaden people's perspective and make them more effective as business people and more efficient in their jobs.</P>
    <P>With regard to an agreed redundancy package for people who are unable to continue operating, the Minister referred to that and indicated that voluntary severance terms had been offered, although I do not think they are agreed. PostPoint is an issue which gives rise to reservations among postmasters and postmistresses. While PostPoint currently operates to top up mobile phone cards for 086 and 087 numbers, the concern is that it is adaptable, as the Minister has indicated, for other services. The postmasters would be extremely concerned that where there is a small amount of business, for example, in the case of the social welfare contract, that business could be offered to outlets such as garages, shops or supermarkets. They want to ring-fence that business. When one considers the economics of the issue we are discussing tonight and the level of income, they have a valid point in that regard. I have no problem with PostPoint being used for topping up mobile phone cards, but if social welfare payments were made through additional outlets, it would have a detrimental effect on the income of sub-post offices and could well defeat the purpose of the debate. At the end of the day, there have not been compulsory closures of post offices but a few have closed and have not reopened while many others are barely surviving.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Keaveney. I stated before Private Members' Business that Fianna Fáil has delivered on its commitments on social inclusion across a range of Departments. I refer in particular to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the work of former Minister of State, Deputy Flood, and his successor, Deputy Eoin Ryan, in the promotion of drugs task forces. I also refer to the work of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and, in particular, the many imaginative initiatives brought forward by the Minister in regard to the social welfare system generally.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare became the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in 1997. The name change reflected the Department's new role in tackling social exclusion in our society. Improvements have been made for the first time in the areas of child poverty, child care, carers, widows and old age pensioners. In addition, the lot of married women working in the home became a priority and new measures are being put in place to improve their position.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group on administrative individualisation under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been published and the Minister is studying it. This is the first step in achieving the goal of full individualisation of social welfare payments. Qualified adult allowances have been increased substantially since 1997 and the payment of QAA directly to an adult is essentially what is involved in this regard. In the long-term this split in payment should be mandatory and on a 50-50 basis from an equality point of view. This should take a few years to implement so that the change will be fully appreciated and understood by all claimants.</P>
      <P>The provision of affordable child care has been a major priority for the Government. This has been tackled through the equal opportunities child care programme of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by giving unprecedented and substantial increases in child benefit. The approach of increasing child benefit was correct. Increases in child benefit help to tackle child poverty directly and to alleviate the cost of child care, which is expensive. Tax relief on child care expenses, which was advocated in the past, was not the way to go given that it would be seen to be divisive as it would discriminate against the woman working in the home. The Minister has adopted the correct approach on child care and I welcome his commitment to maintain this approach and to continue child benefit increases if, and when, we are returned to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide range of improvements to the carer's allowance scheme has been introduced since 1997 and, in addition, the child benefit scheme was <Col N="688" /> introduced in October 2000. Much of the debate on the future development of the carer's allowance scheme relates to the means test and there are some who advocate its abolition. However, I do not recommend that the Minister should pursue this course of action as such a move would not lead to a targeting of resources at those most in need, a view which he also shares. Increases in income disregards for qualification purposes, therefore, are the way to proceed and I welcome the improvements made in that regard in recent years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil made a commitment on the rate of payment of the old age pension and this has been more than honoured. Many improvements have been made in the schemes that cater for the elderly and they have been welcomed generally. I also pay tribute to the Minister for Health and Children for making medical cards automatically available to the over 70s. These measures have made a real difference to the elderly and they have generally been appreciated. Similarly, the position of widows has much improved over the lifetime of the Government. I particularly welcome the new measures announced in budget 2002 which will benefit widows.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the use of personal public service numbers and the introduction of the new concept of a public service identity. I welcome the rationale behind the introduction of the section in that it will lead to increased efficiencies for the users of public services generally. However, the concept of the PPS number has not struck home among the public as people continue to use the term &ldquo;RSI Number&rdquo;. Perhaps more promotion is required to inform the public that this change has been made, the reasons for it and the advances which are proposed in this section.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move by the Minister to bring forward child benefit increases to January and April. The one thing that annoyed people was that benefits announced in the budget were not granted until July or sometimes September. The Minister has done a good day's work. I ask him to proceed in the same way as he has on all the major policy initiatives. He has been an imaginative Minister. I congratulate him on his success to date and wish him continued success in the reform of the social welfare system in the future.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is here this evening to take the praise that should justly be heaped on him for having done so much in his term of office as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. We have reached the sixth Social Welfare Bill and people laughed here when we talked about the first of five. A package of &euro;850 million is to be implemented as a result of budget 2002. The previous Bill dealt with increases in social welfare payments that came into effect in January and PRSI changes which will have effect from March. I have been at a number of old age parties, Christmas parties and all sorts of gatherings where the Minister's name and the virtue of what he has done were extolled. <Col N="689" /> People appreciate that they are much better off than ever before.</P>
      <P>Earlier I heard the Opposition parties talking about the Minister appearing in advertisements. Jealousy is a terrible thing. They will have more to be jealous about as this Bill goes through. The Opposition has been great at misleading people not just about the implications of this Bill but also about other Bills. One such shameful and scandalous claim resulted in people coming to my door and to other people's doors worried that they would lose their medical cards because they were getting an increase in their social welfare. I am glad to reaffirm the assurances given by the Minister that social welfare increases will not lead to people losing their medical cards. The Minister said his Department advised health board chief executive officers that medical card holders would not lose their cards on account of the budget.</P>
      <P>It is very poor form for anybody to mislead the poorest in society into feeling they will be done out of the record increases in social welfare payments, just because the Government recognised their need for more. Increases in child benefit, improvements for carers and many other facets of the Bill are very important and will lead to jealous glances from the Opposition benches. My first year here was in opposition and I remember the £1 per month that was given in child benefit. At that time it would not buy a Mars bar and at this stage it definitely would not do so.</P>

      <P>Unemployment is continuing to reduce. The unemployment figure for my local employment exchange in Buncrana in 1994 was 2,237, in 1995 it was 2,283 and in November 1996 it had risen to 2,407. Despite many serious setbacks, I am glad that the unemployment level, which peaked in December 1997 at 2,424, had reduced to 1,862 by December 2001. Unemployment in Letterkenny dropped from 3,073 in December 1997 to 2,387 in December 2001. The reduction nationally has been replicated in my constituency. I agree with the Minister that despite the number of people who have left the live register there is an increased spend on social welfare payments from £4.5 billion in 1997 to £7.4 billion. This represents a 66% increase for the most needy in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the substantial increases in child benefit rates. The trebling of the amount paid in 1997 has had a huge implication for those in receipt of it. I welcome the substantial increases in old age contributory pensions. They are now £116 per week compared to £78 in 1997. I welcome the fact that 19,500 people qualify for carer's payments compared to 9,000 when we came to office. It is an extremely important area that has been very well addressed by the Minister. We take it for granted that there is a respite grant, which was increased to £500, or &euro;635, this year. <Col N="690" /> Many people do not realise what life was like without it. I again commend the Minister on this initiative. The respite grant for carers was urgently needed and long awaited. I welcome the introduction of the new family services to protect the family and support the stability of family life.</P>
    <P>Payment of child benefit is the most efficient and effective way to get money directly to help children. While we can talk about the £1.14 billion in 2002, the increases of £25.05 for the first two children and £39.01 for the third child and subsequent children brings it home clearly to people. From April, a family with three children will get £301.24 instead of £221 at present. That has big implications for the income coming into a household. This payment is being made a number of months earlier than it was when Fine Gael and Labour were in power. The £1 increase I mentioned earlier was announced in December 1996 but was not paid until September 1997. At that stage the Mars bar would have increased in price.</P>

      <P>The entitlement to child dependant increases payable with short-term social welfare payments such as disability benefit and unemployment benefit is a good initiative. The increase in the age limit from 18 to 22 for child dependant benefit moves towards what was promised in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I look forward to the Minister returning to his portfolio after May so that he can continue with these very worthwhile endeavours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem that some people do not qualify for carer's allowance. There is an argument to drop the means test, but if this is done, those who are well off will not spend the time caring for others but will employ someone. However, I can see the need for focused payments. Increases have been given to 2,300 carers and 3,400 extra carers will now qualify for payment. We should try to bring in as many more carers as possible. We have already seen an increase from 9,000 to 19,500, which is a fair improvement in a short time.</P>
      <P>As regards the health strategy, I am pleased the Minister wants to maximise the support for home care. Cross-departmental work and co-ordinated action plans are very important in meeting the needs of older people and the disabled. I welcome the rural transport initiative, but it has a long way to go before it is rolled out in my constituency. I look forward to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, expanding the number of projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see Buncrana get an ambulance to support the NoWDOC. I commend the Minister for the amount of money he is making available to the volunteers who want to help. I hope he continues to listen and react to the tremendous <Col N="691" /> work they are doing. We need an integrated approach to improve services for all these people.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for me to cover everything in this Bill in ten minutes. The Minister is making important changes to the pre-retirement allowance. I welcome section 11 which exempts retirement savings accounts from PRSI. Although the Minister is modernising the public service to make it more relevant to the citizen, there is a long way to go. Perhaps there should be a link with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of the national identification card and the ability to prove one's age when buying drink and cigarettes. Perhaps the Minister will comment on this. It would be great to reduce the bureaucracy and eliminate red tape.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 15. As regards the civil registration service, the Minister is planning to computerise the system of registering life events. It might be vital for us in the House because the electoral registers are badly askew. Anything which improves the collation and availability of information is to be welcomed. I commend the Minister on the work he is doing and look forward to him being Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for a further five years.</P>

      <P>The Minister said tonight that in the &ldquo;past two budgets alone child benefit increased by £50 overall, 118% for each of the first two children and by £60 overall, 107% for the third and all subsequent children.&rdquo; I thought we got rid of the pound and were dealing in euros. Surely there is sufficient flair in the Department to talk about the euro. Why is the Minister always thinking about the past? He was talking about 1997 and the pound. He also said that if &ldquo;returned to office, we will continue to give record increases in child benefit.&rdquo;  Have we heard that before? I am surprised the Minister said it. He should apologise to the House for including it in his speech. He should have done what he was going to do after five years in office.</P>

He will tell the public to relax and think back and forward. What will it be like in a year's time? Where will the money be to pay for the promises? What about the £3 billion of a Government deficit?

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be in opposition at that stage and will not worry about it at all. That is the fun part of it. The unfortunate Joe or Sheila citizen will have a rude awakening when the psychiatrist snaps his or her fingers and says it is time to wake up to reality. The end will have come and it will be payback time. I will give the Minister ten out of ten for promotion and advancing his own cause. There is a phrase in the legal profession about being a judge in one's own court with which the Minister is familiar. I hope it stays fine for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he is proud to say that during the Government's period in office unemployment has been reduced to one of the lowest levels in <Col N="694" /> the European Union. However, he fails to recognise that when he came to office in 1997 unemployment was falling at a rate unknown in the history of the country and envied by everyone in the European Union. He also refers to spending in pounds. I cannot understand the reason he keeps referring to pounds as I thought we had changed over to the euro.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The psychiatrist might be able to tell us the reason the Minister is preoccupied with the past. Why does he continually refer to 1997? Why not go back to 1992 and the famous Social Welfare Act of that year? I am not surprised he does not refer to that Act because it involved what became known as the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts. I am amazed the Minister has not once stated that the Government has addressed the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;. He has not stated, nor has encouraged any of his colleagues to state, that they have been buried. Why? Is there some underlying reason about which we are not aware? I believe it is because he is looking forward. The Minister is no fool and knows full well that whoever holds his office next year will receive one hell of a rude awakening.</P>
      <P>When the psychiatrist to whom I referred earlier arrives on the scene, he or she should have in his or her possession the correct medication to ensure that the awakening of the Minister's predecessor is neither too rude nor too sudden. If it is too rude or too sudden, the first person on whom his eyes will unfortunately fall when he wakes will surely be his tormentor. He is bound at that stage to launch an attack on the Minister who will, by then, be on the opposite side of the House and who will claim that he has no responsibility.</P>
      <P>For the job he has done and the panache with which he did it &ndash; he has not shown even a twinge of embarrassment &ndash; I would give the Minister ten out of ten for basking in his own reflected glory. I compliment him for being able to do so. That is about as far as I can go in terms of offering compliments. I hate to be critical or negative at a time like this because I know the Minister feels otherwise. I am aware that, recalling the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;, he does not want anybody to contemplate what might happen in the event that he is returned to Government. If that happens, he will be required to tell the people what he intends to do. What about the aspects of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; that were not extracted in the past five years? Will they be trotted out again or are they still being trotted out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one tables a question to the Minister and chides him on the harshness of policy under his direction in the Department, he says &ldquo;I have no responsibility in this matter. This is a matter for a deciding officer in my Department.&rdquo; This is the first occasion on which I have come across a Minister who is not prepared to accept his full responsibility and stand over the actions of his Department. The Minister likes to off-load his <Col N="695" /> responsibility on to some unfortunate civil servant who is then obliged to carry the can. The Minister says &ldquo;I have no responsibility in this matter. I cannot intervene.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

I am concerned about the way Ministers state that they have no official responsibility to the House or that they have no responsibility in a matter because it is dealt with by someone superior to them. Either Deputy Ahern is Minister or he is not. It is high time he accepted everything that goes with his office &ndash; the brickbats as well as the glory. It is fine that the Minister basks in the reflected glory he receives by appearing in newspapers, etc. He is, however, keeping actors out of work as a result, which is not fair.</P>

I am sorry to see the Minister is leaving. I hate to waste my sweet words on his colleagues, no disrespect to them, and I plead with him to remain for a few moments more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the harsh realities have suddenly and glaringly appeared in front of the Minister and that they have had a serious impact. However, I will return to the subject of social inclusion.</P>
      <P>In my time in public life I have not seen more social exclusion than at present. A great deal has been made about carer's allowance and the number of additional carers the Minister claims to have brought into the system. In reality, unless the Minister was a complete Thatcherite he could not but bring more people into the system because it is geared towards ensuring that more people are included as time passes. He stated that the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance has more than doubled from 9,700 to more than 19,000 and that expenditure has been increased by 180%. The Minister is very good at quoting percentages when it suits him to do so. There are approximately 100,000 carers which is an indication of how far the Minister still has to go. If he wants to go towards including these people, now is the time to do so. We are, after all, on the run-in to an election and surely he is in a position to inform the general public that he will show he has the courage of his convictions by dramatically increasing the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance. Why not take a first step by increasing the number on the scheme to 50,000 or 60,000 and thereby recognise the people, most of whom work without recompense, who are making a major contribution to society by caring for their relatives and friends? If these people do not provide such care the State will be obliged to do so.</P>
      <P>The people to whom I refer are relieving the State of its responsibilities and, to date, they have received no recognition from the Minister. If the Minister wants to continue to bask in his own reflected glory, he should take a leaf from his own book and bravely inform carers that he will change the system, increase the number of people in receipt of the allowance dramatically and give to those who have cared for people with disabilities, etc., the kind of recognition they deserve. He should not again refer to 1997, 1977, 1992 or any other year in the last century. He should be brave, break new ground and do his job as it should have been done in the past. However, the Minister will not do this. He will not appear on television or take out a newspaper advertisement to announce an expansion of the carer's allowance scheme. He will not deprive the actors of their slice of the action in respect of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will not say anything about this matter because he is fully aware that by the end of the year people in his Department and in other Departments will have to face the music. They will be obliged to ask &ldquo;From where are we going to get the money we were promised?&rdquo; Will a deciding officer be blamed for the lack of money? Will an unfortunate deciding officer be obliged to <Col N="697" /> come forward and accept responsibility? I hope not, because that would be the original cop-out. However, such behaviour is neither unusual nor unknown.</P>
    <P>It used to be the case that, on leaving office, a Government could look back and state that it had improved on its past performance in office. It could also state that it had done as much as possible and that no one could better its performance. That is not happening now. On reaching the end of its five years in office, the Government has committed to unveiling a ten year plan. I hope there will be no five or ten year plan attaching to the to the anti-poverty strategy which is supposed to be unveiled shortly. That is telling the public now, in advance, what they should have heard five years ago but did not hear and have not yet achieved. It is unique, it is excellent, it is definitely fancy footwork and no spin doctor could complain about how it works.</P>

Much as I enjoy what I am doing, I have not even remotely described the full extent of the damage due to the regrettable con job on the unfortunate people of this country by the Minister, knowingly, blatantly, with his eyes wide open, and we have not seen the last of this. In 1997, what was known as disabled person's maintenance allowance became disability allowance and unfortunate people have been visited, on the Minister's instructions, in pursuance of departmental policy. There is no point in blaming deciding officers or anybody else. The people concerned have discovered how the new strategy operates &ndash; it works against them. It would take much longer to address all the misinformation contained in the Minister of State's speech but, unfortunately, I do not have that luxury. I congratulate the beneficiaries of the Government's largesse in the current year and I hope they will not pay the price for that next year.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and I hope he will be back here again to discuss the details of the Bill on another occasion. In terms of scaremongering, the impression was created by Members on the Opposition side to the effect that all and sundry would be deprived of medical cards following the very substantial increases given in the Social Welfare Bill. That has been cleared up by the Minister for Health and Children and, of course, it was not going to happen. It was a low tactic, for the Opposition's own political purposes, to strike fear into vulnerable people who are most likely to be hurt most by such suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A social welfare system should have clear underlying principles, including adequacy, redistribution, comprehensiveness, consistency and simplicity. Over the past 20 years since I came into this House, I have seen great change in the Department responsible for social welfare whereby those principles have been followed to a much greater extent than before. That was due to improvements in the economy and, in fairness, the work of all Governments over the past ten years in particular. Adequate funding is now available to provide reasonable and decent social welfare benefits across the board. While the money is available, it depends on the will of Government to use it properly. Over the past five years the Government has utilised the available funding to improve the lot of those who are not in a position to provide for themselves. All benefits have been increased substantially during that period, especially for widows, widowers and old age pensioners. All those in receipt of those benefits have acknowledged the substantial increases and the results will be seen after the next election. It is not for election purposes that increases should be given, but rather because people need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Entirely coincidental, of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has delivered, year on year, and I am sure Deputy McGrath would acknowledge that in his better moments, but just now I am not surprised at cynicism from across the floor. This Bill brings into operation certain elements of the budget announced before Christmas, including the increases in child benefit, the respite care grant, the widowed parent grant, disability benefit and so on, which I will deal with later. I agree with the Minister's statement this morning that during the Government's term of office it has more than fulfilled its commitments on social inclusion in the programme for Government. Over those five years, unemployment has been reduced to one of the lowest levels in the EU, with almost 100,000 people taken off the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite that, there has been a massive increase in social welfare spending, from £4.5 billion to <Col N="699" /> £7.4 billion this year, an increase of over two thirds during that five year period. Since the number of recipients has decreased, the share of the cake has increased for those now in receipt of benefits. Child benefit rates have trebled over those years and there have been substantial real increases in social welfare pensions, with old age contributory pensioners now receiving £116 per week. That is greater than what we promised five years ago. There has been significant improvement for carers so that 19,500 people now receive carer's payments, compared to 9,000 in 1997. New family services have been introduced to protect the family and support the stability of family life.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the successes of the Government. There are many other areas in which the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has demonstrated his expertise and care. An additional £500,000 has been allocated to family support services in this year's budget. Family resource centres are giving tremendous service in many villages and towns throughout the country, particularly for the benefit of children. In my area, the resource centre provides a study period, cookery lessons and family budgeting courses. Those services are operated by local community organisations, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in my village, providing services which were unheard of ten years ago for families in local housing estates. That has improved their quality of life and has given children a good environment in which to study. We also have the voluntary and community services money advice and budgeting service and Comhairle which operate under the aegis of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. These services are as important to the development of our communities and improving the welfare and quality of life of our citizens as any other elements of the social welfare budget.</P>
    <P>In relation to child benefit, the Government has decided to significantly increase the benefit which goes directly to the family. It is non-means-tested and in many cases goes to the mother of the household and is used by her, in the majority of cases, for the benefit of her children. Many argue that benefits should be given through the taxation system, but that would not help thousands of people. We have reduced the number paying tax by about 300,000 with the result that there are now something like 600,000 not paying income tax. If benefits were given through the taxation system, that number of people would lose out. In this instance we have a system that reaches everybody. In the budget we increased the monthly rate for the first two children by £25 and for the third and subsequent children by £30.</P>

      <P>From April next, a family with three children will receive £301.24 compared with £221 at present, a substantial increase which fulfils the commitment the Government gave in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to move towards a figure of £100 for the third and subsequent children. This payment will be introduced in the first week of May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the doubters that, when we go back to the previous Administration, payments were made in the month of September. The Government brought the payment date back to the month of June and is now bringing it back further to the month of April, a five month improvement. The rainbow Government gave increases of £1 for the first two children and £5 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the decision by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs that if a child is in full-time education on reaching his or her eighteenth birthday, the increase will continue until the following 30 June. Not having a cut-off point in the middle of the school year is an issue about which we have spoken many times. This is a step in the direction of implementing the commitment of the Government to increasing the age limit to 22 years, something I am sure we will be here to do.</P>
      <P>The Government has always had a special concern for carers. Deputy Woods was the first Minister to introduce a carer's allowance scheme, which has been improved during the years. In the last five budgets the number of carers receiving carer's allowance and carer's benefit has doubled. The amount spent has increased by 180%. Any fair-minded commentator would say that this is a substantial improvement and substantial expenditure in a short space of time. In the Bill the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is honouring his commitment to support the valuable work undertaken by carers. We are all aware of the tremendous service to the community and the country that they are giving in caring for their sick or elderly parents, brothers or sisters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to see more being given to this scheme. The aim is to ensure all carers whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate, the direction in which we are moving. In the Bill the Minister has increased the disregard to &euro;382 per week, which will increase the payment to 2,300 carers and bring in an additional 3,400 carers who will qualify for payment. This measure will be implemented by him by way of regulation. In years to come I hope a means test will be unnecessary, but we have to be realistic. Nobody would thank us if multi-millionaires also qualified for carer's allowance as it would mean there <Col N="701" /> would be less to go to those who really deserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a means test, but we must also move to a realistic level.</P>
      <P>The Minister has again looked after carers in the grant given for respite care which is being increased to £500 this year from a figure of £400 last year. Where a person is looking after two patients, the figure goes up to £1,000 with effect from June 2002. The grant was very small two or three years ago and has seen substantial increases beginning at £200. There is a need for an integrated approach in caring for people with disabilities and illnesses through the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science which must come together to work in line rather than pull against one another.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I have experience of trawling through Departments trying to find out which one deals with a certain matter &ndash; running from pillar to post. Streamlining has increased and there has been more co-ordination between Departments and better relationships between them. I hope we will continue to move in that direction.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is also welcome as it provides for the linking of disability benefit claims of five years duration or more for up to 13 weeks in relation to periods of incapacity for work. The section will assist those who return to work after a period of illness and become aware after a few weeks they cannot continue working and have to reclaim disability benefit. We are aware there was always a question of requalifying and satisfying the conditions.</P>
      <P>There was much bother involved, as people had to be means tested and stay on employment assistance in the meantime. I am glad the Minister has changed this as it was plain to see there were just and deserving cases for disability benefit but because of the system they were not getting it. I welcome the progress on that front.</P>
      <P>I also welcome Section 6 where any two periods of retirement not separated by more than 52 weeks shall be treated as one continuous period of retirement. This is a sensible decision by the Minister. The changes the Minister has made over the past five years, and especially over the past year, have shown him to be a caring Minister who understands the problems of society and the needs of people. He will be remembered as a caring, honourable Minister who did his best for the people he was there to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up the theme on which my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern finished &ndash; for what will the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern be remembered. He will be remembered as the Minister who spent hundreds of thousands of pounds promoting his name <Col N="702" /> around the country. &ldquo;This is a message from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, TD,&rdquo; was heard 1,100 times on the airwaves. His photograph appeared on television as messages went out. He appeared in colour photographs in all the national newspapers. All of this was at taxpayers' expense. The Minister will be remembered as the person who promoted himself and used taxpayers' money to do this around the country. It is the first time I can remember a Minister embarking on such an individual campaign as that. What he did was shameful. It is also worth noting that he did it in an election year. He did it for his own gain and for the Fianna Fáil Party. That is one of the major things for which he will be remembered.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a very clever person who tries to pull fast tricks on people. His self-promotion was one of them, but the second one was the lump sum payment of arrears and forward money by the Department on Saint Valentine's Day, 14 February. This turned out to be very disappointing from his point of view. Not one of the people I spoke to around the country and especially in Westmeath, mentioned the payment to me. It came and went without registering at all. It did not have the desired effect. It may have been an each-way bet in case of an early election to have doled out some money.</P>
      <P>It is the first time in the history of social welfare that advance payments have been made. I have not heard of it happening before. This love bomb from the Minister came on Saint Valentine's Day.</P>

He could not make a speech without saying &ldquo;And this is what I have done and compare this to what happened in the rainbow coalition.

      <P>This is his mantra time after time. We hear the same old story being trotted out again and again. Unfortunately, the Minister did not have the vision some people attribute to him and in his time in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, he failed to address many of the anomalies that are there. I can see the officials smiling as they have heard me say all this before. I will keep saying it and I hope I will be in a position one day to put it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" />Like the Acting Chairman, I have more than two children in my family. I have four children thanks be to God. Is it not amazing that for families that are getting child benefit there is one rate of payment for the first and second child and a different one for subsequent children? Why should first and second children be discriminated against? This ridiculous situation also pertains to twins. Which is the second child for that rate of payment and which is the third child? Why can there not be one payment across the board for all children? Let us treat all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's crusade for individualisation of the tax codes not followed through into the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs? Why are people not treated equally there? Why are adult dependants not treated the same as the major recipient? We will purify ourselves, but not just yet. We will do it on the tax side but not on the welfare side. Likewise with child benefit, where one rate is given for first and second children and a different rate of payment for the others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath must be finding it very difficult to put his argument together tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty at all. I am glad to have the opportunity and as a Member of the House I am entitled to make my point.</P>
      <P>The Acting Chairman, as a busy constituency Deputy like me, has come across many of the same type of cases as I have. Let us look at the child dependant allowances that are payable with social welfare payments. If the major recipient is on unemployment assistance or benefit then his child is entitled to a payment of £13.20 per week &ndash; unfortunately I am in the old money. If the major recipient is on invalidity pension or widow's pension there is a different rate of payment. So too for those on lone parent allowance. There are three different rates of payment for the child dependants of those on social welfare; £13.20, £15.20 and £17.00. I have asked the Minister several times to put that right.</P>
      <P>Why should one child get one rate of payment and another child get a different rate of payment when we are supposed to treat all the children of the nation equally. The problem is that there is only a very small number on the £17 rate and a slightly bigger number on £15.20 rate, but the bulk of the children are getting child dependant allowances of £13.20. This Minister, being the cute man he is, would not want to reduce the payments to anybody so he would have to bring them all up to £17 and that is his problem. He does not have the commitment to do that and sort out that anomaly that still exists after his five years in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other anomalies I am sure other Deputies have come across as well. Family <Col N="704" /> income supplement, FIS, is an excellent scheme that helps out families on low incomes who otherwise may well decide that it is not worth their while to work as they may be better off on welfare. The FIS system is a great boost to those people, but let us take the example of two families living next door to each other. The earner in one house makes £12,000 a year working in a shop. He is a PAYE worker with three children. His neighbour owns the village post office and also earns £12,000. The family of the PAYE worker will get a family income supplement from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, but the family of his self-employed neighbour will not. Upon probing further to find out why this is so, one discovers that the Department does not believe that the self-employed are truthful about their incomes. It believes the second household has more money than they declare. Yet the Revenue Commissioners accept that the income details submitted by the family are in order. The Department and the Minister have simply decided not to pay family income supplement to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The same problem exists in relation to farm assist, and I am sure the Minister, being from a rural constituency, has experience of that. On applying for farm assist a farmer is visited by someone from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who wants to know how much livestock he has, how many acres he owns and what subsidies he has been given. The farmer offers to save the official a lot of time as his accounts have been completed by an accountant and the figures have been sanctioned by the Revenue Commissioners, but he is told that those accounts are not allowable. The official has to compile the information in accordance with the Department's own procedures. The Department makes its own computation of the farmer's income. It is unfair that things should be done that way. It is something the Minister could have done something about during his term of office, but he chose not to.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly exists, this time for young people setting out in life. Our benefits system contains very good dental provisions which work very well. However, there is an anomaly whereby the number of stamps required to avail of dental services increases dramatically once one is over 25 years of age. Those who have been working since the age of 19 or 20 will have managed to accumulate the stamps without any problem, but it will have been impossible for those who have been to college. There is no system of credit for the time spent at third level and even though a person has paid into the scheme for two or three years, he or she will not receive dental benefits. That is not fair and it should be sorted out. If the crusading Minister had lived up to his promise, he would have addressed that problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Ahern made a scathing comment about people pointing out that social welfare recipients might lose their medical cards. I must confess that I was one of those who pointed <Col N="705" /> out what had gone wrong. There have been fine social welfare increases, but another arm of Government had no contact with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in calculating the new income limits for medical cards and the guidelines they published described rates which were below some social welfare payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, the Minister came to the rescue and increased the limits, which was the right thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Had we not been alert and had we not raised the matter, it could have caused consternation for many. I am glad we were sharp enough to see the problem and to put it right.</P>
      <P>I have heard various Members opposite talking about carers and carer's allowance. They have welcomed improvements made in that area, but have any of them read the document published by the Carers Association after the budget? The Carers Association is certainly not pleased with the improved provisions. Carers feel entirely let down and disappointed by the Government, which has failed to give them many of the things they sought. Income limits were increased, which is welcome, but that did not make a huge difference to many. There are about 100,000 carers, 19,000 of whom get some payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. However, not all of those 19,000 carers receive the full allowance. Many of them are on reduced payments.</P>
      <P>Is it right and fair that only a small proportion of the carers who do such a tremendous job should be rewarded? If those carers ceased to provide care, what would be the cost to the State in terms of nursing home care and hospitalisation? Carers should be rewarded. I suggest that the Minister looks at the respite grant payable to carers. That grant, which has been increased from £500, is only made to those in receipt of some other payment. The Chair is familiar with nursing homes and will know that you cannot buy much time in one for that money. You would scarcely get a week at this stage. We are offering perhaps one week's respite care to a small proportion of carers. Why not give a respite grant to all carers, even those who do not get another payment? That would recognise the tremendous work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to commitments made by Fianna Fáil in its election manifesto and we heard from many Members that it lived up to and surpassed them. I did not hear one Deputy say that <Col N="706" /> Fianna Fáil's manifesto stated that the social insurance fund would be safe if it were in government. I suppose the Minister of State did not get around to reading that, but it is there and he should look at it carefully. His party has raided the social insurance fund and robbed it of £635 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>How much did the Deputy's party take out of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It has done so for political expediency. Why did the Government not live up to the commitment it made in its manifesto? It is marvellous to hear people come to this House time after time to describe how such commitments have been honoured, but that is one which the Government has decidedly overturned. It is a move for which the Deputies opposite will feel the wrath of working people when they go out to knock on doors. Robbing £635 million from the social insurance fund is no way to do business.</P>
      <P>The plight of widows is dear to my heart. Widows are the forgotten people. They are faced not only with the trauma of losing a partner but with picking up the bills thereafter, trying to establish a new way of life and trying to cope with the level of income which can be dramatically different to what they had previously. If any of us were to die our widows would get a pension of a quarter of our income. Even if a widow is lucky enough to have been married to somebody entitled to a pension from employment, how will she survive on a quarter of their previous income? If the husband was not entitled to a pension through employment and the widow must depend on social welfare &ndash; to extend that example further &ndash; how can somebody survive on the current social welfare payment of about £90 a week? If the widow has children, she will get additional payments. However, widows deserve a special place in society. They deserve to be looked after compassionately and I am disappointed the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs did not find a way to give increased payments to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being critical of the Deputy. His points are always interesting. No doubt the system is rotten with anomalies, but those are the sorts of issues which arise and we all come across interesting cases from time to <Col N="707" /> time. When we look at these cases from one perspective they may look stupid, but when we look at the same issues the following week or month from another point of view they are often put in perspective. If the officials set out to design a new system today, I am sure they would not end up with the current one.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, I will address a few of the points raised by Deputy McGrath. He is from a constituency with a mixture of rural and urban areas. It is usually the urban people who raise the issue of the extension of the family income supplement to the self-employed or the farmers. That is an issue which has been discussed by different Governments, including the rainbow government. At that time the Minister, who came to the issue from an urban perspective, won the day. The FIS was brought in to help low-waged people before the introduction of the minimum wage. As a Deputy from an urban constituency, I am glad the FIS is still in place and I hope it remains as an allowance for urban-based people. If it were thrown open to farmers and other self-employed persons, it would be very hard to administer and it would not target those for whom it was intended initially.</P>
      <P>A few Deputies, including Deputy McGrath, have spoken about people who might lose their medical cards and I commend them for managing to put the fear of God into many people. However, nobody produced evidence of one person who lost or was threatened with losing the medical card. It was a purely hypothetical case on paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is out of the traps quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the officials of the health board have a bit of common sense and would have been reasonable in dealing with people who were £1 or £2 over the qualifying threshold. The cases outlined were hypothetical. Even if that letter was issued by the Department, Deputies would not have found a case where somebody would lose the medical card.</P>
      <P>However, there is a recognition implicit in the Deputy's complaint, for which we thank him. He basically congratulates the Minister by default by saying the huge increases in social welfare payments in recent years have brought about that anomaly. On medical cards, the Government, for good or ill, set a five year programme targeting people over 70. It exceeded its promise. Five years ago it merely talked about doubling the guideline limits for people over 70. However, it went further and went the whole hog. It is now up to all political parties in the run up to the general election to lay out their strategy for medical cards for whatever other category of people over the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath mentioned raiding the social welfare fund and the reaction of workers. Workers are fair-minded people. The fund was <Col N="708" /> topped-up over the years with something like £1.1 billion, if I remember the figure correctly, or £11 billion &ndash; I forget&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but they do not mind when only a fraction of the amount given to the fund in the form of a top-up in recent years is taken out.</P>
      <P>In a way I am concerned about the fund. Fifteen or 20 years ago, people paid PRSI contributions in order that the payments they would receive would be greater than the social welfare rate, in other words, it was a social insurance fund. The Opposition Members have not been complaining about this but if I were to complain and find something wrong with this year's budget in the case of social welfare, it would be that the ordinary unemployed person who had worked for a number of years will get an additional £8 whereas the person on the lowest payment will get £9.50. This has come about as a result of pressure from certain lobby groups and from the mad push by the benchmarking and indexation group to get the lowest social welfare payment linked to the average industrial wage. That lobby group is not necessarily correct. I would have more concern for the worker who has paid PRSI for years and is on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or disability benefit. That person is losing out slightly this year because of a vociferous loud-mouthed lobby group which has managed to get its policy across. It looks like the Minister is partly taking on board its point this year and it looks like other parties may do so in future, but it is not necessarily benefiting everybody. There are winners and losers in every case.</P>
      <P>Recently the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs invited the Combat Poverty Agency to make a presentation. The agency gave a fair, balanced and complimentary report on this year's budget. Its representatives spoke about developments in the past two budgets where there have been huge increases in child benefit. He spoke of how the past two budgets have done more to address poverty than any previous budget. I was pleased to hear this from representatives of the Combat Poverty Agency because I would not always have regarded them as reasonable or fair in the past, but they were very complimentary of the Minister and his officials this year.</P>
      <P>However, that policy of giving huge increases to child benefit has just been established by the Department over the past two years. Before we have made a great deal of progress on it, however, other groups are pulling the Department away from giving increases in child benefit. They want to increase the lowest adult payment rate.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot have it both ways. <Col N="709" /> Although it has been agreed at one level that the best way to handle poverty is to target increases at child benefit, before we get through our initial three-year programme these groups are moving on to target the person on supplementary welfare benefit, long-term unemployment assistance or whatever. Although we had reached a certain agreement, that the real poverty was to be found in poor families and had just gone through a small portion of our programme and targeted child benefit successfully for two years, it concerns me that we are suddenly being pulled off in another direction. I hope political parties stick to giving payments to families &ndash; the best way of doing that is through child benefit &ndash; rather than being dragged away by the lobby groups who are trying to establish their policy under the benchmarking and indexation group. Theirs is not necessarily the most needy claim. By all means, I would like to increase the lowest rate of social welfare payment, but not at the expense of families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and the Minister of State for being present to reply.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State honour the agreement with farmers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to pay them for independent on-farm live valuation of reactors under the TB and brucellosis schemes? Payment is being refused and valuation inspections only take place where the number of reactors exceeds six. This agreement was made under the PPF and has not been honoured to date by the Government. This is regrettable and many farmers are losing out substantially as a result. This cannot continue at a time when farming is under severe pressure. It adds to the dismal performance of many departmental schemes. It is regrettable that departmental officials are making up the schemes as they go along. The Government's failure is at the expense of the farmer.</P>
      <P>Valuation officers are supposed to be independent and capable of making an independent valuation of animals on farms. It is unfortunate their independence has been removed because the Department insists these people operate under weekly price guidelines. That is a restriction which removes their independence. Not only do the guidelines cause frustration for farmers on whose farms inspections and valuations take place, the inspectors must take the brunt of abuse caused by the Government's failure to adhere to the terms of the PPF. This is another failure the Department has managed to lay on another source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 50% of breakdowns in herds take place in one, two or three animals. There is no on-farm live valuation in these cases which means <Col N="710" /> the animals are taken to the factory. As the Minister of State who comes from the west knows, many of these animals are small store cattle or weanlings whose value is almost nil apart from the grant. In other cases they could be suckler cows which also have a very low value placed on them by factories. We know in the majority of cases that farmers are disappointed with the price paid by factories. It is only the grant that gives them any worthwhile compensation in these instances.</P>
    <P>The Department also gave an undertaking that wildlife control would be tackled in tandem with the commitment under the PPF and that 27 officers would be appointed to deal with infected wildlife in the area of a herd breakdown. This has not taken place. Advertisements have only been placed in recent days and only the overall scheme rather than the appointments is being put in place at present.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed on three counts to honour the commitment given under the terms of the PPF. Will the Minister allow on-farm valuation for all livestock reactors and will he put in place the wildlife control personnel promised? It will not take place until the autumn or winter of this year which means another year will have passed before it will have been implemented.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is important the Minister and the Department act on the terrible news from Britain about another suspected case of foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as ucht an cheist seo a ardú. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to put on record exactly what is happening and how, once again, another commitment of the Government is being honoured.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, provided for the introduction of an on-farm market valuation scheme for the TB and brucellosis schemes. Numerous meetings took place during 2000 and 2001 between officials of my Department and farm bodies on the detailed arrangements for the introduction of the new scheme and broad agreement was reached in early 2001.</P>
      <P>Among the main features of the system are valuations to be carried out by suitably qualified independent valuers by reference to guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that in a minute. I did not interrupt the Deputy and I would appreciate the same courtesy in return. Other features of the system include a ceiling of &euro;2,540 to apply to payment in respect of any single animal, except in respect of one pedigree stock bull per farm where a ceiling of &euro;3,175 applies. Where the farmer or the Department does not accept the initial valuation, this can be appealed to another valuer on the panel. Following completion of the on-farm valuation process, the reactors are removed. If there is no agreement following an <Col N="711" /> appeal, the matter is to be referred to an arbitration panel whose decision will be final. Graduated penalties will apply to the final compensation payment made to the farmer where he or she unreasonably delays the removal of reactors or where a voluntary post-movement brucellosis test was not carried out as well as for other breaches of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The on-farm market valuation scheme has been introduced on a phased basis since February 2001. Initially live valuation was available for depopulations agreed after 1 January 2001 and breakdowns agreed after that date involving herds with pedigree reactors and herds where there were 12 reactors or more. From 1 July 2001 the threshold was reduced to six.</P>
      <P>During the phasing-in arrangements, eligible farmers were offered a choice of live valuation or the existing fixed reactor grants scheme. In the period from February 2001 to date, more than 1,800 farmers have opted for live valuation which has been carried out by independent valuers selected from the panel of valuers established for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Further meetings with farm bodies took place in January and February 2002. A further meeting with the farm bodies is being arranged for next week with a view to resolving the outstanding difficulties &ndash; I know the Deputy is in favour of partnership in this regard &ndash; thus enabling the full roll-out of the scheme to apply to all breakdowns from an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the people of Tuam, County Galway, and its vast hinterland, I demand a clear and unequivocal statement from the Government to the effect that the community hospital for Tuam will be built, and built very quickly. I share the view of the vast majority of <Col N="712" /> the people of Tuam that the Government is dragging its feet on the issue of the community hospital.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient for Government representatives to make commitments out of the side of their mouths locally. They must be matched by the necessary financial resources to build the hospital. If they are not forthcoming, Fianna Fáil will be letting down the people of Tuam. If and when Fine Gael is in government following the next general election, its commitment to building the hospital will be absolute. I have received a personal guarantee from the leader of my party, Deputy Noonan, in association with our health spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell, that the new Government will proceed with all possible haste to open the new hospital for business. The smile will be taken off the Minister of State's face in a few minutes when we hear what he has for Tuam. If he thinks this is a laughing matter, the next time he comes to Tuam he will know different. This guarantee was conveyed personally by the Leader of the Opposition to the people of Tuam a few months ago.</P>
      <P>A number of crunch issues need to be clarified. As the Minister of State knows, the hospital in Tuam will be soon closed one year. The people of the town are infuriated that the big padlocks are still on the gates. All that has happened is that the Western Health Board has purchased the property, which in itself means nothing. The board has a property purchased for more than 15 years for a geriatric home in Ballinasloe which has never been built. There seems to be no urgency in regard to the matter, either at health board or Government level.</P>
      <P>In replying to my Dáil question days before the hospital closed on 3 April 2001 the Minister of State said the health board informed him that it envisaged a 60 bed community hospital, comprising a mix of up to 30 beds for continuing care with the remaining 30 made up of direct access, rehabilitation, convalescent, respite and palliative care beds. He went on to say an important dimension of the service would be its linkage with the acute services, mainly in Galway, but also in Castlebar and Roscommon. That linkage would enable patients to be discharged early and ensure they would not be taken away from their families and communities for too long. He went on to say Tuam community hospital would open the way for the development of consultant-led out-patient clinics from Galway Regional Hospital and that tele-imaging and X-ray services would be developed.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister of State that University College Hospital, Galway, is completely full. It has now reached the stage where it is a torture for patients and their families to go through the system of admission. Given that it is bursting at the seams, if ever there was a need for a community type hospital for Tuam, just 20 miles from Galway, to alleviate the hardship patients must endure unnecessarily by going through the system in Galway, it is now. It would be good news for Galway and, certainly, for Tuam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my understanding that no money has been earmarked by the Government for the hospital, nor has it been included in the national develop<Col N="713" /> ment plan. I would like the Minister of State to state from where the money for Tuam hospital is coming. That is what everyone is asking, including the Minister of State's people. The hospital will cater for between 35,000 and 40,000 patients, not just in Tuam town, but in the vast hinterland. Because of the fact that the hospital is closed, many are beginning to think the Government has turned its back on the area. I ask the Minister of State, as an interim measure, to open the hospital for the reasons the hospital committee previously brought to his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The provision of health services in Tuam and throughout County Galway is a matter, in the first instance, for the Western Health Board. The board has identified as a priority the provision of a community hospital in Tuam which it has included in its schedule of priority schemes since as far back as 1996.</P>
      <P>The needs assessment on which the current proposal is based relates to the population of 31,609 in the immediate catchment area, which includes Tuam and Glenamaddy. Within this population there are 4,432 persons, or 14%, who are over 65 years of age. In some areas the over 65 population extends to 18%. Of those over 65 years, 1,059 live alone.</P>
      <P>The case for a community hospital in Tuam is primarily underpinned by national policy which recommends such a service for every 30,000 of the population. This policy is being reinforced by the provision of new and the upgrading of existing community nursing units and the designation of district hospitals to mirror that model of service. Generally, community hospitals are not intended to have an institutional character, but rather a smaller, more homely care environment serving local communities with both out-patient and in-patient services. The case for a community hospital in Tuam is further strengthened by the inevitable increase in population because of the town's key location as a satellite town of Galway.</P>
      <P>The needs assessment refers to the requirement for a 60 bed community hospital comprising a mix of up to 30 beds for continuing and long-stay care, with the remaining 30 made up by direct access beds, including rehabilitation, convalescent, respite and palliative care. In line with what is generally provided in the board's institutions, Tuam hospital will have a very significant multidisciplinary mix of staff, including medical, nursing, nursing support, paramedical as well as other complementary therapists. Coupled with this, the board would envisage the hospital being at the hub of a comprehensive outreach service providing home care programmes, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, home nursing, home help, as well as other flexible packages of care. These specialist care services would be supported by social services such as community welfare and home advisory programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important dimension of Tuam community hospital would be its linkage with acute services <Col N="714" /> mainly in Galway, but also in Castlebar and Roscommon, as referred to by the Deputy. This arrangement would enable patients to be discharged early for convalescence and ensure they would be only away from their families and communities for the minimum period. There would also be a close linkage with private nursing homes so as to give every resident in need of long-stay care a choice as regards placement. The community hospital would open the way for the development of consultant-led out-patient clinics from Galway Regional Hospital and tele-imaging X-ray services could be developed.</P>
    <P>The board has established an overall management group for the development of the various services on the site. A planning group for the community hospital and the proposed day care centre is also being established and will be requested to prepare the planning brief and bring the project to design stage. When this process has been completed the project will be referred to my Department for approval to invite tenders.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is not possible to give a precise date for the commencement of services at the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today in the short time available to me I was trying to evaluate the record of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern. I would now like to comment briefly on what is the even worse record of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in regard to housing. Just before Christmas, Focus Ireland estimated there were at least 140,000 people on local authority housing lists or homeless and that almost 54,000 families nationally were in this appalling situation. In the past two years there has been, at least, a 35% increase in the number of households on the lists in question. Many counties show a rise of approximately 100% in the number of families waiting for housing. Focus Ireland also warned that the Government social housing target of 25,000 new homes throughout the period of the PPF will not be achieved and that we need dramatic expansion in local authority housing, as proposed by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>With regard to Dublin specifically, each week Deputies meet perhaps dozens of homeless families, people on the waiting list for many years desperate to be rehoused. In my city council area, there are almost 7,500 households in dire housing need. There are perhaps 50,000 people waiting for housing in the four Dublin counties. These statistics show the dramatic failure of the Government in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" />In the north-central area of Dublin City Council, area B, which comprises three city council wards, with a population of about 120,000 people, there are more than 3,000 families desperately competing for perhaps 100 or 150 homes per year. Many of these families have been on the list for many years. In the past year, for example, I have represented people who have been housed after 11 or 12 years. There are at least 1,000 families which are more than five years on the Dublin City Council housing list. Belatedly, we are now supposed to have a new scheme of letting priorities, but it will not give a much greater advantage to people who have been on the list for many years.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city, there is a huge homeless list. Families in area B of Dublin North Central wait for well over a year for accommodation in areas of low demand. There is also a large transfer list in Dublin city following the appalling failures of State management over the years. The failure of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance has created dire circumstances for a very significant proportion of our people. The shared ownership scheme has not been working very efficiently in Dublin city, given that the most that can be granted is £140,000 by way of a mortgage. The affordable housing system has not yet started. In the neighbouring district of Fingal, which I also represent, circumstances are not much better. In my area of Howth-Malahide, there are almost 1,500 families waiting for housing, although, in parishes such as Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle, there has been no social housing whatsoever for the past three years.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the current managerial system cannot cope with the major housing issues. They have been given absolutely no direction by Government. We certainly need to look at housing primarily on a regional basis. I do not think a line on a map of a district like Kilbarrack should create two totally separate housing policies on each side. This time last year, Dublin City Council presented a housing strategy, but we now seem to be falling hopelessly behind in terms of the types of housing production we need to meet the demand of 161,000 households in the greater Dublin region up to 2005. The National Economic and Social Forum proposed some time ago that one of the reforms should be to create a simple national housing authority which would frame strategic policy and offer technical support to Government and local authorities, perhaps like the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland. Most people regarded that as having worked fairly efficiently over the past 30 years. The national housing authority would provide a major guide to Government in tackling the housing problem.</P>
    <P>I urge, in the dying days of the Government, the two Ministers concerned to take urgent action, especially in Dublin city and Fingal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important issue. The idea of a national housing authority has been canvassed by a number of <Col N="716" /> interests, including the National Economic and Social Forum, as is evident from its report on social and affordable housing and accommodation. The establishment of such a body is also the stated policy of Deputy Broughan's party. There appears, however, to be a lack of consensus and clarity concerning the role and functions that such an authority might have, how it might be funded and its relationship with central Government, local authorities and other housing providers.</P>
      <P>It has been a priority of the Government to adapt and strengthen institutions and structures supporting housing development across all tenures. In this area, we have developed a wide range of administrative arrangements and new initiatives. These include the establishment of a voluntary housing unit to co-ordinate and support the efforts of the voluntary and corporate housing sectors in meeting the ambitious housing targets under the national development plan. A separate housing supply unit has also been established in my Department to ensure that the various supply measures introduced by the Government are implemented. A cross-departmental team on housing has also been set up to bring to bear in a co-ordinated way the efforts of other Departments in the housing area. The Housing Forum, set up in agreement with the social partners, as provided for in the PPF, is operating effectively and the eighth meeting of the forum will be held tomorrow. In addition, the Private Residential Tenancies Board has been set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis pending the necessary legislation arising from the recommendations of the commission on the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>We have also increased significantly the funding of our housing programmes and improved and fine-tuned the range of incentives and supports relating to housing. Total funding for housing this year is &euro;1.7 billion, which is more than three and a half times that provided in 1997.</P>
      <P>Our approach is working. We have been delivering higher levels of overall housing output and a major expansion of both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes. Total housing output last year, at more than 52,000 units, was the highest output ever achieved in a single year. Housing output in the greater Dublin area was also at an all-time record. In addition, local authority output was at the highest level for 15 years, at over 5,000 units, and the voluntary housing sector achieved its highest output ever, with 1,250 units completed.</P>
      <P>The NESF recommendation concerning a national housing authority will be further considered by my Department. The establishment of such an authority would, regardless of the exact role it may carry out, have significant implications for all the players in the housing sector. At a time when our objective to accelerate and increase the supply of housing is demonstrably being realised, the added value of embarking on complex institutional changes will need to be well justified. I assure the Deputy that this issue will be addressed fully and openly in the further examination which my Department will now undertake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to read an extract from a letter I received from distressed parents of a teenage constituent of mine:</P>
      <P>Twelve days ago, an unprovoked violent attack on our 18 year old daughter, by young males, on Main St. in Swords, in the early hours of Friday morning, 15 February, occurred. We enclose photographs of injuries sustained in this horrific incident, taken after spending most of that night in Beaumont hospital, waiting to be seen by a doctor. I am sure they are equally abhorrent to yourself. Also included is a photo of our daughter's friend, who was also assaulted in the same attack. You may or may not be aware that this assault is not an isolated incident on Main St., Swords.</P>
      <P>Swords Garda apprehended the alleged culprits almost immediately as they were apparently involved in a previous more serious attack on a youth from Leitrim, also on Main St., Swords, who was taken to Beaumont hospital by ambulance. Fortunately, the violent attack on our daughter was fully recorded on CCTV, the camera being situated at an off-licence beside a well-known pub. The video is currently in possession of the Garda.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in the case of the other victim, he has not got the benefit of video evidence and will be dubious about pressing charges, despite the fact that there were witnesses to his assault.</P>
      <P>Swords, Fingal's capital town has become a dangerous place after dark and is unsafe for anyone, this attack was not an isolated one and is a reoccurring problem at weekends in particular. For this reason I am appealing that a CCTV installation be put in place in the main street before somebody is killed. CCTV would also be a great bonus to the Garda Síochána who are doing excellent work under great pressure. If showing these photographs lends impetus to securing the installation of CCTV cameras, it will have been worthwhile.</P>
      <P>This young girl went out for the first time 12 days after having been attacked severely. I appeal to the Government to fast-track CCTV installation wherever it is needed, especially where business people have offered funding, as is the case in the town of Swords. I thank them for this civic offer. I am aware of the difference CCTV makes in places like Temple Bar in Dublin, which is monitored in Pearse Street station, and also the O'Connell Street area, which is monitored in Store Street station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the late night opening of almost all pubs in Swords, this town has become known as the Temple Bar of north County Dublin. In one major respect it is different; it is missing the CCTV protection. At present, five pubs close after 2 a.m., each with 400 to 500 people spilling out. More than 2,000 punters, many of whom are drunk, come out onto the streets. This is an impossible policing situation. Even with the present inadequate Garda resources stretched to the very limits, a young man was stabbed in the <Col N="718" /> head recently within view of two gardaí. Clearly, there is a need for CCTV as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>There is a need for more gardaí in north County Dublin and also for pub closing hours to be reviewed, not just for the safety of gardaí who have to police the area late at night, but also for the sake of overworked bar and security staff, many of whom believe they are getting a raw deal in terms of their working environment. This is to nobody's benefit, certainly not to the benefit of those being attacked and gardaí who are doing their best in a difficult situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of the measures taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities to tackle what is commonly referred to as street crime. While the Minister is responsible for the overall provision of resources for the Garda Síochána, it is the Garda authorities which are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas.</P>
      <P>The Government's record in tackling crime in all its guises is second to none. One yardstick of this record is the unprecedented level of resources made available to the Garda Síochána. Current Garda strength of 11,770 is the highest in the history of the State; it was only 10,800 when the Minister took office. Recruitment already under way will bring Garda strength up to an all-time record high of 12,000 by the end of 2002. Last November the Minister announced that he had approved the holding of a further Garda recruitment competition early in 2002 to recruit an additional 300 Garda trainees. The recruitment of this additional 300 gardaí will ensure Garda strength is maintained at that all-time high level.</P>
      <P>The commitment to the 12,000 strong force is a key priority for the Government. It is one of the many commitments on which it has delivered since 1997. It is a clear sign that it is delivering on its commitments to give the Garda the necessary resources to enforce the law, clamp down on anti-social behaviour and fight crime. Having delivered on the commitment of the 12,000 strong force, the Minister is determined to maintain Garda strength at this level. The new competition for 300 additional trainees was advertised in the national press last Sunday, 24 February 2002.</P>
      <P>The Government's multifaceted approach to tackling crime is successful. First, it is a clear and determined focus on tackling those engaged in crime. Second, it is a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime. Third, it is a commitment to address and, where possible, ameliorate the causes of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy refers to CCTV. I am sure he is aware of the great progress made in recent years in extending the CCTV network. As of now, Garda CCTV systems are in operation in Dublin north central, that is, O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas; Dublin south central, that is, Grafton Street and its surrounding areas; and Tralee, County Kerry. Furthermore, a Garda <Col N="719" /> CCTV system comprising 29 cameras is currently being completed in Cork city. I understand most of the cameras in the system are now fully operational and I am sure the system will provide a significant additional weapon to the Garda Síochána in tackling street crime in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are aware that the number of Garda CCTV systems is being significantly increased. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are being installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. Tenders have been sought and received in respect of six of the ten Garda town centre CCTV systems referred to, that is, Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The evaluation process is in its final stages and the Minister hopes to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place. Planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for the remaining four locations of Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers within the next three months.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems which have been received by the advisory committee established by the commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. The Minister has given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided for areas not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, he plans to introduce a grants scheme to cater for those communities which would like to press ahead on their own with local CCTV systems. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is on record as stating that where legislation is required to deal with criminal activity, he will not be found wanting. In this regard, he has sought and received Government approval for the drafting, on a priority basis, of a new Criminal Justice (Public Order <Col N="720" /> Enforcement) Bill, the purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to tackle anti-social behaviour. It will target, in particular, druken and unruly elements who congregate late at night outside or in the vicinity of licensed or other premises such fast food outlets, and who by their aggressive and intimidating behaviour threaten the peace and well-being of law abiding citizens. As announced in the Government's legislative programme on 29 January 2002, it is planned that the Bill will be published before Easter.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána's national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, has been in operation since October 2000. This operation focuses on public disorder, public intoxication, under age drinking, illicit drugs use and under age alcohol sales. Hot spots of criminal activity receive particular Garda attention, with an emphasis on high visibility patrolling. Moreover, key urban locations are selected for intensive patrolling involving the Garda mounted unit, the Garda dog unit and the Garda air support unit.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider Operation Oíche to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and night clubs. Notwithstanding the considerable success enjoyed since the inception of Operation Oíche, it was believed that a fresh approach was needed to tackle the problem, especially taking into consideration growing concerns at the number of incidents of public disorder which occur late at night and in the early hours of the morning. Therefore, following consultations with the Garda Commissioner, a new public order initiative, entitled Operation Encounter, came into force on 23 February 2002. The operation concentrates on targeted areas and also involves closer liaison with the owners of night clubs, pubs and fast food outlets.</P>
    <P>The National Crime Council is undertaking a major research project in relation to the commission of public order offences in Ireland, which should significantly enhance the information available on the scope and nature of the problem. The council has commissioned the Institute of Criminology in UCD to conduct the research and it is estimated that the project will be completed in approximately 12 months. I have no doubt that this research will assist decision makers in deciding on future measures to deal with this problem on a systematic and ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 February 2002.</P>

      <P>My Department will be actively co-operating with the task force set up recently by the Tánaiste to address the employment and training needs of workers affected by the slow down in employment in the north Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The primary role of my Department where people lose employment is to provide a comprehensive information service on social welfare entitlements and to process any applications for unemployment payments as speedily as possible. In addition, customers are advised of employment opportunities and are referred to FÁS for a more focused job placement and training service as appropriate.</P>
      <P>These services are available through the network of social welfare local offices. My staff in these offices have been liaising with larger companies in the region which have made staff redundant over the past six months. This liaison involved providing an enhanced information service to workers prior to redundancy and making arrangements for the acceptance of claims in a manner which would minimise the inconvenience to redundant workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officers of my Department are in regular contact with local statutory and voluntary agencies providing education, training and support services to unemployed persons. They have a special working relationship with FÁS through the operation of the employment action plan under which persons who are in danger of becoming long-term unemployed are referred to FÁS for assessment <Col N="722" /> of their needs and for placement in employment or training as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Along with promoting departmental initiatives, officers of my Department are also directly involved in partnership with local statutory, voluntary and community groups in devising and delivering employment, training and educational opportunities for disadvantaged persons in the area. It is represented at management board level on four area partnerships in Dublin north and is also actively involved with the local employment services. Furthermore, a number of areas in Dublin north have been targeted under the Government's initiative to give priority attention to areas of particular disadvantage. The initiative, known as revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, or RAPID, include six areas in the northside of Dublin and my Department is actively involved at area implementation team and sub-committee level on these groups.</P>

      <Quest>the total moneys paid out for supplementary welfare allowance in 2001; the breakdown of such payments for the years 1995 to 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest estimate of expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for 2001 is £315 million, &euro;400 million. A breakdown of this expenditure is given in the following tabular statement. Expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the years 1995 to 2000 is set out in IR£ and &euro; euro in the following tabular statements.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure rose by £180.8 million, &euro;229.6 million, in the six years between 1995 and 2001. This represents an overall increase of almost 135%. The category that represents the most significant portion of overall expenditure continues to be rent supplements. In 2001, rent supplements accounted for almost 45% of total supplementary welfare allowance expenditure. The continuing rise in rent supplement expenditure is for the most part a result of the significant increase in the cost of private rented accommodation which has occurred over the past few years.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has decided in principle to set up a new scheme of rent assistance which will be operated by the local authorities. When this scheme is put in place more appropriate housing solutions will be offered to people with long-term housing needs and there will be less recourse to supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>In 2002, for the first time, increases in weekly social welfare rates provided for in the budget were effective from the beginning of January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" />Increases in short-term weekly payments such as unemployment and disability benefits were implemented from the first pay day in January. However, book-based payment systems, which are the chosen payment option for the majority of pensioners and other long-term weekly beneficiaries, are less flexible than other payment methods and require longer lead-times to implement increases. Budget increases for those customer categories were paid via lump sum payments in February, with full retrospection applied to the effective date of the increase in all cases.</P>
    <P>Customers on schemes where books were renewed in February were paid a lump sum in respect of the six weeks increase due from the start of 2002 in payments issued on 14 and 15 February. Customers on schemes where new books are due in April 2002 also received a lump sum during February, containing six weeks backdated payment to the start of 2002, plus an advance payment of the increase for seven weeks to bring them up to the date on which their new books arrive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" />As the manner and date by which customers received their increases differed depending on their payment category, it was essential to ensure that all customers were fully aware of when and how their increase would be paid. It was also essential that, where payments were being made via lump sums in February, the relevant customers groups should be made aware that retrospection was being applied so that they would receive the full benefit of the increases effective back to the start of January.</P>
    <P>To that end, my Department implemented a range of measures to ensure that our diverse range of customers were fully aware of the arrangements for payment of budget rate increases. These measures included television, radio and national newspaper advertising, a freephone service for customer inquiries and a mailshot delivered during late January and early February 2002 to 588,944 customers in categories which received their increase via lump sum payments in February. The mailshot explained the payment arrangements for the increases and also provided departmental contact details for any further inquiries arising.</P>
    <P>It was particularly important to ensure that an appropriate range of public awareness measures were in place regarding the arrangements for payment of budget increases in the situation where euro notes and coins were also being introduced from the start of January, so as to reassure customers that no one would lose out either as a result of the arrangements for payment of budget increases or on the changeover to the euro. By implementing these measures, my Department ensured that all our customers were provided with the necessary clarity and reassurance about how and when their budget increases would be paid.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to minimise the potential for the issue of a letter to a deceased person by ensuring that address data is extracted as close as possible to the issue date and excludes data where the record has been updated with details of the death of a customer. However, it is still possible that the Department may not be aware of the death of a pensioner, for example, where a person dies in the interval between extracting the data and the delivery of the correspondence.</P>
    <P>My Department is very aware of the risk of causing distress to survivors of deceased persons and, when extracting customer address data for the issue of mailshots and circular letters to customer groups, checks are carried out to ensure that correspondence issues only to current customers. If the Deputy has in mind a particular case which she wishes me to have investigated further, and can provide details, then I will make the necessary arrangements.</P>

      <P>The grant was introduced in April 2000 for widows and widowers with dependent children, who became widowed on or after 1 December 1999. Entitlement to the grant is contingent on their being in receipt of or entitled to any of the payments which are specifically provided by my Department for widows and widowers.</P>
      <P>In processing applications for these payments, in cases where the widow or widower has qualified children, payment of the grant is issued automatically by cheque to the survivor, once the death is notified, without the need to make a formal application for the grant.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this proactive approach, in order to ensure that take-up of the grant has been maximised, my Department is at present attempting to identify any widows or widowers with qualified children who may not have received payment of the grant in this way. If any case is identified, their entitlement to the grant will be processed without delay.</P>
      <P>Since introducing the grant in April 2000, my Department has made a total of 2,150 payments of which 862 payments were made in 2000, 1,208 payments in 2001 and 80 payments have issued to date in 2002.</P>
      <P>Since the scheme's inception in April 2000, my Department has spared no effort in publicising its availability. It has had significant coverage in the media through press releases and information leaflets and application forms are available from my Department's network of local social welfare offices. My Department also has an Internet site on which information is readily available. It can be accessed at www.welfare.ie.</P>
      <P>Also, social welfare information is provided on RTE's teletext information system, Aertel. The pensions services office in Sligo communicates regularly with funeral directors nationwide with the objective of creating greater awareness of all bereavement payments and from time to time provide information updates to them.</P>
      <P>Comhairle, which is funded by my Department, also provides an extensive network of citizen information centres. They complement and enhance the information services provided at local level by my Department.</P>
      <P>Given all of the initiatives and measures that have taken place to date, I am satisfied that my Department has made all possible efforts to ensure that people are fully informed concerning their entitlement to the widowed parent grant.</P>

      <P>This working group, which is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, comprises representatives from each of the pillars of social partnership, together with representatives of relevant Government Departments and agencies, including my own Department. The National Women's Council of Ireland is representing the community and voluntary pillar on this working group.

      <P>Increases in child benefit have been paid in September for a number of years. Last year, however, the Government brought forward the increases to June and this year the increases announced in the budget will be effective from April.</P>
      <P>The rates of child benefit payments have also been radically improved. When we came to office in 1997, the level of child benefit was &euro;38.09, IR£30, for each of the first two children and &euro;49.52, IR£39, for each of the subsequent children. Last year, we announced the most substantial increases in child benefit in the history of the scheme, namely &euro;31.74, IR£25, per month for the first two children and &euro;38.09, IR£30, for subsequent children. This year, I am happy to say that similar increases are being provided again. The rates of payment from April 2002 will be &euro;117.60 for the first two children and &euro;147.30 for subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of child benefit payments are made by means of books of payable orders which run from June to May and current books contain orders at the existing rates. The new books which will be issued from June next will contain orders at the increased rates. The increase for April and May will be paid separately and May is the earliest date from which it is administratively possible to pay it. A special voucher in respect of the increase will be issued to post offices for encashment when customers collect their monthly pay<Col N="728" /> ment due on 7 May. Those who are paid by direct credit to bank accounts will receive their increase at the same time by way of payments to the accounts nominated by them.</P>

      <P>Industrial action taken by clerical staff in this office commenced on 4 October 2001. The action was suspended on 21 December 2001 and detailed settlement proposals have since been accepted by the staff concerned.</P>
      <P>The processing of child benefit claims has been adversely affected by a backlog of work which arose during the dispute. In addition, the volume of inquiries currently being received is significantly higher than normal and is affecting the ability to clear the backlog and to achieve satisfactory performance levels in service delivery to the families concerned. In addition, it is not possible to provide an adequate and speedy response to those inquiries.</P>
      <P>At this time, it is taking six weeks to process claims from new families, three weeks for claims from families claiming for an additional child and an average of six weeks to deal with other requests for changes to existing claims.</P>
      <P>A number of measures is being put in place to address the situation. The priority is to bring the backlog of claims to an acceptable level by mid-March and my Department is confident that the measures now being put in place will achieve this. My Department's business plan states that the aim is to clear 90% of all child benefit claims within one week. I regret any inconvenience to claimants arising from this temporary deterioration in service.</P>

    <P>The Programme For Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the establishment of a social insurance board with representation from <Col N="729" /> the social partners will be examined over the lifetime of the programme.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the social insurance fund is in a healthy financial situation at the moment. The surpluses which have emerged since 1997 onwards require careful management in order to ensure that they are used to best advantage having regard to emerging demands and the overall interest of its contributors.</P>
    <P>In this regard, my Department has engaged external consultants to conduct an actuarial review of the social insurance fund for the period 2001 to 2056. This work is well advanced and I expect to receive the final report from this review shortly.</P>
    <P>This review will build on the findings of the 1997 review in relation to social insurance based pensions as well as dealing, for the first time, with short-term benefits. The outcome of the review will inform short to medium and long-term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally and the emerging surpluses of recent years. It will also directly feed into the examination of possible roles of a social insurance board and the social partners will be fully consulted as part of this process.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the accommodation and subsistence needs of asylum seeking children are met directly through an independent co-ordination agency, the reception and integration agency, which <Col N="730" /> comes under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by the health boards through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means, whether in cash or in kind, and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who arrived since 10 April 2000. They are provided with full board accommodation, including all meals and other services under the system of direct provision operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In such cases, the recommended weekly allowance is &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro; 9.60 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who are not in direct provision are entitled to the full range of supports available under the supplementary welfare scheme. Child benefit is also payable in respect of any child resident in the State, including asylum seeking children. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has invested heavily in the child benefit scheme in recent years. Following the biggest ever increase in child benefit in 2001, the 2002 budget again provides for record increases which will bring the rate of payment to &euro;117.60 for the first two children and &euro;142.30 for subsequent children from April of this year.</P>
      <P>The rates of payments have been increased threefold over our period in office and, in addition, we have brought forward the effective payment dates for child benefit from September in 1997 to April in 2002. These improvements in child income support demonstrate the absolute commitment of the Government to tackling the issue of child poverty, wherever it occurs.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow, the Taoiseach and I will launch Building an Inclusive Society, the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS. The publication of the revised strategy comes at the end of a long consultation process in which the social partners fully participated. It expands the scope of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and strengthens it through bolder policies and robust institutional structures. The new targets and policy measures, including those in relation to children and ethnic minority groups, represent a more ambitious approach to the reduction of poverty in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As outlined in the Government's legislation programme, published on 29 January last, I intend to bring forward a number of Bills over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Bill, published on 27 July 2001, is currently before Seanad Éireann. This Bill deals with the regulation of occupational pensions and the legislative framework for the implementation of recommendations contained in the Pension Board's report, Securing Retirement Income.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Bill will be passed by the Seanad by the end of February and then considered by the Dáil with a view to its enactment before the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, was published on 15 February last. It provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the implementation of certain social welfare improvements announced in the Budget Statement of 5 December 2001 such as increases in the monthly rates of child benefit and increases in the respite care grant and improvements in the schemes of disability and unemployment benefits and pre-retirement allowance. The Bill also provides for amendment of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts to facilitate the implementation of a new computerised system of registration of births and deaths pending the enactment of a comprehensive Civil Registration Bill later this year. In addition, it includes a number of amendments to the Combat Poverty Agency Act, the Health Contribution Act and the Charities Acts. The Second Stage debate is scheduled to commence on 26 February 2002.</P>
      <P>The Civil Registration Bill will provide for reform of the existing births, marriages and deaths registration legislation and underpin the modernisation of the civil registration service. The Bill is currently being drafted by the parliamentary counsel's office and it is my intention to have the Bill published as soon as possible. </P>
      <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill will provide the legislative framework for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, established under the auspices of my Department in response to problems of moneylending and overindebtedness. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for a firm statutory basis for the service and to secure its continuity into the future. The drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to publish the Bill before the Easter recess.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 49 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the community welfare service in the health boards. The scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department as part of my Department's series of expenditure reviews.</P>
      <P>The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme are being examined. The review also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the review procedure involved an examination of the objectives of the scheme and included a widespread consultation process. This resulted in 145 submissions being received by the group. The issues raised in these submissions were read, summarised and grouped under 18 relevant themes by the working group members.</P>
      <P>Within these 18 themes over 700 different issues were raised. The points raised ranged from six comments on the co-ordination of welfare services to over 100 comments on the involvement of community welfare officers, CWOs, in dealing with housing issues. There were almost 100 comments each on the future direction for the community welfare service and the role of the community welfare officer. The particular points made included: there should be more integration of social services; too much CWO time is spent on routine payment processing; and too much CWO time is spent dealing with long-term needs, including housing supplements, which are inappropriate to a safety net scheme. A number of submissions made the point that these activities hamper the service in taking a leading role in tackling poverty and social exclusion at community level. A tabular statement setting out the 18 themes and showing the number of issues raised under each theme follows.</P>
      <P>The working group propose establishing sub-groups to examine these issues in detail. Superintendent and community welfare officers as well as staff in my Department were invited to nominate themselves for such sub-groups if they wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" />Progress in relation to this review has been slower than anticipated due to the number and nature of the issues raised. It is now hoped that <Col N="734" /> an interim report will be published in the autumn.</P>

    <P>Mr. McGahon asked the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs his plans to increase the living alone allowance as a means of helping elderly persons who have to live on small incomes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [6429/02]</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare-type payments and who reside alone. Any proposals to increase the allowance could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>However, the overall policy being followed in relation to support for our older people has been to commit resources to improving the personal pension rates rather than supplementary payments such as the living alone allowance. This is the most effective way of ensuring that the position of all our pensioners is improved.</P>
      <P>Our Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of &euro;126.97 by 2002. In the review of this programme, the Government committed to the early achievement of the &euro;126.97 rate and, furthermore, extended it to other social welfare pensions. This target was achieved one year ahead of schedule in the case of old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension and was achieved in this year's budget for old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The improvements announced in budget 2002 saw the old age contributory pension increase to &euro;147.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension increase to &euro;134 per week. Overall increases in old age pension rates since the Government came into office amount to between 37% and 49%.</P>
      <P>Other improvements made in the area of pensions include changes in the assessment of capital under the means tests for non-contributory payments. There have also been significant improvements in the area of the free schemes.</P>
      <P>Old people will remain one of the major priorities for the Government and the most effective way of improving their position will be kept under review in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures.</P>
      <P>With regard to the budget, spending Departments are responsible for, and obliged to, poverty-proof expenditure measures. The National Anti-Poverty Strategy unit of my Department acts as an ongoing resource to assist all Departments to meet their obligations.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing is a major tool in ensuring that Departments are kept aware of the possible implications of policy on those most in need and it is a system this Government is committed to as part of its social inclusion strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2002 social welfare budget package is based on objectives agreed in a number of documents, such as the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Action Programme for the Millennium and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy. The overall aims of the package include: to continue to increase pensions in view of the Govern<Col N="735" /> ment target of &euro;127 for all old age pensioners by 2002; to provide real increases for all social welfare payment recipients, in line with the PPF, to make progress towards the target of &euro;127 per week on lowest payments, as promised in the PPF; and to continue to increase child benefit for all families, with the dual objective of addressing child poverty and facilitating parental choice.</P>
    <P>All these are consistent with NAPS objectives. Nevertheless, in the interests of comprehensiveness and in accordance with the poverty proofing guidelines, an explicit poverty proof of the main elements of the package was undertaken by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Government has invested record resources designed to address the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities. Tomorrow morning, the Taoiseach and I will launch the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, Building an Inclusive Society. The primary focus will be on the integration of the various proofing mechanisms and the extension of poverty proofing to health boards and local authorities.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the current application of the cohabitation rule to lone parents in view of the recent recommendations made by the NESF's report No. 20; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The one parent family payment is my Department's main income support payment for lone parents. It is designed to provide income maintenance to those parents who are bringing up their children without the support of a partner. Clearly, a payment which is based on the contingency of lone parenthood cannot continue where the person marries or cohabits.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system, in general, is contingency based and also assumes that there are economies of scale where two people are married or cohabiting. In the circumstances, under the current system a reduction in income may occur where a person changes status from being a lone parent to one where he or she marries or cohabits. Where both of a couple are welfare recipients the losses are, to some extent, eased by the payment of the qualified adult allowance.</P>
      <P>This issue was examined in detail in a number of reports in recent years including the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, 1999, and the review of the one-parent family payment, 2000. In neither case was a solution to the problem put forward with the contingency nature of the social welfare system as a whole identified as one of the major obstacles to a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" />The National Economic and Social Forum in its recent report on lone parents also examined the issue and, while it made no definite recommendations, it has put forward some suggestions for further consideration. Generally speaking, its main suggestion revolves around giving lone parents who marry or cohabit access to the unemployment assistance scheme so that they may retain a full personal payment. A household means test would still apply and the unemployment assistance scheme would be amended to exempt parents from the requirement to actively seek work until their youngest child was five years of age, with a part-time work requirement applying until the child was 12 years of age.</P>
    <P>The view of the National Economic and Social Forum is that the system should have a much broader application with all qualified adults opting for this conditionally if they wish to receive a full personal rate and work tests also applying to those who remain as lone parents.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion made involves transitional arrangements whereby one-parent family payment recipients could retain a full payment for a period after they marry or commence cohabiting. The option of paying a lump sum is also explored. The National Economic and Social Forum acknowledges that such arrangements would be difficult to administer, may also create other disincentives and may place other couples at a disadvantage compared to those couples who would benefit from such arrangements.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum suggestions are welcome as a contribution to policy discussion in this area. However, because of the fundamental changes envisaged for the social welfare system and the general principle underlying the changes, I consider it is appropriate that the recommendations should be examined further before any decision is made in regard to implementation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 56, 76, 85, 86 and 329 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent estimate of the number of full-time carers is available from the results of the census pilot survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office. This survey was carried out in September 1999 and is based on a sample of 8,000 households in which persons aged 15 years or over were asked if they provided unpaid personal help for someone with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age.</P>
      <P>The detailed results are as follows: 35,000 people provide more than 50 hours unpaid personal help per week, or seven hours per day; 17,000 people provide 20-49 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between three and seven hours per day; and 79,000 people provide one to 19 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between nine minutes and 2.5 hours per day.</P>
      <P>These results are consistent with the conclusions of the review of the carer's allowance and it also explains the estimate of 120,000 carers used by the carer organisations. I have asked the Central Statistics Office to consider undertaking a detailed analysis of hours spent caring when conducting the census this year.</P>
      <P>There are currently over 19,000 carers in receipt of carer's allowance which means that over 36 % of the 52,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of over 106% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the Government took office and it should also be noted that the expected increase of another 3,400 carers following the increases in income disregards, which will become effective from this April, will increase this percentage to over 42% of all carers who are providing more than three hours care per day.</P>
      <P>The level of payment for these carers has increased by &euro;48.28, 54%, for those over 66 and by &euro;33.08, 37%, for those under 66 over the last five budgets. In addition, people on carer's allowance now qualify for the full range of free schemes in addition to the annual respite care grant which will increase to &euro;635 from June this year. Carers caring for more than one person will receive a double respite care grant of &euro;1,270.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" />With regard to last year's figures, carer's allowances were awarded to 5,186 carers and 4,171 applications were unsuccessful. In addition, 254 people who applied for a carer's allowance during 2001 subsequently withdrew their applications.</P>
    <P>In relation to reviewing the carer's allowance scheme further, the review of the carer's allowance, which I have already mentioned, was undertaken as part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in its Action Programme for the Millennium. The review was completed by an inter-departmental committee, chaired by my Department and published in October 1998. Arising from proposals in the review, a range of measures has been introduced over the last five budgets to improve and develop the position of carers.</P>
    <P>The recently published health strategy proposes to reform existing arrangements, including the carer's allowance, in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. The Department of Health and Children has begun to work with my own Department to develop proposals in this area. In addition, the strategy proposes that a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people be developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This wider approach is the most appropriate way to proceed.</P>
    <P>In addition, I expect that the study examining issues relating to the financing of long-term care, which is being carried out by Mercer Limited, will be published shortly after Easter. As the Deputies are aware, the study is being undertaken in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance and any policy proposals arising from the report will be developed in conjunction with these Departments as part of the Government's cross-cutting approach to care issues. Publication of the report has been delayed due to the extensive consultation which has taken place with these Departments. This has taken longer than originally anticipated as did the comprehensive level of research undertaken by the consultants for the report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of caring benefit mentioned by the Deputy, the review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of a cost of care allowance and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. The estimated cost of introducing a weekly universal cost of care allowance of &euro;50 would be in the region of &euro;135 million annually, based on the current estimate of full-time carers &ndash; 52,000.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for the Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and <Col N="739" /> practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 54 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the NESC, entitled Review of the Poverty Proofing Process, was prepared in response to a request from my Department on behalf of the interdepartmental policy committee which has provided the central focus for the National Anti-Poverty Strategy since its launch in 1997. The contents of the NESC report were noted by Government prior to its publication in December 2001.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that since late 1998, all memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives, upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed. The comprehensive review of the poverty proofing process undertaken by the NESC is timely and provides the basis for the further development and enhancement of the process.</P>
      <P>The NESC report indicates that the process has had a positive impact, notably in terms of sensitising policy makers to the poverty dimension of policies. It makes a number of recommendations aimed at increasing this impact and further enhancing the effectiveness of the process in relation to policy impact assessment.</P>
      <P>The review examines issues such as how the poverty proofing process might distinguish between large integrated programmes and other more self-contained proposals. It also assesses how the poverty proofing process might be integrated with broader policy proofing requirements, such as equality proofing. The development of the poverty proofing process will be undertaken in the context of the implementation of the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, which the Taoiseach and I will formally launch tomorrow. The conclusions and recommendations contained in the NESC report will be central to that development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputies that the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, entitled Building an Inclusive Society, has been approved by Government and will be formally launched tomorrow by the Taoiseach and I.</P>
      <P>This publication is the outcome of a process committed to under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This process involved a review of the methodology underlying the strategy and a review and revision, where appropriate, of existing targets. New targets in the areas of health and housing-accommodation as well as specific targets in relation to vulnerable groups are included in the revised strategy.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the new strategy will provide the basis for further progress towards our goal of effectively eradicating poverty in this country and that it will add impetus to our policies for increasing social inclusion.</P>
      <P>Building an Inclusive Society expands the scope of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and strengthens it through bolder policies and robust institutional structures. The new targets will represent a more ambitious approach to the reduction of poverty in Ireland. The revised strategy also recognises the importance of the collection of accurate and timely data both nationally and in relation to specific groups.</P>
      <P>The publication of the revised strategy comes at the end of a long consultation process in which the social partners fully participated. The framework document which sets out the results of this process in some detail will also be available from tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The framework document and the Government's new strategy document aim to build on the significant progress we have made since the NAPS was launched. After the exceptional economic growth we have enjoyed in recent years, it is important now to put the policies in place that can continue to improve the lives of our most vulnerable citizens in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The primary role of the community employment, CE, scheme is to provide part-time employment to assist unemployed people, particularly, the long-term unemployed, to re-enter the labour market. The Deputy will be aware that participation levels on CE are gradually being reduced, reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the family income supplement, FIS, scheme, on the other hand, is to create an incentive for full-time workers with families, who are in low-paid employment, to remain at work. Extension of FIS to CE participants would not be consistent with these policy objectives. I also emphasise that CE participants receive payments which are in excess of their entitlements under the social welfare system. For example, a CE worker without dependants receives a weekly payment of &euro;148.20 as compared with an entitlement under long-term unemployment assistance of &euro;118.80. In addition, CE participants are free to supplement their payments through earnings from work outside of their working hours on the programme.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the CE rate is adjusted based on the number of dependants in the household. This means that a participant who has an adult dependent and three children can receive a payment of &euro;272.30 per week while working in a CE scheme. In addition, participants can retain secondary benefit entitlements for the duration of their participation on the programme, if gross weekly household income is less than &euro;317.43 per week.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional family income support via family income supplement is not considered appropriate in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The overall policy being followed in relation to support for our older people has been to commit resources to improving the position of all pensioners through significant increases in personal pension rates. Our <Col N="742" /> Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of &euro;126.97 by 2002. In the review of this programme, the Government committed to the early achievement of the &euro;126.97 rate and, furthermore, extended it to other social welfare pensions. This target was achieved one year ahead of schedule in the case of old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension and was achieved in this year's budget for old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The improvements announced in budget 2002 saw the old age (contributory) pension increase to &euro;147.30 per week and the old age (non-contributory) pension increase to &euro;134.00 per week. Overall increases in old age pension rates since this Government came into office amount to between 37% and 49%.</P>
      <P>Other improvements made in the area of pensions include changes in the assessment of capital under the means tests for non-contributory payments. There have also been significant improvements in the area of the free schemes.</P>
      <P>Increasing pension rates is the most effective way of improving the position of all pensioners. The suggestion from the Deputy entails a more targeted approach with additional means testing required to identify those who might benefit. This is not something which has been considered to date as apart from increasing rates the approach has also been to reduce reliance on means tested benefits.</P>
      <P>Improvements for old people will remain one of the major priorities for the Government and the most effective way of meeting their needs will be kept under review in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <P>Claims under the one-parent family payment scheme are processed from my Department's office in Sligo which also administers a range of other payments and benefits. In the case of one-parent family payments around 18,000 claims are received per year, equivalent to 350 per week. The time taken to process individual new claims varies significantly having regard to the difficulty or otherwise in establishing the circumstances in each case. Because of the nature of the scheme and the conditions which must be fulfilled, there can be delays in establishing entitlement, particularly in cases of separation. Generally speaking, applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed and such payment will normally continue until entitlement to one-parent family payment is determined. However, every effort is being made to process applications as quickly as possible and to minimise the time during which applicants receive these interim forms of support.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as recipients of the one-parent family payment are in a relatively young age bracket, they are more likely to move in and out of employment, education or training on a regular basis or to have other changes in their circumstances. Approximately 48,000 existing cases per year, or some 920 per week, have to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>It is intended to devolve the administration of the one-parent family payment scheme to the Department's network of local offices. This is being done primarily to develop improved employment support and training opportunities for single parents and it will also assist in reducing claim processing times through closer links with the local investigative officer network.</P>
      <P>Pending the devolving of claim processing to local offices, a re-organisation of the one-parent family payment administration is currently being undertaken to, <i>inter alia</i>, reduce delays in the processing of new claims. Every effort continues to be made to process claims from lone parents as quickly as possible and any delays which occur will not result in any loss of entitlements to the people concerned.</P>

      <Quest>the aspects of the 1997 Programme for Government relating to his Department which have not been implemented.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6625/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to inform the Deputy that substantial progress has been made by my Department over the past five years in implementing the key commitments in <Col N="744" /> both the Action Programme for the Millennium published in 1997 and the revised programme agreed in November 1999.</P>
      <P>Our stated objective is to build an inclusive society where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country. After five years we can point to numerous notable successes in promoting an inclusive society.</P>
      <P>We have made determined efforts to break cycles of poverty and deprivation and significantly the main National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS, goals, with an original target date of 2007, have now been achieved. The overall target, as revised in 1999, is to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor from 9 to 15% of the population to less than 5% by 2004 and we are well on our way to achieving this target.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we have committed ourselves to revising and renewing the National Anti-Poverty Strategy in consultation with the social partners. This revised strategy will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>We have recognised the need to deal decisively with the issue of welfare income adequacy. Significant improvements in social welfare schemes amounting to over &euro;3.3 billion, £2.6 billion, have been made over the past five years. Social welfare rates have improved significantly in real terms since we took office and payment dates for budgetary increases in rates have been brought forward each year and are now effective from the beginning of the tax year.</P>
      <P>As part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we have entered into a number of social inclusion commitments with the social partners. This programme provides that in the period up to 2003, all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 per week for the lower rates of payments.</P>
      <P>Not alone have we made substantial progress towards this PPF target for the lowest social welfare payments, we have almost reached this target this year and I have no doubt that it will be exceeded in the remaining budget before the end of the programme.</P>
      <P>In our Government programme we pledged to bring the old age pension levels up to £100 per week by 2002 to ensure that all old age pensions increased in line with average industrial earnings. The effect of the increases we have introduced over the past five budgets is that the rate of old age contributory pension, &euro;147.30, £116 per week, currently exceeds the £100 target and the rate of old age non-contributory pension now stands at &euro;134, £105.53, per week.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the old age contributory pension represented 27.5% of average industrial earnings. We have increased that each year to 31% in line to reach the National Pensions Initiative target of 34%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our action programme we are strongly committed to improving the position of people who take time out of the paid workforce to care for <Col N="745" /> children or sick relatives. We have substantially increased the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age with the aim of increasing the allowance, for the full old age pension rate over a number of budgets. In addition, under the homemaker's scheme, years spent out of the workforce caring for children or incapacitated people may be disregarded when calculating entitlement to old age contributory or retirement pension. The scheme is currently effective from 1994 and a maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way. I am committed in principle to making the existing scheme effective from an earlier date than 1994 and replacing the disregards system with actual credits. These and other issues, including the cost and administrative implications involved, will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions which will be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>One of our key priorities in the revised programme is to bring forward a programme to effectively address child poverty. Over the past five budgets we have provided substantial improvements in the rates of child benefit. We have already fulfilled our commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to move towards £100 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased threefold from £30 per month to £92.50 per month in the lower rate and from £39 to £116 in the higher rate of payment. This investment of substantial resources to child benefit reflects the serious commitment this Government has made to supporting those who are responsible for raising our children and in tackling child poverty.</P>
    <P>This Government fully recognises the valuable role of carers in our society. We have delivered on our commitments to relax the qualifying criteria for carer's allowance and to increase the value of the payment in real terms. We have introduced a wide range of increases both in terms of income supports and in terms of services provided. This is reflected in the increasing numbers of carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit which have increased since we took up office from 9,200 to some 19,500 and also are expected to reach 22,000 as a result of the improvements provided in budget 2002. Expenditure for carers has more than tripled from £36.5 million in 1997 to a projected &euro;179 million, £140.6 million, this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, I initiated a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care at the end of 2000. This study which is due to be completed shortly, will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs both in the community and in institutional care and the potential of the private sector or a combined public/private sector approach to develop new initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium attaches importance to maintaining the position of the family in Ireland as &ldquo;one of our strongest <Col N="746" /> national characteristics&rdquo;. In the first year of our term of office we published the findings of the Commission of the Family. The report is making a positive contribution to developing coherent, progressive and effective policies for families. In line with the commission's recommendations, we have established a family affairs unit in my Department and provided significant extra funding to the Family Mediation Service and to Marriage and Child Counselling and Family and Community Centres.</P>
    <P>In our revised programme we promised to establish the family mediation service on a statutory basis and develop a strong regional network of accessible counselling services. The Family Support Agency Bill, recently enacted, will lead to the establishment of a new agency &ndash; the Family Support Agency which will provide a comprehensive and coherent response for families who have need of support services. We have also committed ourselves to establishing 100 family and community centres and to develop local offices to provide family services as recommended by the commission. There are currently some 80 centres either established or approved for funding throughout the country providing locally based community support to families.</P>
    <P>Pilot family services projects to provide improved information services for families operate on a one-stop-shop basis in Cork, Finglas and Waterford. Some £12 million has been provided in the National Development Plan for the expansion of the projects over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Another key priority in this area relates to lone parents and the need for measures to support them and facilitate their return to the workplace. Last year I initiated a proactive programme for one-parent family payment recipients to ensure that they are aware of the employment, education and training opportunities available to them.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to localise the administration of the scheme from the Pension Services Office in Sligo to my Department's local offices. This move brings lone parents into closer contact on an ongoing basis with the various support services available in the Department's offices and will therefore be useful in promoting the programmes available to encourage lone parents back into education, training and employment. A pilot scheme has been initiated in my Department's Tallaght office.</P>
    <P>The back to education scheme has been improved over the years and the qualifying age under the scheme has been reduced from 21 to 18 years for people who have been in receipt of the one-parent family payment for at least six months and who have been out of the education system for two years.</P>
    <P>In 1997 we pledged to reduce the burden of PRSI and levies with a particular emphasis on helping those in low-paid employment. Since then we have reduced the employee rates of PRSI and levies by 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively, and increased the exemption limits so that employees earning less than £226 per week do not pay a <Col N="747" /> PRSI contribution and those earning less than £280 per week do not pay the health contribution.</P>
    <P>Funding is provided under the &ldquo;Scheme of Grants to Locally Based Community and Family Support Groups&rdquo;. Some 34 women's groups are currently in receipt of three year core funding with &euro;1.85 million committed in 2002.</P>
    <P>We undertook in our action programme to attack fraud and abuse of the social welfare system with the aim of freeing up resources to address real needs. Control savings have been achieved each year and ranged from £176 million in 1998 to £211 million in 2001.</P>
    <P>Legislation was also introduced in 1998 to improve the flow of information between certain public bodies to improve service and control fraud, by providing for the more widespread use of the PPSN number. It also specifies particular purposes for sharing of information between public bodies.</P>
    <P>The commitments in the action programme relevant to social welfare come under the following headings: the national anti-poverty strategy, increasing social welfare pensions, developing the family services, addressing child poverty, addressing the needs of carers, reducing PRSI and levies for low paid employees, funding women's voluntary agencies and attacking social welfare fraud and abuse.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made by my Department in all of these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion, namely to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" />The original objective of the telephone allowance was to provide an element of protection and security in their own homes for older people and people with disabilities who were either living alone or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency. A secondary objective of the scheme was to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
    <P>The free schemes act as an important support to encouraging care in the community. The proposal to extend telephone allowance to pensioners resident in nursing homes does not fit easily within the community care objectives of these schemes. Persons resident in nursing homes may already be in receipt of State support, either through the public health system or through a nursing home subvention. In addition, those living in nursing homes and other residential institutions have daily support and contact with other residents and nursing staff.</P>
    <P>The current arrangements for the free schemes are kept under review. Any changes in the arrangements, as the Deputies have proposed, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the context of overall Government priorities for the social welfare area.</P>

      <P>Since responsibility for the main means-tested payment for people with disabilities, i.e. the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, was transferred from the health boards to my Department in October 1996, a range of significant improvements, including improvements in the means-testing arrangements, have been introduced. As a consequence, there has been a substantial increase in the number of recipients of disability allowance &ndash; up from 34,500 in October 1996 to 58,061 at the end of January 2002, an increase of 68%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main improvements in the means-testing arrangements which have been provided for, and which also apply to the means-tested blind person's pension scheme, include substantial increases in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which may be disregarded for means test purposes. With the further increase announced in last December's budget, the level of this disregard will have almost tripled &ndash; up from &euro;44.70 to &euro;120.00. This disregard has also been extended to earnings from rehabilitative self-employment. There is also a major improvement in the method of assessing capital which was introduced in October 2000, with the first &euro;12,697 being disregarded &ndash; an increase of &euro;10,158 &ndash;<Col N="749" /> and the method of assessing capital above this level improved;</P>
    <P>Since April 2001 the full rate disability allowance is paid where the person's partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment. This improvements has resulted in weekly increases of between &euro; 44.44 and &euro; 58.41 for those affected.</P>
    <P>Up to &euro;190,461 from the proceeds of the sale of a person's residence is exempted for disability allowance and blind person's pension purposes, with effect from April 2001. In addition, the back to work scheme has been extended to recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension. Under this scheme a person is allowed to retain his or her weekly payment on a sliding scale in addition to his or her income from employment or self-employment. While significant improvements have been made in the means-tested payments for people with disabilities in recent years, it is nevertheless recognised that more needs to be done and I will continue to examine the potential for further improvements in this area, having regard to available resources and the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group was established to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments. The group was comprised of representatives of each of the social partners and relevant Government Departments.</P>
      <P>While it did not reach consensus on the issue, the majority of the group recommended that it would not be an unreasonable policy objective for the lowest social welfare payments to reach 27% of gross average industrial earnings by 2007. The recommendation added that this would not rule out setting a higher target, 30% of gross average industrial earnings, for example, in the context of a review process.</P>
      <P>The text of the majority recommendation also rightly recognises, however, that it is the Government of the day which must ultimately decide on the level of social welfare rates. It also recognises that there are budgetary, economic, incentive and other considerations which have to be balanced when deciding upon the appropriate level of social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there is considerable merit in raising all payments, as and when this is possible, <Col N="750" /> with the objective of ensuring a reasonable relationship, in due course, between the average living standards in the community and the level of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the report &ndash; and its majority recommendation which is similar to the INOU's call &ndash; was carefully considered in the context of the recent budget. Increases in the lowest welfare payments in budget 2002 were in line with the majority recommendation of the group.</P>
    <P>The future direction of social welfare rates is a matter which is being considered in the light of the report from the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, the consultations on the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS), representations from interested groups, and the underlying economic and social context. The Government's views in this regard will be elaborated on in the context of the revised NAPS, when it is formally launched jointly by the Taoiseach and me tomorrow.</P>

      <Quest>when the cash payment to asylum seekers, administered by his Department under the direct provision system, was last increased; the percentage by which social supplementary welfare allowance payments were increased in the same period; his plans for an increase in the amount; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers is met for the most part by the health board through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who arrived since 10 April 2000. They are provided with full board accommodation, including all meals and other services under the system of direct provision operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is &euro;19.05 per adult and &euro;9.52 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one-parent family payments, pensions and disability allowance. In addition, any asylum seeker with children is entitled to child benefit. The current monthly rates are &euro;85.71 for each of the first two children and &euro;109.20 for the third and sub<Col N="751" /> sequent children. These payment rates will increase to &euro;117.60 and &euro;147.30 respectively in April 2002.</P>
    <P>The allowances in payment to asylum seekers in direct provision have not increased since the direct provision system was introduced in April 2000. The maximum personal rate of supplementary welfare allowance in April 2000 was £72 per week, equivalent to &euro;91.42. The current maximum personal rate is &euro;118.80 representing a percentage increase of 30%.</P>
    <P>I established a working group in April 2000 to examine the issues relating to assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. Among the issues examined by the group are the existing arrangements for the payment of basic weekly supplementary welfare allowance to people who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs and the payment rate appropriate to asylum seekers in direct provision. To give a broad spread of expertise, the group comprises representatives from my Department and the Departments of Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Environment and Local Government, as well as a representative appointed by the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I understand that the working group will finalise its report very shortly. When I receive the report I will be in a position to consider the findings and recommendations of the working group and decide if it is appropriate to make changes in either the rate of payment to asylum seekers in direct provision or the manner in which these payments are made.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector was published by the Government on 13 September 2000. The White Paper marked the start of the Government's long-term strategy to develop and support the community and voluntary sector. It sets out the rationale for developing the relationship between the State and the sector and the principles which should underpin this relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A unique feature of the White Paper was the establishment of an implementation and advisory <Col N="752" /> group to oversee the implementation of the White Paper's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The group consists of six members from the voluntary and community sector and six from the statutory sector. A secretariat has been established within my Department to support the work of the group.</P>
    <P>The implementation and advisory group commenced work in July 2001 and has met on seven occasions to date in plenary session. Much of the detailed work of the committee is carried out by sub-commmittees formed to examine specific issues and report to the main group. The main matters considered by the group to date are as follows: following on from the recommendations of the White Paper, funding has been made available in 2002 to provide additional support to voluntary and community organisations as follows: funding to national federations and representative bodies &ndash; an amount of &euro;2,539,000 has been made available to provide support for national representative bodies in the community and voluntary sector. The scheme was advertised in November 2001 and applications are currently being assessed by the implementation and advisory group assessment committee.</P>
    <P>Funding for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector: funding of &euro;2,539,000 has been made available in 2002 to foster the availability of additional training and support services to the community and voluntary sector. This scheme will be advertised shortly.</P>
    <P>Legal and regulatory framework: responsibility for charity regulatory matters and the office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests transferred to my Department in July 2001. The Government is committed to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fundraising. In January 2002 consultants were appointed to assist in the process of reform which will include widespread public consultation.</P>
    <P>Research programme: the White Paper provides &euro;508,000 for a programme of research into the extent of community and voluntary activity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A sub-committee of the implementation and advisory group has been established to progress this research programme. Proposals are expected to be sought by advertisement in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Multiplicity of funding sources: a sub-committee of the group to examine issues relating to the multiplicity of sources of State funding and to consider a funding manual for the sector has been established and began its work in February 2002.</P>
    <P>Review: the White Paper provides for a formal review of the workings of the group after three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 308 together.</P>
      <P>Social protection, as defined by EUROSTAT, covers not only the income support schemes administered by my Department, but also health care, supports with housing and other social and family services. I will just deal with the income support aspects.</P>
      <P>The EUROSTAT report does not in fact say that Ireland's spending on social protection was just half that of the EU average but that Ireland's spending, as a percentage of its GDP, was below the EU average. This is due to Ireland being different from other EU countries in a number of areas which have a major bearing on this indicator.</P>
      <P>This can be illustrated firstly by the situation of the EU as a whole. In the three year period 1990 to 1993 EU social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose on average by over 3% from 25.4% to 28.9%. This was the result during that period of the slower rate of economic growth and as a result, a slower rise in GDP, and rising unemployment resulting in higher social protection expenditure on unemployment. Over the five year period 1994 to 1998 the percentage for the EU actually declined slightly to 27.7%, due to renewed economic growth and an actual decline in social protection expenditure in some countries, some of which would be attributable to the decline in unemployment.</P>
      <P>For Ireland in 1990 expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP was 18.7%. This rose to 20.5% in 1993, and then declined to 16.1% in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes mirrored the developments just described in other EU countries, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries. Annual rates of growth ranged from 8% to 11% in the period <Col N="754" /> 1994 to 2000 and levels of unemployment declined from 14.3% to less than 4% over the same period. The sizeable increase in Ireland's GDP was far above that of any of our EU neighbours, and the EU as a whole, where growth averaged at approximately 2% for the same period.</P>
    <P>However, there was no reduction in the level of actual social protection expenditure in Ireland during this period, but a substantial increase. Expenditure on social protection in Ireland per head of population rose by 50% in real terms between 1990 and 1999, the second highest in the EU over this period. This fact is acknowledged in the report, which also shows that this expenditure was more than double that of the average increase of 24% for the EU15 as a whole. The indicator masks this substantial increase in social protection expenditure in Ireland because of the high level of the growth in GDP.</P>
    <P>Levels of social protection expenditure are also affected by the numbers requiring benefits and services. I have already referred to the substantial fall in unemployment. In most developed countries, the highest single item of social protection expenditure is on pensions for the elderly. In 1999 those aged 65 and over in Ireland as a percentage of those in the working age group was just 17%, the lowest in the EU and a full 7% behind the EU average of 24%. As a result expenditure on old age and survivors' pensions in 1998 represented just 25% of total social protection expenditure in Ireland compared, for example, to 64% in Italy. This means that a much bigger proportion of social protection expenditure is available for other categories of claimants than is the case in most other EU countries.</P>
    <P>Other factors which have a significant bearing on the amount of expenditure are the extent to which the State provides supplementary pensions, childcare and elder care and the way benefits are taxed. Lower state involvement, as in Ireland, means lower social protection expenditure. The EU report referred to by the Deputy also gives the situation in 1999, and does not take account of the increases in expenditure since then particularly in relation to child benefit and pensions.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years Ireland has been different than the EU average in terms of its high rates of economic growth and its low level of unemployment. This, coupled with the lowest elderly population in the EU and the fact that it relies less on State provision in a number of key areas such as supplementary pensions and child and elder care services, inevitably results in Ireland's social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP being below the EU average. This will change in time as economic growth and unemployment levels fluctuate and the population ages.</P>
    <P>The policy of improving the standard of living of all those dependent on social protection will continue as resources permit guided by the national anti-poverty strategy and the new EU process of national action plans but the degree of progress that can be achieved in this area in all <Col N="755" /> countries is dependent on continuing to achieve economic growth and maintaining a low level of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report Family Formation in Ireland. Trends, data needs and implications was commissioned by my Department under the families research programme, which I launched in 1999 to support research into all areas of family life to inform the future development of policy and services.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Family Formation in Ireland&rdquo; is a clear example of the benefits of having a quality research programme. This excellent report has analysed the major recent trends in family formation in Ireland and drawn out the implications for the future direction of family policy. The researchers have provided an overview of issues faced by families in modern Ireland, concentrating on three key areas; fertility decline, lone parenthood and changes in household and family size.</P>
      <P>The messages from the research signal the continuing challenge to policy makers to meet the changing needs of families' today including the need to invest in support for large families, and the need to strengthen and support marriage and relationships and prevent breakdown.</P>
      <P>These messages validate this Government's Families First approach to policy and services development which encompasses a range of measures and programmes to protect the family, support the stability of family life and prevent marital breakdown and address the effects of divorce on families.</P>
      <P>The principal recommendation in the report, Family Formation in Ireland, relates to improving the range and accessibility of information being collected at present and addressing shortcomings in existing data collection. The prospective National Longitudinal Study of Children and the Families Research Programme are mentioned as significant initiatives to improve the knowledge base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits of a national longitudinal study, which would follow a large cohort of children from birth through to adulthood, was highlighted by the Commission on the Family in its report to Government &ldquo;Strengthening Families for Life&rdquo; in 1998 and echoed in the National Children's Strategy, &ldquo;Our Children, Their Lives,&rdquo; published by the Government in 2000. Such a study would be a major undertaking but the information it would <Col N="756" /> yield could be invaluable in terms of what it would tell us about how children from different backgrounds fare out in the longer term and how the State can better support families.</P>
    <P>A design brief, commissioned by my Department, together with the Department of Health and Children, setting out what would be involved in undertaking a major study of children in Ireland has recently been completed by a consortium of researchers in Ireland. It is my intention, with the Minister for Health and Children, to bring the proposals to Government for consideration within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the NESF report on the reintegration of prisoners into the community. I am very conscious of the difficulties which ex-prisoners can face when returning to the community and I recognise the important part employment and training play in helping ex-prisoners take their place in society.</P>
      <P>My Department administers a broad range of employment support services which are designed to assist and encourage the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups, including ex-offenders, to return to work, training or further education.</P>
      <P>I was concerned to see that the report indicates that some ex-prisoners are unaware of the comprehensive range of supports which my Department offers. I have asked my Department to immediately pursue the production of a comprehensive information package on prisoners' options on leaving prison with the relevant Departments, Comhairle and voluntary bodies, as recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>In addition, as an immediate way of providing information and advice on the range of employment supports available, my Department is liaising with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the provision of informational literature on the back to work and back to education schemes to prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schemes have been highly successful since their introduction some years ago and have encouraged over 100,000 people back into employment or training. As an added help to ex-prisoners, periods spent in prison can be used to facilitate access to these schemes. It is estimated <Col N="757" /> that about ten to 12 ex-prisoners avail of this easy access per annum.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that improved and user-friendly information on these programmes will be available in every prison in the country in the near future. My Department will also examine ways of developing more proactive links with prisoners through the nationwide job facilitator network, which is a very important element in the employment support programme and which is there to support and assist those who are experiencing difficulties in gaining a foothold in the workplace.</P>
    <P>My Department's existing employment support programmes coupled with a wide range of supports and interventions currently available through other State agencies can provide good support to ex-offenders. My Department will make every effort to ensure that its programmes and services are publicised to those who need them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent publication of the report from the Combat Poverty Agency referred to in the questions. The report examines data from the living in Ireland surveys over a five year period from 1994 to 1998 and illustrates mobility between unemployment and other labour market situations during this time.</P>
      <P>In this regard it complements work currently under way in my Department to identify and address the characteristics, and their relative impacts, associated with long-term unemployment. In particular it complements the findings of the report Employability and its Relevance for Management of the Live Register, commissioned by my Department and published by the ESRI in May 2001.</P>
      <P>While the base of the living in Ireland survey is not necessarily the same as customers on the live register, both reports highlight issues such as age, gender health, education and previous work experience as having a bearing on the labour market status of an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" />Both reports also call for a combined effort to be made in putting preventative measures in place to prevent the drift into long-term unemployment and for better targeting of interventions. In line with these recommendations my Department has further developed the strong links which exist with agencies such as FÁS, vocational education committees and the National Adult Literacy Agency to assist customers make the progression from the live register to employment or further education and training.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendation that a system of profiling be established, this echoes a recommendation in the ESRI report on employability commissioned by my Department. In the employability report it is recognised that a longitudinal survey is required to assemble characteristics associated with unemployed people and their differential durations on the live register, with the relative impact of each characteristic, before an accurate profiling model can be developed.</P>
    <P>A survey of this type is currently under way in my Department's local office in Galway in conjunction with the ESRI. This survey involves updating data obtained during a comprehensive survey of customers at that office in June 2000. The ESRI will examine data emerging from this process and develop a statistical model of characteristics likely to lead a person to remain on the live register.</P>
    <P>The consultants expect to be in a position to report on this process by mid-2002 whereupon the model will be tested against a control sample. Depending on outcomes consultation may be required with other Departments, relevant agencies and the social partners.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged, as part of its employment support programme, in identifying and referring people on the live register who require a range of targeted supports to help them make the transition to work or further training and education. The types of services which my Department's job facilitators offer are broadly in line with the recommendations in both reports.</P>

      <P>Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision on a claim to social welfare payment made by a deciding officer of my Department or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowance has a statutory right to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" />Provision for the operation of the social welfare appeals process is already in legislation. The statutory basis for the system is contained in Part VII of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and in regulations made under the provisions of that Act. This legislation provides for the appointment of appeals officers and for various other procedures and powers necessary for the operation of the system. The legislation also outlines the powers and duties of the chief appeals officer.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals process is administered by the social welfare appeals office which, since 1990, operates independently of the Department.</P>
    <P>The appeals officers have always been independent in the exercise of their functions, a fact which has been recognised and commented on by the courts. However in 1990, in line with a commitment in the Programme for National Recovery, the social welfare appeals office itself was established as an independent and separately managed office with a separate executive. Prior to 1990, appeals were made to the Minister and administered by the Department. Since 1990, appeals are made directly to the chief appeals officer and are administered by the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and fair consideration. The system is accessible and informal which gives it significant advantages in terms of providing the best possible service for social welfare customers.</P>

      <P>The old age contributory pension has traditionally been paid at a higher rate than other payments made to those over 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>However, I am committed to bringing the rate of the widow(er)'s contributory pension for those over 66 years of age into line with that of the old age contributory pension. A number of special increases granted in recent budgets has seen the gap between the two payments narrow considerably. After the increases granted in budget 2002 the maximum weekly rate of the old age contributory pension for someone under 80 years of age now stands at &euro;147.30. The over 66 rate for the widow(er)'s contributory pension is &euro;144.80, that is, a difference of only &euro;2.50.</P>
      <P>The cost of increasing the widow(er)'s contributory pension to the rate of the old age contributory pension is estimated at &euro;9 million for those over 66 years of age. If widows and widowers under 66 years of age are also included the estimated cost rises to approximately &euro;52 million.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to an article published recently in the journal of the Institute of Public Administration, which draws on material from a qualitative study undertaken in 1998 of patterns of money management in welfare-dependent households with children. The article discusses decisions on food and diet made by 50 mothers in such households.</P>
      <P>The article comments on the composition, in so far as it refers to food items, of the basic deprivation index which is used, in conjunction with income poverty lines, to measure consistent poverty. It argues that the index &ldquo;refers to a basic minimum and excludes any consideration of choice, changed eating patterns or child related foods&rdquo; and that it is therefore in conflict with the national health promotion strategy, which encourages choice and variety.</P>
      <P>However, the purpose of the deprivation index, which has been independently formulated by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is not to measure a basic minimum set by Government or by any other agency but to identify those excluded, due to lack of resources, from availing of particular items or activities that people themselves consider necessary for avoidance of deprivation. The inclusion of food items in the list of deprivation indicators reflects the value that people themselves place on providing for their dietary needs and those of their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI regularly reviews the composition of the deprivation indices, and have found that, for the present, the current list of indicators provides a robust basis for the measurement of consistent poverty. Since the study was conducted, the level of consistent poverty has continued to fall and we are well on the way to achieving our current target of below 5% of population by 2004. Moreover, in the same period the Government has <Col N="762" /> invested heavily in increasing the level of welfare payments and, most importantly, in significantly increasing the level of child benefit payments, to the benefit of all households with children.</P>
    <P>The study represents a very useful addition to the knowledge base which can be drawn on in considering the adequacy of welfare payments. The social welfare benchmarking and indexation working group which reported last year drew attention to the need for enhanced research in the area of income adequacy and identified nutritional surveys as one specific area worthy of greater attention.</P>
    <P>The study also highlights the continuing need to assist low-income families in providing sufficient and varied food to meet all their nutritional requirements. In this regard, I should mention that under the cardiovascular health strategy my Department has responsibility for the development of innovative pilot projects and research in this area. Preliminary discussions regarding the pilot projects are currently taking place.</P>

      <QRef>[6597/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of rumours circulating that asylum seekers and refugees are in receipt of payments from the social welfare system which Irish citizens do not get in respect of items such as cars. These rumours are untrue and without foundation. I agree with the Deputy that they are used to promote resentment against asylum seekers and refugees and for that reason, I am glad to refute these stories today.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, asylum seekers generally do not have the right to work while awaiting a decision on their claim for asylum. Their income maintenance needs are met for the most part by the health boards through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who arrived since 10 April 2000. They are provided with full board accommodation, including meals and other services under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is &euro;19.05 per <Col N="763" /> adult and &euro;9.52 per child to provide for personal requisites.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards. Families with children receive child benefit on the same basis as any other family.</P>
    <P>All asylum seekers who arrived before April 2000 and some who arrived since then live outside the direct provision system. In these cases, they may receive the full standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, subject to the same conditions as any other recipients.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided that asylum seekers who applied for asylum before 26 July 1999 and who had completed 12 months in the asylum process but whose cases had not been decided were allowed to seek employment.</P>
    <P>In addition, any person who has been through the asylum process and has been granted refugee status can also seek employment. If they are unable to secure employment they will qualify for assistance from my Department on the same basis as any Irish citizen for example, they may qualify for unemployment assistance if they fulfil the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work and if their means are below the qualifying limit.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that the social welfare entitlements of asylum seekers and refugees are not any more generous than those of Irish people. It is important to remember also that every non-national is not a refugee or asylum seeker. In fact, the majority of non-nationals currently residing in the State are not asylum seekers or refugees. They are mainly EU citizens or people from other parts of the world who have been granted work permits and who are in employment. In this regard, over 54,000 work permits were issued to non-nationals in 2000 and 2001. There are also significant numbers of non-nationals who are studying in this country. Whether studying or working, they are people with their own financial resources to dispose of as they see fit.</P>
    <P>With regard to plans to combat misleading stories about non-nationals, the Government decided to implement a national anti-racism awareness programme. In February 2001, a high level steering group was established by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to implement the programme in partnership with his Department. The awareness programme was formally launched by the Taoiseach on 25 October 2001. A number of regional launches have been organised in the months since then, the most recent being in Cork on Thursday last, 21 February.</P>
    <P>The aim of the programme is to contribute to creating the conditions for building an inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland where <Col N="764" /> racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued. Grants have been given to local projects throughout the State to raise awareness. Details of the programme are contained in information packs which have been widely distributed to the public. More detailed media packs have been prepared for the information of the media.</P>
    <P>The promotion of a tolerant inclusive society is not just a matter for Government. We all have a role to play as individuals and in the various organisations in which we take part.</P>

      <P>The payment of additional moneys, in excess of statutory entitlements, for workers who have lost their jobs is primarily a matter for agreement between employers and employees. In the two previous cases, additional payments were made to former employees under specific statutory provisions. In the case of Irish Hospitals Trust the workers had been, in effect, working on behalf of the State for many years by raising funds for the development of hospitals. Special legislation was passed by the Oireachtas in June 2000 to facilitate making payments of &euro;25,400 to certain former employees of this company. Under the Irish Shipping Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Act, 1994, the then Department of the Marine made <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum payments totalling some &euro;4 million in respect of 313 former employees or their representatives. In the current case, the workers have received their statutory redundancy entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 2001, and there is no legislative basis under the Acts for making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the employees.</P>

    <P>The total unemployment figure for Leitrim for January 2002 is 1,144, which is a decrease of 128, or over 10%, on the corresponding figure for January 2001.</P>
    <P>Since the report by the task force which I set up following the closure of Ballinamore Textiles in 1998, there has been a wide range of activities by the State development agencies aimed at stimulating enterprise development in Leitrim and providing training and retraining for workers affected by job losses. The county is now receiving priority attention as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creation. The number of overseas companies visiting Leitrim on IDA Ireland itineraries has increased. The MBNA centre in Carrick-on-Shannon has exceeded its original target of 300 jobs with current employment at 370. The company is hoping to expand its Leitrim operation with a sizeable increase in employment. Also, IDA Ireland has been working closely with existing companies in the county to invest and increase employment. The construction of a new 24,000 sq. ft. advance building in Carrick-on-Shannon is nearing completion and is being marketed by IDA.</P>
    <P>In continuing to promote the attraction and development of indigenous industry in Leitrim, <Col N="767" /> Enterprise Ireland is working with client companies in the county and encouraging them to grow and develop, particularly in export markets, encouraging companies from outside to set up in Leitrim and promoting the establishment of high-growth businesses. The Leitrim County Enterprise Board provides support to promote small enterprise development. The board is also involved in a number of other initiatives, such as providing support for researching import substitution possibilities and the training of entrepreneurs in the start-up phase. In view of the fact that the Leitrim County Development Board is developing a plan for the county, and given also the combined activity of the development agencies in enterprise development in County Leitrim, I do not consider it necessary to set up a task force for the county.</P>

      <P>Government policy as operated by the national development agencies, specifically Forfás, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, has been to encourage the growth of manufacturing and internationally traded services and to do so in a balanced way with regard to the regional spread of activity. This strategy is based on developing the competitiveness and capability of indigenous industry, and enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for international investment. Moving up the value chain and developing Ireland as a centre for knowledge-based activities are key features of the strategy. Regional development objectives are an integral part of the strategy moving forward.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in relation to the employment situation in County Leitrim. I wish to emphasise that the Government, through the enterprise development agencies, is committed to ensuring an equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. In particular, the Border, midlands and west region, which includes County Leitrim, is a priority area for employment promotion by the agencies concerned  &ndash;  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.</P>
      <P>The latest CSO live register analysis shows that those claiming unemployment benefits in the north-west region, counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo, fell from 17,822 in March 1997 to 13,347 at the end of 2001, a drop of 25%. To maintain this trend, the development agencies are continuing to be particularly proactive in the region. The number of jobs created by companies assisted by these agencies in County Leitrim over the past five years, 1997-2001, is set out in tabular form below.</P>

    <P>Leitrim is a priority area for IDA Ireland which continues to market the location for new inward <Col N="770" /> investment. Over recent years the county has seen major new investment from overseas companies such as Masonite, MBNA and Eaton Automotive. IDA Ireland is in the process of developing a new advance facility in Carrick-on-Shannon and this building will be used to assist in the marketing of the location. IDA Ireland is currently involved with the Leitrim County Development Board, in the development of a comprehensive seven-year plan for the county with the aim of ensuring that the county is well placed to secure new inward investment. IDA Ireland is also continuing to work closely with Leitrim County Council to enhance the infrastructure in the county.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to be committed to supporting the development of new enterprises with a view to the creation of more jobs in County Leitrim, taking action across a wide range of initiatives. Specifically, in recent years, Enterprise Ireland has been involved in facilitating the development of community enterprise centres in Mohill, Manorhamilton, and Carrick-on-Shannon. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has facilitated clients to purchase industrial land from IDA Ireland with a view to creating more enterprise space, including companies and groups in Carrick-on-Shannon, Rooskey, Ballinamore and Manorhamilton. Enterprise Ireland also continues to approve investment in client companies in Leitrim, amounting to &euro;381,058 investment in 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the MicroEnterprise measure of the BMW Regional Operational Programme 2000-2006, the Leitrim County Enterprise Board provides support to micro-enterprises in County Leitrim, through investment in assets, employment and feasibility studies managerial training, enterprise education and women-in-business initiatives. In 2001, Leitrim CEB supported the creation of 42 new jobs in enterprises employing fewer than ten people and expenditure by Leitrim CEB during 2001 amounted to &euro;421,553.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 100, 106 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many firms are facing and of the problems this is creating for them. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents me and the Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of the September 11 attacks in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, which had a significant presence in the Irish market. An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>
      <P>A workplace safety group has been established with a view to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and, to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The group is developing proposals at present designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third insurance framework directives were adopted by the EU some years ago, as part of the completion of the internal market in relation to insurance services. Since their transposition into Irish law, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home <Col N="772" /> country authorisation and supervision. Further regulatory measurers are not under consideration at present. Increases in insurance costs may be a contributory factor in the trading difficulties being experienced by some businesses at present but there may be other factors specific to particular cases. I encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example, by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the covers included in policies is actually required.</P>

      <P>The work permits section is currently processing applications received approximately three months ago, compared with an average waiting period of eight weeks in late 2001. The processing time for work permit applications has risen due to the unprecedented number of applications that continue to be received in the Department. The number of work permit applications increased from an average of over 350 per week in 2000 to over 825 per week last year. The level of applications continued to climb during the year and in December alone, an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received.</P>
      <P>New FÁS procedures were introduced from the beginning of this year and this has resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received. In January 2002 the figure was down to an average of 325 complete and valid applications per week. Increases in staff resources and overtime have facilitated the issue of over 36,000 work permits last year compared with some 18,000 in the year 2000. The Department is continuing to examine options for significantly reducing the processing time for the issue of work permits.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Department to process applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. Assuming that the applications are completed correctly and are otherwise in order, processing time will take approximately 12 weeks from the date of receipt of the applications.</P>
      <P>The processing time for work permit applications has risen due to the unprecedented number of applications received in the Department, especially in November and December 2001. The number of work permit applications increased from an average of over 350 per week in 2000 to over 825 per week last year. The level of applications climbed during the year and in December alone, an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received. New procedures were introduced with effect from 2 January 2002, and this has resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received. The average number of complete and valid applications received for the month of January 2002 was 325 applications per week. While the staff numbers in the work permits section was increased by 50% last year in an effort to reduce processing time, the very large increase in applications meant that the waiting period could not be reduced. Nevertheless, the staff in the section issued 36,436 permits in 2001 compared with 18,000 in 2000.</P>

      <P>The issue of job creation is a day to day operational issue for the development agencies under the aegis of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, have a direct role. The figures requested by the Deputy on job losses and job creations are not yet available. The Forfás annual employment survey which gives details of all jobs created and lost by the development agencies is carried out in November of each year. The number of notified individual redundancies under the Redundancy Payment Acts, 1967 to 1991, for County Mayo from 1 to 31 January 2002 was 17. No figures are yet available for February. It should be noted that notified redundancies do not necessarily result in actual job losses. The job losses should be seen in the context of the worldwide slowdown, the incidence of foot and mouth disease, the downturn in the ICT sector and the tragic events of 11 September in the United States of America.</P>
      <P>The strategies of the enterprise development agencies are now firmly fixed on building, and providing the infrastructure for, high value-added and knowledge-intensive industries in Mayo. There will continue to be challenges in the year ahead and I am confident that, going forward, the Government's policies will be successful in minimising the effects of the difficulties experienced in 2001 with new jobs continuing to be created across a wide range of sectors.</P>

To date, six overseas companies have visited the facility. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has circulated details of the facility to 20 of its expansion oriented client companies.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is targeting the following options to seek a new project: a new greenfield project from overseas; an expansion-led project from the existing base of overseas companies in Ireland that may require a new building-location; and a detailed re-targeting of companies that visited Cork recently. Details of the facility have been sent to these companies to encourage them to include the GSI building in their location analyses. The key target sectors are: pharmaceuticals-medical devices; international services; and information and communications technologies.</P>

      <P>Participation in community employment is normally for a period of one to a maximum of three years as the primary objective of the programme is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. In August 2001 I announced new flexibility arrangements for the future operation of CE which allows FÁS discretion to extend, on a case by case <Col N="776" /> basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects. In the case of people aged over 50 years, the three year cap on participation has been removed where people in this age group, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment. For such participants, FÁS now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>The issue of job creation is a day to day operational issue for the development agencies under the aegis of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, have a direct role. The Finn Valley area of County Donegal includes areas administered by Údarás na Gaeltachta, for which my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, has responsibility. However, I am pleased to say that the number of people on the live register in the Finn Valley area has actually decreased by 101 in January 2002.</P>
      <P>As far as the agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Donegal County Enterprise Board, are concerned these agencies are committed to ensuring an equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. In particular, the Border, midlands and west region, which includes County Donegal, is a priority area for employment promotion. IDA Ireland, the agency under the aegis of my Department charged with the attraction of overseas industry to Ireland, has committed itself to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. As part of IDA Ireland's regional agenda for the north west region, the agency has put in place a programme to encourage the development of infrastructure, skills and education in the region to enhance its attractiveness for new inward investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, significant developments in Donegal will impact positively on the Finn Valley region, as it is located approximately 20 to 30 minutes from Letterkenny, which is the main focus of IDA's activity in Donegal. Among the projects secured for the north west region in recent times are; PacifiCare Health Systems &ndash; expansion with an additional 160 jobs; Prudential Insurance Company of America &ndash; 300 additional jobs; Sterling Fluid Systems &ndash; 16 jobs; Kirchhoff Ireland &ndash; expansion with additional 25 jobs; Interventional Technologies &ndash; additional 90 jobs <Col N="777" /> in Letterkenny; Claddagh Group &ndash; 35 jobs &ndash; in Buncrana; and Eire Limited &ndash; 15 jobs &ndash; in Ballyshannon. In addition, Abbott Ireland has recently announced two major projects in Donegal town and Sligo creating 190 new jobs.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, which has responsibility for the development of the indigenous sector, has also been active in the Finn Valley area. Specifically it approved funds for the following: Convoy Community Enterprise Centre assisted in 1996-97 with funds of &euro;98,500 to develop 22 units which are currently fully occupied; Lifford Enterprise Centre assisted in 1995-96 with grant aid of &euro;101,000; St. Johnston Community Enterprise Centre assisted in 1996-97 with grant aid of &euro;82,500 plus and also fully occupied; and Raphoe Development Company Limited approved &euro;62,000 in March 2000 to build a new enterprise centre with four units in the area. This group is currently developing an additional proposal in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland to develop more enterprise space.</P>
    <P>The number of new jobs supported by Donegal County Enterprise Board during 2001 was 99 and the third highest of all counties in Ireland, at a 20% increase on the prior base level. As the Finn Valley area has the highest concentration of enterprises in the county, I am confident that the area is attracting its due proportion of enterprise support and new employment.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the order apply to the issue by the regional fisheries boards of salmon fishing licences for fishing engines other than rod and line.

      <P>Arrangements for attendance at St. Patrick's Day celebrations are not yet fully finalised. However, the Government currently expects that Ministers will represent it at important events promoting Ireland throughout the United States, including Boston and New York; Britain, including Scotland; Canada; Mexico; Europe, including Norway and France; Australia; New Zealand; South Africa; and Asia, including Hong Kong and Malaysia. I understand that information has also been requested from individual Ministers regarding their plans. In my own case, I will not be fulfilling St. Patrick's Day-related engagements abroad this year but will be attending the European Council summit in Barcelona on 15 and 16 March.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department is monitoring developments in Zimbabwe very closely, particularly those affecting the welfare of Irish citizens. The embassy in South Africa, which is accredited to Zimbabwe, maintains regular con<Col N="780" /> tact with Irish citizens by telephone and e-mail, as well as through visits to Harare by embassy officials. The embassy is also in regular contact with the embassies of the other EU member states in Harare. As a precaution, contingency plans are being developed to cope with an emergency and the Deputy may be assured that, should the situation in Zimbabwe warrant it, my Department will take all possible steps, in co-operation with our EU partners, to protect the safety and welfare of Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from the previous questions to which I have replied, the Government remains very concerned about the situation in West Papua, or Irian Jaya, as it is now known. I am aware of the outstanding questions about the circumstances surrounding the 1969 Act of Free Choice in Irian Jaya and the role of the UN in that process.</P>
      <P>On whether the matter should be revisited, as I have made clear previously, Ireland was not a party to the 1969 Act and it is not within the Government's power to re-examine the outcome of the Act. On the question of a possible UN review of the events of 1969, this would be a matter for the UN Secretariat and the UN Secretary General. Procedurally, re-opening the issue would require the support of UN member states.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding from our mission to the UN that, at present, there appears to be no significant support among UN member states for a review of the 1969 decision. There is no intention on the secretariat's part to re-open the issue. Furthermore, there is concern that such a review may prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the Government authorities in Jakarta and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am increasingly aware of reports of ongoing human rights abuses in Irian Jaya, and in particular about allegations of military police involvement in such violations. This issue has been taken up at EU level and last year the 15 Foreign Ministers called on the Indonesian Government to further strengthen democracy and human rights, in particular, civilian control and democratic accountability of the police and armed forces. The issue was further raised by the EU with members of the new Indonesian Government in <Col N="781" /> August 2001, including with the Foreign Minister, the Minister for People's Welfare, and the Vice-President of the Republic. As part of its proposal in September 2001, to develop a political dialogue with the Indonesian Government, the EU highlighted human rights as an area for discussion and, in particular, the issue of civilian control over the military.</P>
    <P>In November last year, the EU reacted promptly to express deep concern at the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Mr. Theys Eluay, chairman of the Papua Presidium Council, in Irian Jaya. The EU urged the Indonesian authorities to clarify the circumstances of the murder and to bring its perpetrators to justice as soon as possible. As a follow-through, EU heads of mission in Jakarta are planning to undertake a fact-finding mission to the region next month in order to witness at first hand the situation there. This visit will also demonstrate the growing concern among EU member states to ensure the protection of human rights defenders in the region. At UN level, Ireland is currently preparing for the 58th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which begins on 18 March in Geneva, where the EU plans to raise the human rights situation in Indonesia.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government of Iraq has ordered medical supplies under the food for oil Programme from the EU or other sources in the past six months to deal with the health and medical needs of children in Iraq; the estimated numbers of children who have died in hospitals in Iraq due to medical needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government consistently advocates the rapid delivery of essential humanitarian supplies under the United Nations oil for food programme. The programme, which is administered by the United Nations office of the Iraq programme, is the international co-ordinating mechanism for meeting the humanitarian and other essential needs of the people of Iraq.</P>
      <P>In December 2001, the Iraqi Government submitted a proposed distribution plan for humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, under the programme. In January 2002, this plan was agreed with the UN. The plan, which amounts to a total of US$4,432 million, covers a beneficiary population of 26.3 million Iraqi people, including 698,279 children below the age of one. Under it, US$10 million has been allocated specifically for nutritional support for pregnant and lactating mothers. With approximately 50,000 births per month, the allocated funds are considered sufficient to meet the additional food requirements of this vulnerable group. Medical supplies are a particularly important part of the humanitarian aid which the international community has agreed to provide. The medical sector has been allocated US$178 million, divided equally between the provision of medicine and medical supplies and the rehabilitation of hospitals and equipment. In addition, US$44 million has been allocated for the rehabilitation of the health infrastructure in Iraq's three northern governorates.</P>
      <P>Water and sanitation are other areas of critical importance to children's health. US$700 million has been provided to help improve water and sanitation, with US$195 million directed at improving the food-handling sector. Similarly, substantial allocations have been made to the broader agriculture, education, irrigation, housing, transport and electricity sectors. A special allocation of US$309 million has been agreed to cover emergency needs in housing, health facilities, water, sanitation, mine action and other key areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assistance for children is also provided from EU sources. The European Union has been a major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq, providing over &euro;270 million in aid since 1991. More than &euro;12 million of this total was provided during 2001 when an additional &euro;27 million was provided by EU member states, including &euro;310,000 from Ireland. To date, more than $29 billion worth of contracts for humanitarian supplies have been approved under the oil for food programme. Humanitarian supplies worth $18.3 billion have been delivered to Iraq, while another $10.9 billion worth are in the process of preparation or delivery. The oil for food programme is currently in its eleventh phase which runs from 1 December 2001 to 29 May 2002. So far during this phase, Iraq has exported 114.1 million barrels of oil for an estimated revenue of &euro;2 billion. As of this month, US$1.9 billion and further substantial unused funds are available under the United <Col N="783" /> Nations Iraq account for the purchase of humanitarian supplies by the Government of Iraq.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Security Council resolutions, the Government of Iraq has the necessary authorisation to export unlimited amounts of oil in exchange for the importation of a wide range of humanitarian goods. The UN Secretary General has confirmed on a number of occasions that the improved funding level for the oil for food programme means that the Government of Iraq is in a position to address the nutritional and health needs of the Iraqi people, particularly those of children. Estimates of the number of children who have died in hospitals in Iraq due to medical needs vary greatly depending on their source. In general terms, the lack of reliable information has made it extremely difficult to estimate the levels of child mortality in Iraq over recent years.</P>
    <P>Along with our UN and EU partners and in conjunction with the Iraqi authorities, the Government will continue to strongly support practical measures aimed at ensuring the delivery of assistance to children and other vulnerable sectors of the population in Iraq. The Government believes that the application of a more targeted sanctions regime is the best means of ensuring both that the primacy of the Security Council resolutions is respected and that humanitarian concerns are addressed. We are hopeful that this will convince Iraq to accept fully its international obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions and to meet all of its responsibilities and commitments, while minimising the suffering of the Iraqi people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken careful note of President Bush's State of the Union address. The Irish Government shares his concerns regarding the ongoing threat from terrorist networks. We also take the view that there are varying degrees of concern in relation to the ambitions of North Korea, Iraq and Iran to acquire and develop weapons of mass destruction. It is difficult to argue with President Bush's observation that North Korea is a country arming itself with missiles and weapons of mass destruction while its citizens starve. Nor can we dispute that the Iraqi Government has used chemical weapons against its own citizens or that it refuses access to UN weapons inspectors. In relation to Iran, there are concerns about the efforts of unelected elements to frustrate the intentions of the government and to stand in the way of the democratic will of the people. However, a number of EU representatives, myself included, have questioned the accuracy of the term &ldquo;axis of evil&rdquo; as we do not see a clear <Col N="784" /> equivalence between the positions of those countries.</P>
      <P>The Government very much hopes that there will be no extension of military action beyond that undertaken in Afghanistan. We will make every effort to ensure that any further effort to eradicate international terrorism is achieved through peaceful means. I note that President Bush and other leading figures in his Administration have denied that there is an immediate intention to extend the current scope of US military action.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that any difficulties between the US and the countries cited by President Bush should be resolved by dialogue. In particular, we call on Iraq to allow the early return of UN weapons inspectors. At the same time as tackling international terrorism directly, it is equally necessary to address those extreme conditions, endemic in so many parts of the world, such as abject poverty and acute injustice, which can give rise to conflict and terrorism.</P>

      <P>According to An Post, the direct mail industry in Ireland is estimated to have grown at an exponential rate over the last decade at between 20% and 25% above the European average, albeit from a much lower base. However, direct mail in Ireland is still well below European levels. Based on research undertaken in 1998 for the An Post group, the average Irish consumer could expect to receive 26 items of direct mail per annum, while a British consumer could receive 68 items, Belgian, 106, Swiss, 211 and German 74 items per annum.</P>
      <P>An Post is not in a position to estimate the true extent of direct mail items entering or leaving the country as it has no way of telling the content of any mail piece. By its very nature, direct mail is individually addressed and is indistinguishable from an ordinary letter. Furthermore, no information is available on the level of direct mail outside the reserved area being carried by competitors of An Post or the costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>The 30 day holding period for purchases of susceptible animals, which was introduced initially in the context of the foot and mouth emergency, is intended to slow down animal movement in order to limit the risk of spread of disease. The measure applies to all parties engaged in the movement of animals, not simply to livestock dealers and agents. Throughout the period of its operation, the measure has been subject to continuous reappraisal and review. In my recent announcement on the ending of certain FMD related controls and restrictions, I indicated that the measure would be kept in place and I also undertook that it would be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as dealing operations are concerned, a number of exemptions to the 30 day rule are available to assist registered dealers and agents in the conduct of their business. These exemptions were extended at the beginning of this month and, subject to certain conditions, allow dealers and agents to purchase cattle from marts and sell them privately within the 30 days and to purchase cattle privately and sell them onwards at a mart or privately within the 30 day period. Other exemptions apply in respect of animals moved to <Col N="790" /> slaughter plants, including slaughter plants in Northern Ireland; cattle moved for export from approved export assembly centres <i>viz</i> some 14 stand alone premises or ports, plus 23 marts approved for the clearance of cattle exports to Northern Ireland, and cattle moved through some 19 premises used by live exporters to marshal cattle and test them prior to export.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the 30 day rule as applied at present is a sensible precautionary measure in the context of limiting the spread of disease and that the exemptions in place are sufficient to facilitate dealers, agents and exporters in their ongoing business. A 30 day retention requirement also applies in Northern Ireland with minimum exemptions.</P>

In the event of any such buy out schemes being introduced I must make it clear that it would only apply to farmers who have no arrears of payment due.</P>

      <P>Additional quota will <Col N="793" /> be made available to small and medium sized producers in a number of schemes in the coming year. These will continue a number of initiatives which I have implemented in recent years for the purpose of placing milk quota in the hands of committed dairy farmers at a reasonable cost. Almost 365 million litres of milk quota was reallocated permanently under the 2000-01 and 2001-02 milk quota restructuring schemes. Of this, 88% was allocated to small and medium-sized producers. I have already announced details of the 2002-03 restructuring scheme which has continued the trend of targeting quota towards small and medium sized producers.</P>
      <P>The same priority criteria will apply to temporary leasing schemes to be operated by co-operatives in the next quota year which I also announced recently. In these schemes in 2000-01 and 2001-02, almost 90% of the quota has been allocated to small and medium-sized producers and a similar outcome can be expected in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The maximum price for quota payable under both schemes has been reduced by a further 10%, thereby further improving the affordability of quota to smaller category producers. In addition to these special schemes, the milk quota appeals tribunal will continue to make recommendations to me on allocations from the national reserve to producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota regime. In considering the applications, the tribunal, among other factors, takes account of the applicants' quota size, farm size and commitment to dairying.</P>

      <P>In the context of disease control, the principal trigger for spread of disease is deemed to be animal movement, particularly continuous movement or movement involving multiple source contacts or destinations. Apart from the 30 day holding provision, I have no other proposals to reduce the numbers of personnel handling cattle. However, it is of vital importance to register the participation of all parties involved in animal movement since, in <Col N="794" /> the event of a disease outbreak, they would be an essential element in any tracing operation.</P>
      <P>In any event, there is a legal requirement under Directive 97/12/EC to register livestock dealers, including &ldquo;brass-plate&rdquo; dealers or agents who procure animals on behalf of another person. The registration process for agents is very straightforward and I do not consider that it will detract from the participation of many small farmers in the cattle trade.</P>
      <P>To clarify matters in respect of small farmers, I confirm that there is no need for registration of the occasional procurer of an animal on behalf of a family member, friend or neighbour. However, agents or farmers who acquire animals on a regular basis have to be registered and their involvement in animal movements recorded for the aforementioned reasons.</P>

      <P>An applicant for the early retirement scheme who is in &ldquo;joint management&rdquo; is someone who, though involved in the <Col N="795" /> management of the land that is being transferred, does not own some or any of it. A younger spouse or partner will often apply under the joint management arrangement because he or she can draw down the pension for longer than the other spouse or partner who is the actual owner of the pension lands. A joint management application can also happen when the applicant himself or herself does not own enough land to make up the maximum area of 24 hectares on which the pension can be paid, and brings in some other land owned by a spouse or family member.</P>
      <P>In joint management cases, any national retirement pension that either party is or becomes eligible for must be offset against the pension under the early retirement scheme. This is because eligibility for the early retirement pension has been based partly or entirely on lands that the applicant himself or herself did not own.</P>
      <P>In a &ldquo;joint ownership&rdquo; case, on the other hand, each party is registered as the full owner of the farm and, provided they meet the conditions of the early retirement scheme, either may apply. In these cases, only the national retirement pension payable to the participant must be offset against the pension paid to him or her under the early retirement scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by many farmers around the country in the completion of sheep registration forms due to the complex and technical nature of the forms; and if he will take the complex nature of the forms into consideration when imposing penalties for the submission of incorrect information.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6781/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS &ndash; which came into operation on 21 June 2001, it is a legal requirement that persons who hold or keep sheep on a registered holding maintain records of the <Col N="797" /> individual animal identification number attached to the animals. It is also a legal requirement to keep a written record of the movement of animals on to or off the registered holding. The accurate recording by all owners of flock details in their flock registers is an essential element of the traceability component of NSIS. To facilitate recording these details, flock registers were issued to all sheep farmers at the end of 2001. The register also provides for recording numbers of female sheep eligible for ewe premium purposes.</P>
      <P>The flock register contains full guidelines and examples to assist with completion. To further assist farmers with any queries they may have, my Department has established a help-line and, in conjunction with Teagasc, is currently hosting more than 75 widely advertised information meetings nationwide. As with any new documentation, it will be necessary for flock owners to become familiar with the new flock register before they are comfortable in working with it. It is for the very purpose of assisting this process that my Department is providing the help and information mentioned. I do not accept that the flock register is unduly complex nor that it poses any more difficulty for flock owners than many other items of documentation, both farming related and otherwise, that they deal with as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>From the feedback my Department has received to date, I am advised that flock registers are already being satisfactorily completed by very many flock owners. It must be remembered that the ultimate beneficiaries of an identification and traceability system, which works well and stands up to scrutiny from any quarter, are Irish sheep farmers themselves and that this is recognised by most flock owners. Incorrect or incomplete information in the register will not, in itself, result in the loss of ewe premium, although it may raise questions which the flock owner will have to address satisfactorily before premium payment can be cleared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. I am satisfied that every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner. However, the amount of quota available for allocation is limited in the context of the large <Col N="798" /> numbers of applications that are submitted and therefore the tribunal is not always in a position to recommend the allocation of quota to an applicant.</P>
      <P>The tribunal gives priority to the following categories of producers &ndash; small scale producers whose entitlement to purchase quota under the 2000 and 2001 milk quota restructuring schemes was limited because of animal disease or personal illness, or where insufficient quota was available in the applicant's co-operative or dairy; younger dairy farmers with small milk quotas; producers whose butterfat representative levels are very low, and producers who are in financial difficulty. In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors &ndash; current quota size, off-farm income and-or other farm enterprises, size of holding, family circumstances, including succession, commitment to dairying, and previous allocations from the national reserve. In the current year, approximately 19.5 million litres has been allocated to producers on the basis of recommendations from the tribunal, based on the above criteria.</P>

      <P>Payment to the amount of &euro;25.97 for slaughter premium 2000 and &euro;18.74 for national envelope 2000 in respect of one animal slaughtered on 18 August 2000, will be issued within the next week. The delay in payment in this case was due to an outstanding query on the movement of the animal into the herd which has been recently resolved with reference to herd testing data. Under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme an application in respect of 32 animals was submitted on 18 January 2001. Payment of the 80% advance, amounting to &euro;5,244.45, issued on 24 October 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All 2001 applications submitted under the suckler cow premium are cross checked against the cattle movement monitoring system &ndash; CMMS. In this case, the CMMS database showed that one of the animals applied on had been slaughtered on 19 January 2001, during the <Col N="799" /> scheme's six months retention period, and no animal replacement details had been provided by him. My Department's district livestock office wrote on 5 February 2002, seeking clarification on the death of the animal. It was confirmed that it had been slaughtered in October 2001 and is consequently eligible for payment. The correct date of slaughter is now being updated on the CMMS database. Payment of the balance of entitlement will issue within the next two weeks.</P>

The producer's milk quota of 75,079 gallons utilises 85.70 livestock units, leaving a total of 54.98 livestock units for special beef premium. This entitles the person named to payment in respect of 91.63 animals &ndash; 91.63 X 0.6lu.</P>
      <P>Advance payment has issued in respect of seven animals. Payment will issue in respect of the remaining 84.63 animals in early March. The person concerned is not eligible for payment on the 15.37 animals applied for in excess of the permitted stocking density rate. However, in accordance with the scheme's terms and conditions, these animals are deemed to have been paid under the age category applied for.</P>

The Commissioners of Public Works are currently negotiating to purchase a strip of land at the rear of the station. Without this additional land, the planned refurbishment cannot take place. For security reasons, and in the interest of safety while refurbishment works are in progress, rear access to the station is essential. The acquisition of this extra land will also allow badly needed vehicular access to the rear of the station.

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement of this scheme that the disabled person meets the medical criteria specified in the relevant regulations and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of a primary medical certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent body whose decision is final. It will be noted that neither the Revenue Commissioners nor my Department has any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of admission to the scheme.</P>
      <P>In this case, I understand that the person concerned was refused the issue of a primary medical certificate and that this refusal was appealed to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal. The board assessed the person concerned on 7 March 2001 and the refusal was upheld. At the person's request, the board reviewed this particular case again in September 2001, but maintained its original decision not to issue the requisite primary medical certificate. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for admission to the scheme without the issue of such a certificate. It should be noted that there are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.</P>

      <P>I received correspondence in May 2000 complaining about the application of the seaside resort scheme in Bundoran, County Donegal. This complaint was in relation to the availability of the double rent relief arising from guaranteed rental schemes in respect of self-catering accommodation. It should be pointed out, however, that section 70 of the Finance Act, 2000, restricts the application of this relief with effect from 1 January 2005 where partnerships qualify for a double rent deduction in the seaside resort areas. From 1 January 2005, relief for losses, etc. will only be available for set off against income arising to a partnership and will be subject to an upper limit equal to the capital contribution to the partnership. The application of the reliefs available under the seaside resort scheme is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that they have received complaints about the operation of the scheme in Bundoran.</P>

      <P>Hairdressing is not exempt from VAT. Like any other taxable business it can benefit from the registration thresholds. This means that the business does not have to charge VAT provided it remains at or under the relevant threshold, but it also means that it cannot recover any VAT charged on the inputs that it uses in the course of its business activities.</P>
      <P>The registration thresholds for VAT were last increased in 1994 and are currently &euro;25,500 for services and &euro;51,000 for goods. Ireland has the second highest registration threshold for goods and services in the EU, and some member states have no registration threshold for goods and services and require all taxable persons to register irrespective of their turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, determines the rules in respect of any change in the thresholds. This requires that it is possible to increase the thresholds but only in line with maintaining their real value. In effect, there<Col N="809" /> fore, it would only be possible to increase the threshold to &euro;30,000 for services and &euro;60,000 for goods. Any increases beyond that amount would require EU approval.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to increase the thresholds for hairdressing salons only. Any increase in the thresholds would have to apply to all taxable persons. I have no plans to change the existing registration thresholds. Any change in the thresholds would have a significant Exchequer cost.</P>

      <P>Although I appreciate the motives of the Deputy in this instance, this is a complex matter. On the basis of the information provided it is not clear if <Col N="810" /> the expenditure or the facilities involved relate to the trades of the business persons to whom reference is made in the question or if some type of voluntary contribution or donation is involved. Neither is it clear who will actually own the facilities, e.g. the local authority or the owner of the business premises.</P>
      <P>In any case, the expenditure incurred would appear to be capital in nature and no &ldquo;accelerated&rdquo; deduction would be available. At best the normal rates of capital allowances on plant would be available if a person incurs expenditure on plant for the purposes of his or her trade. In order to qualify for such a deduction, the plant must belong to the person involved and be in use for the purpose of the trade, and while used for that purpose, be wholly and exclusively so used. These rates are 20% per annum over a five year period.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy's proposal is a relatively new one, it would be necessary to examine the matter in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the new return filing date for income tax self-assessment cases arising from the changeover to a calendar tax year and the streamlining of the self-assessment payment and return filing system. Under the old 5 April year-end, tax returns had to be filed by the following 31 January, that is, a period of approximately ten months from the end of the tax year. This ten month filing period has not been shortened under the new arrangements: the tax year now ends on 31 December and the return for that year must be filed by the following 31 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new streamlined &ldquo;pay and file&rdquo; arrangements, which were introduced in the Finance Act, 2001, were designed to make the self-assessment system work more effectively. Instead of three dates in the self-assessment calendar &ndash; 1 November, the preliminary tax payment date, 31 Jan<Col N="811" /> uary, the return filing deadline and 30 April, the date by which any balance of tax due should be paid, from this year onwards there will be only one key date &ndash; 31 October. By this date, taxpayers will pay their preliminary tax for the current tax year, file their tax return for the previous tax year and pay any balance of tax due for that previous tax year.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the transition to the new filing and payment arrangements may cause some pressures in tax practitioner offices during 2002, particularly coming up to the 31 October 2002, deadline for filing tax returns for the short tax &lsquo;year' 2001. In discussions with the tax practitioner bodies leading up to the introduction of the new pay and file arrangements, I indicated that I was not prepared to extend in legislation the return filing deadline for the first year of the new arrangements to deal with these transitional issues. However, this does not preclude the Revenue Commissioners from adopting a reasonably flexible approach, on an administrative basis, for the first year subject to the Exchequer yield being protected.</P>
    <P>I understand that representatives of the tax practitioner bodies have already made known their concerns to the Revenue Commissioners about the 31 October 2002 filing deadline, including those referred to by the Deputy, and that these concerns are being addressed in the Tax Advisory Liaison Committee &ndash; TALC. This is a standing committee comprising senior Revenue personnel and representatives from the main tax practitioner bodies. I hope that through consultation an acceptable solution can be found for all concerned including the Exchequer.</P>

    <P>This year, my Department has provided additional funding of &euro;0.662 million to the ERHA for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.405 million was for an orthodontic training programme. Four dentists from the authority commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Furthermore, my Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" />Additional funding of &euro;2.971 million was provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;2.044 million was for an orthodontic initiative in the authority. The chief executive officer of the authority has informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative: two consultant orthodontists, two specialists in orthodontics and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; a six-surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five-surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards; the Northern Area Health Board has engaged the services of specialist orthodontic practitioners from outside its own area. The board announced in October 2001 that up to 300 patients from its orthodontic treatment waiting list would be treated under these arrangements, beginning last November.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has further informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 3,776 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority. This is an increase of 488 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the corresponding figure at the end of the September 2001 quarter. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures in the orthodontic initiative take effect.</P>

      <P>Cannabis is a schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. It is also one of the controlled drugs which has been designated for the purposes of section 13 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the controls provided in this manner are those which, according to the current UN Conventions on Narcotic Drugs and Psycho<Col N="817" /> tropic Substances, must be applied to substances, such as cannabis and cannabis resin, for which there is no current recognised medical or scientific use. Under these laws, the manufacture, possession, supply, and prescription of such drugs are prohibited, except under licence from the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the designation under section 13 of the Act, licences may be only granted for the purpose of research, forensic analysis, or in respect of the use of the drug as an essential intermediate or starting material in an industrial manufacturing process. Licences may also be granted in the case of certain low tetrahydrocannabinol plant varieties of cannabis for the growing of hemp. In granting a licence for the purpose of research involving any of the designated controlled drugs such as cannabis, the Minister must be satisfied with regard to the scientific or medical justification offered in support of the application.</P>
    <P>I am aware that claims are being made in respect of cannabis about the possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma. However, these medical claims are not currently supported by the results of recognised medical research. If an application were to be made to me for a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and the orders and regulations made thereunder, which proposed the conduct of research into the therapeutic use of cannabis, in circumstances where the approval of the Irish Medicines Board under the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 were to be forthcoming and which would be likely to obtain the necessary approval of the appropriate Ethics Committee under that Act, I would be prepared to give serious consideration to the grant of the required licence(s) under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</P>
    <P>I understand research into the medical use of cannabis is under way in Britain. This research is not yet complete. However, my Department will be monitoring the outcome of this work.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, were drawn up by the Minister for Finance and come under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. The Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for the regulations or their operation.</P>
      <P>To qualify, a person must meet the medical criteria specified in the above regulations which are not set by the Department of Health and Children. The senior area medical officer for the relevant health board area will issue a primary medical certificate if he-she is satisfied that the applicant fulfils the medical criteria set out in the Department of Finance's Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. This role is to assist the operation of the Revenue scheme.</P>
      <P>If a person is dissatisfied with a decision of a senior area medical officer in respect of primary medical certification, it is open to that person to appeal to the medical board of appeal. However, as with the above regulations, the Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for this board of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to two other schemes which come under the aegis of my Department. The motorised transport grant is a means tested payment administered by the health boards. The purpose of this grant is to provide assistance for persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain-retain employment or to provide assistance for persons with a disability who <Col N="821" /> are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems.</P>
    <P>To be eligible to receive the motorised transport grant applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; and the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the person to obtain-retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
    <P>Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases, the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who will drive this person to and from his-her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board. The maximum motorised transport grant is currently &euro;4,370, effective from 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>The mobility allowance is a means tested payment which is administered by the health boards. The purpose of the allowance is to provide financial support for severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport, for example, to finance the occasional taxi journey.</P>
    <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years; be living at home or maintained in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year;moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
    <P>An eligible person who is benefiting from the Disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme may receive the mobility allowance up to a maximum of &euro;63 per month. If an eligible person is not benefiting from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, he-she may avail of the mobility allowance up to a maximum of &euro;126 per month &ndash; rates effective from 1 January 2002. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case.</P>
    <P>If the individual to whom the Deputy is referring in this case feels that he may qualify for the motorised transport grant or the mobility allowance, he should contact the Western Health Board, 25 Newcastle Road, Galway for further details and an application form.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to report that phase one of the national cervical screening programme was launched in the Mid-Western Health Board on 16 October 2000. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered to approximately 67,000 women, free of charge, at five year intervals in the Mid-Western Health Board area. An expert advisory group on cervical screening is currently overseeing the implementation of phase one.</P>
      <P>Under the national health strategy a commitment has been given to the full extension of the cervical screening programme to the rest of the country. This will be a major undertaking with logistical and significant resource implications, which requires careful planning and consideration. The chief executive officers of the health boards are currently involved in an examination of the feasibility and implications of extending the programme to the rest of the country. The importance of achieving a national cervical screening programme, which is underpinned by quality assurance and best practice, is a key objective. The experience gained from phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll out of this programme.</P>

      <P>To qualify, a person must meet the medical criteria specified in the above regulations which are not set by the Department of Health and Children. The senior area medical officer for the relevant health board area will issue a primary medical certificate if he-she is satisfied that the applicant fulfils the medical criteria set out in the Department of Finance's Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. This role is to assist the operation of the Revenue scheme.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash;&euro;114.28, &euro;152.39 and &euro;190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, were introduced under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. The first schedule to the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules to be followed by all health boards in assessing the level of dependency of an applicant for a nursing home subvention. The second schedule to the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules to be followed by health boards in assessing the means of an applicant for a nursing home subvention. For the purposes of these regulations, &ldquo;means&rdquo; are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance. I am confident that all health boards, including the Southern Health Board, are assessing appli<Col N="825" /> cations for subvention in accordance with these regulations.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme was undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention to bring forward proposals in relation to whatever measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993, including the changes outlined in the recently published national health strategy.</P>

Central to this policy framework is the decision by the Government to significantly increase bed capacity in acute hospitals over the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed analysis of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The subsequent report entitled, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, <Col N="826" /> which was published on 16 January 2002, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In tandem with the publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds in the current year at a cost of &euro;65 million.</P>

The number of people waiting for in-patient treatment at September 2001 was 118. This figure represents a decrease of 52% on the comparable figures for September 2000. The number of people waiting for general surgery has fallen by 97% during the same period. Considerable progress has also been made in reducing waiting times.

      <P>Inquiries with the ERHA reveal that the matter was investigated by the local East Coast Area Health Board, and subsequently by the central appeals office of the authority. The client was advised of her right of appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman, in the event that she was unhappy with the outcome of the investigation, and this, I understand, she chose to exercise.</P>

      <P>A detailed analysis of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The subsequent report, entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which was published on 16 January 2002, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In tandem with publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds in the current year at a cost of &euro;65 million.</P>
      <P>Of the 709 acute hospital beds announced on 16 January 2002, 45 will be provided in Mayo General Hospital. These beds will provide for an adolescent unit and the development of orthopaedic services at the hospital. The other details requested by the Deputy are more appropriate to the Western Health Board as the statutory body responsible for the management of Mayo General Hospital. Accordingly, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board to provide him directly with the information requested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was not intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, &euro;114.28, &euro;152.37 and &euro;190.46, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
      <P>The first schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules to be followed by all health boards in assessing the level of dependency of an applicant for a nursing home subvention. The second schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules to be followed by health boards in assessing the means of an applicant for a nursing home subvention. Means for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. As referred to above, Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. An additional &euro;27 million has been made available for 2002, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £72 million, &euro;92 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" />As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention to bring forward proposals in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993, including the changes outlined in the recently published National Health Strategy.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority requested its scientific sub-committee on additives, contaminants and residues to conduct a risk assessment in relation to the issue of infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water. The group was due to report to the authority by September 2001.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Food Safety Authority that the primary reason for the delay in publication of the report on risk assessment of potential hazards of using fluoridated water for reconstituting infant formula is that the issues involved are complex and are still under discussion by the scientific sub-committee.</P>
      <P>There is a large amount of scientific literature under review by the scientific committee, which is a voluntary committee made up of members with full-time commitments outside the Food Safety Authority.

This list ensures equity between the general medical services and drug payment schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes.

    <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price <Col N="837" /> and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. With regard to quinine sulphate, I should point out that this product is authorised for the treatment of malaria and for no other indication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 to 265, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I revoked the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, (S.I. No. 152 of 1996), which set out criteria and procedures to be used by the chief executive officer of a health board when determining applications for granting community <Col N="838" /> pharmacy contracts. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand.</P>
    <P>The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act.</P>
    <P>The Pharmacy Review Group, established by my Department to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland, is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group. As part of its work the group is examining the question of the number and location of pharmacies contracts awarded during the periods mentioned by the Deputy and the details requested will not be to hand for some time.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my responsibilities centre on the provision of a high quality health service and this includes ensuring, in so far as is possible, that adequate and accessible pharmacy services are generally available. The decision to sell a pharmacy is a matter for the proprietor concerned. However, I am aware of the transaction referred to by the Deputy was examined by the Competition Authority and I understand that the authority has recently submitted its report which is under consideration at present. This transaction took place prior to the revocation of S.I. No. 152 of 1996.</P>
    <P>The overall increase in community pharmacy contracts under the 1996 regulations was approximately 50. Of these, about half are outside urban areas. However, applications for rural areas were also refused by health boards under the population, distance and viability restrictions of the 1996 regulations. Therefore, the effects of the 1996 regulations are not clear. The Pharmacy Review Group will study the extent to which the 1996 regulations achieved the objective of a wider geographic spread of pharmacy services. An assessment of the effects of revocation of S.I. No. 152 on geographic spread, without data on the achievement of this objective under S.I. No. 152, would be merely speculative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The foster care allowance is paid in respect of children who are taken into the care of the health board under the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995, or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children. The new restructured foster care allowance scheme, which was introduced last year, incorporates the orphan's allowance or pension. The new rates for the allowance are &euro;270.50, £213.05, per week per child under the age of 12 and &euro;296.50, £233.51, per week per child aged 12 and over. The scheme was designed to give effect in practice to the recommendation of the Report of the Working Group on Foster Care and to ensure that all children in foster care are treated fairly and equitably.</P>
      <P>The payment of the orphan's allowance or pension is a matter for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. These payments are made in accordance with social welfare legislation, where both parents are dead or one parent is dead, unknown, has abandoned or refused or failed to provide for the child and the other parent is unknown or has abandoned or refused or failed to provide for the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of children who are placed in care under the foster care or relative care regulations, these payments are made directly by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, normally to the child's guardian. The circumstances in which these payments are made and the level of payment are determined by that Department. It is therefore inappropriate for me <Col N="840" /> to comment on any aspect of the orphan's allowance or pension scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268, 269, 274 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware that there are a number of issues surrounding the under resourcing of the voluntary sector organisations providing health related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In response to issues raised, I point out that there have been a number of key developments in the disability sector in recent years in relation to the enhancement of services and the development of new services to meet identified needs. This has been made possible by the significant increased investment over the last number of years from an additional &euro;36.82 million in 1997 to approximately &euro;160 million extra funding in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With particular reference to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, additional funding of more than &euro;175 million has been provided by this Government for the maintenance and development of health related support services, including residential, respite, day, home support, including personal assistance, and therapy services. The ongoing element of this funding more than doubles the previous annual budget available to the sector. In 2002, I have allocated additional funding of almost &euro;40 million, including ongoing funding of &euro;30.53 million as part of my commitment to services for people with physi<Col N="841" /> cal and sensory disabilities. Some &euro;6.411 million has been targeted at this under resourcing of the voluntary sector and I am currently considering how this funding should be most effectively distributed across the voluntary organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>Substantial funding has been targeted at services provided by the major voluntary organisations in the sector for the purpose of meeting their core funding requirements. However, despite significant funding input, some of the organisations concerned have continued to accrue substantial core deficits. This issue, together with staffing levels, has been the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department, the health boards and the voluntary organisations concerned. It is my intention to clarify this issue further in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition, to encourage the development of a partnership approach between the voluntary and statutory sectors, my Department and the health boards actively engage with the voluntary sector at various national and local fora and committees, on the allocation of available funding and participation in policy development.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector, is currently developing a national physical and sensory disability database, which when complete, will provide a detailed picture of the service requirements of people with physical and sensory disabilities over a five year period. This database will enable a co-ordinated and planned approach to be taken to what is ultimately most important, the delivery of services to individuals as required.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services, including occupational therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to him as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including occupational therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified person<Col N="842" /> nel in this area to 2015 was published on 25 July last.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including an increase of more than 150% in occupational therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for occupational therapy. Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient centred health service; and the career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the Report of the Expert Group on Various Health Professions published April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The bids have now been received and are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training <Col N="844" /> last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative: two consultant orthodontists, five specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; a six-surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open, the treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five-surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; and three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards. Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that the numbers of patients and waiting times for orthodontic assessment and treatment in their areas of responsibility at the end of the December 2001 quarter were as follows:</P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. These figures show that the number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment fell by 1,133 and 1,613 respectively between June and December 2001.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have further informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" />The approach being adopted is to prepare good practice guidelines for practitioners rather than draw up specific regulations. It is intended that these guidelines will also serve to assist environmental health officers in their inspection of premises under the infectious diseases regulations. It is also intended to produce an advice and information leaflet for the general public about the possible risks attached to body-piercing and tattooing.</P>
    <P>While a considerable amount of work has been undertaken to date, the guidelines are not yet finalised. Further consideration of the issues involved and further consultation with appropriate interested parties is necessary before my Department will be in a position to bring the guidelines to completion. Due to other competing demands it is not possible at this stage to put a time frame on the completion of these guidelines.</P>
    <P>Under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, health boards are empowered where there is reason to believe that a suspected case of an infectious disease or a probable source of infection exists, to carry out an investigation and take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the nature and source of such infection, for preventing the spread of such infection and for removing conditions favourable to infection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 to 283, inclusive, and 290 together.</P>
      <P>In the interests of ensuring that Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, would apply to all housing developments as soon as possible, provision was made limiting to two years, or until 31 December 2002 whichever is longer, the validity of permissions granted after the announcement of the Part V provisions in August 1999 and before putting information on relevant housing strategies into development plans. The permission withers for any part of the housing development for which the external walls have not been completed.</P>
      <P>Based on information received from local authorities, it is estimated that about 2,000 current planning permissions, 79,700 units, nationally, excluding one-off housing, of which 650 planning permissions, 37,400 units, are in the greater Dublin area, GDA, come within the two year rule. Of these, 1,200 permissions, 44,000 units, nationally will expire on 31 December 2002 and 800 permissions, 35,700 units, during 2003. The corresponding figures for the GDA are 480 permissions, 21,000 units, expiring on 31 December 2002 and 170 permissions, 16,400 units, during 2003. An additional 533 relevant applications nationally, 139 for the GDA, for around 28,400 units, 11,600 units for the GDA, are currently awaiting decision and, if granted, will expire during 2004.</P>
      <P>Given current demand for housing and recent annual record output, it is likely that many of these planning permissions will be built out within their two year duration. Reapplications will have to be made for any units where external walls have not been completed at the end of the two year period. These reapplications will be subject to Part V social and affordable housing provisions. Local authorities are being advised to process reapplications as quickly as possible to avoid any interruption to the supply of housing. I have also made regulations which reduce the fee to one quarter for these particular reapplications.</P>

The priorities will be identified on the basis of plans which will be drawn up for each RAPID area by an area implementation team. The team will be representative of the relevant State agencies, including the local authorities, and residents in the local community.

      <P>Under the terms of its contract, NCTS is required to carry out a test within 28 days of the date of the making of a request for a test. I understand from the company that, on average, persons currently contacting NCTS for a test are being provided with a test date within 12 days of the request, which is more than two weeks earlier than required by the contract.</P>
      <P>The industrial dispute at National Car Testing Service Limited, last year gave rise to a backlog of testing which the company is addressing in a recovery plan. The plan involves a substantial increase in the capacity of the company to undertake testing which will be achieved through a range of measures, including the recruitment of additional testers and the provision of extra test lanes and equipment. As a result, the company is now making offers of provisional test appointments to owners who do not initiate the contact, for dates, on average, 29 days after the test due date.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EC, passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter. The scheme of car roadworthiness testing has been introduced on a phased basis beginning in 2000 with cars first registered before 1992, in 2001 with cars first registered between 1992 and 1996, and in 2002 four year old and other eligible cars. Under the Road Traffic (National Car Test) (No. 3) Regulations, 2001, which transposed this requirement into Irish law, the test due date is calculated by reference to the date of first registration of the vehicle and then is set as every two years after the first test due date. Where a NCT inspection does not occur on the original test due date as laid down by the regulations, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test due date. This is to ensure that the car is again liable for a test in accordance with the test schedule laid down in the Directive.</P>

      <P>A brief for the Belmullet sewerage scheme was submitted to my Department by Mayo County Council in 1992 but has not been approved. The scheme was tenth on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>On 8 February 2002 I announced the Government's decision to approve the appointment of a panel of three independent persons to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry on 21 November 2000.</P>
      <P>Appointments to the panel have recently been confirmed and consist of Mr. Kevin Bonner, Mr. Bill Attley and Ms Ann Riordan. The panel has been asked to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime on 21 November 2000, including an estimate of the numbers of individual licence holders involved, the likely financial implications and the recommended criteria for assessment of extreme personal financial hardship under any subsequent proposed response by Government. The report of the findings of the panel will then be presented to Government. The Government initiative is in response to the continued claims that certain taxi licence holders have suffered extreme personal financial hardship following the November 2000 changes which may not have been fully addressed by the mitigation measures already put in place.</P>
      <P>Persons who held a taxi or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence at 21 November 2000 who consider that they have suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation may now make submissions to the panel, including an indication as to how their claim of hardship can be substantiated. It is open to each individual taxi licence holder to make his or her own submission directly to the panel and the closing date for submissions is 19 April 2002.</P>
      <P>I must again stress, however, that the courts have clarified on a number of occasions since 1992 that there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to the secondary market values of licences and there is no question of payments being made to the holders of taxi licences for any perceived loss of value arising from liberalisation.</P>
      <P>Since the announcement of the establishment of the panel, advertisements inviting submissions have been placed in the national newspapers and officials of my Department have also met representatives of taxi groups and FAIR to inform them of the initiative.</P>

      <P>The person concerned attended for a driving test on 14 January 2002. The report prepared by the driver tester indicated that she made a number of serious driving errors during the course of the test. The decision of the tester was that she did not meet the required standard to enable her to pass the test. As a gesture of goodwill in this case, my Department has indicated that the individual on reapplication for a test be offered a test by a senior tester. A person aggrieved by the decision of a driver tester may appeal to the District Court under section 33 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. If the court finds that the test was not properly conducted it can direct that a further test be arranged free of charge for the candidate concerned.</P>

      <P>Separate allocations are not made to authorities in respect of the subsidy which may be payable by the Department towards the cost of acquisition and development of the sites of these dwellings.

      <P>Under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, is required to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent, an emission from such premises. Emission is defined to include a smoke emission. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting emissions in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The Act empowers a local authority to serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission specifying the measures necessary to prevent or limit air pollution.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, places a general duty on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste, and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309, 310 and 312 together.</P>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by the health boards which administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of my Department. The scheme provides entitlement for any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>At present there are of 9,532 basic supplementary welfare allowance claims in payment in respect of 19,215 asylum seekers, of which 13,136 are adults and 6,079 are children. In addition to the basic claims there are currently approximately 5,100 rent supplements in payment to asylum seekers. There are 528 claims for unemployment payments currently in payment to asylum seekers. These claims are in respect of 1,542 people, of which 845 are adults and 697 are children.</P>
      <P>A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one-parent family payments, pensions, disability allowance and child benefit. Details of the numbers involved in these categories are not available.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on asylum seekers under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was £60.83 million in 2001. This includes £38.53 million in respect of basic payments, £19.37 million in respect of rent supplements and £2.93 million in respect of exceptional needs payments.</P>
      <P>Details of expenditure for the years 1997 to 2001 are set out in the following tabular statement. The information requested by the Deputy is not available in relation to earlier years. Prior to 1997, asylum seekers were not identified separately from other supplementary welfare allowance applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a <Col N="859" /> health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments. Exceptional needs payments are subject to a means test. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment.</P>
      <P>Urgent needs payments, on the other hand, can be made to people who would not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance. These payments are normally issued in emergency situations, for example, following a house fire or a flood. Immediate needs in respect of items such as food, clothing and shelter can be catered for by way of an urgent needs payment. The payments may be recoverable where they are made to people in full-time remunerative employment.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not allow me to prescribe either the circumstances, or the nature of the need, in respect of which these payments may be made. The issuing of payments, and any recovery in the case of urgent needs payments, are made at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of each individual case and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>A booklet containing guidelines on exceptional needs payments was published by my Department in 1995 to promote consistency of treatment of applications for exceptional needs payments both within and between the various health boards around the country. The situations outlined in the booklet relate to the most common items or situations for which the payments are made but as stated in the booklet it is not intended to be a comprehensive list. I have arranged for a copy of this booklet to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The most noticeable increase in expenditure on exceptional needs payments has been in respect of adult clothing for people with special clothing needs, rent deposits to assist people in securing private rented accommodation and the replacement or purchase of essential household items. Details of expenditure in these areas for the past three years are shown on the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>In determining entitlement to carer's allowance there are medical, means and residency conditions which must be satisfied and there is inevitably a timelog involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable decisions to be made. The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 3 October 2001. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention are required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied.</P>
      <P>The medical evidence submitted with the application was insufficient to determine whether the person being cared for required full-time care and attention and a more comprehensive medical report was requested from the care recipient's doctor.</P>
      <P>This report was referred to the Department's chief medical adviser, who, in the light of the evidence presented, expressed the opinion that the care recipient did not require full-time care and attention in this particular case. The application was subsequently refused on that basis. The person concerned was notified of this decision and of her right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office on 20 February 2002.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314 and 328 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is generally available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time restrictions on the free travel scheme have been a feature of the scheme since its incep<Col N="861" /> tion. They apply at peak times on city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. They do not, however, apply in the case of recipients of disability allowance who are mentally handicapped or attend long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes.</P>
    <P>In addition, they do not apply to disability allowance recipients who are attending a third level course of education or to certain other disabled or blind people. These people receive an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times. The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints.</P>
    <P>Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In general, demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. My Department has written to the Department of Health and Children requesting that this problem be examined by that Department and the health boards with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. However, in general, it appears free travel pass-holders make suitable arrangements around the peak time restrictions.</P>
    <P>In exceptional or extenuating circumstances where hospital appointments cannot be arranged out of peak travel time, my Department can issue a temporary unrestricted free travel pass, valid for up to six months. Requests for such passes can only be considered on a case by case basis and are only granted in very exceptional circumstances. Any general lifting of the time restrictions could cause capacity problems for CIE and further disruption to work and school commuters.</P>
    <P>Very significant improvements have been made in the free schemes in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. The operation of the schemes will be kept under review with a view identifying the scope for further improvements.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individual. A sum of &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.</P>
      <P>Voluntary or community based groups seeking funding under the scheme of community support for older people must satisfy the defined eligibility criteria of the scheme, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that this scheme continues to operate in a way that benefits the most vulnerable older people in our society. With this in mind my Department keeps the administrative procedures applying to the scheme under review and makes amendments as appropriate. My Department also monitors the scheme on an on-going basis to ensure that those organisations receiving funding under the scheme are complying with all the scheme regulations and requirements.</P>
      <P>The organisation mentioned in the Deputy's question is one of the voluntary organisations who have submitted applications for funding to my Department in recent years. While every effort is made to ensure the prompt processing of applications under the scheme, my Department, in administering this and other grant schemes funded from public money, must ensure that all criteria are adhered to, including the provision by funded groups of satisfactory accounts in respect of previously issued grants.</P>

    <P>An application for funding was received from <Col N="864" /> this organisation in 2000 and again in 2001. However, as satisfactory accounts were not submitted to my Department in respect of the grant issued in 1999, it was not possible to process the application further. My Department has been engaged in lengthy correspondence with the group on this matter and recently received accounts and other documentation which are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>Representatives from my Department met with the organisation recently to discuss outstanding issues relating to their application. As a result of that meeting my Department is reviewing the application and additional information provided by the organisation. My Department hopes to resolve this situation shortly and will be in touch with the organisation in due course.</P>

      <P>The orphan's payments paid by my Department are intended to provide income maintenance for children who satisfy the qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>At present orphans contributory allowance and maximum rate orphans non-contributory pension are each paid at a rate of &euro;91.00 per week. Orphans payments are increased each year in line with the standard budget increases afforded to other income support payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foster care allowance, paid by the health boards, is paid at a rate of &euro;253.95 per week in <Col N="865" /> respect of children aged under 12 and &euro;279.34 per week in respect of children aged over 12. Since August 2001 the orphans payment is paid directly to the health boards, on behalf of, and for the benefit of, each eligible child in foster care.</P>
    <P>Foster carers operate within a very specific framework, they are subject to rigorous scrutiny and ongoing monitoring by the health boards and the children in their care are subject to a care plan. This means that foster carers have additional responsibilities and duties in respect of the children in their care, such as working with health board personnel. The report of the working group on foster care noted that foster carers require extra financial support as there are additional costs involved in looking after foster children.</P>
    <P>The two payments systems have significantly different objectives and purposes. The orphans payments, paid by my Department, are designed as income support measures while the foster care allowance not only provides income support but also recognises the additional responsibilities and expenses faced by foster carers.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider there is a case for increasing the orphan's allowance in line with that being paid to foster parents.</P>

      <P>The issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension, including self employed people who were already over 56 years in 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group was addressed in 1999. These people could not qualify for a pension because they could not satisfy the basic conditions required for pensions purposes, particularly the requirement to have entered insurance ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>A special old age contributory pension was introduced in April 1999 for self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years' contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
      <P>I believe the special arrangement introduced in April 1999 represents a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this group of people found themselves and there are no plans at present to make further changes.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over and to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability-type welfare payments, such as disability allowance and invalidity pension. Carers in receipt of carer's allowance, and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowances, are also entitled to a single status standard travel pass, enabling the passholder to travel free on public transport.</P>
      <P>A companion free travel pass is available to disability allowance clients who are certified as unfit to travel alone, to people who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and who are receiving full-time care and attention from a carer or are confined to a wheelchair. Children who are registered as blind with either the National Council for the Blind of Ireland or the National League of the Blind of Ireland are also entitled to a companion free travel pass. The only category of children under age 16 who are entitled to free travel are blind children.</P>
      <P>In the case of the family concerned, the child's father is receiving disability allowance and has a companion free travel pass. His wife is receiving a carer's allowance and also has a standard free travel pass. Their son is not entitled to free travel under the scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the various free schemes including free travel are highly valued by the clients concerned, and are seen generally as an innovative set of direct practical supports for a broad range of groups. A number of very significant initiatives to improve free scheme entitlements and to extend coverage have been taken by this Government over the past five years. Further extension of free travel coverage would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme makes provision for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments.</P>
      <P>There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payments. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case and neither I nor my Department has a function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Area Health Board was again contacted on behalf of the couple in question and has confirmed that prior to making an application for rent supplement or an exceptional needs payment the couple had independently secured their current accommodation. They informed the community welfare officer that they had borrowed money from a family member to pay the deposit and the first month's rent.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 852 which I answered for the Deputy on 30 January 2002, an exceptional needs payment was not considered appropriate in this case on the grounds that at the time of application the need had already been met. This decision is in line with the board's long standing policy in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>There are currently 58,061 persons in receipt of disability allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" />In all my Department's schemes there is a review mechanism to ensure that entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied. Continuing entitlement under the disability allowance scheme is dependent on the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria. This is achieved through a process of selective and periodic review of appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>According to departmental records, during the period January 1998 until December 2001, 2,631 persons were disallowed disability allowance. Of those disallowances 182 were on medical grounds and 2,449 were in respect of means. This includes cases where appeals or re-applications may currently be in progress.  </P>
    <P>In all such review cases resulting in disallowance the persons concerned are informed of the decision and the reasons for it. They were also advised of their right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees with families on low earnings and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be only marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The range of improvements to the family income supplement scheme instituted by this Government, including the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income and the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme. In this year's budget, I provided for further increases in the FIS income limits with effect from January 2002. These increases raised the weekly income limits by more than &euro;34 at each point, adding on average, an extra &euro;20 to the payments of existing FIS recipients. The average weekly payment now stands at &euro;71 per week, with a total of 11,630 families receiving a supplement under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of further improvements to the income thresholds, is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and Government commitments.</P>

      <P>In the past four years one additional bilateral agreement has come into operation, making provision for the aggregation of insurance records and the payment of pensions on the aggregated record where the person does not have a sufficient record under one legislation alone. This agreement was with Switzerland, and it came into effect on 1 July 1999. This brought the number of such agreements to seven.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are at an advanced stage with regard to the completion of similar agreements with Korea and the United Kingdom, covering in the latter case third country nationals who are not at present covered by the EU regulations on social security for migrant workers and the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands which are not part of the EU.</P>
      <P>Consideration has also been given to negotiating similar agreements with some of the countries of central and eastern Europe. However, if the enlargement of the EU goes ahead as planned in 2004, the application of the far more comprehensive provisions of the EU regulations for migrant workers would make any such agreements unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The recently established emigrant task force, on which my Department is represented, will examine the position of Irish workers abroad. Its report, due later this year, will greatly assist the evaluation by my Department of whether further bilateral agreements are necessary to adequately protect the pension rights of workers moving between Ireland and other States.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the treatment benefits scheme adminis<Col N="870" /> tered by my Department, persons insured under the social welfare Acts and their dependent spouses can avail of benefit in respect of a certain range of dental, optical and aural services subject to satisfying certain PRSI contribution conditions. These PRSI contribution conditions vary depending on the age of the insured person. Persons must also have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for a certain length of time. The PRSI contributions which are reckonable for treatment benefit are Classes A, E, H and P.</P>
    <P>The PRSI eligibility requirements for a person under 21 years of age is that he or she must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since she or he first commenced work. For a person in the age group 21 to 24 years of age he or she also needs to have 39 weeks PRSI paid since first commencing work but is also required to have 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year.</P>
    <P>In the age group 25 to 65 years of age the PRSI eligibility requirement is that a person must have 260 weeks PRSI paid since first commencing work with 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year.</P>
    <P>A person over 66 years of age is required to have 260 weeks PRSI paid since first commencing work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching 66 years of age. The relevant tax year for persons making claims in the year 2002 is 2000-01.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the qualifying conditions for treatment benefit would have cost and budgetary implications. I currently have no plans to change these.</P>

      <P>My Department funds a number of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on provision of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work. The grants to voluntary organisations are made for renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications or research or other special projects. The purpose of the community development education and training grants scheme is to fund local community and voluntary groups for funding and education initiatives, for example, programmes which strengthen and increase the skills and knowledge of management committees. The scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups provides grants for programmes of self help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life. The budget allocation for 2002 for the three schemes indicated above is &euro;2.774 million, with an additional &euro;150,000 allocated specifically to the Carmichael Centre.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides funding for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services. Grants are provided to voluntary organisations to support activity in the areas of marriage counselling, marriage preparation courses, child counselling &ndash; in relation to parental separation, bereavement counselling and support &ndash; on the death of a family member.</P>
      <P>In 2001, &euro;6,107,440 was made available to voluntary organisations providing the above services. A sum of &euro;6.659 million has been allocated this year to support voluntary organisations in the provision of marriage, child and bereavement counselling services. This amount includes a special budget allocation of &euro;50,790 to Turning Point.</P>

    <P>In regard to grants for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights, the information section of my Department provides funding to voluntary organisations for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights awareness. An amount of &euro;761,854 was spent on these grants in 2001 and an amount of &euro;762,000 has been allocated for 2002. Included in this year's allocation is an amount of &euro;100,000 for the promotion of information and welfare rights for emigrants. In regard to community development support programmes, in addition to the once-off grant schemes indicated above, my Department provides long-term funding to locally-based groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities so they can develop a greater capacity to influence others and articulate their points of view; have a role in decisions which affect them; contribute to a process of change in their areas; and improve their quality of life.</P>
    <P>Such support is provided through the following community development support programmes: as the community development programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; and the programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>These programmes are designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and are primarily concerned with developing the capacity of people to participate in society as opposed to the provision of direct services. To be eligible for funding, groups must subscribe to a self-help, community development ethos and must involve the intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. There are currently some 280 projects funded under these programmes.</P>
    <P>The CDSP programmes are now administered as part of the social inclusion programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, with funding of some &euro;140 million being made available over the period of the plan. The budget allocation for 2002 is &euro;27.02 million.</P>
    <P>Details of the funding made available to projects funded under the CDSPs have also been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year since 1990 for the information of Members.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector was published by the Government on 13 September 2000. The publication of the White Paper marked the start of the Government's long-term strategy to develop and support the community and voluntary sector. It sets out the rationale for developing the relationship between the State and the sector and the principles which should underpin this relationship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" />Following on from the recommendations of the White Paper funding has been made available in 2002 to provide additional support to voluntary and community organisations as follows: funding to national federations and representative bodies &ndash; an amount of &euro;2,539,000 has been made available to provide support for national representative bodies in the community and voluntary sector, other than national anti-poverty networks funded by the Combat Poverty Agency; funding to provide community and voluntary sector training and supports &ndash; funding of &euro;2,539,000 has been made available in 2002 to foster the availability of additional training and support services to community and voluntary sector groups.</P>

      <P>The area referred to by the Deputy contains national monuments which are not owned by the State but rather are in guardianship. This means that while the site is afforded legal protection in accordance with the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, it remains in private ownership. In this instance the landowner remains reluctant, following last year's foot and mouth crises, to permit the public to access his lands.</P>
      <P>While we must respect the rights of the landowner with regard to his property my officials have been in contact with him to seek to address his concerns and at the same time allow the public to access the monuments. These contacts have not been successful to date but I can confirm that efforts will continue to be made to once again make the monuments in question accessible to the public.</P>

      <P>The study currently being carried out by the development officer of the Irish Islands Federation is limited to ascertaining the extra passenger and cargo transport costs associated with living on the islands. It is expected that this study, which commenced in mid-2001, will be completed in early April 2002 and its results will then be forwarded to my Department for consideration.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to consult business and farm interests on the islands as part of this study as its scope is quite limited and will involve, in general, consultation only with those who run scheduled ferry services, both subsidised and non-subsidised, between the islands and the mainland.</P>

      <P>County Waterford forms part of the south eastern management region of Dúchas &ndash; the heritage service of my Department. Conservation rangers are not allocated on a county basis. Currently, responsibility for County Waterford is divided among four conservation rangers working in the south eastern region. These officers would also have responsibility for parts of other adjoining counties. The rangers report to a district conservation officer who is based in County Waterford also.</P>
      <P>While, as with other areas, additional resources could be put to good use in the area of nature conservation, my general approach to staffing this sector has been to build up resources over time in order to address the growing volume of work involved in safeguarding our wildlife and important habitats, including responsibilities arising in connection with the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000. This approach has ensured that this sector is now better and more effectively resourced than ever before. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, since taking office, I have authorised the employment of an extra 30 conservation rangers which significantly increased the strength of the corps to 90. For this reason, I take the view that the existing staff resources should suffice for the present to deal with my Department's general functions in relation to wildlife, management and supervision of protected areas, including national parks, nature reserves and refuges for fauna etc. However, staffing resources for my Department, including those for the heritage area, are maintained under continuous review, subject to overall Government policy on Civil Service numbers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yellowhammers are non-migratory seed-grain eating buntings closely related to the finches. Around 1900 they were considered to be common throughout the lowland countryside, especially in areas of mixed farming. By 1950, it was thought little change had taken place in both numbers and distribution. The first distributional survey of this species &ndash; and all other Irish breeding birds &ndash; was carried out in 1968-72 and published in The Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland. This showed the yellowhammer to be present in most parts of Ireland where suitable habitat occurred. <Col N="880" /> However, a new survey in 1988-91  &ndash; The New Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland &ndash; showed a major reduction in the species' range. The species was now absent from large areas of the north midlands, the north west, and the south west. This represented a 37% contraction in breeding range, as distinct from numbers, in about 20 years. Unfortunately the first survey was completely non-quantitative, while the second survey was only semi-quantitative, and therefore it is not possible to say what reduction in numbers took place as a result of the range contraction. Nevertheless, the range contraction justified the inclusion of the yellowhammer on the red list of species of conservation concern which is maintained by BirdWatch Ireland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, in order to monitor numbers and distribution of this species and other countryside birds, a new ongoing project, named the countryside bird survey, commenced four years ago, and over the years will indicate population trends. While data collection is ongoing, it is too early to draw definitive conclusions on population trends based on the limited data collected to date. The countryside bird survey is a joint project of Dúchas &ndash; the heritage service of my Department and Birdwatch Ireland.</P>
      <P>The indications are that the decline in yellowhammers in Ireland is due to changes in agriculture over the last 50 years or so. Post-war mechanisation; increasing use of artificial fertilisers; herbicides and pesticides; removal of hedgerows; loss of winter stubbles with the switch to autumn sowing of cereals; overall reduction in mixed farming; reduction in oat growing with the decline in horses, etc. all combined to make the Irish countryside less hospitable for this and many other species.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and other agri-environment measures, for example, set-aside, which are being increasingly taken up by farmers throughout the country, have the potential to undo some of the harmful effects of over-intensification in agriculture. I hope this will result in some recovery of bird populations which have declined in recent decades.</P>
      <P>The EU birds directive requires that member states maintain a favourable conservation status for all wild bird species occurring in their territories. Schemes such as REPS are considered to be the most appropriate way of achieving this for widespread farmland bird species such as the yellowhammer.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the allocation of Garda resources to any particular area is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Garda authorities that no recent requests have been made for an increase in Garda manpower in Cork city. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the level of public disorder and assaults in cork city is on par with other sizeable cities and towns.</P>
      <P>I am assured that An Garda Síochána has a very positive relationship with the city centre traders and the licensed trade in Cork city. The Garda maintains regular contact with the pub and night club owners in the city centre in an attempt to curb the level of public disorder and any abuse of alcohol.</P>
      <P>A pilot pub watch initiative has been launched in a number of areas in the city centre and progress to date has been positive. Special exemptions have been generally opposed by the Garda as part of its enforcement strategy with exemptions not generally granted after 2 a.m.</P>
      <P>In addition, a CCTV system is now being completed in Cork city division which has been part funded by the Cork City Council in conjunction with my Department. This system, consisting of 29 cameras, most of which are now fully operational, will be a particularly valuable resource to the Garda both in terms of crime prevention and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in view of level of concern about public order problems in general, and following consultation between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner, a new public order initiative entitled Operation Encounter was recently announced and came into effect on 23 February 2002. This operation will concentrate on targeted areas and will also involve closer liaison with the owners of nightclubs, pubs and fast food outlets.</P>

      <P>This person is serving a five year prison sentence, with the last year suspended, for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He is also serving a three and a half year sentence for handling stolen property.</P>
      <P>This offender has made repeated complaints about the way he perceives he has been treated by the authorities, in particular the Irish Prison Service. The allegations of ill-treatment in Wheatfield Prison on 27 October 2000 have been investigated thoroughly by the governor of that institution who concluded that these allegations were unfounded. In this regard, statements were made by a number of prison officers, all of whom were either not aware of, or deny the allegations made by the prisoner and his family. During the course of the investigation, a security camera video tape of the alleged incident was examined and, despite the allegations, there is no evidence of aggressive behaviour by any of the prison officers present.</P>
      <P>This matter was also investigated by gardaí at Ronanstown Garda station and a file was forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. No prosecution ensued.</P>

    <P>The offender's other complaints have similarly been investigated by prison management and have also proved to be either without substance or trivial in nature.

It is included in the policing section of the community policing unit at Fitzgibbon Street. I am further informed that since 1 August 2001, there have been no incidents recorded on the Garda Pulse system of public order offences having taken place at the complex.</P>
      <P>I understand that representatives from the flats complex attend the community policing forum at Store Street Garda station, on a monthly basis. This forum enables representatives of An Garda Síochána, public representatives and Dublin City Council to discuss local issues with local representatives and to address any problems being encountered. I am informed by the Garda authorities that complaints expressed at the most recent forum concerning the complex related to minor drug dealing which was allegedly being conducted on balconies there. I understand that concerns were also expressed that patrons from a local public house were using the grounds of the flat complex as a toilet.</P>
      <P>In respect of the alleged drug dealing, local resources in conjunction with the divisional drugs unit are aware of the complaint made and have been directed to pay necessary attention. I am also informed the community policing units and the public order patrol van, which operates from Fitzgibbon Street, have been directed to supplement regular patrols and continue to monitor the area in order to curb any instances of public disorder which may occur there.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the waiting times for the processing of Land Registry dealings is as set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, the completeness of the documentation forwarded by the solicitors, etc. The volume of business being transacted at any stage would also have a bearing on matters. The Deputy may also wish to note that any cases involving urgency are, in accordance with the customer service policy of the Land Registry, dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of measures are being taken to deal with the level of business now being received by the Land Registry. The Deputy will particularly be aware that in 2000, in order to address the increasing intake of applications, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by 77. Most of these appointments were made during 2001 and the training of the new staff is now beginning to pay dividends. I can also inform the Deputy that, during 2001, I received sanction for a further 19 temporary posts for the Land Registry. The recruitment of these additional staff is in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the Land Registry has been in the process of rolling out the integrated title registration information system, ITRIS. It is now operational in 12 counties representing approximately 70% of all dealings lodged. It will be extended to counties Tipperary, Meath and Westmeath in April and will be available for the entire country by the end of 2002. In the meantime in advance of the full roll out of ITRIS, in response to customer demand, the Land Registry's electronic access service, EAS, is now available in 20 counties and will be available to the <Col N="886" /> other counties by May-June this year. Since its introduction, users of the EAS, from the convenience of their own premises, can conduct on-line searches of the electronically available indices and register; view and print computerised ownership records; discover the applications pending in the Land Registry against a particular registered property; make on-line applications for official copies of Land Registry records; and track the progress of applications through their lifecycle.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that further enhancements are planned for this service which will become available from the second quarter of this year. A measure of the success of this flagship project to date can be gleaned from the usage of the service, which was initially launched in autumn 1999. A total of 123,000 business transactions were undertaken via this service during 2000. In 2001 this figure grew to almost 160,000. At the end of 2000 there were approximately 1,600 account holders. By April 2001 this had grown to 2,000 and it has now exceeded 3,100.</P>
    <P>In September 2001 a major computerisation contract was signed which, when implemented, will enable customers of the Land Registry to access all folio and filed plan records and their related names indices over the Internet from the convenience of their own offices. The first images are expected to be available on-line by the middle of this year and it is planned that by the end of 2004 all the Land Registry's folio and filed plan records &ndash; about 6.4 million pages of paper records &ndash; will be available in electronic format. This is in addition to the more than 400,000 folios held in electronic format which are currently available.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry's electronic access service &ndash; www.landregistry.ie &ndash; which provides access to its current electronic database of property ownership records, was one of the key flagship projects in the first e-government action plan and was the first such project to go live.</P>
    <P>The statistics provided in the first column of the following tabular statement, dealings not requiring subdivision-creation of a new title, represent almost 70% of the total intake of cases by the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. As already outlined Land Registry management is implementing some proactive measures, along with the use of new technology, the launch of the e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps, to help deal with the situation. These measures include improvements to workflow and the training and development of staff.</P>

I can, of course, fully appreciate the seriousness of such activity, and I urge anyone suffering such intimidation to seek assistance from local gardaí. Local gardaí will also be happy to advise business people on crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities disseminate a comprehensive range of crime prevention advice to the business community on an ongoing basis. This is done, both in person through the crime prevention officers attached to each Garda division, who carry out crime prevention surveys of public and private properties throughout the country, and through the Garda Síochána's booklet, A Guide to Retail Security. Further support is available from the Garda national crime prevention unit based at Harcourt Square, Dublin.</P>

      <P>As Irish nationals are not subject to Irish immigration law, they are not legally obliged to possess a passport in order to re-enter the State. However, immigration officers are empowered to carry out immigration checks on aliens &ndash; persons who are not Irish or British citizens &ndash; upon their arrival in the State, even from Great Britain or Northern Ireland. As a matter of practicality therefore in certain areas, an immigration officer may ask a passenger for evidence in support of a claim that he or she is an Irish citizen and is thus exempt from immigration control. While there is a number of practical ways in which this may be achieved, possession of an Irish passport is a very effective means of doing so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Irish immigration authorities have no role in respect of the type of identification which might be sought from a person seeking to travel to the UK by either an airline or the UK immigration authorities.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda community relations section provides assistance for external groups and organisations in delivering presentations on various topics governing substance abuse. An Garda Síochána is also actively involved in schools through the Garda schools programme for school children in primary schools. Drug awareness and education is one of the topics covered in this programme.</P>
      <P>In relation to the age card scheme which I launched in September 2000, I have secured the sum of &euro;150,000 in this year's budget to conduct an awareness raising campaign to further reduce the possibility of under age drinking. The campaign will focus on promoting awareness of the age card among young people and encouraging 18 year olds who wish to purchase alcohol to apply for it; and encouraging on &ndash; and off-licences to demand production of the age card and promoting awareness of the consequences of serving under age persons.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science, which has primary responsibility for the administration of public education, has a number of initiatives to combat drugs, all of which are closely linked with the package of measures it has to tackle educational disadvantage. That Department operates two initiatives in the context of preventive actions &ndash; the substance misuse prevention programme, Walk Tall, for primary schools and the substance abuse prevention programme, On My Own Two Feet, aimed at second level school pupils.</P>
      <P>The report on the national drugs strategy 2001-08, entitled, Building on Experience, underlined that there was strong support throughout the consultation process for the need to implement school-based programmes as a &ldquo;first line of defence.&rdquo; The strategy has emphasised it is essential that current programmes are supported fully and implemented effectively in all schools.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is also co-operating with the Department of Health and Children in delivering health promotion programmes in primary and second level schools. It is intended that every primary school will incorporate substance misuse prevention programmes in the broad context of social, personal and health education, which is now part of the primary school curriculum, by September 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science, in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the National Youth Council of Ireland, funds the national youth health programme on an annual basis. The programme aims to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion-education support and training service for youth organisations and for all those working with young people in the non-formal education sector. This is achieved <Col N="891" /> through the development of interventions with youth organisations and through the training and support of workers and volunteers implementing these interventions, many of which relate to drug and alcohol education programmes. The youth affairs section also provides annual funding for the No Name Club, which is a national youth organisation formed specifically to enable young people to socialise in an alcohol free environment.</P>

      <P>Under the Aliens Order, 1946, subject to certain limited exceptions, all non-EEA nationals, including Japanese and Korean nationals, are required to register with their local Garda registration office if they wish to reside in the State for longer than 90 days. The process of registration is combined with that of obtaining permission to remain in the State and persons may subsequently seek extensions of that permission to remain, again by presentation at a Garda registration office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin area, registration takes place at the immigration registration office, Harcourt <Col N="892" /> Square. For persons residing outside the Dublin area, registration takes place at the Garda superintendent's office for the area in which they reside.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly the case that the immigration registration office, Harcourt Square, has experienced unprecedented growth in demand for its services in recent years and that this in turn has led to delays for persons seeking to register or renew their permission to remain in the Dublin area. The number of persons registered at the immigration registration office in Dublin has grown from 17,064 in 1999 to 26,641 in 2000 and 56,610 in 2001. This increase in activity reflects the growth in the level of legal migration to the State.</P>
    <P>Initiatives already undertaken to respond to this dramatic increase in demand and to reduce queuing time include very significant additional resources, longer opening hours, computerisation of the registration process and streamlining of operating procedures. In so far as opening hours are concerned, the position is that the office is now open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. &ndash; Monday to Thursday, inclusive &ndash; and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday. Furthermore, I understand from the Garda authorities that in practice the office regularly stays open until 9.30 p.m. or later in order to process applications for persons who have attended the office on that day. It is not the case that persons are required to queue overnight and the detective chief superintendent of the Garda National Immigration Bureau is on record as having stated that persons who are present when the office is opened in the morning will be facilitated on the day in question. Occasionally, if a person cannot be dealt with on the day of his or her attendance he or she will be given an appointment to call to the office on a subsequent Saturday or Sunday. It should be borne in mind however that a non-EEA national does not enjoy an automatic entitlement to reside in the State simply by virtue of the fact that he or she is a national of a non-visa required country. Different considerations may apply, for example, where such a non-EEA national entered Ireland illegally, overstayed his or her original permission to enter the State or has been involved in criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Further additional resources are currently being deployed to the immigration registration office in Harcourt Square and negotiations are taking place with the relevant trade union representatives with a view to introducing a shift system for civilian staff. This will facilitate a further extension of opening hours and will eliminate the need for queuing at the immigration registration office.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that, as a result of the introduction of computerisation, customers attending the immigration registration office get a better quality service at the counter. Under the old system, the manually prepared Garda registration certificate was posted out to the person in question several weeks after his or her visit to the <Col N="893" /> Harcourt Square office. The position now is that the new computer generated certificate is handed to the customer on the date of his or her visit.</P>
    <P>Work is already under way in relation to further initiatives. The Office of Public Works has purchased new and far larger accommodation for the registration office, which will be ready for occupation later this year. The intention is that the new accommodation will provide a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for legally resident non-nationals in the Dublin area as it will also accommodate the immigration and citizenship division of my Department together with the visa office in the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is intended that this initiative will further facilitate the streamlining of operating procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my Department has been assigned the lead role in the development and co-ordination of child care service provision over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. Funding of some &euro;436 million is being provided under the equal opportunities child care programme for a diverse but strategically focused range of measures, including capital grants, staffing supports for community facilities and projects designed to improve the quality of child care. The equal opportunities child care programme has two main purposes to its measures &ndash; to increase the number of child care facilities and places and to improve the overall quality of child care provision.</P>
      <P>Some &euro;110 million is already committed to a range of capital and staffing grants and to quality enhancement initiatives and my Department and I are wholly determined to deliver the Government's child care programme fully and effectively.</P>
      <P>In developing the equal opportunities child care programme, my Department sought to make the best possible use of available resources to meet the developmental needs of the child care sector and, above all, to develop services to meet the needs of children and their parents who may be in education, in training or in employment. The measures which were developed under the programme seek to increase the supply of child care places, to support child care places in areas of disadvantage and to increase the quality of child care through the development of child care training, networks and other initiatives. It was considered that existing statutory bodies already provide child care training and that it would be inappropriate to fund the direct provision of child care training from the equal opportunities child care programme. As a result, projects such as that referred to by the Deputy do not qualify for grant assistance under the main measures of the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to county child care committees to provide funding for the direct provision of training for local groups in the event that the activity <Col N="895" /> being proposed meets with the strategic focus of the local county child care committee and, obviously, that the county committee supports the granting of funding for that purpose.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular proposal referred to by the Deputy, I have been informed by the child care directorate of my Department that an application for funding under the equal opportunities child care programme was received from An Cosán in July 2001. As the project relates to the direct provision of child care training and is local in nature, it was transferred for consideration to the south Dublin county child care committee and the promoters of the project were advised to contact the south Dublin committee regarding their requirements.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that while no decision has yet been taken by the south Dublin county child care committee in relation to this project, the committee may not be in a position to fund this project at present. I further understand that An Cosán has commenced part of the project, involving some 20 participants, with the aid of local fundraising.</P>
    <P>In the event that the south Dublin county child care committee is unable to support this proposal, the project managers might contact the child care directorate in my Department which will explore the availability of funding for this purpose under the employment and human resources operational programme of the national development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that no application has been received by the advisory committee &ndash; that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications &ndash; in respect of Tipperary town. Applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Applications may then be considered by the advisory committee which makes a recommendation to me in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications are assessed by the committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management <Col N="896" /> and any special circumstances-needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is intended that these ten CCTV systems will be installed and operational by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been sought and received in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The evaluation process is in its final stages and I hope to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place.</P>
    <P>The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Waterford, Athlone, Tallaght and Clondalkin is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers within the next three months.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided for areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grants scheme soon to cater for those communities which would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as it requires it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme, including relevant conditions and grant levels, will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following an initial submission and approval of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; con<Col N="900" /> tract document; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, OPW, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>I have approved the contract documentation submitted by Ballinasloe Town Council for the proposed replacement swimming pool in Ballinasloe. The council may now seek tenders for the work proposed.</P>

    <P>Some &euro;130 million EU co-financed public sector funding, including &euro;55 million support from the European Regional Development Fund, has been provided for investment in tourism product development under sub-measures 1 to 3 which will be administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann. Support for the angling and marine tourism sub-measures, which will be administered by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, is additional to this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" />I am arranging for the Deputy to be sent an extract from the BMW operational programme covering the programme complement for tourism sub-measures 1 to 3 together with a copy of the operational guidelines for the tourism product development scheme.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme, the maximum aid rates for public sector projects including community and voluntary projects are 50% in the S&amp;E Region and 75% in the BMW region. I would point out that every project approved may not necessarily qualify for the maximum permissible aid rates.</P>
    <P>In relation to private sector projects, assistance rates must comply with the European Commission's guidelines on national regional aid. The formal approval of the scheme for State aids purposes was granted by the European Commission on 7 November 2001. The maximum ceilings, in percentage terms, for regional aid for all sectors in Ireland were approved on 26 October 1999 and are set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>The tourism product development scheme, which I launched recently, has a particular focus on less developed tourism areas, including those in the Border counties. The scheme, which will be administered by Bord Fáilte, is funded under the Local Enterprise Development Priority of the two regional operational programmes in which provision has been made for public sector investment of some &euro;130 million in tourism product development over the next five years. This amount includes &euro;55 million support from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective of the scheme is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, eases <Col N="902" /> pressure in highly developed areas and increases the share of tourism revenue for underperforming regions.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, provision is made for the development of major attractions; the upgrading and packaging of geographically and financially sustainable clusters of existing attractions; the development of special interest pursuits; and for projects promoting the better management of the relationship between tourism and the environment.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) Tourism Programme has been very successful in stimulating private sector investment and creating jobs within the tourism sector. Its programme for 2002 will continue with the implementation of programmes approved in 2001 and with the development of new and innovative concepts and themes with the potential to spur economic growth in the Border regions. The total allocation to the Southern border counties under the IFI tourism programme for 2002 is &euro;2.31 million.</P>
    <P>Funding for tourism promotion of the Border region has been provided in the new programme for peace and reconciliation which will run until the end of 2006.  This programme has just started to come on stream after prolonged negotiations with the European Commission. The INTERREG III Programme is expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2002. While specific tourism related measures have not been included in the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG III Programme, support for tourism related projects may be provided where they meet the criteria of other elements of the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 399 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides a centralised payroll service for voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive schools for the payment of incremental salary grant directly to eligible teachers employed by those schools. Payment is issued in the first possible pay issue following the submission, by the nominating school and the teacher, of all required documentary and other evidence of eligibility for payment of salary. Delays in processing nominations arise due to lack of recognition of the nominee as a teacher and late submission of nominations by school authorities.</P>
      <P>According to my Department's records 634 teachers, employed with effect from 1 September 2001, received their first salary payment after 1 October 2001. The corresponding figure for 2000 was 925.</P>

      <P>Eligible part-time teachers, EPT, employed in voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive schools are included in my Department's second level teachers payroll. Based on current rates of pay and allowances, the average annual salary of a teacher who began an EPT contract in a voluntary secondary, community or comprehensive school in the academic year 2001-02 is approximately &euro;20,674.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreed Report 10/2000 of the Conciliation Council for Teachers provides for the award of <Col N="907" /> incremental credit, in respect of length of training, to EPTs with effect from 1 September 2001. Qualified EPTs will move up two points on the incremental salary scale and, as a result, the average annual salary of a teacher who began an EPT contract in the academic year 2001-02 will increase to approximately &euro;22,000.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have details of the average annual salary of EPTs employed in the vocational sector as they are paid by the vocational education committees concerned.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions, the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The statutory framework for the higher education grant schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or <Col N="909" /> she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grant schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support for disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The majority of teaching posts at second level are filled on a permanent wholetime basis. Vacancies in schools arising from career breaks, approved leave of absence or secondments and concessionary posts, which are allocated in excess of a school's normal quota of posts, may only be filled in a temporary or part-time capacity. In addition, in order to ensure that schools have the flexibility to meet the curricular needs of their students, particularly in minority subject areas, it is necessary for them to appoint temporary or part-time teachers.</P>
      <P>Eligible part-time teachers, EPT, who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required. Most teachers, who are initially employed as EPTs, subsequently apply for and are appointed to permanent teaching posts in their subject area. They are entitled to incremental and pension credit for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes.</P>
      <P>The job security of temporary teachers is related to the number and type of posts available. In this regard the position at second level has significantly improved in recent years. More than 1,200 additional posts were created in the sector since the 1999-2000 school year. A further 400 posts will be created for the 2002-03 school year under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>Pupils with autism are generally catered for in special schools or in special classes attached to ordinary schools. At present in Cork, there are 12 special classes catering for children with autism. Eight of the classes are located in special schools and four are attached to mainstream primary schools.</P>
      <P>Each class caters for a maximum of six pupils and has the support of a minimum of one teacher and two special needs assistants. Pupils attending such classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and the escort service. Further such classes are being established in response to identified needs.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with autism can be supported in mainstream primary schools with the support of the resource teacher and-or special needs assistant service. There are currently in excess of 210 resource teachers and 390 special needs assistant posts in place in Cork in primary schools.</P>
      <P>My Department also supports a pilot project in Cork that caters for 30 children with autism. This project, which delivers an applied behaviour analysis model of response, was established in 1999 and is operating on a five year pilot basis.</P>
      <P>The report of the Task Force on Autism, which is currently being considered in my Department, will make an important contribution to the future development of services for children with autistic spectrum disorders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants scheme; the VEC scholarship scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grant schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered by the vocational education committees on behalf of my Department. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions which govern the award of a grant, for example, age, residency and means.</P>
      <P>Application for a grant must be made to the relevant local authority or VEC. Decisions on applications which are taken by these bodies are based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grant schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an indi<Col N="916" /> vidual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support for disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I significantly increased the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants. The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education. This scheme covers child dependants in the age group 18 to 22 years. The action group recommended that, subject to specific conditions, the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over. My Department forwarded full details of this initiative to the local authorities and vocational education committees in July 2001, with a request that payment be made with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finalised data in relation to both the 2000-01 <Col N="920" /> and 2001-02 academic years on the numbers benefiting under the initiative, and the total expenditure involved, are not available within my Department, as a number of local authorities and vocational education committees have yet to complete the assessment process in respect of students applying for the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>I have given a commitment that the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in its first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grant schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support for disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I significantly increased the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>Through the teacher fee refund scheme, funding is provided for payment to primary and post-primary teachers towards course and examination fees incurred by them in the successful completion of in-career development courses. This scheme was introduced under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>. A monitoring committee consisting of representatives of teacher unions, school management and the Department oversees the scheme, which was first introduced in 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, courses which result in a qualification in respect of which an allowance is payable are specifically excluded. Particular attention is drawn to this in the material that is circulated in regard to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to point out that the scheme is not intended to cover the entire cost of a course. The refund is only a proportion of fees paid and depends on the number of qualifying applicants in any given year and the amount allo<Col N="923" /> cated to the scheme in that year. The funding available is allocated on the basis that all successful applicants each receive the same proportion of their eligible fees after any tax relief has been deducted. Qualifying applicants received approximately 36% of their eligible fees in 1999 and approximately 32% in 2000.</P>

      <P>St. Joseph's secondary school is one of two schools currently serving the post-primary school needs of Athboy, County Meath, the other school being St. James's vocational school.</P>
      <P>The management authorities at St. Joseph's have for some time been seeking approval for improved or replacement accommodation for the school. However, my Department has long been of the view that Athboy post-primary centre, with an overall projected enrolment of less than 500 students, would be best served by a single, amalgamated school. This issue has been the subject of many meetings between officials of the planning and building unit of my Department, the Mercy Sisters, as trustees of St. Joseph's secondary school, and County Meath VEC. Unfortunately, discussions to date have been inconclusive, and I am advised by my officials that there is little immediate prospect of agreement between the trustees on a single school development.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the impasse with regard to a single school, I have asked the planning and building unit of my Department to arrange for a technical inspection of the existing accommodation at St. Joseph's to be carried out to determine what remedial action is required. Following that inspection, a decision will be taken on how best to address the school's accommodation needs, taking account of the overall needs of the area.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Sligo has to walk 1.3 miles to a pick-up point for primary school transport.</Quest>

      <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that as far as possible no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils who live off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in this case is that the family concerned reside 1.3 miles from the route of service <Col N="925" /> to the school in question. As this is considered to be an adequate level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme, and as extra cost would be incurred in extending the route as requested, it is regretted that the current arrangement is the most that can be offered.</P>

      <P>A new vocational school will be provided at Newport, County Mayo to cater for 40 pupils in the short-term. Preliminary enrolment projections for the proposed school, based on an estimated intake of 40 pupils per annum completing a six-year cycle, would suggest an overall enrolment of 240 pupils after six years. A more accurate calculation of long-term enrolments will be possible when a definitive catchment area has been determined. This matter will be finalised in my Department when the views of all the parties concerned have been received and fully considered.</P>
      <P>The stage 4/5, detailed design-bill of quantities, submission for this project has been received in my Department and is currently being examined by the technical staff of the planning and building unit. When this examination has been completed, my Department will then be in a position to give formal approval to County Mayo VEC to invite tenders for the project.</P>

      <P>Special needs assistants may be appointed to schools to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities in an educational context. They may be appointed to a special school or a mainstream national school to assist school authorities in making suitable provision for a pupil or pupils <Col N="926" /> with special care needs arising from a disability. The appointments are made on the basis of the professionally assessed needs of the pupil in question. The allocation of special needs assistant support may be made on a full or part-time basis.</P>
      <P>The attendance pattern of junior infant children generally attracts part-time special needs assistant support and the question of permanency would not arise. Responsibility for the recruitment and employment of special needs assistants in schools rests with the school authorities. Information regarding particular employees who may be leaving their posts and the reasons for such departures is not therefore available in my Department. I remain, however, committed to developing services for special needs pupils so they receive appropriate supports.</P>

      <P>Drugs awareness programmes have been introduced into 94% of primary and 75% of post-primary schools through the Walk Tall and On my Own Two Feet programmes. Up to 3,000 schools at primary level have received detailed educational resource materials and a comprehensive in-career development programme for Walk Tall. In the case of On my Own Two Feet, more than 1,650 teachers from 570 post-primary schools received resource materials and were trained to implement the programme.</P>
      <P>It is intended that every primary school will incorporate substance misuse prevention programmes in the broad context of social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; which is now part of the primary school curriculum, by September 2003. Since September 2000, SPHE, including substance misuse prevention, is being phased in to all schools at junior cycle over a three year period. This is being done in partnership with health promotion personnel in health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The youth affairs section of my Department, in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the National Youth Council of Ireland, funds the national youth health programme on an annual basis. The programme aims to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion-education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with <Col N="929" /> young people in the non-formal education sector. This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for, and with, youth organisations throughout the country and the training and support of workers and volunteers implementing these programmes. Many of these programmes relate to drug and alcohol education programmes. The programme received £56,000 from the Department in 2001 and the allocation for 2002 has not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>The youth affairs section also funds the No Name Club on an annual basis. This national youth organisation was formed specifically to enable young people to socialise in an alcohol free environment. The No Name Club received £79,610 from the Department in 2001; the allocation for 2002 has yet to be finalised. The youth affairs section of my Department also funds several organisations who have as part of their programmes, substance abuse awareness programmes.</P>
    <P>Funding in respect of 36 mainstreamed local drugs task force projects was transferred to my Department from the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation from 1 January 2001 following evaluation by the National Drugs Strategy Team. The evaluation included agreement on the level of annual funding required for each project. The mainstreamed projects include a small number related to groups which provide drug awareness courses. Applications for increases in funding from these projects are considered by the Department in the normal way during the annual Estimates process.</P>

      <P>Inspectors from my Department visit the European schools primarily to undertake inspections of Irish nationality teachers working in those schools, though they may, from time to time, meet with parents on specific issues relating to their children's progress through the schools. It is not part of their function, any more than it is in this country, to provide advice relating to third level options, which is a matter for identified teachers in each of the schools. However, to support them in this work, my Department has arranged for specialist advice to be provided by experienced Irish guidance counsellors to pupils and parents in the three schools in Brussels and in the school in Luxembourg, which, between them, cater for almost all Irish nationality pupils in European schools. A total of 70 visits were made to the European schools during the three years in question, broken down as follows: Bergen, five; Brussels (I) 15; Brussels (II) 14; Brussels (III) 13; Culham, two; Karlsruhe, one; Luxembourg, seven; Mol, eight and Varese, five.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to financial support from my Department to the European schools is being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.

      <P>The pupil referred to by the Deputy is currently receiving three hours resource teacher support per week based on her professionally assessed needs. In June 1999, under the IT 2000 Initiative, my Department issued a computer grant of &euro;1,905 to the management of the school attended by the pupil to facilitate the provision of suitable equipment to assist with her education. I understand the pupil has been supplied with a laptop computer. My Department's inspectorate has been requested to review the education needs of the pupil. When the inspectorate has reported, my officials will be in contact with the school authorities in this regard.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. In view of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>My Department's building unit has advised the authorities of the school referred to by the Deputy to engage a consultant architect to report on works required at the school. When this report has been received the matter will be given further consideration.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware there are two applications currently to hand in the post-primary building unit in respect of this school. As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 478 of 12 February 2002, both the feasibility study and the planning process has been completed in respect of works to make the school universally accessible and the management authority of the school has been requested to submit revised tender documentation for the proposed works. A decision to progress this project will be made on receipt of a response from the management authority. A decision to authorise the school authority to request its design team to commence the preparation of a feasibility study to report on the long-term needs of the school will be made shortly and officials of the post primary building unit will be in contact with the management authority of the school regarding this issue.</P>
