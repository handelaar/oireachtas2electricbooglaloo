      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notices from Deputies McManus and Sargent. I first call on Deputy McManus to state the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the very serious crisis in accident and emergency services in hospitals, as a result of which over 100 patients were waiting on trolleys yesterday afternoon; the particular problems experienced by Beaumont Hospital, which had to turn ambulances away for two hours; and the need for the Minister for Health and Children to act to provide the necessary resources to end this crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I first wish, on behalf of the Green Party, to be associated with the expressions of sympathy following the tragic accident and death of Wayne O'Donnell. I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the urgent situation regarding the health services and to ask the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance to introduce the necessary measures and resources to ensure there are no further shortages of staff and equipment at hospitals, such as Beaumont, which are often unable to cope with admissions resulting in horrendous delays and conditions for patients and staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 55, Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 78, Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) and No. 56, Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; (2) Report and Final Stages of No. 55 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Education and Science; (3) the resumed Second Stage of No. 78 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m.; and (4) Question Time tomorrow shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter. Private Members' Business shall be No. 125, motion re school building programme (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the first three weeks of March the House would normally sit for nine days during which there would be six occasions on which the Taoiseach would answer questions and take the Order of Business. However, because of his reluctance to come into the House and the Government's failure to deal with issues, we are being denied our responsibility as Opposition parties to hold the Government to account. The proposed sittings for the first three weeks of next month will result in only one Order of Business and mean we will not be able to hold the Taoiseach to account in the House regarding his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Tánaiste was not in a position to do so &ndash; she cannot explain much these days &ndash; but the Taoiseach can explain the reason it is pro<Col N="4" /> posed to have only five instead of nine sitting days during the first three weeks of next month. Given this, will he also explain the reason he is trying to have a large programme of legislation passed by the House, necessitating the use of the guillotine, in breach, Sir, of your recommendations on late amendments? Why is the Government ordering business in this way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question before the House concerns the late sitting this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on the points I have raised before we decide that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we agree to the proposal I am asking the Taoiseach to explain the reason the order for the first three weeks of next month will, in effect, diminish the powers and responsibilities of the House in holding the Government to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the House will sit for eight days during that period and that discussions with the Whips are ongoing about sitting longer, including on two Fridays. The House does not sit on St. Patrick's Day and normally does not sit on the day before or the day of a referendum. We are here until 10 p.m. Since resuming after Christmas and also during the last session we have been sitting longer hours. As I said before, if the House wishes, during the week of the referendum we could sit on the Monday, to which I do not have an objection, if the Whips agree.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 55, Report and Final Stages of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of No. 55, I have here a letter which you sent to me and, I presume, to all my colleagues in the House, about your ruling stipulating that you will not entertain amendments after what you call the 11 a.m. preceding day deadline. Last night, at a very late hour, the Minister concerned with the Residential Institutions Redress Bill tried to remedy some of its disgraceful omissions at the last minute. Does this letter apply only to the Opposition or does it apply also to the Government? Are two rules being enforced? This was a last minute decision by the Minister, just like we have seen on another Bill. The Government seems to be making up legislation on the hoof, as it goes along, on major omissions. What is the value of this letter to the Opposition if the Government can introduce amendments at any stage on Committee and Report Stages?</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy <Col N="6" /> Rabbitte, these amendments were circulated late last night, yet their content and subject matter was amplified on every radio station throughout the State before any Member received a copy of them. At the same time you write to Members imposing deadlines for amendments that appear to apply only to Members on this side of the House, not the Government.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow the Deputy to intervene. Under Standing Orders only one Member from each party may speak. I cannot allow other speakers.

      <P>The Taoiseach is refusing to debate the abortion referendum with me, and his explanation this morning was that he has been explaining the issue for four months or so. When the Minister introduced the legislation, the definition of abortion given was the termination of a pregnancy after implantation in the womb. The Minister argued in the House that this put the <Col N="10" /> use of the morning after pill and the IUD beyond doubt. The referendum commission, in its information leaflet, is taking an entirely different view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that I wrote to him on 13 February raising two items of legal concern, one of which was the legality of the morning after pill and whether a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 6 March would make the morning after pill subject to a legal challenge from an individual citizen and prevent the legality of the morning after pill becoming permanent and real. The Fianna Fáil booklet, issue No. 5, on emergency contraception states that the use of emergency contraception such as the morning after pill or post-coital IUD will be fully safeguarded. In light of today's report on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>, taken from the website of the Referendum Commission which was posted late yesterday, will the Taoiseach indicate now, in response to the letter I wrote to him over a week ago and what is now coming from the Referendum Commission, what is the status of the morning after pill and whether a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will make the morning after pill subject to a legal challenge and possibly make it illegal?</P>

      <P>On a separate matter, a Cheann Comhairle, my colleague, Deputy McManus, sought the adjournment of the House to discuss <Col N="13" /> the crisis in the accident and emergency departments of a number of hospitals in Dublin. Radio listeners are aware of the extraordinary situation that arose yesterday when people in ambulances seeking to get into a hospital on an emergency basis were turned away as a result of a breakdown of the system. I am sure the Taoiseach's briefing note mentions that the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital was effectively closed for two hours yesterday. The ward is designed to cater for 59 people, but more than three times that number were there yesterday. One toilet was available to them. Does the Taoiseach regret the fact that he has squandered any coherent planning for medical and health facilities in the last four years? Does he think the crisis reached yesterday is a fair testimony of the structured neglect on the part of the Government during the last four years?</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, over 700 beds have been made available this year, of which Beaumont Hospital's share will amount to 37. At short notice, the board of the hospital asked the Minister for Health and Children to buy St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, where 70 beds are available. He agreed to purchase the hospital at a cost of £11 million where beds will be brought on stream later this year. Beaumont Hospital, therefore, will have 107 additional beds and also benefit from other improvements announced by the Minister in terms of paramedical, nursing and medical staff. Yesterday's events are not that unusual.</P>

Does he agree that hospital staff, many of whom I have met, work under extraordinarily stressful conditions? Many nurses are leaving their employment as the scale and level of stress are too much. After the five richest years we have ever seen, is this to be the Government's legacy? Having spent so much money, the situation has still not improved.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate the question was raised of extending the scope of the Bill to deal with the abuse that took place outside the residential institutions. I said during that debate that the Bill deals with abuse in industrial schools, reformatories, orphanages and similar kinds of institutions. This is an issue which was brought graphically to light by publications, documentaries and the accounts of survivors in recent years. The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the abuse of children that occurred while the State was acting to a significant degree <i>in loco parentis</i>, where children had been removed by the State from their parents and placed out of their protection. I am extending its remit to cover some of the situations which the two Deputies opposite mentioned on earlier Stages. I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify for the House the standing, in the context of the legislation and his amendments thereof, of psychiatric hospitals, orthopaedic hospitals and so on? What is the standing of the women of the Magdalen laundries? May I take it from his reply that he is absolutely set against including, as entitled to redress, victims abused in day schools? When I raised this point on Committee Stage I suggested to the Minister that, as a fallback position, he might consider introducing to the legislation an entitlement to benefit those who have proven that they were victims of abuse through the courts but have not received any redress. I also men<Col N="23" /> tioned previously the Hesley Hall case in the United Kingdom and the concept of vicarious liability. It is almost inevitable that the State's legal responsibility in cases where abuse took place in day schools will some day be proven in the courts. The State had a <i>de facto</i> supervisory role, as it still does in primary and post-primary schools. It is effectively the paymaster of staff in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>If we are to make the best possible attempt to give real meaning to the Taoiseach's apology to victims of abuse, we should be open to including as many as possible of those victims under the terms of the legislation. I ask the Minister to consider day pupils and clarify the case of the women of the Magdalen laundries, the people who in many respects introduced this issue. When the story was uncovered there was a domino effect. The Taoiseach's apology and this legislation all grew out of the story of the women of the Magdalen laundries. I ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>

      <P>It would be helpful if the Minister were to clarify the amendments he circulated last night, although I welcome the extension of the terms of the Bill to other categories of survivors. It is rather unfortunate that he did not go so far as to include those people who suffered abuse in day schools or those cases in which the perpetrators have been convicted and have served or are serving sentences.</P>
      <P>To return to the Title of the Bill, the Minister has decided to oppose the suggestion that we use the term &ldquo;victims of abuse&rdquo; in relation to residential institutions. One of the additional categories included by him under amendment No. 9 is pupils in special schools. While this is to be welcomed, we must bear in mind that special schools catered for day pupils and boarders. Will the Minister assure us that the Bill will actually include those day pupils? A number of those suffered abuse in the same way as residents or boarders. It would be helpful if the Minister clarified that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct. Amendments Nos. 3 and 9 deal substantively with this issue and I will deal with those matters through my amendments and will discuss them at that stage. In relation to the question, the Bill is founded and based on the residential principle. The amendments suggest changing the Title by deleting &ldquo;Residential Institutions&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;Victims of Abuse&rdquo;. That would be a fundamental change and would have implications for all parts of the Bill. The Title is fundamental to the Government decision and orientation of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister is making a mistake in not removing the word residential from the Bill. The Bill should cover people who have suffered at the hands of abusers and the Minister's amendment in regard to other categories of survivors is not sufficiently specific. The main complaints I have heard relate to residents but there is still a considerable number of other victims of serious sexual abuse, who suffered at the hands of people now convicted of serious sexual offences, and their pain and trauma is still with them and extends to their spouses and families.</P>
      <P>It is hard to believe the wrong done in those cases. When they complained as children to their parents and complaints were made to school authorities and politicians of the time all that happened was that the abuser was moved from one school to another where the abuse was repeated and the cycle continued. I put it bluntly to the Minister that although their physical pain and suffering may not have been as bad as that suffered by haemophiliacs their mental pain and trauma has had a devastating effect. Even as grown adults some are moved to tears when speaking of it. They had hoped for some redress but the Government is saying no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is afraid he will open floodgates. That will not happen. Ministers have been criticised in the past for holding too firm a line. The Minister is holding a firm line and holding the gates shut against people who already had the gates shut against them when they looked for fair play and tried to have the abuser removed. Their voices were not heeded then either. Unless the Ministers of the time were blind, deaf and dumb they must have understood what was going on. It was reported by teachers and inspectors but met a ministerial wall of silence. It is time that wall was broken down and that those who suffered in the past are given fair play. The Minister should ensure that justice, fair play and compassion are <Col N="25" /> shown to those who were abused and that they are given some redress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This fear of opening up redress to day schools goes to the heart of one of the fundamental difficulties that we have with the Bill. That fear is a red herring and there is a way, if the Minister wants to consider the issue, to limit the State's liability. The State is already a defendant in many of the cases taken under the Statute of Limitations extension which was granted to victims of abuse so that they could re-enter the court system. Compensation paid out under the redress scheme is designed to avoid the adversarial nature of the court process and the trauma associated with it. Where victims have taken court cases the State will have to pay if there is culpability so why not extend the scope of this Bill to those who have already lodged claims before the court? If they could win their case in court they could equally convince the redress board of the merits of their case. We would save legal fees and it would be less traumatic for the victims.</P>
      <P>The other argument advanced by the Minister is that in residential institutions the State was acting <i>in loco parentis</i>. The logic appears to be that had the victims been in the care of their parents then their parents would have intervened. That is a simplistic approach which does not take cognisance of the reality in Ireland at the time the abuse was perpetrated. The reality is that until recent times a child making an allegation of sexual misconduct or abuse against a teacher was more likely to be punished for making the allegation than to have the allegation investigated. That was the culture of the time and it is unfair to assume in hindsight that because children were in their parents' care they were protected. There was a climate of dominance of the educational establishment prevailing at the time.</P>
      <P>It is also an accepted fact that victims of sexual abuse do not report the abuse at the time of its happening. That is partly because of the dominion exercised over them by their abusers which is the rationale as to why the Statute of Limitations was extended. The Minister's mind seems closed to that reality. At that time too corporal punishment was the norm and there was a double standard in regard to physical abuse but there was never a grey area about the rights and wrongs of sexual abuse of children in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because many of these people are before the courts and the State may have to face up to liability, because we could limit the remit of the board to those day pupils who suffered sexual abuse and because it would not open up the floodgates, which would concern any Government in terms of expense, we have a moral obligation to put in place the most effective redress scheme for victims. We have a moral obligation to put in place the most effective redress scheme for victims. To differentiate between two victims because one was in a day school and one was not is unfair. The point made by Deputy Shortall about special schools is also relevant. We cannot <Col N="26" /> differentiate between two students who were abused in a special school where one was collected by his parents in the evenings and the other was not. There is a strong legal and moral argument to at least include day-pupils who were victims of sexual abuse because, under the Statute of Limitations, the State will be exposed to liability in the courts in any case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for an appeal by the claimant against an award to a review committee. The appeal will be a full re-examination of the claim. I do not agree that, given the nature of the compensation scheme now proposed, it would be appropriate to involve the High Court in reviews of awards as these amendments propose. One of the primary objectives of the scheme is to remove the issue of compensation from the formality and time-consuming procedures of the higher courts. As pointed out on Second Stage, involvement of a court in this scheme would blur the distinction between formal court proceedings and the compensation scheme and significantly dilute one of the main benefits of a compensation scheme, that is an expeditious resolution of claims.</P>
      <P>The scheme as it stands gives survivors of abuse who experienced very significant delays and uncertainties in litigation a quick and effective alternative. This will have none of the formal panoply of a court. Further, the level of inquiry by it into the facts of his or her history will be considerably less onerous as will his or her cross-examination. In the circumstances, having this scheme stand alone outside the normal litigation process is the appropriate approach to take. Where an applicant is unhappy with the level of an award, or where an award is not made, the option of an action in the courts remains open to him or her. Thus, a claimant can access the redress scheme up to the point where an award is determined, abandon it at that point, and pursue his or her case through the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inconsistency in the Minister's approach. He is forcing one category of victims &ndash; I do not differentiate between victims of day-schools and residential victims &ndash; to pursue cases through the courts because of the restrictive application of this Bill to those who were in residential institutions. At the same time he is denying the category of victims dealt with under the legislation the safety net of an appeal mechanism to the High Court if those victims are dissatisfied with the manner in which their claim for redress is dealt with by the redress board. That is a fundamental inconsistency. How can we slam the door shut on one category of victims that is told to go to the courts while attempting through this legislation to ring-fence another category of victims so they will not have access to the courts? This matter will either be dealt with through the courts or in a non-adversarial way. However, victims who are dissatisfied with the non-adversarial approach should be given a right of appeal to the High Court. That is the kind of safety net that will ensure the redress board being established under the legislation will deal fairly with the claims before it. I urge the Minister to reconsider his approach on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taken aback by the Minister's reply. He is more or less saying that it is not appropriate to have the High Court involved, that there is too much formality with regard to the High Court and that the court is time-consuming. The Minister should remember, when he speaks of the courts being time-consuming, that people have suffered pain and trauma for up to 25 years, as have their families. The Minister should not think that saving them half a day in the High Court is important when that half-day will give them an opportunity to explain to a High Court judge in open court the pain and hurt they suffered. The Minister, by his refusal, is attempting to deny them their right to explain in public court what they suffered. It is terribly wrong that the Minister even mentions the formality and time-consuming nature of the High Court as obstacles.</P>
      <P>The Minister also spoke of the blurring of the distinction between the High Court and the tribunal, and that there is to be a quick and effective way of dealing with these cases. The people involved are not looking for a conveyor belt system but for fair play, justice and a right to articulate their feelings. I am amazed that the Minister is attempting to cut off their right to appeal to the High Court at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, there has been an attitude in Government which sought to get rid of juries because they gave excessive awards. The only groups who had the courage of their convictions and stood up against that were the trade union movement and the Law Society &ndash; unlikely bedfellows, but at <Col N="28" /> least the trade union movement was anxious to ensure that those who suffer injury or death at work, or their families, have recourse to the courts where juries were giving awards. Juries have been abolished in this area and these cases are now decided by judges. It looks now as if the Government is to take away the rights of victims by moving away from that system. The courts were established under the Constitution and we should not lightly whittle away their rights. The Minister is denying the right to appeal to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I have received many letters and many people have come to me, some of whom were anxious that their names would be mentioned publicly. I have decided not to mention names at this point because if one mentions one or two and leaves out others, it would not be wise. This Bill has the potential to help provide redress for some of what took place in the not too distant past, but what the Minister is leaving out is very important to many of those people. If people are not happy with the award made or if they are not happy and get no award, they should have the right to appeal to the High Court. The courts of justice rather than a tribunal would have been a better way to deal with this. However, there will be a tribunal, but if people are not happy they should have the right to go to the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone has the right to go to the High Court at any time. The only reason I am bringing this in and taking on all that has gone through the House up to this stage is that we want to give people a simpler, more readily available method of pursuing their claims and getting compensation. There is no question but that this will be a much simpler process and it has been very widely welcomed. Indeed, the Deputies opposite have spoken again and again about the large numbers, the costs and so on but one will find that people will get satisfaction there.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like to make very clear is that in parallel, a report was done by the expert committee entitled, <i>Towards Redress and Recovery</i>. The decision to which the compensation advisory committee came was to compensate at the level of the High Court, not to drop to the level to which they dropped in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and elsewhere and to give payments consistent with those awarded at High Court level. It pitched the whole compensation process at that level. That is in the report. We discussed this earlier and it has been well ventilated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say there is no right of appeal in any event is totally wrong. There is the right of appeal to the High Court. When a person gets their award, they can consider it and decide whether they think it is adequate. At that stage they can decide to go to the High Court. When one comes to look at this system, one will see it is an easier one. The level and degree of proof required will be much simpler as will the harassment for the people going before it. Therefore, I think most people <Col N="29" /> will be happy to work through the compensation body. There is a right of appeal both before and after the event.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 7 extends the scope of the redress scheme to those who, as children, were sent to Magdalen Laundries from an institution already covered by the scheme, such as an industrial school, and were victims of abuse while children in the laundry. This extension is within the original intention of the Bill. I am not proposing that victims of abuse who were adults when that abuse took place should be covered by this scheme. This Bill cannot hope to address all the wrongs which occurred. It is, in essence, a measure to right the wrongs done to children where the State was <i>in loco parentis</i> and failed in its duty to protect them. In saying this, I must emphasise that I in no way wish to dismiss the fact that abuse of adults could and did occur in Magdalen Laundries or that the abuse was an appalling breach of trust or, indeed, that the vic<Col N="30" /> tims of that abuse suffered and continue to suffer greatly.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 9, I propose to extend the scope of the scheme to include those who as children suffered abuse in special schools, orthopaedic hospitals and other medical institutions. I was asked on Committee Stage to consider those who were abused in institutions other than those initially envisaged. I have included a number of new institutions in an amendment to the Schedule, including bodies such as the schools for the deaf and the visually impaired, schools for those with an intellectual disability and orthopaedic hospitals.</P>

I have considered this series of extensions very carefully and remain convinced that to allow applications in relation to schools where the State was not <i>in loco parentis</i> nor where it had the same regulatory and supervisory relationship with the State would be to stretch the scheme beyond any reasonable interpretation of its principles. Accordingly, I have not proposed that primary or post-primary schools, other than the residential institutions outlined in section 4 and in the Schedule, be covered. Calls were also made on behalf of those who, as children, were fostered and suffered abuse. There is no substantial evidence of widespread abuse in foster homes and, in the circumstances, I do not propose to extend the scheme to this category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I ask the Minister to clarify a point which he has not clarified so far. He is seeking to make a distinction between day pupils and boarders in special schools. That distinction is completely erroneous. If two children in class were abused and one was a day pupil and the other a boarder and if they were abused during school time, what is the basis for distinguishing between those two victims? It is a completely unsustainable position to adopt, namely for the Minister to discriminate against a victim purely on the grounds of whether a person was a boarder or a day pupil.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the basis for that distinction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Shortall are similar to the points we raised earlier in terms of the title of the Bill and its application to non-residential institutions. The danger is that this legislation will be challenged in the courts either by somebody who has not been given an opportunity to defend his or her good name against an allegation, as has happened in other jurisdictions, or on the basis of the points specifically under consideration here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of this legislation, a victim of abuse in a special school who was a resident in that school will be entitled to compensation, but somebody who suffered the same abuse but who was not a resident in the school will not be entitled to compensation. I would ask the Mini<Col N="31" /> ster to consider a point I made earlier, that his <i>in loco parentis</i> argument is not really relevant. Another point is that these special schools may have been schools for persons with physical, speech, hearing or visual impairment and, in addition to the reluctance of an abused person to tell their story because of the dominion held over them by the person who abused them, there may also have been a physical difficulty in communicating to their parents the abuse that was being perpetrated on them as day pupils. It is invidious to draw a distinction in terms of this legislation between residential and day pupils, particularly in the context of special schools. Abuse is abuse. We are not fireproofing this legislation against legal challenge and that will be its failing. It would be regrettable if the compensation process were to unravel because of our failure to amend the legislation. It is not sustainable to say to one pupil who sat in a classroom and was abused that he is entitled to compensation and to another that he is not. The <i>in loco parentis</i> argument simply does not stand up as it fails to take account of an abuser's dominion over the victim.</P>
    <P>It must also be considered that under the extension of the Statute of Limitations, many of these cases may already be before the courts. If the Minister limits entitlement of day pupils to those who suffered sexual abuse and those who have already availed of the extended Statute of Limitations and are before the courts, he cannot then argue that the floodgates will open. There is a defined number of people before the courts. In any event, the report of the advisory committee on compensation, to which the Minister referred earlier, has made the point that the compensation levels to be paid by the redress board will be commensurate with High Court awards, and that these day pupils, by virtue of the Statute of Limitations, have already lodged their cases with the High Court and are waiting to see whether they are to be forced down that road or can be compensated here. The net point is that the State will end up paying in any event, either before the courts or under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill. Why not, therefore, remove the adversarial costs of court proceedings and enable those day pupils to avail of the terms of the redress legislation? It is illogical to do otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague who quite rightly speaks of the contrasting situation of residents and day pupils in institutions. I want to make a specific point which relates to my constituency and to impress upon the Minister the need to take into account victims of sexual abuse in day schools. The Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is very much aware of the situation in Walsh Island national school in County Offaly where victims have been campaigning in isolation in recent years. A certain optimism was expressed prior to the current Minister taking office. I hope <Col N="32" /> that an appropriate amendment will be accepted that would allow these victims to be compensated.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the crime perpetrated upon the victims has already been recorded. The teacher in question was eventually charged and ultimately convicted in open court. However, no redress on the part of the State is available to the victims. That is why the extension of this legislation is so important. Teachers, such as the one in the Walsh Island case &ndash; and I am sure there are others throughout the country &ndash; were acting for and on behalf of the State. The Walsh Island teacher was not only employed by the State and acting on its behalf, he was also protected by the State.</P>
      <P>The deparmental file on this case will clearly show that complaints of a serious nature were made as far back as 25 years ago and were not acted upon by the Department. That is a scandal. Not only is the State not prepared to countenance the matter of compensation, but it actively protected this individual who was transferred from one school to another and employed again with references from the Church and public officials despite the knowledge in the Department that very serious complaints had been levelled against him. What do we say to the victims of this crime? I use the word &ldquo;crime&rdquo; advisedly because a crime has been recorded. What compensation is the Minister offering to these victims who have suffered hardship, anxiety, trauma, suffering and damage and have had to live with this for 25 years or more? Now, in 2002, we have an opportunity to compensate them. I welcome the extension the Minister announced last night but I acknowledge the persistence of Deputies Shortall, Creed and others in ensuring that this Bill became meaningful legislation. I welcome the fact that the Minister succumbed to pressure from Deputy Creed and others at the eleventh hour and I ask him to go a bit further.</P>

What has he to say to the victims, other than what he has said out of the side of his mouth, which is a comment unbecoming of any Minister, much less a man purporting to hold an education brief? I ask that the Minister introduce an appropriate amendment in response to a very well-put and deserving case. The Minister says it would open the floodgates. That is no excuse. If people have been wronged by the State, particularly if the State actively protected the wrongdoer, victims are entitled to a measure of compensation. I ask the Minister to include such an entitlement in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that 714 cases came before the Laffoy Commission and 100 of those victims were in non-residential institutions. This occurred in normal national schools, not just in Walsh Island national school in County Offaly, but also in Portarlington, Ballybrittas and Kilkenny, where a teacher was moved from school to school with glowing references. When victims complained, the abuser was afforded a veil of protection. Government Ministers concealed what was happening and allowed it to continue. This person was charged and found guilty by the courts. That is sad for his family but the victims are still suffering and the Minister will add insult to injury if he does not grant their right to compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that the State does not employ the teachers. Who paid the teachers in respect of the cases referred to by Deputies Enright and Flanagan? What function did Department inspectors have if not one of supervising the day to day operations of teachers in the classrooms?</P>
      <P>Earlier, I referred to vicarious liability and legal precedent in the UK. That will come back to haunt us. It is possible to deal with our requests in terms of day pupils in a fashion that will not incur any additional expense to the State because many, if not all, of these pupils have hedged their bets and, because of the extension of the statute of limitations, lodged claims with the courts. They will win in the courts but they will face the expense of the adversarial system and the associated trauma of giving evidence. The State will pay High Court compensation at levels that are exactly the same as those recommended by the compensation advisory committee. Will the Minister have the generosity to remove the obligation on them to go before the courts? Will he face up to the State's responsibility in this regard?</P>
      <P>This is a sorry chapter in our history and not a reflection of the Minister's tenure in office. It is a reflection on Irish society at a time when matters were swept under the carpet. We were not prepared to face up to the behaviour of people in positions of authority who abused children in their care, but there is now an opportunity to deal with this matter once and for all. I regret that the manner in which the Minister proposes to proceed is piecemeal, will inflict additional trauma on victims and will save the State nothing because ultimately it will have to pay in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated earlier in the debate that the difficulty about extending the legislation to non-residential institutions, and to day schools in particular, was that the floodgates would be opened because too many cases are involved. The Minister has now stated that the State did not employ the teachers and the reason for not extending the legislation to day schools is that there was no employer-employee relationship between the State and the teachers. Will the <Col N="36" /> Minister state in clear and unambiguous terms the reasons he is not prepared to accept the amendment? Why is the Minister prepared to exclude non-residential schools, particularly in open and shut cases where teachers have been convicted of the most heinous offences against vulnerable school children? Is he saying, as Minister for Education and Science, the State can absolve itself of all responsibility in this regard? Is he saying he is prepared to wash his hands of this matter altogether because the State had no responsibility? This is notwithstanding that school children are legally required to attend school, or that teachers &ndash; and, in the case in point, a headmaster &ndash; were paid by the Department. A file on each and every school teacher in the country is held in the Department of Education and Science, yet the Minister is attempting to absolve himself of all responsibility by saying, &ldquo;Ah, but the State doesn't actually employ them&rdquo;. That simply will not wash because, as Deputy Creed quite rightly said, there is a question of vicarious liability. The Minister should clearly spell out his reasons for not accepting this amendment, which would go some way towards facilitating a measure of redress.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage there was a long session during which Deputy Creed and I argued this case. I commend the Minister for having listened to us and for including those categories of victim which were not included in the original Bill. While that is to be welcomed, we also made a strong case for those who were abused in day schools. Not only did we do so but a number of the Minister's backbenchers made that case on Second Stage. There is an unanswerable case for including in the terms of the Bill those people who suffered abuse in day schools. The same backbenchers attended the committee when we met victims of abuse in day schools. They made sympathetic noises but I wonder where they are today. Why are they not here at the crucial time making the same points to the Minister? Perhaps it is because at the end of the day they will vote in favour of a Bill that excludes the people they purported to support.</P>
      <P>The point has already been made that there is no legal or moral basis for excluding people who were in the care of the State, in so far as they were attending schools that were funded by the State and were taught by teachers who were paid by the State. During that time the teachers, and in some cases teachers who abused them, were in <i>loco parentis.</i> Therefore, there is no excuse for excluding them from the terms of the Bill. There is certainly a strong moral obligation on the Minister to include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he was concerned about the floodgates opening but on numerous occasions we have said we are not talking about such an eventuality. We are talking about a specific category of people who suffered serious sexual abuse in day schools, where such abuse was established in court and where, in many cases, the per<Col N="37" /> petrators were convicted. That is not a wide category of people but they were badly damaged and wronged while in the care of the State. At this late stage, will the Minister reconsider the inclusion of those victims within the terms of the Bill? There is no moral or legal basis for excluding them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also raised the issue of including special schools but I am prepared to bet any money that there will be a legal challenge to that. There is no possible basis for drawing an arbitrary distinction between people who were abused in special schools on the basis of whether they were residents or day pupils. There is no question but that there will be a legal challenge in that regard. When day pupils in that situation win that case, as I believe they will, the follow on will mean that pupils in ordinary day schools will also be entitled to compensation. I am asking the Minister to reconsider that point because there is a real danger that his decision to exclude day pupils will be challenged in the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been a Member of the House for about 25 years. Consequently, he is familiar with parliamentary procedure and knows that at any time the Title to a bill can be changed. He stated, &ldquo;I have gone as far as I could go without changing the legislation&rdquo;, but he is still empowered to change the legislation by removing the word &ldquo;Residential&rdquo; from the Title. It could be entitled the &ldquo;Abuse and Injury Redress Bill&rdquo;, which would be adequate, and the amended Bill could then go to the Seanad without difficulty.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with people who had power and influence and who, in their own way, had control over other people of humble origins. The latter were good, proud and hard-working people but they did not have the ability or wherewithal to stand up to those with such power and influence. I did not want to have to go into this, but the Minister should remember that in connection with the Donal Dunne, Noel Conway and Brother Jack Kelly cases, between them there were 60 victims who testified in court. The Minister should remember also that approximately 20 teachers from day schools have been convicted on the evidence of 200 victims.</P>
      <P>In a matter of this nature it is up to the Government and the Minister to investigate. For the Minister to say his Department had no control over the teachers at the time is a serious abdication of his ministerial responsibility. His predecessor, Deputy Martin, said at the time that the handling of a written complaint in 1982 was seriously lacking, even by the standards of the time. On RTE's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme he said it was &ldquo;mind boggling&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1940, Donal Dunne's abuse was reported to the principal of Scoil Mhuire in Marino. In 1969, it was reported to the Garda Síochána, a Department of Education inspector and the school manager. In 1982 the matter was reported to the Department of Education, a school inspector and the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin. Donal Dunne <Col N="38" /> was first convicted for offences that occurred in 1995, decades after victims and parents had informed the authorities. The Tánaiste went on record and she said the State had less responsibility and no authority to exercise it. If ever there was clear nonsense, then that was it. The Minister must take out the word &ldquo;residential&rdquo;. If he does not he is allowing himself to be part of the continuation of abuse and of people in power holding on to power and not having the generosity and sense of fairness to pay compensation to those victims in national schools at the time. People across my constituency of Laois-Offaly suffered then and they are still suffering. If the State apologised to them and paid compensation it would be in the best interests of everybody. The Minister may walk away with his hands behind his back and say he can do nothing more to change the legislation, but I say that it can be changed today and I call upon him to change it.</P>

      <P>There are procedures for dealing with the type of case which Deputy Enright has raised. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform amended the Statute of Limitations to provide for cases like those mentioned by Deputies Enright and Flanagan, and those amendments were availed of. In the current situation I set out to accommodate the concerns expressed in a way consistent with the principles of the Bill as published and which would avoid a flood of claimants such as would overwhelm the survivors of institutional abuse for whom the scheme was devised in the first place.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands it applies to industrial and reformatory schools, to orphanages and children's homes, in respect of which public bodies had regulatory and supervisory functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As such, the Bill is quite narrowly and effectively focused on people whose parents to a degree were replaced by the State when they were children. The validation threshold in the Bill is very low, precisely because the Bill is so narrowly focused on a category of institution in respect of which there is general acceptance that the conditions in them frequently amounted to brutal and inhumane treatment, notwithstanding the Laffoy Commission which will not report for some years. Although there are incidences of abuse in the other places proposed, notably ordinary schools, there is no evidence of a generally abusive approach to children although it must be acknowledged that corporal punishment was widespread and often severe in all or virtually all ordinary schools up to the 1970s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances I consider that the extension of the scheme outside of the <Col N="39" /> residential institutions in respect of which public bodies had a significant role in child protection, would not be feasible in this Bill. Any such extension would either lead to a flood of claims or if criteria were set down to limit access to the scheme, these would be arbitrary and seen as very unfair and inequitable. This is particularly so in the case of ordinary schools. Proposals have been made to permit applicants to the scheme from ordinary schools where there has been a conviction of a school employee for abuse. This approach would deal with the validation issue but it would also create a strong sense of unfairness in the case of those who have suffered abuse but whose abusers cannot be prosecuted due to lack of evidence or because the abuser has died or the survivor cannot face the trauma and the stress of a criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>I propose accordingly that the terms of the Bill be extended to those instances where children were in residential care in institutions in respect of which public bodies had supervisory or regulatory functions. This involves extension of the compensation scheme to hospitals and special schools. We previously covered 77 institutions in the amendments and we will now cover 109 institutions and these institutions are set out in the text of amendment No. 103. It is a major extension within the context of the Bill as drafted and as completed on Committee Stage. I recommend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, will the Chair clarify a point of procedure? In effect, amendments Nos. 1, 8, 101, 102, are very similar in substance to amendments Nos. 3, 7, 9 and 103, which we are now discussing. In the grouping of those amendments, Nos. 1, 8, 101 and 102, for debate purposes, I take it that I will have an opportunity again to vote when we discuss amendment No. 8, because this is the last opportunity in this debate. While I welcome what the Minister has done in extending some concessions and increasing the number of institutions covered, my colleagues and I think the Minister has not done enough. This is the last opportunity to amend this legislation and I seek the guidance of the Chair as to whether I will have an opportunity of voting on amendment No. 8 when we reach it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;relevant person' means&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;a person who is referred to in an application as having carried out the acts complained of in the application, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;in the case of an institution that is referred to in an application as being the institution in which the acts complained of in the application were carried out, the person who is concerned with the systems of management, administration, operation, supervision, inspection and regulation of such institution as the institution concerned may determine and specify in writing to the Board;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the issue of accused persons speaking in their own defence. This matter was clearly one which caused a great deal of concern to Deputies. In particular it has been said that accused persons should have an opportunity to defend their reputation. It is not the intention of the Bill to create a court of law by another route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" />I also said I considered it to be a function of the commission to inquire into child abuse to deliberate on issues such as liability and responsibility for abuse. Ultimately, it is a matter for the courts to make findings of guilt in relation to individuals. However, I am conscious of the importance of this issue for many people and their desire to have a hearing if they are accused of abuse. In proposing these amendments I hope to allay the fears of those who feel justice may suffer if they are not allowed a hearing and the opportunity to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>In making these proposals I emphasise that these matters will remain confidential and that an award to an applicant does not mean that a corresponding person against whom allegations have been made is guilty. The board will now be required to inform accused persons and managers of institutions where allegations of abuse are made. The accused person may, at his or her own volition, make written representations to the board and may apply to the board to make oral representations. A refusal by the board to allow oral evidence can be reviewed by the review committee. An accused person may be represented by legal representatives and may cross examine his or her accuser in defence of his or her version of the truth and good name. An accused person may also be cross examined by the person who is alleging abuse.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, in such a scenario there will be a conflict of evidence and the amendments provide that in such an event medical evidence will prove decisive. If the medical evidence establishes injury consistent with abuse as alleged, compensation will be paid. Overall, the provisions are a balanced and measured approach to the issue of potential false accusation. We are dealing here with an issue raised and discussed on Committee Stage and with these amendments I am attempting to meet the concerns raised by Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unsatisfactory that amendment No. 34, which is detailed and lengthy, was made available to Opposition spokespersons only this morning. The amendments under consideration deal with serious concerns raised on Committee Stage, including by the Minister's backbenchers. In view of what the Minister has said they go a considerable way towards allaying them.</P>
      <P>International comparisons can be considered when drafting legislation in this area. I understand the process in Nova Scotia unravelled because of the failure to notify persons against whom allegations were made and who challenged the findings. It placed a question mark on all awards made to victims because it brought the process into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair that individuals against whom allegations of abuse are made are notified and given the opportunity, if they wish, to defend their good names. However, debate on this aspect must be cognisant of other provisions in the Bill, <Col N="42" /> including the provision that acceptance of an award from the redress board obliges the victim to undertake not to pursue the perpetrator through the courts. I suspect that in many of the bona fide cases that will come before the redress board, the accused on notification will not avail of the entitlement to legal representation and to make submissions. Nevertheless, it is vital that a safety net is provided to ensure that nobody's good name is tarnished without the opportunity of defence.</P>
    <P>Given that we received these amendments only this morning, will the Minister indicate if the conclusions I make about their implications are correct? Will he confirm that any persons against whom an allegation is made will have the right to defend their good name if they wish? Where the alleged perpetrator is deceased is the redress board obliged to notify family members? Not all alleged perpetrators will have been members of religious orders, for example, some may have been employees. While it is unsatisfactory to have received these amendments at such short notice, I welcome the thrust of them in so far as they appear to address the concerns raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate Deputy Creed's point on the short notice in relation to these amendments. On Committee Stage we asked the Minister to ensure we would have a period of at least four or five days to consider his amendments before Report and Final Stages. Regrettably, he has not complied with our request. We received most of these amendments at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. this morning and have had no opportunity to consider them in detail. It is a very unsatisfactory way to treat Members and to expect us to do our job.</P>
      <P>I recognise the Minister has taken on board points made on Committee Stage. However, I believe we are creating a monster here. If a survivor makes allegations and the accused has a right to refute them we are essentially asking the board to act as a court of law, to establish if the abuse took place and to determine if the accused is responsible and guilty. I do not see how a board set up in this manner can have the power to act in this way.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that, ultimately, the medical evidence will decide the matter. Is the person alleged to have inflicted the abuse entitled to have it refuted? Where does it end and who adjudicates on this? In the limited time I have had to consider this aspect it is apparent that we are making a big mistake to proceed on this basis. The purpose of the board is to allow a speedy redress to be made to victims, many of whom are in middle or old age, but this will not happen if the Minister takes this approach. The deliberations of the board are likely to proceed for an endless period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal basis for establishing the board in this manner is questionable. It is impossible to expect members of a board to adjudicate on these <Col N="43" /> serious issues. The Minister is creating a monster: this is not the right way to go about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially what Deputy Creed said is correct. A person would have a right to defend their good name and to put the case. In respect of a deceased person, the institution would be informed. Regarding the issue raised by Deputy Shortall, that was always my concern and is one of the reasons that initially we did not take that route. No matter which route one takes one has to walk a tight rope, and we are making provision for natural justice to apply. The board will not make any finding, that will be a matter for the Laffoy Commission, but it will rely on the medical evidence in relation to cases. One can have a settlement irrespective of any of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

      <P>When the Taoiseach originally apologised to the victims of abuse it was flagged at that stage that there would be a compensation tribunal with all the panoply of powers which tribunals have in terms of legal standing, finding of fact, etc. Inadvertently or otherwise, in his reply the Minister referred to &ldquo;natural justice&rdquo;, &ldquo;defending their good name&rdquo; and &ldquo;putting the case&rdquo;. These phrases, as well as &ldquo;the apportioning of blame&rdquo; appear to be the language of a court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what way it is dressed up it appears as if the redress board, or the review committee which will ultimately review a finding of the redress board, will make findings of fact in individual cases. Given that we have recognised that it would be against the principles of natural justice to make those findings without giving the alleged perpetrators of abuse a right to put their case, are we not back to the point I made on Second and Committee Stages that what we should be establishing is a tribunal with all the necessary legal supports to make findings of fact? I welcome the thrust of the amendment which proposes to allow access in natural justice to alleged perpetrators but in many respects it is melting the ice under the Minister and making a strong case for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry and compensation similar to the hepatitis C tribunal which is awarding compensation rather than this redress board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Natural justice does not just apply in the courts, it applies in all administrations. It is a normal part of life in ensuring that people against whom there is an allegation have an opportunity to at least put their side of the case <Col N="44" /> in any of those instances. There will be no apportioning of blame, no finding of fact. The finding of fact will be a matter for the Laffoy Commission. In effect two things are going on in parallel. That was the road we chose to go from the beginning. We could have said, and that was the view earlier, that when the Laffoy Commission reported one could then take up the compensation issue, but that would take a long time to complete. For that reason we discussed the issue and come to the conclusion that it would be preferable to run a parallel compensation redress board in the interest of the victims and survivors. That is what this amendment is designed to do. I am of the view that we are making reasonable arrangements to cover the points raised by Deputies and that they are workable. In any event there can be a settlement if such a case arises as Deputies fear.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="48" />(<i>c</i>) that he or she was injured while so resident and that injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The text of section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) currently requires that an applicant should prove that he or she was abused while resident in an institution. It is more appropriate that an applicant should show that he or she was injured in a manner consistent with abuse, given that there will be no detailed inquiry into the facts of abuse. The Bill is based on the understanding that, at many years remove, it will be almost impossible for many applicants to prove, even on the balance of probabilities, that they were abused in a particular institution at a particular time by a particular individual.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach acknowledged in 1999, there is no doubt that abuse occurred in these institutions and that victims are entitled to redress. It would be cruel to force on them a standard of proof which would be all but impossible to meet. The scheme provides for an applicant to show injuries consistent with abuse. This would be the question for the board to determine. I have indicated that those who have allegations made against them will have an opportunity to defend their reputations.

      <P>In page 7, line 19, to delete &ldquo;of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;concerning the Statutes of Limitations or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I sought to restrict the right of those whose case had been the subject of a determination by a court to make an application to the board. That was entirely correct as it would be inappropriate for the board to make decisions over the heads of the courts. However, in so far as an applicant has had a determination made solely in relation to the statute of limitations, it would be unduly harsh to rule out the redress <Col N="49" /> route. This process deliberately avoids applying a time bar on applications.</P>
    <P>The principal obstacle faced by potential plaintiffs in taking a case involving abuse in residential institutions before the courts is the passage of time and it would be unfair to compound that difficulty. This amendment specifically provides that a determination relating only to the statute of limitations will not rule out an applicant from the compensation scheme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where an award is made in respect of an application pursuant to this section, the Board shall direct that such award be paid to the personal representatives of the deceased person referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> or the applicant referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i> and that the personal representatives shall treat such award as if it had been paid to such deceased person or such applicant immediately prior to his or her death.</P>
      <P>(5) In this section &lsquo;personal representative' has the meaning assigned to it by the Succession Act, 1965.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is technical in nature. Its purpose is to clarify the procedures for the distribution of awards to the spouses, partners or children of victims who have passed away between the time of the Taoiseach's statement in 1999 and the making of an award. Awards made will be distributed in accordance with either the will or intestacy of the deceased applicant. This is in accordance with well established succession law and is the fairest approach to the issue. The purpose, therefore, is to distribute awards in accordance with the Succession Act if no will has been made.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Creed's concern about this matter. A quorum of three board members for a hearing might be desirable but regard must be had to the workload of the board and the absolute necessity that its work is completed without undue delay. It is likely that the board will sit in panels. If each panel is to include three rather than two people, it complicates greatly the process of finding a sufficient number <Col N="50" /> of people with the appropriate skills to carry out this work. Two person panels are appropriate and will lead to an efficient and effective process.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(10) The Board may make an interim award where&ndash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" />(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;it makes a preliminary decision in accordance with <i>subsection (9) </i>that the applicant is entitled to an award,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;it is satisfied that it is probable, having regard to all the circumstances, that an award that is equal to or greater than the amount of the interim award will be made in respect of the applicant,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;it is of the opinion that having regard to the age or infirmity of an applicant the making of an interim award is appropriate in the circumstances,</P>
    <P>and such interim award shall not exceed &euro;10,000 and it shall deduct the amount of such interim award from the award made in accordance with <i>section 13</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The compensation advisory committee reported to me recently and that report was published on 15 January. Among the recommendations was the desirability of provision being made for an interim payment where an applicant is getting on in years or is unwell. For a great many of the victims, the suffering and injury was manifested in their economic conditions throughout their lives. The damage is not limited in time to the years of childhood spent away from parental care and it is not limited in scope to the physical and psychological. It is a sad fact that some applicants will not live to see the final award that the board may make in their own case, yet there is much to say in favour of an interim payment. That could relieve immediate economic hardship and serve as a symbol of the recompense society is making while the victim can still appreciate the gesture. This was a sensible and compassionate proposal and I am pleased to bring it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister see fit to limit the size of an interim reward to &euro;10,000 if the report to the Minister for Education and Science by the compensation advisory committee recommends that all awards be commensurate with High Court awards? Why not have the interim award base at the minimum level of compensation that the High Court would allocate in any case? If it is satisfied that an award is due, why not make it the minimum amount that would be allocated in the High Court because the &euro;10,000 maximum for an interim reward is unduly small? Why not make the interim award the minimum award recommended by the advisory committee. I refer to page 67 of the compensation advisory committee report which states that in regard to band 1, the award payable would be &euro;50,000. I fail to understand why we are pitching the amount at &euro;10,000 as an interim when the High Court would award from &euro;50,000 upwards. Perhaps the Minister might consider that matter during the lunch break.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The ministerial air transport service is provided by the Air Corps to facilitate members of the Government in fulfilling their official engagements at home and abroad. General guidelines for Ministers regarding the use of the service are contained in paragraph 1.29 of the Cabinet Handbook. All use of the service requires my approval which is given in the broad context of these guidelines.</P>
      <P>The number of flights sanctioned from 1 July 1997 to date is 1,204. No record is kept of refusals. Requests for use of the service are made by Ministers' private secretaries to my office in accordance with procedures and dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office. Requests are examined by my staff in accordance with the guidelines referred to above and any necessary clarification or further information is sought. All screened requests are then submitted to me for approval. I have no plans to review the operation of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe that the use of the aircraft by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to open an off-licence in County Leitrim was a mistake? Has he conveyed this view to her in the light of the publicity which surrounded the matter? Will <Col N="53" /> he confirm that an admirer of the Minister who supports her party &ndash; I think his name is Mr. Fernandez &ndash; offered to pay, or is cited as having paid, the estimated cost of the flight to the Department of Defence? If so, was the money received and how will it feature in the accounts? Is it included as appropriations-in-aid? How is such money normally received by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has acknowledged that there was a personal element to the event in Manorhamilton and that, with the benefit of hindsight, she would have made different travel arrangements. However, the decision to authorise the use of the MATS was correct and justified as it was based on official use of the Minister's time for a formal opening. The Minister made it clear that she would not have done so if she had not been pressed for time that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with her judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, yes. In fairness to the Minister, she does an enormous amount of travelling within the country trying to visit boards and staff of companies in the case of closures. To her credit, she puts enormous effort into such work. She was trying to fit an enormous amount of work into the day in question and has made her position clear. I do not have the details, but I understand the payment referred to by the Deputy was made and received. I presume it was listed as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated he sanctioned about 1,000 helicopter flights and that his office advises him on what is and is not appropriate. Does his office have a protocol or guidelines under which it operates and, if so, what are they? Does he think the guidelines should change between now and the general election? Will Ministers have the use of Air Corps transport during the general election campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of flights approved is 1,200, which includes all aircraft, not just helicopters. In recent years the use of helicopters has declined fairly dramatically. They are no longer used that much.</P>
      <P>The guidelines under which the officials work are set down and fairly detailed. A request for a long flight has to be lodged a considerable period of time before the required date. In the case of a European flight, the request must be made one week before the date. If the flight is internal, the notice period is shorter, but officials endeavour to ensure the request is made one week in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure is that the private secretaries to <Col N="54" /> Ministers and Ministers of State first apply to my officials who make a judgment. If the flight is to Brussels or whichever country holds the Presidency of the European Union, there is an effort to amalgamate arrangements to limit the number of flights and facilitate Ministers and Ministers of State who would normally travel at the same time. If a request is cleared by officials, I will formally clear it. It is then formally sent to the Department of Defence for clearance.</P>
    <P>An application must formally include details such as the date and time of departure, the destination, the required arrival time, whether the departure is critical in order that flights can be combined, the date and time of return, airports, the number and names of passengers, outward journeys and a contact name should there be a change due to weather or travel arrangements. Officials make an initial judgment and requests approved at that stage are sent to me for formal approval. The request must then be matched up with the Department of Defence. It is not always possible for the Air Corps to meet a request because of maintenance or the limited number of aircraft. However, it provides the service to the best of its ability.</P>
    <P>We try to use the MATS sparingly for internal flights, but no one will be able to use it during an election unless he or she is going on official business outside the country to an EU meeting which has to take place. People will only be able to use the service in those circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>A good friend of mine, the late J. B. O'Hagan, was involved in another controversial political flight when he left the Taoiseach's constituency unexpectedly in a helicopter in 1973. Perhaps the Taoiseach remembers the occasion. Unlike the Tánaiste's excursion, however, Mr. O'Hagan's flight was widely welcomed. Does the Taoiseach not agree that at a time when our fishing industry is under continuing threat, the use of an aircraft dedicated to fishery protection to carry the Tánaiste to County Leitrim to open an off-licence was totally inappropriate? On a more positive note, is the Taoiseach aware that people in rural Ireland, especially in areas removed from large towns with hospital facilities in the west &ndash; including County <Col N="55" /> Leitrim &ndash; and the midlands and border counties, have been campaigning for a helicopter emergency medical service which could save lives? Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he would support such a service?</P>

      <P>I am not too sure about the first part of the question. I thought the Deputy was going to invite me to claim the bill for that flight. However, that was a private helicopter and I think the poor pilot lost his job or vanished. These flights are used sparingly within the jurisdiction. The second question is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. I heard him answer that recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Does the Taoiseach not find it demeaning and utterly inappropriate for the Prime Minister or deputy Prime Minister of a state to run around the country opening pubs, off-licences and supermarkets? Does he accept that ordinary taxpayers are appalled that their funds are being abused to facilitate the deputy Prime Minister attending the opening of a private business because of some personal friendship? Does he not agree that it is a gross abuse of taxpayers' funds and that the use of a fisheries protection aircraft for this mission is particularly inappropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The CASA is very rarely used by any office holders. Under 2% of its use is for that purpose. It is only used when no other aircraft is available. The CASA has its daily routine and when it is finished that it will undertake a flight if it is available in an emergency or at short notice. It is never removed from fishery protection duties for this purpose. The CASA undertakes rotational trips on a daily basis and these are not affected.</P>
      <P>The argument that Deputy Joe Higgins makes is unusual as people usually complain that Ministers and Ministers of State do not spend enough time out in the regions. They are constantly being asked to undertake engagements by people in rural communities. The Tánaiste did so, but she has given her own view on the matter and there is no need for me to reiterate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the function of opening off-licences in a local authority area such as County Leitrim could easily be carried out by the chairman of the county council, the manager of the county team or a whole array of publicly elected representatives? Does he not find it incongruous that the Tánaiste and Minister with responsibility for the largest single Department in the State, who at present has seven Bills at different Stages to deal with, is making a false choice and undermining her role by diverting scarce resources so that she can open an off-<Col N="56" /> licence in County Leitrim when she could be in this House or in her office? She was not only elected to this House but is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Does the Taoiseach agree this is precisely the sort of behaviour that brings politicians and the whole profession of politics into disrepute?</P>
      <P>Can he indicate whether, in the case of an application for ministerial air transport before his Department, where the normal aircraft is not available and the CASA must be used, the matter is referred back to his Department, having regard to the role of the European Commission which significantly co-funded the aircraft and helps to monitor its use? If he does not have a monitoring system in place, will his Department ensure that requests for the CASA receive special scrutiny and agreement from the Taoiseach? Will he give an undertaking to put such a monitoring system in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years the CASA has only been used for this purpose 40 times out of 1,200 trips and only when it is required. It is used sparingly and only short trips from coastal locations are taken. The Department of Defence makes sure that it is used only rarely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but once I have approved a flight the Air Corps makes the decision. As can be seen from the figures, the CASA is used only rarely. It is certainly never used for other purposes when it is required for coastal duties. The CASA is not the best means of flying. I have experienced it on a few occasions and it is not the best experience I have ever had.</P>

      <P>Exactly, and a few other things too. However, I do not want to go over this again. The Tánaiste said what she said, but she certainly would not have been here in the House at night on the Friday before Christmas passing legislation. She endeavoured to do a full day's work on that occasion and achieved a number of important things. Running out of time for her own programme, she then undertook an official engagement that was also important to her on a personal level. She has clearly stated her position so there is no point in my saying any more about it.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Taoiseach accept that the CASA is a specialist aircraft? It is chock-a-block with technical equipment for doing the business it is supposed to do, namely fishery surveillance work. Because of this, it should not be used on any occasion for work other than that. <Col N="57" /> It is totally different from the other aircraft available. One can appreciate the need for its use on rare and exceptional occasions such as the removal of the remains of the late Mr. Jack Lynch from Dublin to Cork because the existing helicopters obviously could not take the coffin. However, apart from occasions such as this, it should not be used.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that a clear set of guidelines is required, setting down exactly what constitutes an official engagement? By elimination one can then arrive at what constitutes an unofficial engagement, which this certainly was. It was an abuse of taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>The CASA is only used on exceptional occasions. I have already given the figures which prove that is the case. It is only used where there is no other means of transport available. I have already answered the Deputy's other question. The guidelines are quite clear. As in all of these cases they can be interpreted differently. The Tánaiste has her own interpretation of the guidelines. In the normal course of events the opening of a business would be cleared as an official engagement, but the Tánaiste has explained that this engagement also had a personal element.</P>

      <P>In his response to the second part of my earlier question the Taoiseach said that it was a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. It is incumbent on Government to make a decision and to articulate a position on the helicopter emergency medical service. Does the Taoiseach see a role for the Air Corps in the provision of such a service? That service is an absolute requirement for vast swathes of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have no role in decisions by certifying officers under the provisions of the National Archives Act, 1986. The responsibility for certifying files for retention is vested by section 8(4) of the Act in officers of the Department authorised for that purpose in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>A total of 528 files, or part files, were transferred by my Department to the National Archives at the end of 2001 to be released for public inspection on 1 January 2002 and 13 were withheld. Of the 13 withheld under Section 8(4) of the National Archives Act, 1986, ten were withheld under sections 8(4)(<i>b</i>) and 8(4)(<i>c</i>) and three were withheld under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). These files therefore contain certain records, release of which, in the opinion of the certifying officer, (a) would be contrary to the public interest, or (b) would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty, or a breach of good faith on the grounds that they contain information supplied in confidence, and (c) would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the grounds that they contain information about individuals, or would or might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation.</P>
      <P>Files in my Department which relate to Northern Ireland are released annually to the National Archives, as provided for in the Act. In the case of the 1971 files, there are 58 such files. None of these are among the 13 withheld.</P>
      <P>In respect of a number of other documents, some minor abstractions were made under section 8(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Act. The abstractions included either the names and addresses of correspondents, or sentences or paragraphs which referred to individuals or expressed views about individuals which, if released, could cause distress or danger to the individuals or lead to an action for defamation. In addition a small number of abstractions were made under Section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) or 8(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Act. These related to security matters and or information given in confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Files of my Department in respect of the year 1969 were transferred to the National Archives in <Col N="59" /> 1999 and made available for public inspection on 1 January 2000. No complete files were withheld under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) of the National Archives Act, 1986 by my Department in respect of the year 1969. However, some minor abstractions were made from parts of one file series under section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Taoiseach's reply answers the question I posed in Question No. 6. He is aware that there was a story in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 6 January 2002 in which an eminent historian, Ronan Fanning, described as ludicrous the case of a speech by John Hume attacking William Craig and Ian Paisley where the names Craig and Paisley were deleted from the official record yet the entire speech with their names was attached to the record. This seems to be taking section 8(4)(<i>c</i>) to a ludicrous extent. Does the Taoiseach seriously think that Ian Paisley will take an action for defamation against the State because his name is recorded? Can he explain his view because in his reply he does not appear to have answered that part of the question? Will this practice continue or is it an excessive oversight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened in that case is that the abstractions were made on the document and the full speech was put in. The abstractions on that occasion were a mistake. Abstractions are made where people who held strong and trenchant views sent in detailed letters and on releasing those documents the National Archives, not knowing whether those people are dead or still hold the same views, eliminates the names and addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the story brought to our attention by the media and Professor Ronan Fanning, does the Taoiseach or the personnel of the National Archives have any intention to change the practice of how they apply the legislation in relation to these matters &ndash; the sensitivity of and inclusion of names?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The case mentioned was clearly a mistake and nobody was trying to hide anything. In the normal course of events if there are letters stating views or policies the National Archives, to be helpful, issues correspondence that emanated at that time. The correspondence shows different points of view and gives a flavour of what was coming between the public and the Taoiseach of the day. What the National Archives did under section 8(4) (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) was to extract the names. They allowed the comments but extracted the names. That should not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was made succinctly by Professor Ronan Fanning that if someone in 1971 was sufficiently self-confident of his or her views to write trenchantly to the Taoiseach giving a full name and address that person has already made <Col N="60" /> a decision as to whether publication of his or her name will cause distress. In that instance is abstraction of the name not an excessive interpretation of article 8(4)(<i>c</i>) of the legislation? Will the Taoiseach consult historians as to what would be best practice in relation to this? We all get letters from people and know that we disregard those without names and addresses and respect those with them. If an original letter has a freely given name and address it is relevant from the point of view of good archival practice that historians should be consulted as to how best to administer this section of the legislation. I quoted one example but it is evident that the practice is more extensive than a few isolated incidents suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but the view has been taken that in those days people wrote letters to the Taoiseach of the day and Departments. It was prior to the legislation on freedom of information. It would be impossible for the National Archives to go back to those people to check whether they want their names released. We are left with the choice of leaving out the letters or leaving out the names and including the letters to give the flavour of what was going on at the time. People can change their views over 30 years and we can see that from some of the comments made and the views expressed then. People might not be so precious on some matters but the National Archives advisory council may be the people to have discussion on the matter.</P>

        <b>: </b>Can I ask the Taoiseach about file No. S17418 of 1969 concerning former-Lieutenant Donal de Róiste who was retired from the Army under section 18(f) of the Defence Forces Regulations? That section removes somebody from the Army against their will with no reasons given and no opportunity provided for them to answer allegations made behind the scenes. It is a section that has since been abolished because of its gross violation of the principles of natural justice. In that regard, will the Taoiseach sort out a conflict between what he said today with regard to the files concerning <Col N="61" /> 1969, which was that no file was withheld under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of the National Archives Act, 1986, and a letter to the Taoiseach's colleague Brian Crowley MEP on 21 May 2001 in which the Taoiseach said that Donal de Róiste's file was withheld from public inspection under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of the National Archives Act, 1986?</P>
      <P>A former chief of the Defence Forces has said in a newspaper article that Lieutenant de Róiste was perhaps retired because he visited some Dublin pubs, which in the 1960s we used to quaintly call &ldquo;singing pubs&rdquo;. Donal de Róiste is now trying to clear his name but has no access to the relevant files. Does the Taoiseach agree that the files should be released to Donal de Róiste so that he can see what he was accused of and vindicate his good name? He should not have to wait 100 years like former Garda Geary, who was vindicated some time back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said about files relating to 1969. Files of my Department in respect of 1969 were transferred to the National Archives in 1999 and made available for public inspection on 1 January 2000. All those files are available for public inspection. No complete files were withheld under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) of the National Archives Act, 1986 by my Department in respect of 1969. The Deputy will note that I said &ldquo;no complete files&rdquo;. However, some minor abstractions were made from parts of one file series under section 8(4) (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). I do not know if that refers to this matter and I do not know if it was transferred in 1969 or if it is from another period.</P>
      <P>This is clearly a personnel matter and one related to a dismissal if I understand the Deputy correctly. He should take the matter up with the Minister for Defence. No files from 1969 were withheld other than abstractions, which would not have included the matter raised by the Deputy. If there are personnel or security issues involved, the Deputy should take the matter up with the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Since there is a conflict between what the Taoiseach wrote in May 2001 and his note for today, will he ask his Department if they can clear it up for me and correspond with me on whether it was an abstraction relating to this particular file? Section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) states that the files can be maintained on the grounds that they contain information supplied in confidence. Section 8(4)(<i>c</i>) states that information in the files might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation. Would section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) be covered if the person who supplied the information is not named but the information, on which serious actions were taken and a man dismissed from the Army, was made known to the man so dismissed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody was wronged, is section 8(4)(<i>c</i>) not an injustice and should it not be changed? Is it not unjust that somebody was dismissed, for <Col N="62" /> example, on the basis of gossip or material that was not put to him so he did not have the opportunity to defend his good name? Does the Taoiseach agree that the moral right suggests that former Lieutenant de Róiste should be made aware of this? For the Taoiseach's information, the Minister for Defence is refusing to give any information on the matter. I look to the Taoiseach to give justice to a citizen who seeks to vindicate his good name and has no problem with all the facts being brought into the open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm what Deputy Higgins is saying? Does the Taoiseach's information indicate what portion of the file was transferred &ndash; the Taoiseach indicated that the complete file was not transferred &ndash; and what portion was retained? Do the sections of the file retained refer to former Lieutenant de Róiste? Can I confirm that the Department of Defence will not make the information available to Deputies or to the person directly concerned, and that the Taoiseach, who has responsibility for the National Archives, has the power to enable this citizen to see the file which was the basis for his dismissal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise the matter. I have no particular information on that. Re-reading the reply that I earlier read to the House, I interpret it, perhaps incorrectly, to mean that no complete files, apart from minor abstractions, were withheld. However, I will clarify that issue. I have no information about the individual referred to here although I obviously answered some letters on this in the recent past. In many cases where people were dismissed on security grounds, there is a security difficulty for the Garda Commissioner or the Army Chief of Staff concerning the release of information. I am not sure that is the case in relation to this matter and do not want to wrong the individual concerned. I will communicate with both Deputies who raised the matter.</P>

    <P>Together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I met Prime Minister Blair and Secretary of State Reid in Downing Street on Monday last. We reviewed the political situation <Col N="64" /> in Northern Ireland and the progress generally in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as well as the elements of the package agreed at Weston Park last July.</P>
    <P>In addition to the need for further decommissioning, which remains an indispensable part of implementing the Agreement, we discussed the appointment of a judge of international standing to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion by the security forces in a number of serious cases, including the murders of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. We also discussed progress in the area of policing and the encouraging work to date of the Policing Board. Follow up on a number of other areas, including demilitarisation, was also reviewed. We also had an opportunity to discuss parades as well as the ongoing criminal justice review.</P>
    <P>The meeting in Downing Street also focused on the upcoming European Council meeting in Barcelona as well as EU issues generally and particularly the Convention on the Future of Europe which begins its work in the next few weeks. The Government's continuing concerns regarding Sellafield were also raised with the Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>I also met the Deputy First Minister and leader of the SDLP, Mark Durkan, the deputy leader, Bríd Rodgers and Alex Attwood, an SDLP nominee to the Policing Board, in Government Buildings on Thursday, 31 January 2002. We discussed the work of the Policing Board and its role in relation to the Ombudsman's report into the investigation of the Omagh bombing. Our discussions also focused on the work of the North-South institutions and how they might be improved, particularly through increasing co-operation, North and South, as well as the criminal justice review. As part of ongoing contacts with the political parties in Northern Ireland, I also met the Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams this morning. I very much welcome the recent report of the Policing Board on the Omagh investigation. The board has given a detailed, measured response to the issues raised by the ombudsman and the McVicker report, and that response deserves careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that both the ombudsman and the Chief Constable support the recommendations of the board and I hope that the Omagh relatives will also be able to place their trust in the board's recommendations. I look forward to a close working relationship between the gardaí, the external investigation officer and the assistant chief constable to be appointed in an oversight role.</P>
    <P>This has been a very difficult issue for the Policing Board and reaching an agreed outcome represents a significant achievement. The board deserves great credit for resolving complex, sensitive issues with authority for the benefit of policing and the community as a whole. I hope that the new structure of the investigation will help achieve the objective we all want &ndash; to bring those who perpetrated this awful crime to justice.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, it is an issue that is on the agenda. I hope we can continue to progress on all issues, including this one. It is an important issue and, as always, if we can keep moving forward on all aspects, then I think we can make progress. There is nothing imminent of which I am aware but then I would not be. There is a commitment to engagement with General de Chastelain and a commitment to continue to deal with this issue as part of a process without putting it up in lights and creating difficulties for everybody involved. As regards all of the issues &ndash; decommissioning, demilitarisation, OTRs and the exiled &ndash; there is a commitment on the part of all parties to try to move on and to stick to the commitments entered into.</P>

      <P>In the course of his discussions with Prime Minister Blair, was the position of OTRs &ndash; people on the run who are suspects and will possibly be charged with violent crimes of one kind or another in relation to the political troubles in Northern Ireland &ndash; raised? Will any changes or extensions of amnesties in regard to OTRs be extended to people here whom the Garda Síochána are seeking to apprehend or to have returned? Have they been included in the overall proposal? In order to encourage decommissioning, will OTRs be given an amnesty? I ask the Taoiseach, in the context of his discussion with Mr. Gerry Adams, whether any movement by the two Governments in relation to OTRs being sought by the security forces would equally apply to people the Provisional IRA and the republican movement have expelled unilaterally from their own communities in Northern Ireland and, in some cases, in the South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is, yes. I discussed in detail the issue of OTRs which has been around for a considerable length of time. It is hoped that we can reach a conclusion on this. There are problems in the British administration system, in British law and in British legislation dealing with this. Some progress has been made and some cases have been dealt with on an administrative basis. I went through that process with Prime Minister Blair and Secretary of State John Reid to try to see how we can best deal with it; I think there is a commitment to try to do that. Linked to that &ndash; I raised this with Mr. Adams today as well &ndash; is the question of people who were exiled. That is also a big issue. I refer to people who were exiled to the Republic or exiled off the island completely. There certainly is an attempt to&mdash;</P>

Many initiatives have been researched, many proposals have been put in place and many concepts have already been enacted to extend this. It is something with which the Assembly is increasingly anxious to co-operate and with which the Government is prepared to deal. There are many individual initiatives which are worthy of support on an all-Ireland basis.</P>

In the course of his talks with Mr. Blair and other political leaders, did the discussion range across the issue of cross-community and cross-Border co-operation outside that which occurs at governmental level? While the Good Friday Agreement is working in Stormont, it is certainly not working in the Ardoyne and in other places. What proposals, if any, have the Taoiseach and the British Government to promote more inter-community and cross-community activity, co-operation and communication and cross-Border co-operation at non-governmental levels?</P>

        <b>: </b>The Taoiseach mentioned that one of the issues discussed was Sellafield. Did the Taoiseach raise the manner in which the British Government has again flouted the guidelines, rules and agreement in relation to accuracy of information supplied by allowing quantities of radioactive spent fuel far in excess of that agreed between the RPII and the Sellafield authorities to be processed? I refer to spent fuel from Scot<Col N="67" /> land and Germany far in excess of the guidelines and amounts agreed and set down by the various court hearings in terms of the provision of accurate information to the authorities here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Deenihan, there are a number of initiatives, through the Assembly and the Government, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the North-South bodies, which try to generate cross-community support. There are many others, NGO related or voluntary, for example, the Ireland Fund, where there is direct involvement in these initiatives. At recent meetings with officials we have been examining areas such as north and east Belfast where there are large communities which, regardless of sectarian difficulties or from what side of the divide they come, experience social problems, lack of resources or investment, and have been starved of any kind of employment for two generations. We need to try to build some kind of cross-community co-operation in these areas because, as long as high unemployment and other ongoing difficulties continue, people can get sucked into sectarianism, paramilitarism and so on. There is concern that areas where people suffer social difficulty tend to have ongoing problems while others move on and are quite successful.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Higgins, we discussed the MOX plant and, particularly, the issues surrounding it, our stated position on UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the aspects of it that we do not believe the British are fulfilling. I have outlined our position on moving ahead in the autumn with the arbitration system, which will be a big legal effort for us, but one we must undertake.</P>
      <P>We are also examining the EU aspects of this and other provisions, because many of them come within the competence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. I am not confident that we will ever get an inspectorate that will comply with the arrangements because conflict is ongoing and, no matter what is set down at a meeting, we are back to the old position by the time we meet again. The law of the sea, in so far as it affects the marine in the context of the mixed oxide plant, not to mind the other aspects of Sellafield, is something this country needs to have defined. Even if this takes a considerable amount of resources and time, it is in our interests to pursue it.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the rise in medical card eligibility limits for 2002 was so low that several categories of people on social welfare who qualified in 2001 no longer qualified.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, they are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The Deputy is no doubt aware that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility.</P>
      <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy launched by the Government late last year. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services, to which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to last year's extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes eligible for a medical card and give priority to families with children, particularly children with a disability.</P>
      <P>My Department advised the health board chief executive officers in writing last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget. In addition, the health boards have been asked that every effort be made to ensure both medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. During 2002 the Government's priorities for improving the health system will include: 709 <Col N="69" /> additional acute public hospital beds and 200 beds contracted from the private sector; addressing waiting times through a new treatment purchase fund; commencing implementation of the new model of primary care; services for people with a disability; and services for older people.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Government's commitment to extending medical card coverage should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including many of the recommendations drawn directly from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, such as: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm to the House that, far from the chief executive officers of health boards being in any way responsible for this mess, the limits for medical card eligibility are set by him? Does he agree that the payments to certain categories of recipients exceed the medical card income limit? For example, the income for a pensioner now is &euro;137.30, but the medical card income limit is &euro;144. In the case of widows and widowers in receipt of a contributory pension, the payment now is &euro;144.80, which is over the medical card income limit. This applies in a whole category of cases. Will the Minister tell the House how and why the percentage of the population covered by medical cards under agreement between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation has dropped from about 38% to 29% since the rainbow Government was in office? How does he justify extending apartheid deliberately and wilfully to the primary care area by giving a medical card to retired bank managers, who have more money than many Members of this House, while excluding those on incomes of less than &euro;130, some of whom live alone? The reason is that the people concerned do not vote while wealthy retired bank managers do. It is a disgraceful abuse of power. I accuse the Minister of activities which really should be inquired into by a criminal tribunal. It is outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the Deputy is mistaken. In introducing the budget, when the Government decided to give very generous <Col N="70" /> increases to old age pensioners, which it has done over the past five years and again in the budget, we made a premeditated decision at the Cabinet table that welfare recipients were not to lose their medical cards as a result of any increase in social welfare payments. I communicated this to the health board chief executives in January and again in February. As the guidelines apply, therefore, any increases in social welfare payments, particularly pensions and so on, will not result in the loss of medical cards. That is the factual position as far as the Government is concerned. It is something of which we were cognisant at the time of the granting of increases at budget time.</P>

      <P>There are 31% of people now with medical cards, of whom about 27% are over and about 72% are under the age of 70 years. I am somewhat bemused by the Deputy's proposition because his own party proposes to extend the medical card to everybody over the age of 65 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in a comprehensive proposal to reform the medical card system, I have proposed that medical cards be given to the lowest paid 40% of the population, that a free GP service be given to the lowest paid 60% of the population, that a free GP service be given to children up to the age of 18 years and beyond if in full-time education, and to everybody from the age of 65 years and over? That is the truth. He is misleading the House in suggesting anything else, as he usually does, speaking out of both sides of his mouth at once. Will the Minister tell the House why he gave wealthy retired people, who are on better money than Members or this House, a medical card when people earning less than &euro;130 a week and living alone were left without it? Is the Minister aware that ESRI research shows that among males aged 55 and older, the death rate for those on lowest incomes is 32 per thousand and among wealthy people it is 11 per thousand?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 February 2002 I received a letter from the President of the Royal College of <Col N="72" /> Psychiatrists regarding the Green Paper on Abortion. The college drew attention to a quotation contained in the Green Paper from a report entitled &ldquo;The Physical and Psycho-Social effects of Abortion on Women&rdquo;, which had been produced in 1994 by a private commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of Lord Rawlinson of Ewell. The college indicated in its letter that the quotation in question did not accurately represent the statement to the Rawlinson commission of one of the psychiatrists who gave evidence on its behalf. The college stated that the psychiatrist had said that there were no absolute psychiatric indications for termination of pregnancy and that termination of pregnancy would always have to be worked out on the basis of an individual patient.</P>
      <P>The Government has noted the college's position on this issue. The quotation about which the college has expressed concern was quoted in the Green Paper on Abortion in good faith. It appeared in Chapter 5, which dealt with the many submissions which had been received and the arguments made in them. The Green Paper stated explicitly that the inclusion of a particular argument or statement in that chapter did not indicate that the Cabinet committee which was responsible for the preparation of the Green Paper was in agreement with it. It is not possible to amend the Green Paper at this stage, this document having been published in September 1999.</P>
      <P>The proposals which will be put to the people in the Referendum on the Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution follow a detailed process of consideration and consultation. This included the preparation of the Green Paper and the detailed hearings held by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution at which the issues were explored in detail with many of those who had made submissions. In the course of this, the all-party committee met representatives of the medical profession, including a number of psychiatrists, the churches, legal experts and a range of other interested parties to explore in detail the complex medical, legal and social issues involved. The Government believes that the evidence considered in the preparation of the Green Paper, and also the testimony and conclusions in the report of the all-party committee, do not support the maintenance of suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland and would not justify the enactment of a legal basis for abortion to avoid such a risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Health and Children not accept that not only is he distorting the view of the Royal College of Psychiatrists by refusing to go back and set the record straight in the Green Paper, which he has a duty to do because it is inaccurate, but that he and his Government are peddling an untrue line in terms of psychiatric views of the possibility of suicide in pregnancy? The Royal College of Psychiatrists has made it clear that patients must be treated on an individual basis. The idea that there <Col N="73" /> is no psychiatric justification for termination is simply ludicrous when one looks at what the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Irish division have stated as their view. Surely the Minister would accept that the Government is presenting a distorted view to the electorate about an issue that is extremely important, albeit rare. We know of two such situations already &ndash; the X case and the C case &ndash; where two young girls, one aged 14 and one 13, were at risk of suicide. The psychiatric report given in court in the C case was sufficient for a judge to determine that, in that case, the little girl had a right to a termination. Does the Minister accept that the continuing inaccuracy and misrepresentations even today from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on this issue, give incorrect information to the public and are misleading?</P>

I could quote Professor Anthony Clare, who stated that the only reason he appeared before the health committee was that psychiatrists have become involved in the issue of abortion and that they have been drawn in to try to get people off the hook over this issue of danger to the health and life of a woman who is pregnant and wishes to terminate the pregnancy. He pointed out that there is no one better than a psychiatrist to say that if this is refused, a woman will kill herself.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the position regarding capital funding for a complete refurbishment of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin 12.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5977/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Col N="76" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department received a document from the hospital setting out proposals for the future development of the hospital. These proposals were set out in broad outline form. However, the normal process for the initiation of a major capital development such as this, would be a request by the hospital and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the establishment of a project team to consider issues such as scope of service, assessment of need, option appraisal, functional content, phasing and costings. This submission has not been made to my Department by the ERHA or by any other body.</P>
      <P>Significant infrastructural investment is currently taking place at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, including the development of operating theatres, day theatres, hospital sterile supplies department and ancillary works. This investment will amount to approximately &euro;33 million on completion of the development in the coming years. I have sanctioned the project which has already commenced. In addition, last year, approval for a grant of £3 million, or &euro;3.81 million, for urgent priority equipment and minor capital works was given to the hospital.</P>
      <P>The recently published health strategy, entitled Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You, provides for a review of acute paediatric services to be completed by next year. The review will focus on the future organisation and delivery of hospital services for children. The aim will be to enhance the range and level of services available at regional level and to determine the most effective configuration of tertiary services. The scope for developing certain highly specialised services on an all-Ireland basis will also be explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that &euro;6 billion will be made available in the next four or five years for capital expenditure in health. The Minister can dress it up as &euro;30 million if he so wishes, but offering £20 million to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, in these circumstances, is pathetic. The hospital building is past its useful life, having been designed in 1940 and constructed in the 1950s. Contrary to what the Minister said, the hospital's management committee sought permission two years ago to carry out a formal planning exercise to obtain outline concept approval from the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That approval has not been forthcoming from the Department or from the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Is the Minister aware that in other hospitals such as St. Vincent's and Beaumont, major re-development moneys are being spent, yet Crumlin has been left out? It has been left on the back-burner and children are being sent abroad for surgery because the hospital is not capable of dealing with their needs. I invite the Minister to stand with me on Cooley Road in Drimnagh, from where he will <Col N="77" /> see the exterior of the hospital building. It is self evident that a major re-development of the national children's hospital is overdue. The hospital does not serve only the people of Crumlin and Drimnagh, but the whole country. The Minister's offer of a few measly euros is insulting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of &euro;33 million, which is a substantial amount of money by any yardstick, will do much to transform cardiac facilities and operating theatres at the hospital. In 2000, I visited the hospital and I agree with the Deputy; I was unhappy with the state of that building. When I met members of the hospital management board they said, &ldquo;Minister, you have got our plans&rdquo;, but I did not have them. It was discovered at that meeting that the plans had not been sent to me. They also asked whether the hospital was included in the national development plan. I visited the hospital in late 2000, long after the NDP allocations had been given out. The plans were not submitted to me prior to that, via the ERHA, as a project under the NDP and therefore the ERHA would not have included Crumlin originally among the other projects on the list. The Deputy is correct in saying there is a huge building programme going on in all the Dublin hospitals, including Tallaght.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Crumlin was left out, not by me or my predecessor, but for some reason within the structures that pertain in the eastern region it did not get a look in. The project did not move forward but what did move forward &ndash; to be fair, under my predecessor &ndash; was the decision to develop and increase the capacity of the operating theatres by about 40%. That is where the &euro;33 million is being spent. The design stages of the project commenced two to three years ago and we have now accepted tender and given sanction to go to construction. I will work with the ERHA to see if we can get the plans to a stage where we can appoint project and design teams to get it moving.</P>
      <P>The other problem &ndash; I will be straight up about this because I have not been involved in Dublin politics for the past ten years, while the Deputy opposite has&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an urgent need for some degree of convergence of views among all those involved in paediatrics in Dublin. Coming to the <Col N="78" /> health portfolio from outside, I was taken aback by the degree of tension and disharmony within the overall paediatric community where hospitals vied for status, position and funding. That applies to the appointment of additional consultants as it does to additional facilities and expansions. That is an underlying feature of why, in the past, Crumlin hospital has not been advanced to the degree it should have. I assure the Deputy, however, that it will receive priority. It has already got priority, particularly in terms of the &euro;33 million, the additional equipment we provided last year and the overall development of paediatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the infrastructure to support the current specialities in the national children's hospital in Crumlin does not exist? This is resulting in the use of prefabricated buildings which now total 20. This is completely unsatisfactory. The hospital has recently installed a burns unit in a prefabricated building. Crumlin needs &euro;330 million, not &euro;33 million. The Minister would not tolerate this if it was happening in Cork, but it is in Crumlin and I will not tolerate it. I do not care what promises the Minister makes coming up to the election, he has been the Minister for Health and Children for some time and the Government has been in office for almost five years. What he has done for this hospital is pathetic. For the Minister to suggest that no application has been made to him, or to the ERHA, is not correct.</P>

      <P>The relevant regulations, which set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts which allowed pharmacies to dispense prescriptions under the medical card and drug payment schemes, had been subject to ongoing legal challenges. During the course of those challenges, the legal basis of the regulations was raised. Against this background I sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. The advice received concluded that the regulations were <i>ultra vires</i>. Accordingly, I considered that I could not continue to operate the regulations and, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance whose consent was required, I proceeded to revoke them.</P>
      <P>The effect of the revocation for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the relevant health board directly concerning re-applying.</P>
      <P>The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act.</P>

Why did he not wait before making a decision? Even at this stage, will he reverse his decision until the review group reports to him?

      <P>Last year the Attorney General gave the Minister some legal advice and told him that he could deal with it under the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.

      <P>I can recall when the report by the Ombudsman on nursing home subventions was published. Deputy Ring and others were the first to hammer the Department and accuse it of standing over regulations which had no legal basis. Health boards and the Department were attacked and pilloried for presiding over that position for the five or six years following the introduction of the nursing home regulations. When I received the Attorney General's advice I was in the same position; would I, as Minister, continue to force people into the High and Supreme Courts knowing in my heart and soul that the regulations were invalid and <i>ultra vires</i>?</P>

      <P>This arose through the Dame Street case in which the person who had been refused the right to open a pharmacy appealed the decision. In the course of that appeal it became clear to me and to the senior counsel advising that the regulations were<i> ultra vires</i> and would collapse. The offer of settlement made in that case was that I would undertake to reconsider the appeal and agree to grant it even before I reconsidered it. That was the nature of the deal that was done and it shows that the regulations were collapsing and the position was untenable. To make absolutely sure I asked the Attorney General, the law officer advising the Government, for a comprehensive opinion and view.</P>

I had hoped that the pharmacy review body could be the route by which we could reform or refine the regulations of 1996 or create a new regulatory framework. I am still <Col N="81" /> committed to establishing a regulatory framework for pharmacy by means of the pharmacy review body. I have asked the pharmacy review body to report as soon as possible as a result of the legal imperative.

Was he speaking as the Attorney General or as president of the Progressive Democrats and which advice did the Minister take? This is not in the best interests of rural Ireland, it is not in the best interest of pharmacies and it is not in the best interest of people working in the industry.

      <P>An independent external investigation has been established by the North-Eastern Health Board into an allegation of physical abuse of a patient in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, County Louth. The inspector of mental hospitals has been notified of the action taken by the health board as have the gardaí who will investigate whether a criminal offence has been committed. I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation established by the health board by making any further comment at this time. However, I would point out to the House that, in the normal course, the outcome of such investigations is reported to the health board in question and the inspector of mental hospitals is also informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" />When the report of the current investigation is available, I will be asking the inspector of mental hospitals to examine the matter in full and to make any recommendations he considers appropriate arising from the findings of the investigation. The North-Eastern Health Board has also stated its intention to act on the findings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has established an independent investigation but is he concerned that when the North-Eastern Health Board was contacted by the <i>Sunday Independent </i>it initially denied this issue had arisen but subsequently admitted it? Is the Minister concerned by claims that a handicapped patient crawled on all fours, that a nurse shouted at him to get into his chair and, when this was not done, he was kicked several times in the lower back? Such treatment of patients in a mental institution causes grave concern. It is also alleged that a nurse was witnessed grabbing a patient by the neck and inflicting serious pain and that the patient suffered a broken leg. The Minister must be concerned that there is an affidavit which claims that the patients were being tied to chairs with socks and ropes; beaten if they sought assistance; left in soiled clothes for hours; given cold baths and fed in a circle like animals. A nurse stated that the wards were worse than those in Romanian orphanages and that some were referred to as Ceaucescu wards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>An independent external investigation has been established. The persons nominated to conduct the investigation include a retired programme manager from the North-Western Health Board; Dr. Ena Lavelle, the consultant rehabilitation psychiatrist in Saint Ita's in Portrane and Jack Buckley, chief nursing officer in Saint Brendan's Hospital, Dublin. They are all external to the North-Eastern Health Board. I share the Deputy's concern about the matter. I have reviewed the available documentation about the allegations made which, given their serious nature, clearly demand a thorough investigation. I will be keeping a watching brief over this and I will ensure that there is a follow-on once the external independent investigation is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his concern and accept his bona fides on this matter. When does he expect the investigation to be completed? While I do not accuse any other health board of such treatment of patients, does the Minister agree there is concern about the general approach to psychiatric patients in institutions, including the services they receive and the condition and age of many institutions? What plans does he have to improve this situation and ensure that people in mental institutions enjoy the same conditions as patients in general hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the team to decide when the investigation will be concluded but I hope it <Col N="84" /> will be within a reasonable time frame. The terms of reference indicate that if other allegations surface the team will also investigate them. The team will conduct interviews with complainants, the person complained of and any other relevant persons to establish the facts surrounding a complaint. It may also make recommendations on any related matter it may deem appropriate in the interests of the health, safety and welfare of both patients and staff and it will deal with any other issues that pertain to this investigation and that could affect others.</P>
      <P>We have ongoing plans in terms of the refurbishment of mental hospitals and, more specifically, in terms of reducing the numbers of people who are inappropriately placed in mental institutions in the first instance. We have had to deal with this historic legacy. Progress has been made but much more needs to be done over the next two years. However, the funding is in place to continue the capital programmes that will relocate people from what are currently inappropriate placements to more satisfactory therapeutic placements.</P>
      <P>Many of us have visited mental health institutions or old style hospitals, many of which leave much to be desired in terms of their physical fabric and so on. Much has already been done, although the chief inspector would say that progress has been slow. However, we are avoiding the mistakes of other countries in terms of the &ldquo;de-institutionalisation&rdquo; of mental health patients. I hope there will be significant improvement in the coming years.</P>

      <P>Last summer I met representatives of the Irish Heart Foundation's council on stroke regarding its proposals for the development of stroke units to provide patients with dedicated specialists in-stroke care, an associated interdisciplinary team, appropriate diagnostic technology and a clearly defined continuum of care. I indicated I was very interested in the proposals and accordingly it was agreed that the council further develop and cost their proposals with a view to the establishment of a pilot programme in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January I received an outline submission from the Irish Heart Foundation which is being considered by my officials in the context of the cardiovascular strategy framework, Building Healthier Hearts, Primary Care &ndash; A New Direc<Col N="85" /> tion, Quality &amp; Fairness &ndash; a health system for you, and the recently completed, National Review of Acute Hospital Bed Capacity. When this process is complete my Department will issue a response to the Irish Heart Foundation. I hope to be able to make a favourable response to the work of the foundation. It made an outline submission to the Secretary General and me last month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Department does not allocate funding for preventative medicine and I am disappointed that a western location was not chosen by the Minister for this pilot scheme because, by and large, the greater number of strokes occur in the west. The Irish Heart Foundation has said that the incidence of strokes would be reduced by 25% if these facilities were available. In view of this, why did the Minister not sanction investigations in each of the health board areas? It is something we sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We may do that but it is not the major issue. Last summer I met the chairman and vice-chairman of the Irish Hearth Foundation's council on stroke to explore the possibility of developing stroke units. They presented me with various concepts and suggested that pilot projects be undertaken initially to ensure that the right kind of programme was developed. Following that they undertook to make proposals on how multi-disciplinary stroke units might be developed. They have now made a submission.</P>
      <P>I have ascertained the position in the west but it should be noted that cardiac facilities are especially well developed in the eastern region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to introduce a note of levity but in my experience the Minister knows a great deal about strokes. Is he aware that according to the Irish Heart Foundation, every year stroke kills more people in Ireland than breast cancer, bowel cancer and lung cancer combined? Does he agree that the first emphasis in terms of development should be on the provision of stroke units? The United Kingdom has put in train a policy to develop a stroke unit in every general hospital by 2004. Is the Minister aware that the Irish Heart Foundation would like to see a policy to develop a stroke unit in every general hospital in Ireland over the next four years and that this simple measure is effective in saving lives and preventing disability? Only 14 patients need to be treated for one extra to return home. To <Col N="86" /> put it another way, the stroke units reduce death and severe disability by 25%. Does the Minister agree that is the case and will he confirm that he will put in place a programme similar to that in the UK?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not know anything about political strokes. In the past two years alone, 800 extra people have been employed by the health service under the cardiovascular strategy. All are health care professionals involved in what may be termed preventative areas. They include smoking cessation officers and dieticians. They are working at trying to build and change patterns of behaviour in society. That is a clear investment in terms of preventative measures.</P>
      <P>Primary care is to the forefront in terms of prevention. This year we will fund an initiative under the cardiovascular strategy to deal with cardiovascular difficulties and how people can take preventative steps in the normal course of their lives. The primary care infrastructure we are developing, especially GP co-operatives, which will give greater 24 hour access to patients and the general public, and the concept of multi-disciplinary primary care team units, outlined in the national health strategy, is the way forward. These will help to ensure that blood pressure and cholesterol checks become a feature of people's regular routine on a six monthly or annual basis. That is not the case at the moment. Many people do not attend their doctors as often as they should.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I revoked the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 (S.I. No. 152 of 1996), which set out criteria and procedures to be used by the <Col N="87" /> chief executive officer of a health board when determining applications for granting community pharmacy contracts. The effect of the revocation, for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the health board directly concerning re-applying.</P>
    <P>The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation, such as the Planning Act. The pharmacy review group, established by my Department to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland, is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group. I have already met representatives of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to discuss their concerns following the revocation of S.I. No. 152 of 1996. A further meeting will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my responsibilities centre on the provision of a high quality health service and this includes ensuring, in so far as possible, that adequate and accessible pharmacy services are generally available. The decision to sell a pharmacy is a matter for the proprietor concerned. However, I am aware of a recent transaction which was brought to the attention of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who subsequently referred it to the Competition Authority. I understand the authority has recently recommended that the sale should proceed.</P>
    <P>The overall increase in community pharmacy contracts under the 1996 regulations was approximately 50. Of these, about half are outside urban areas. However, applications for rural areas were also refused by health boards under the population, distance and viability restrictions of the 1996 regulations. Therefore, the effects of the 1996 regulations are not clear. The pharmacy review group will be studying the extent to which the 1996 regulations achieved the objective of a wider geographic spread of pharmacy services. An assessment of the effects of revocation of S.I. No. 152 on geographic spread, without data on the achievement of this objective under S.I. No. 152, would be merely speculative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>What time elapsed between obtaining the legal advice from the Attorney General and making the announcement on deregulation? Will the Minister accept that the <Col N="88" /> regulations which were in place needed to be changed but that in terms of health care needs nobody had been pushing for total deregulation? Will he accept that the present situation leaves open the possibility of major multinationals, multiple chains, taking over the pharmacy business, which is not necessarily a good thing, and there is nothing to prevent that happening? The time frame for providing a new regulatory framework, even if it is ahead of the review group reporting, presumably will be fairly lengthy. Meanwhile one can presume the horse will have bolted and by the time a new regulatory framework is in place it may be inappropriate because of changes that have occurred. This will be the free market gone crazy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not pushing for a deregulated market. That was the reason I set up the pharmaceutical review body to deal with the issues that emerged in Ireland in the context of the OECD regulatory reform report. I was quite satisfied to go along with that. On the question of the time frame, the Dame Street case arose in October. During November I saw the notes on the file from my senior counsel on that case which indicated that these regulations were <i>ultra vires.</i> I then sought an opinion from the Attorney General which I received in January on the Monday of the week I decided to revoke the order. The reason for the pressure was that on the Friday following the Monday on which I received the Attorney General's opinion, the Dame Street case was back in the High Court. I had to make an immediate decision on whether to continue with a position which I knew in my heart and soul was untenable given that I had been advised these regulations were invalid. The advice was as strong as one could get, so I decided to be up front and say that, as far as I was concerned, the regulations were invalid and I would revoke them. That was our response to that deadline of the court on the Friday. We were in line to be sued by the person concerned. I realise there is a time frame issue.

      <P>The existing regulations did not stop them nor did they stop multiple ownership. There is evidence under the existing regulations that multiple ownership was happening in any event and clusters of pharmacies were being collected by big interests. The one I referred to in terms of the Competition Authority, was well in train long before the decision to revoke. I do not buy the argument that because of deregulation many multiples will come in. Nonetheless, we want the issues of quality and public health foremost in a policy of pharmacy provision and access to pharmacy services. That is what would inform our position from the perspective of the Minister for Health and Children in the context of the <Col N="89" /> pharmacy review. We want built in guarantees in respect of quality and protections for public health because it is medicine that is being dispensed, not sweets or anything else. I hope that can be done as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister appeared to take umbrage when I suggested earlier that he had been &ldquo;got to&rdquo;. Will he tell the House what happened to light this fuse? The decision to revoke the order was announced on the same day as the major decision on the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; so as not to catch much attention. The Minister established the review group only last November on which the Competition Authority and the Consumers Association were represented. Will the Minister agree that deregulation of the taxi service has been a fiasco? Fares have increased and no more taxis are available because they work only limited hours given that the licence costs only £5,000? Will he agree there is a danger that pharmacies will be deregulated in the same way? What plans has the Minister to ensure a service is available in every village and town and at weekends? Is it not a fact that he controls the cost of drugs because he gives the pharmaceutical companies the UK price plus a mark-up? The cost of drugs is not the issue. Will he tell the House if it is correct to say that a multinational coming into the market here can take over many pharmacies but would not be allowed do so in their home state?</P>

      <P>On the question of multinationals coming in and multiple ownership, they will not come in immediately. We do not have a huge number of pharmacists here. They are not there because of the restrictive nature of access to which Deputy Creed alluded. People who are educated outside this country cannot enter and open a new pharmacy. This is one of the issues we asked the pharmacy review body to examine. If I was to move on it now, it would open the floodgates in terms of pharmacies in the counties concerned. While people may be worried about having some degree of regulatory framework in the system, I would prefer to leave the pharmacy review body to deal with this in the fullness of time.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the reasons for this measure. The compensation advisory committee reported to me recently and its report was published on 15 January. Among its recommendations was the desirability of making provision for an interim payment to be made where an applicant is getting on in years or is unwell. I set out the reasons for this before we adjourned. Deputy Creed asked the reason there was a limit on the interim payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made was that the compensation advisory committee has recommended a minimum payment of &euro;50,000. If everybody is entitled to this minimum sum, why not have the interim payment fixed at this level? The payment can then be topped up with entitlements in excess of this figure, which are determined at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is dealt with on page 76 of the report of the compensation advisory committee &ndash; the Deputy referred to page 67 earlier. It states:</P>
      <P>In the view of this Committee, there is a compelling case for making, as soon as practically possible after a positive preliminary decision, an interim payment to certain applicants, namely those over the age of 60 or those who are seriously ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" />We envisage that the making of a preliminary decision by the Board that redress is payable to a particular applicant should be sufficient to justify an immediate &ldquo;interim&rdquo; payment of &euro;10,000 to that applicant.</P>
    <P>This is the source of the figure I quoted earlier, which I remembered correctly. It is an immediate payment which, I believe, will be used in many cases. It will be subtracted from any subsequent award that is made. It is important to remember that little or no inquiry will have taken place at this very early stage, which is the reason this figure for an interim payment is proposed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In a nutshell the amendment relates to the deal done between the Minister and representatives of CORI about which we had an unsatisfactory meeting at the Committee on Education and Science. One of the issues raised during the Second Stage debate and the hearings at which we met representatives of religious institutions and vic<Col N="96" /> tims was the establishment of an education trust. Under the deal the Minister concluded with CORI there is provision for, I believe, &euro;12.7 million to establish this education trust. This is being rolled up as if it is an entitlement under the legislation. Quite simply, it is not, because the trust is not part and parcel of this legislation. The beneficiaries of the trust, which is being established at the behest of CORI, will be some but perhaps not all of those involved. They will not have a legal entitlement to access the fund. It is unfair to lead the public to believe that victims will have an automatic right to access the trust fund of &euro;12.7 million, as the Minister knows that is not the case. This should not have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a most unsatisfactory explanation of the property portfolio of the compensation package, especially in relation to properties that have been transferred, are about to be transferred or will be transferred in the next five years. We do not know if there will be independent valuation of the properties involved or whether they will be valued at today's prices or those in 2007. If the value five years hence is to be paid, there will be an incentive to delay the transfer to minimise the impact of property inflation. Religious institutions may choose to wait for prices to increase so they can minimise the amount of property that needs to be transferred to make up their contributions.</P>
    <P>The contributions of religious orders should be commensurate with their culpability and their capacity to pay. My duty includes putting the deal under appropriate parliamentary scrutiny. The transaction, which is shrouded in absolute uncertainty, involves the delivery of certain properties to the State. The Minister's attempts to explain what is to be delivered have not done justice to CORI. My remarks should not be seen as a failure to appreciate the contribution made by religious institutions to education and social welfare over many years. I have said on many occasions, however, that the sins of the few must be faced collectively by the institutions. Neither the Minister nor the religious orders have adequately explained the detail of the deal that has been struck. The weakest aspect of the arrangement relates to the establishment of an education trust worth &euro;12.7 million, which victims of abuse feel they are entitled to access. I would like the Minister to admit that victims will not have an automatic right to access the fund as, regrettably, it will be administered and established at arm's length from this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Minister's deal with CORI is a poor one for victims of abuse and other taxpayers. When we peel away the hype and spin put on the compensation fund by both CORI's public relations consultants and the Minister's press office, we see that a miserable contribution is to be made, especially given the culpability of some members of religious orders in past abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" />The Department of Education and Science estimates that the final bill for compensation is likely to be about &euro;500 million. The cash contribution of the religious orders to the bill will be about &euro;25 million, about 5% of the total, which is pretty miserable. We have discussed the matter in the House on umpteen occasions, but the Minister has refused to estimate culpability or liability on the part of the religious orders. On Committee Stage I said that I thought this was a sweetheart deal and I am more convinced of that than ever now. The figure pencilled in for property transfers is spurious as a great deal of property was transferred with anything but compensation for the victims of abuse in mind. There is no clear record of what is happening.</P>
    <P>The supposed briefing we were given by the Minister was entirely unsatisfactory as he did not answer questions posed by Deputies. Perhaps the Minister was holding on to the information or he was inadequately briefed, but it was an unsatisfactory exercise. I can only describe this section of the Bill as a con job. I wonder how much of the promised money the State and the taxpayer will ever see. I accept that the State has the majority responsibility for the abuse suffered by many people, but I do not accept that its culpability amounts to 95% of the total, working on the basis of the proposed 5% contribution by the religious orders. The Minister seems to accept such a high proportion of State blame on behalf of the taxpayer, thereby allowing the religious orders to escape lightly with a 5% contribution.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a &euro;12 million education fund is an aspect of the deal which has nothing to do with a direct cash contribution. Many Deputies spoke during the debate on this Bill about the need for such a fund, but we stressed that it should be established by the Minister for Education and Science. The State needs to take responsibility for providing educational opportunities to those who missed out in years gone by as a result of abuse, but the Minister has not brought forward any proposals. It is entirely unsatisfactory that religious orders will be able to control this fund, even if they have established it. It is wrong that they will decide who will be able to access the fund. It lets the Minister off the hook in terms of his obligation to provide second chance education for those concerned, but it also gives the religious orders the discretion to use the fund in a manner of their choice, which is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It was particularly mealy-mouthed of the religious orders to include another sum of &euro;10 million for counselling, record retrieval and pastoral services. When the Minister was asked for details of this fund at our so-called briefing, he was incapable of providing any information on how it will be broken down between the three areas. Is it any wonder that those of us on this side of the House, the victims' groups and the public are cynical about the secretive deal that was done with the religious orders, given that the Minister is not prepared to come clean on its pre<Col N="98" /> cise detail? I do not know if the money will ever see the light of day. It does not constitute a financial contribution to the compensation fund; it is merely a case of the religious institutions writing off amounts of money in the hope of being seen to have contributed a respectable amount of money. It is not difficult, however, to understand what the Minister and the religious orders are doing. It is especially disingenuous given the context in which this contribution was supposed to be made.</P>
    <P>One of the primary objectives in seeking to make amends for past abuse must be not to compound it. The religious orders' smoke and mirrors approach to compensation and making donations smacks of a failure to meet this objective. The nature of the contributions they propose to make has been less than honest and it rubs salt into the wounds of those who have suffered abuse. As I have said, it is an unsatisfactory deal. It is a poor arrangement for victims of abuse and other taxpayers, who will have to pay for the decision to allow the religious orders avoid paying almost &euro;100 million. At the end of the day taxpayers will have to make up that difference and that is not fair or right.</P>

      <P>The Deputies raised a series of questions. Deputy Creed suggested that the education trust was not an entitlement under the legislation.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The education trust will be operated by independent trustees. We will have a say in the setting up of that trust. That is a fair and reasonable way in which to approach the matter.</P>
      <P>The first meeting between the representatives of the State and the religious congregations to discuss the congregations' contribution to a compensation scheme for victims of abuse in childhood was held on 10 November 2000. The State was represented in these and subsequent discussions by senior officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General. The parties met on a further nine occasions &ndash; ten occasions in all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the discussions ultimately reached an impasse. At that point I felt it was my duty as Minister, acting in the public interest, to attempt to resolve a situation which was arrived at after <Col N="99" /> more than one year of negotiations. At that point there was an education trust, money for counselling and property, but the property went back over the past ten years. In that context I stated that it was reasonable to include property which was transferred to the State since the Taoiseach's statement of May 1999. I argued that this was a reasonable base from which to start, but not to go back ten years. This suggestion was eventually agreed.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to get this legislation through and set up the compensation scheme. That has been my objective, but there are not many sitting days left. I did not want to leave the matter to the vagaries of what might happen at a later date. A subsequent Government might feel it faces a different situation and may not take the same view. A different Minister might be involved and the situation would be different. On the other hand, the process could roll on and be sorted out in due course.</P>
    <P>I felt that I should make an effort to bring the matter to a conclusion at that stage. The Secretary General of the Department and I met the representatives of the congregations on two occasions and I put to the Government the set of proposals which emerged from that process.</P>
    <P>It is quite offensive for Deputy Shortall to suggest that there is some sort of sweetheart deal. I rebut that suggestion which is offensive and untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the discussions I proposed to the Government a package which amounted to &euro;128 million. The target set by the negotiating team &ndash; other people who were dealing with the matter &ndash; was £100 million. In effect, we eventually reached a slightly higher figure in the total package. People argue about the content of the package, but that is the framework upon which it had been built during protracted negotiations. I took the matter from there and managed to increase the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussions on this issue opened over a year ago, the congregations stated that they wished to make a meaningful contribution to any scheme of redress for people who spent large parts of their childhood in institutional care. In my view the terms now agreed in principle represent a reasonable outcome which will allow all relevant parts of society to make meaningful <Col N="100" /> redress for past wrongs through which children were injured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall talks about &euro;25 million in cash. The figure is &euro;38 million, &euro;12.7 million of which goes to the education trust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is &euro;25 million in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The property transfers total &euro;80 million. That is a substantial figure which will go to the State. The Deputy is suggesting that this will not benefit people directly. Our objective is to ensure the State takes the overall package and responsibility, that it guarantees it for those who were abused and obtains a contribution from the religious orders. That is the way in which the matter has been approached.</P>
      <P>The property will be transferred to the State which will then make the payments and cover the total costs of the package. There is another &euro;10 million for counselling. The religious congregations have stated that they will continue their co-operation with the State and voluntary bodies regarding property transfers where they apply for services for people in need.</P>
      <P>For its part, the Government will provide an indemnity. The precise form and extent of that indemnity is a matter for further detailed discussions between the officials and representatives of the congregations. Further detailed discussions will also be necessary to agree the issues regarding property transfers. However, I am confident they will be honoured in detail. The agreement is an agreement in principle, but if its contents are not honoured the indemnity does not apply to the religious. The two issues go hand in hand, as provided for in the legislation.</P>
      <P>With the participation of the congregations, the redress scheme represents a significant part of the healing process for people who were damaged as a result of childhood experiences while in the care of the State and the congregations. The State and the congregations have apologised for the hurt caused. The Government has set up a commission to inquire into child abuse to which the congregations have repeatedly committed their full co-operation, and the Government and the congregations have put in place counselling services for people injured as a consequence of their time in care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the agreement made with the congregations, particularly regarding the amount of the contributions. In considering the agreement, regard must be had for the present and past roles of the congregations in society and the role of the State in respect of destitute children. I have said the State bears a heavy burden of responsibility for the abuse of children. In saying so, I am not speaking of legal liability as might be established in a court of law in accordance with legal procedure. In such a forum, whether civil or criminal, the liability of the perpetrators of abuse and their employers cannot be avoided. However, the primary purpose of the redress scheme is to take this difficult <Col N="101" /> issue of abuse out of the courts where many survivors could not get justice because of the rules of evidence and procedure. In a wider political and moral sense, society stands guilty of abandoning vulnerable children so that they were susceptible to abusers. That is our crime and our failure of duty, and it is high time we gave some comfort to those who suffered.</P>
    <P>It would have been possible for me to refuse to agree with the congregations unless they committed the last cent of their resources to the redress scheme. However, what would have been gained by such an approach other than further protracted negotiations which would probably end in failure. In the meantime the pain of survivors would have continued without any prospect of relief. The contribution now committed by the congregations is meaningful. The agreement now reached provides the best possible opportunity of providing, not just compensation for survivors of abuse, but a complete settlement of this issue where all parties involved take their responsibilities seriously in the interests of long-term healing for abuse survivors and their families. What Deputy Shortall said about figures was not actually correct. The figure is estimated at &euro;250 million. It is estimated that it could become anything between that and &euro;500 million. The contribution, therefore, will be 50%, if the figure turns out to be &euro;250 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 10%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has her own view. If the figure is &euro;500 million, the contribution will be 25%. However, the important point is that the State is taking responsibility for what happened. It is ensuring those who were abused are given support and comfort. I cannot go into the reason the State should do this. There is plenty of evidence for its involvement. It is quite extraordinary that when the State turns around and states that it wants to make amends, people attack me.</P>

      <P>I have said this from the beginning. As soon as I was involved, I said we had an administrative and moral responsibility towards the people concerned to which we must live up. We are living up to it and are happy to do so. That must be sorted out in the minds of Opposition Deputies first and foremost. After this we sought a contribution towards meeting the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The records will show, in time, the extent to which the State was involved. Files were hidden away; reports came right up to the Secretary General of the day and were ignored or set aside. There is no doubt about the responsibility of the State in that regard. There are about 13 religious orders against which allegations have been made, but 18 are contributing towards this package, which is a matter for them. The reality is that a <Col N="102" /> number of religious orders against whom no allegations have been made are contributing.</P>
    <P>The choice we had to make was either to let the matter drift on until the summer and see what Government and Minister would come in and how people felt about it then, or to complete the work which I have been trying to complete. An alternative would have been to let the religious contribute nothing and the State provide the whole lot.</P>

      <P>There is old maxim that states that when one is explaining one is losing. It is very apt in this context. The more the Minister goes on about the deal, the more gaps appear in it. One of its most glaring failures is that it does not guarantee access for victims to the envisaged education trust. I could argue with some conviction that the independence of the trust, at arm's length from the Department, is not a benefit as it removes it still further from the victims. The valuation put on record retrieval and counselling further undermines the merit of the argument while the part dealing with property is too vague. Ultimately, this is the fault of the Minister and his negotiations. There should be more detail. We should have actual properties, current valuations and transfer dates agreed. The more the Minister speaks of the deal, the more it emerges as unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial amount of the figure included for property has been transferred over the last three years. It is only right that religious orders, which in many cases are sitting on very valuable properties due to rising property values and will make substantial gains when they sell them, make some contribution towards the people concerned. This can be done by providing land for social housing as happened in the past. However, it happened without any reference to compensation for abuse victims. It happened because it was only right that religious orders should make that contribution. To include it now is being economical with the truth, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was unable to provide any information about properties to be transferred in the future. Yesterday evening he was also unprepared to answer questions in an up-front manner. He continues to deal with Members in this fashion. I have had to use the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to obtain information from his Department about what is going on between Church and State. When all the window-dressing <Col N="103" /> is stripped away, the religious orders are contributing 10%, at best, to the compensation fund. It is more likely to be 5% and could even be a smaller percentage. This is a bad deal for victims and a very bad deal for the taxpayer. It is only a matter of time until this dawns on people.</P>

      <P>That is part of the problem. There is a lot of unhappiness regarding that amendment. Amendment No. 99 which inserts a new section 32 states: &ldquo;For the avoidance of doubt, a person who was detained in an industrial school pursuant to the Children Act, 1908 . . .&rdquo; Some people are unhappy that the definition is so confined. I have had discussions with them about this and they are unhappy that they have not had the opportunity to tease it out further. Part of the problem is that there is a guillotine. This is one of the amendments that I have been asked to go into in detail and we will not have the opportunity of doing so now.</P>
      <P>I mentioned floodgates today. The Minister can go into all the theory he likes about <i>in loco parentis</i> and so on, but he should remember that if there was even one wronged person who was under the care of the Department of Education and Science in an ordinary national school, though he or she was only there from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m., and that person is deprived of the right to compensation for his or her pain and suffering, the Bill is flawed. If only one individual is denied, the Bill is flawed. One person is being excluded for fear that a few more might get in. To base law on that alone is wrong and it is wrong that we are bringing in a guillotine on this Bill.</P>

I regret that I am not satisfied the Bill is as comprehensive as it should be. We have moved from the original concept of a tribunal of compensation to a redress board. In terms of amendments brought forward today which spoke of findings of fact, there is a danger that this might unravel on a constitutional basis. The Bill's real failing is in terms of the exclusion of day pupils. That we have agreed to compensate some students in special schools but not others may well prove to be our undoing.

      <P>I do not know why this legislation has come before us. If ever a Bill was likely not to have an impact on the issue facing us, this is it. If we brought in a Bill for the Minister to give emergency directions to local authorities throughout the country to build houses I would welcome it. If the Minister introduced a Bill to issue directions to local authorities to ensure there was adequate, affordable housing available to the population I would welcome it. The amazing factor about this legislation is that it is essentially cosmetic legislation. It is coming before the House, allegedly to deal with an issue, but it does not deal with the issue and is five years too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how nobody in the Department of the Environment and Local <Col N="105" /> Government has mentioned the seriousness of our housing situation. The major contribution made by the Government over the past four and a half years has been to count the numbers twice and come up with a revised number of those on waiting lists. There are about 120,000 families in the country seeking first time housing. In my constituency there are about 3,500. About 2,700 of those are on the local authority waiting list and another 1,000 or more are people with an income but that income is not sufficient to purchase a house.</P>
    <P>The maximum loan available under the local authority loan system is approximately &euro;130,000 but no house is for sale at that price. The question of affordable housing is a farce and this legislation does nothing to address the issue. I feel embarrassed when I meet constituents who were in need of a house five years ago and who still need a house but have less prospect of getting one now. Ten years ago such people would have been living in mobile homes or caravans all over the countryside. Unless something dramatic is done, other than what is proposed in this legislation, half of our population will be living in mobile homes or caravans and be in danger from living in unsafe and unhealthy conditions.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech carefully looking for some inspiration or some indication of hope for my constituents. The normal criteria for obtaining a building society loan has been that an applicant can get a maximum loan of two and a half times a gross income. The price of housing has long since passed that by. Housing prices were driven sky high and coupled with a shortage of housing the result is that housing is now a luxury. Even the promise of a house is now a luxury.</P>
    <P>There was a time when we could inform constituents that if they had a job they could aspire to a home of their own within six months. That time is long gone. Housing is now a luxury and we have had situations where people left the country because they did not have a home. We now have the situation where people pay £100 a week for the smallest accommodation and we have up to 14 people sharing a house. The Minister has brought in various regulations to address the issue but nothing has been achieved because there are insufficient housing units to meet the need.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling situation. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, is a kind, caring and compassionate man but unless there is something dramatic done soon, other than what we have seen before or other than what is proposed in this legislation, the consequences will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say there has been a slowdown in housing costing &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000. That may be of concern to housing market people or people who paid such high prices but it is of no relevance to the people with reasonably good jobs who just a few years ago were regarded as middle-income groups. For what are the sons and daughters of the present generation waiting? Will <Col N="106" /> they wait until house prices drop below the &euro;130,000 mark? There is no chance of that. I reject everything contained in the proposal before us because it fails to address the biggest issue facing this country since I was elected to this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill does other peculiar things. It proposes a clawback for those with shared ownership loans. God love those unfortunate people who, having squeezed themselves into a situation where they could obtain a shared ownership loan to possibly buy a house, will now have that extra clawback nugget at their elbow which makes sure that they are properly penalised for daring to apply for such a loan. They will have to pay part of it back if they sell their house within 20 years. That is the craziest situation I have ever come across and I have serious doubts as to its legality. There will be situations where a person will have to move for job purposes and have a genuine reason for moving. I do not see anything in the Bill which suggests that compassionate consideration can be given in such circumstances and presume it will not be. The concept of clawback was rightly abolished years ago because it was deemed to be unfair.</P>
    <P>The Minister came up with some interesting quotes. I would love to have been at his scriptwriter's elbow when the speech was prepared. When he spoke about the affordable housing scheme, which was supposed to be the panacea to resolve the housing crisis, the Minister said the indications were that last year a total of 300 units were completed under the scheme and that 6,270 were under construction or planned. The planning part is the aspect for which I take my hat off to the Department. There are plans in my constituency for houses that will be lucky to appear on the scene in the next two years. Some may never appear.</P>
    <P>What was the Department doing for the last five years? Why did it not produce these houses five years ago? What is to happen to those who have been on the waiting list for affordable housing or local authority houses? Where will they go? Somebody, somewhere will have to take responsibility for this and tell people the situation as is. There is no sense in having a situation, similar to that concerning the emperor's clothes, where the Minister comes into the House with a proposal that he says will solve the housing problem as if there had not been a problem up to now. I have had questions answered by the Minister in the House over the past four years indicating that there was no housing problem or crisis. He suggested that there was no shortage of housing. If the body responsible, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, is not aware of the seriousness of the housing problem, there is no help for anyone. That is where the solution is supposed to start.</P>
    <P>The Minister says other things. The word &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; should be deleted from his vocabulary at this stage. There is no affordable house, in my constituency or elsewhere, available to those <Col N="107" /> families with a single income of less than &euro;50,000. There is not, and will not be, anything available for them and the provisions of this legislation will do nothing for them. The Minister also said social housing programmes remain the primary vehicle for providing access to accommodation for lower income households. That used to be the case, but how is access to this elusive housing provision determined when so few houses are being provided? I know that the Department will state there has been a huge increase over 1988 or 1999. However, a huge increase from nothing is nothing. That is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of access for lower income groups. For example, a family may be renting accommodation that costs up to &euro;1,400 at present. It can be expected to have an income of perhaps &euro;50,000 per annum, which is not a bad income, even though it might include two combined salaries, yet it may not be able to get out of rental accommodation and its housing needs have not been met nor are they likely to be met.</P>
    <P>Under existing housing legislation, it is the duty of the Department to ensure a person has his or her housing needs met. One of the proposals under the European Charter of Human Rights, at one stage, was that every person would have the right to a home of his or her own, although it was opposed by the Irish Government of the day. If adopted, it would have caused consternation in Ireland, but it was not. However, I believe that every person has the right to a home of his or her own. The sooner we recognise this, on all sides of the House and particularly in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the better.</P>
    <P>This is not by way of criticism of individuals, but unless, in the shortest possible time, some recognition is given to the seriousness of the housing situation, there will have to be emigration to relieve the shortage. That is my appraisal. I hope that even at this late stage the Minister and his Department will come forward with something tangible and realisable in a reasonable time. They should cut out this nonsense of massaging the number on the housing lists, the nonsense of reviewing the number on the housing lists, the nonsense of telling people to apply every time they change address despite being forced to change address on a regular basis, and the excessive administration costs associated with this nonsense. The Department should issue a directive to the various local authorities to ensure they provide, or cause to be provided, sufficient means for those currently outside the housing system in order that they can achieve their target.</P>

      <P>Excellent, one can do a lot of damage in five minutes. However, it would take five hours to set out fully the litany of atrocities perpetrated on hapless members of the public looking to own houses of their own.</P>
      <P>There is another fundamental matter. I can remember, when I was a lot younger, going down the promenade at Dún Laoghaire. Written on the wall were the words, &ldquo;vote Fianna Fáil; the party that made meat a luxury.&rdquo; I do not know when that will be written again or who will write it. However, I hope the same scribe does not come back and append the words, &ldquo;the same party that made housing a luxury&rdquo; because that is now what housing is. The right to have a home of one's own is a luxury at this time. No one should have any illusions about this.</P>
      <P>There has been a suggestion in certain quarters that the people are old-fashioned in our aspiration to own our own homes, that we should be more cosmopolitan like other Europeans and lease or rent our homes, and that we should be be damn glad to get a home.</P>
      <P>Maybe that is true but let us remember there was a long, hard and bitter struggle in this country for people to have the right to own their own home. If we lose sight of that, we will lose something which, although it may not be very inspiring for the people stuck on the list at present, was sufficient to inspire those who laid the foundations of this State. We would do well to remember that. We are not like the rest of Europe; we do not lease our houses. We have the right to aspire to own our houses. I totally reject the notion that we should go where we are sent by those who think they know better than we do. This pattern is beginning to emerge in the thinking of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>We hear a great deal of nonsense about spatial strategy and where people should live in the future. Where should they live now? Why does the Department not tell the people where they should live now? Surely, there must be somebody with that kind of resourcefulness in the Department. We know it is more economical to house people in certain ways. In some parts of the country, the practice is to build two houses &ndash; one on top of the other. There is a particular name to describe that but, essentially, it is one house built on top of another because we have run out of space. If, like Holland, we had run out of space by virtue of an increase in population, we would have a population of over 50 million. The so-called experts who tell us we have run out of ground and should do things differently should cop themselves on. We are not all fools and we have heard it and seen it all before. The island of Ireland is approximately one third the size of the United Kingdom, the population of which is 13 times greater than ours. We have a long way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before some expert from the Department of the Environment and Local Government or somewhere else tells me it is much more econ<Col N="109" /> omical to house people in conurbations close to railway tracks and adjacent to motorways where there is ready access and transport, all of which is quite true, he should consider the likely social cost of this economics? Has anybody ever asked what happened in other countries and why we had to change our housing policy in certain parts of this city as a result of economic decisions taken in the past? Has anybody considered what the verdict of the people will be if, at some stage in the future, somebody asks whether we built one house on top of another because we were running out of space? </P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share my time with Deputy Clune.</P>
      <P>It is nearly two years since I was our party's spokesperson on housing. I have kept a close eye on the development of policy from the Government benches during the two years since I left that portfolio but the situation has not improved. The situation, as Deputy Durkan quite rightly said, is getting worse, not better. It is strange that what is, in effect, quite minor legislation is coming before the House in the dying days of this Government when much more important legislation, which was promised and which was the subject of a very important commission that reported over two years ago, has yet to come before the House. I refer to legislation on the private rented sector. It is astonishing that the Government established a commission which had a timeframe of six months to report and bring forward conclusions, but a year and a half since the publication of its report on the private rented sector, we have not seen any action. We have still not seen legislation which would give some protection to tenants.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Government is playing at but it is interesting to note that even at this time, the Government benches cannot produce speakers, so ashamed are they of the Government's record on housing policy. That is because over the past number of years, the Government has relied on a series of high profile productions by Dr. Peter Bacon, all of which have been contradicted by the Government's response. I make one point which highlights this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of speculators, the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, took out of the equation those people who were coming into the housing market to buy up property and rent it out. They were <Col N="110" /> described by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, as speculators. Following a report by Dr. Bacon, those people were removed from the equation and, only six months ago, the Minister again referred to this group of people and said they could never again be catered for. What we rightly saw in the recent budget was a complete reversal of policy. There is no consistency from the Government on this issue. The Government has cut through Dr. Bacon's reports and there is no confidence in relation to the issue of affordable housing. The longer the Government goes on, the more it and its supporters realise that this is one of the key areas in which they will be exposed in the upcoming election.</P>
    <P>In excess of 5,000 people are homeless or living rough on the streets of this capital and of our towns and cities. It has recently been brought to my attention that one can only be defined by the health boards as a homeless person if one has resided for at least three months in a hostel in any of the health board areas. This is an astonishing situation. The Government is massaging the figures because one cannot be classified as a homeless person unless one fulfils certain criteria. Of course, the figures on which the Government relies to indicate the number of people who are homeless are completely inaccurate because the majority of homeless people cannot get a hostel place. This is one of the coldest days we have experienced this year and the situation will get worse later in February and in March. It is an absolute scandal that in this day and age, in excess of 5,000 of our fellow citizens cannot be housed in either temporary or permanent accommodation. This is one of the greatest flaws in the housing policy pursued by this Government. Despite the high profile announcement by the Taoiseach some months ago, in excess of 5,000 people are homeless tonight. There is no chance that these people will be housed by any of the health boards in question.</P>
    <P>The Government regularly lectures us about the total number of new starts and, admittedly, new starts in the area of social housing are impressive. However, there is a fundamental distinction between new starts and the number of completions at the end of a given year. While the Government has expectations that the local authority housing programme can deliver a certain number of houses in a given year, we all know they have manifestly shown themselves unable to deliver on their targets, minimal as they are, year in and year out.</P>
    <P>This legislation, in effect, extends the borrowing capacity of the housing finance agency by a significant amount so that loans can be made to local authorities. It makes a mockery of local government that significant sums of money in the capital accounts of many local authorities cannot be used for the purposes of housing because they do not have the Government's permission to use it. My own local authority is asset and capital rich to the tune of over &euro;20 million. As a local authority we cannot at any given time divert a signifi<Col N="111" /> cant tranche of that money for the purpose of house building programmes. We have a totally centralised structure when it comes to housing provision and providing capital for the purposes of providing affordable housing in all local authority areas. It is ridiculous that local authorities cannot spend the money they have but must seek the approval of a central committee in the Custom House before they can vary the amount they spend on various programmes. It underlines the complete inadequacy of local government that moneys in the capital accounts of various local authorities cannot be used for the purpose the members want because the Government has not given them permission for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the affordable housing scheme, which is good. If properly used it will make a difference to a significant number of people who are trying to get into the housing market. The initial proposal came from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in 1999. I remember the memorandum he circulated to local authorities. However, as Deputy Durkan said, last year only 600 housing units were completed throughout the country, which is minuscule. Up to 6,000 are planned for this year or are in the process of being completed. There seems to be no capacity for housing policy to deliver in local areas, and no capacity for the Department to ensure it sticks to the plans to which it has committed itself. This is a real problem in this area. Last year, three years on from the introduction of the scheme, 600 houses were built. This again underlines the failure of the Department to deliver on its commitments. Be that as it may, it is a good scheme. It has the capacity to significantly increase the housing output in local authorities. I once again call on local authorities to use their powers under this scheme and to use this legislation to significantly increase the number of housing units.</P>
    <P>The income threshold for the shared ownership scheme, an excellent scheme which provides an opportunity for people to get on the housing ladder, needs to be looked at again. It is ridiculous that two-income families cannot afford to buy a house and that some of them are still priced out of the market by the income level for the shared ownership scheme. This income level needs to be monitored on a three or four monthly basis as against the two yearly assessment recommended in the Bacon report.</P>
    <P>One area on which I want to concentrate, which is not part of the Bill but is part of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act which regularly comes before the House, is the chronic shortage of good quality central heating systems in social housing provision throughout the country. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, whom I greatly admire, told me in the House before the Christmas recess that as many as 50,000 local authority homes are without an effective, affordable heating system. It is aston<Col N="112" /> ishing in 2002 that such a significant number of local authority homes do not have central heating. I understand that a new assessment is taking place in the Department with all of the local authorities concerned. I readily admit that some local authorities are much better than others, but we need a national conversion programme over the next three to four years and to set out a very clear objective that every local authority house will be converted to some form of central heating system by 2006. I understand the cost would be about &euro;200 million. It would be a good investment. It would make a big difference in cutting down on respiratory and other illnesses that many local authority tenants experience.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that local authority tenants must pay the full rent under the differential rent scheme when the quality of the house is pathetic compared to other houses in the local authority housing stock. A landlord renting a house to a tenant would expect to have to ensure that the house had a central heating system. However, we are renting 50,000 local authority homes without central heating to members of the general public and that issue has not been grasped by this Government. It is essentially an issue of poverty proofing. I cannot understand why the three Ministers in the Department have done nothing about this over the past five years. I call on the Government to concentrate on this issue, to put in place a national conversion programme and to do something significant for the many people who have inadequate heating at the time of the year when it is cold, wet and windy. We need to do something quickly for those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy will have something to contribute on a Bill such as this, particularly those who are also a member of a local authority. The issue of housing is something which comes again and again. We deal on a daily basis with applicants for housing in our constituencies. Cork Corporation, of which I am a member, now has over 4,200 applicants on its housing list. That is serious because each of those applicants represents a family unit. The list increases every month because the number of people that are housed does not match the number of new applicants. The number of applicants on the housing list increased by about 18% last year and it is continuing to increase, which is alarming. It is also frustrating that the only way people looking for housing feel they can get themselves on the list and housed is to approach officials to push their case. It is a very serious situation. The Government has failed to deliver a housing programme to match the needs of our communities. Other Deputies have spoken on this already, but it is something we all feel very strongly about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to talk about shared ownership and affordable housing, although they are not mentioned specifically in the Bill. I have always been very supportive of those schemes which are very valuable. There is quite a gap between being a local authority tenant and owning one's own <Col N="113" /> home. There are many people between those two extremes who could be helped. The most valuable thing the State could do in this area is to transfer some of its wealth to enable people to own their own houses. That is where shared ownership and affordable housing come in. There is another very valuable scheme whereby local authorities sell serviced sites at cost to people who can afford to build their own house. We need to expand on such schemes and help people to own their own houses. There are many people who want to own their own house but find the costs too exorbitant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes mentioned the income threshold for the shared ownership scheme. I ask the Minister to look at that again. It is becoming impossible to buy a house, particularly in the Cork area. Income certainly does not match the cost of housing. This needs to be addressed. Many people who find themselves in the middle ground should be supported and helped to own their own homes, particularly when the cost of private rented accommodation is so exorbitant that some people are paying £600 or £700. Such costs are an enormous burden on people, preventing them from getting on the housing ladder and buying their own house. They find it difficult to get the deposit for a mortgage but the irony is that they would pay less if they were servicing a mortgage than they pay to a private landlord.</P>
    <P>Renting is money down the drain. We should introduce legislation to protect those in the private rented sector rather than a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The Government set up a commission but we have yet to see legislation to enact its recommendations even though security of tenure and protection of tenants' rights are very important and necessary. I pay tribute to Threshold. Its role &ndash; giving advice, support and assistance to tenants and to those looking for housing, and intervening with landlords &ndash; is invaluable.</P>
    <P>Economic success has resulted in house prices going through the roof. Young couples find it so difficult to afford their own homes that both have to work full-time to service the mortgage. Most young people can afford mortgages that are only 75% of the cost of a house, the balance comes from their parents or other family members. That is unsustainable. Why should parents who have reared their children be expected to support them as they try to purchase their own homes? It is, however, a fact of life today and families are struggling with it, even though many parents did not see themselves in such a situation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of Part 3 of the Bill specifies building regulations that provide for more efficient energy use, including renewable forms of energy. Much can be achieved through the regular supervision of construction work. Regulations exist and we know what we are supposed to do but builders are cutting corners because they know they will not be picked up on it. There should be greater supervision and enforcement. We must consider using renewable forms of energy in homes, such as solar panels or other innovative schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" />I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and to bring to the Chamber the frustrations so many people are experiencing. I was speaking to a separated mother of three last week who had to spend three nights with her children in a car because she was evicted when her rent was increased. Such situations exist across the State and they are a sad indictment of our society. More needs to be done to focus on those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this legislation which gives statutory standing to social and affordable housing and tidies up some of the anomalies in current housing legislation. The success of the Government's building programme can be seen from the figures indicated by the Minister &ndash; more than 200,000 houses were built in the past five years. It highlights the demand for housing and the need for measures which will streamline the legislation and deal with some of the anomalies, while setting down a framework for the development of housing under the national development plan. It is difficult to know where to start with housing because so much is involved but this legislation gives us the opportunity to debate some of the issues.</P>
      <P>Elderly people in isolated areas find that the conditions in which they live are far below the necessary standards. Previous speakers mentioned the provision of heating, a matter of vital importance to the elderly. In the west of my constituency, and in the west in general, there are large numbers of elderly people living in isolated houses which do not even have basic facilities such as running water or toilet and sewerage facilities, decent heating and, in many cases, adequate windows or doors.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board operates a very good housing scheme for the elderly where, with the minimum of bureaucracy, it interviewed the elderly living alone, identified their requirements, sought quotations for improvements and, at very small cost to the authorities, put in place adequate facilities for them, although large numbers still have to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>People with disabilities face enormous difficulties. The red tape and delays involved in applications for small grants for extensions or refurbishments for people with disabilities are unreal. In my constituency there are people who have been waiting for three years for work as minor as the installation of a shower unit for a person in a wheelchair. It baffles me why it is necessary to get certification from medical officers and community nurses before these jobs can be done. These people are in receipt of benefits evaluated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards. Why are further assessments, which hold up their applications for a year or two, necessary? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocations are inadequate to meet the demand. Last year Clare County Council paid out in excess of £1 million in disability grants but it received a grant of less than £500,000. This year's allocation will pay for work completed last year. <Col N="115" /> Now many people are on a waiting list and have been told to cut back on the development of their houses because there is not enough money to meet their demands. This is unacceptable. It did not happen today or yesterday, so the Opposition cannot make snide comments. It has been going on for years. It is necessary to streamline the legislation governing the payment of grants for essential repairs. Grants to the disabled and elderly are paid through health boards for minor remedial work to houses. This Bill aims to tidy up the many anomalies in housing, particularly those concerning shared ownership schemes, so this is the time to highlight the necessity for streamlining such grant payments. The requirements of people with disabilities, the elderly and pensioners generally need to be assessed. In addition, an overview of the relevant legislation should be undertaken in order to have an efficient system of dealing with such matters so that people will not be left waiting for two or three years for minor works, such as the installation of a shower unit, central heating or new windows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work of some of the voluntary agencies in providing accommodation. I compliment in particular Respond, the housing agency that has been very successful in developing houses in Shannon, Ennis and other parts of County Clare, as well as other areas in the west. The schemes undertaken by Respond demonstrate a high level of professionalism, including excellent plans and specifications. I commend the fact that in many of its schemes, Respond also installs community facilities. Over the years there has been a lack of planning in this area as a result of which many housing schemes in smaller towns were left without adequate sports and leisure facilities, compared to those provided for larger estates. There have been successful developments in towns such as Kilrush where there is a mix of elderly and young families in housing estates, but no facilities were included for community meetings or recreational facilities for younger people. Young people in many such estates got into difficulties of one kind or another due to the absence of adequate social facilities. That criticism is timely because in the new drive to develop affordable social housing there is a necessity to provide complementary community facilities. A specialised approach to this issue must be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to record my appreciation of the substantial upgrading that has taken place in the provision of local authority housing generally. A few new schemes have been undertaken in County Clare and the engineers and council personnel are to be complimented on the style and quality of the new houses being constructed for local authorities. I presume the same applies in other counties. In Clare, we have had new housing schemes in Ennis, Kilrush and Miltown Mal<Col N="116" /> bay as well as other smaller towns. The council has installed first-class housing which is a credit to the professionalism of the council staff and to the Department of the Environment and Local Government which supervised the work.</P>
    <P>Most of the time, if a small amount of additional finance was provided to upgrade them we would not have the kind of dereliction we have seen in many housing schemes over the years. I can recall houses that were built in the 1940s and 1950s being allowed to fall into disrepair by the local authorities. In some cases they became totally dilapidated because, once they were completed, no attention or additional finance was provided for their upkeep. Therefore, the cost of upgrading such housing stock became enormous. In many cases, windows and doors had fallen out and the houses were in a shocking state. It was unreal to see what happened to once valuable housing stock. For want of minor investment such houses were allowed to fall into disrepair in the past, thus becoming unfit for human habitation. Such a situation needs to be avoided in future so that when the State invests heavily in housing development, whether through voluntary organisations or county councils, back-up funding for maintenance should be increased. Every local authority should have a maintenance section. We had such sections years ago but they were not continued and, as a result, many of the houses that were built at substantial cost to the Exchequer fell into disrepair and became unfit for use.</P>
    <P>The Bill underpins the work being done by housing agencies and voluntary organisation such as Respond. There is a new awareness of the contribution that voluntary housing organisations can make to building up smaller towns and villages. I attended a meeting recently in Tulla, County Clare, where a modern, sophisticated housing scheme is being put in place by a voluntary organisation. The people involved are to be complimented on the work they are doing. Not only are they providing essential housing in isolated rural villages but they are also helping to halt the population decline in such areas. The Government must react to these developments by providing infrastructural investment for sewerage, water and other services so that small towns and villages can thrive.</P>
    <P>The Bill is both timely and valuable. In examining the situation, however, the Minister should look further to see what needs to be done in the areas I have mentioned. The provision of reconstruction grants needs to be re-examined, including a new formula to streamline grants for essential repairs to housing for the elderly and the disabled. By providing the finances to enable that to be done we can provide people with an opportunity to live in decent housing. It is a small contribution for us to make.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State for introducing the Bill which represents a major advance. While the record of what has been achieved over the past five years is there to <Col N="117" /> be seen, a huge challenge lies ahead. We can make a start today by tackling these issues and putting in place a framework which will enable the points that I have raised to be dealt with effectively over the next few years.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with three main issues concerning the Bill: first, the crisis concerning applications for housing tenancy; second, housing aid for the elderly; and, third, housing repairs. There are currently 1,350 applicants on Limerick County Council's housing waiting list, but many of them will be waiting for years before they are housed. Many are young families living in overcrowded conditions and sub-standard accommodation. They are in urgent need of proper accommodation but cannot afford to buy houses due to low incomes and the fact that house prices have gone beyond their reach. In the immediate future they will not be in a position to consider purchasing private accommodation. This is putting pressure on families and, given that the Government is supposed to be so supportive of the family, it is a disgrace that such people must live in overcrowded conditions. In recent days, several families have contacted me about rodent infestation in their properties. They are crying out for proper accommodation.</P>
      <P>The elderly also require proper housing. They have served the State well and built up a country that we can now enjoy. Their contribution, made through toil and sweat, created the Celtic tiger. Many of these people live in isolated rural areas and because of their fear of crime and their living conditions, they are anxious to move into proper accommodation. They must be housed as a matter of urgency. The third group consists of single parents. Thirty per cent of children are born outside of marriage and many single mothers are in need of accommodation. These young parents must often share a home with their own parents. They are caught in a trap whereby they cannot earn money and so provide a home for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to rationalise the schemes providing housing aid for the elderly and the essential repairs grant. They both cater for the same group of people. The waiting time in the Mid-Western Health Board area for the housing aid for the elderly scheme is deplorable. People wait up to three years. I know of one elderly person who suffered a stroke six months ago. She has an outside toilet and must cross the yard with the aid of a walking frame in order to use it. She needs proper toilet facilities urgently. There should not be a waiting list for people who need to have a shower installed because they can no longer use a bath. People are leaving hospital and must return to houses without shower facilities. There should be <Col N="118" /> a thorough examination of the housing aid for the elderly scheme to ensure that it delivers a service to the people who have served this country.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with previous speakers that it is totally unacceptable that 50,000 people are without central heating in their homes in the 21st century. We are all aware of constituents who must spend large amounts of money on solid fuel in order to provide heating for children with asthma or elderly infirm relatives. Local authority housing stock should have heating. The local authorities have a duty to ensure that their houses are up to standard. There is a lack of resources in many areas for repair and maintenance work on the housing stock. Repair work is often only partially completed or not done at all. We must develop the shared ownership scheme. It is an excellent scheme and I encourage people to use it. The Minister and his Department should fund and promote the scheme in a more generous way. It is a halfway stage between homelessness and house ownership and many people can move on from there within a few years and own their own homes. The concept of social housing is a very good one but it does not seem to be working. It is not being used effectively.</P>

Provision of improved housing for the elderly is dear to the hearts of everyone in this House but we must have proper policies in place and a Minister and a Minister of State who will deal with the problems.</P>
      <P>Substantial numbers of single parent families are living in rented accommodation which is not fit for human habitation. The local authorities are not inspecting these places. Ministers have allowed people to live in sub-standard accommodation during an economic boom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>House prices would not have risen so high if the Government of the day had provided sufficient moneys for enough serviced land for housing. Competition would then have kept down the price of houses. The scheme for social and affordable housing has been copied from the United Kingdom with a population of 60 million. In a population of four million it cannot be expected that 80% of those who can afford to purchase a house can carry the other 20%. I say to the Minister that it will not work. Our population could <Col N="119" /> carry about 8%, not 20%. The Minister for Finance has overturned policies which were introduced and recommended by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, on the basis of the Bacon reports. I hope Mr. Bacon is still not on the payroll as one of the Government advisers. Thousands of people cannot afford to buy their own homes. The Government must provide the money for serviced land because sufficient supplies of serviced land will enable more houses to be provided. When the 20% social and affordable housing initiatives were introduced in County Meath, the manager decided to increase the local charges from £4,600 to £8,600. It is important for everybody to recognise that while the Government tells us it is doing something to provide people with their own homes, it takes 43% of the price of a typical first time buyer's three bed semi-detached house in the form of VAT and other taxes and charges.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy on all of the issues I have raised has been a failure because when it took up office in 1997 nobody in the Department knew how to deal with the problems that were manifest. All the Government could do was to pay an outside adviser who has now gone to another country to undertake similar work. We have learned nothing from the years of trying to provide accommodation for ordinary people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of Galway County Council and over the years I have been told of many different figures regarding the numbers on our housing list but none were as startling as the figure declared at a meeting of the council two months ago when it emerged that in our county there are 1,350 families on the housing list, far in excess of the highest previous number of 800 or 900. Why is it that so many families in County Galway cannot afford their own homes? There are many and varied reasons, which I do not have the time to address. However, during the term of office of this Government that cohort of people has been sidelined.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge change in the social profile of those on the housing list. Heretofore most did not have a job or were on social welfare or in low paid jobs. However, many on today's list are in jobs which, in previous times, would have enabled them to buy their own home. How can this problem be addressed? Families on today's list would not want a local authority house if they could acquire their own home with reasonable help. An integrated approach to housing for this cohort of people is required. Without it we will get nowhere. Many of them are bitter that the Celtic tiger economy has meant greater difficulty in owning their own home than was the case three or four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme is good although it has many drawbacks which I do not have time to address. The scheme requires a greater degree of funding to enable it to be targeted at lower <Col N="120" /> income groups. If at all possible, families should be given the opportunity to own their own homes and to take responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of tenant purchase schemes, many of which have been successful. They could be applied to those who could own their own homes if they were given a little more encouragement. Maintenance problems do not arise where houses are owned. The owners will be house proud and this will have a knock-on effect in terms of enhancing the profile of the housing estate.</P>
    <P>There is an acknowledged need to provide many more houses, both social and affordable. Despite occasional problems, affordable housing is a good concept that will be around for a long time. This House recently debated the issue of public private partnerships. There is much to be said for allowing small groups of builders to act in conjunction with local authorities and build social housing.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why the standard of local authority housing has increased very significantly. Tenants are as entitled as anybody else to be in a good house. More importantly, the stock of national housing is enhanced when good quality houses are built. There is worldwide evidence to show that when people are offered well apportioned and finished houses they are likely to remain in good condition, unlike houses of inferior quality. In this regard we should ensure that the input by architects into local authority housing programmes continues.</P>
    <P>The provision of housing for the elderly by the Western Health Board in County Galway works relatively well but it has one huge drawback. An elderly person of, say, 80 years of age must often wait for up to two and half years to have a bath converted to a walk-in shower, despite the fact that conversion is not costly. It is very unfair, especially when people are granted approval but must then wait.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to his debate. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister of State, Dan Wallace, and especially the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, have done Trojan work. The principal driving force behind the Bill is the need to make statutory provision for a number of measures aimed at increasing the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say about helping young people gain access to the housing market. In his contribution he said he would update the power to pay new house grants and remove a small number of anomalies to ensure that, following a legal separation, applicants who are first time purchasers will be eligible for a grant. The Minister could go further in helping young people with housing grants. He said it was intended to look at more efficient use of energy, including the use of renewable forms of energy in line with the national climate change <Col N="121" /> strategy. I would like more information on this because we all realise there are many difficulties facing young people in their efforts to obtain a house for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I welcome what has been said in relation to disabled persons' housing grants for which increased funding will be sought. One of the difficulties with this useful grant is that there is no consistency in the manner in which local authorities throughout the country operate the grant. For example, a provision was introduced some years ago to provide a grant for heating. That was a welcome initiative in most local authorities but the rate of grant paid varies. While a 90% grant is available for the installation of showers and improvements to bedrooms or bathrooms, a 50% grant is the maximum available for heating installation, certainly in Galway County. It may be different in other authorities. As other Deputies have said, the provision of a heating grant has to be a priority for local authorities whether for those with a disability or the elderly and it should be provided at the maximum rate in each local authority. The same is true of the essential repairs grant but certain works are not eligible for local authority grant purposes. There will always be duplication in respect of the essential repairs grant and the Western Health Board scheme for repairs for the elderly. While there are two bodies working in this area, the hope is that they can deal with the waiting list. There is a great need for the funding provided by the Minister and he has been generous in the way he has provided it. Given the waiting list which exists, there is a great need to have this work done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the work being done by Respond and other voluntary housing bodies. I was struck by the professional way in which Respond operates in Galway, particularly the manner in which it deals with applications, communities and local authorities. I have noticed in recent months that Respond and other voluntary housing organisations are attaching an affordable housing scheme to the voluntary housing scheme. That has provided a nice mix of housing developments in towns and villages. In the village of Kilkerrin, County Galway, a good scheme provided by Respond is in progress at a cost of £1.2 million, which amounts to £66,000 per unit. This is good value for money and has provided great opportunities for families seeking housing to live in a village in which they want to live. All credit is due to Respond. Kilkerrin is one of those villages which is lucky to have a sewerage scheme. The issue of providing more funding for the smaller villages will have to be tackled. One reads in the newspapers every day about the millions of pounds being spent in Galway city. The provision of £1 million in each small village in east Galway would provide a sewerage scheme for that village.</P>
    <P>When I approached the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, some years ago concerning a sewerage scheme for Williamstown, the cost of which was £1 million, he and his officials said that if a par<Col N="122" /> ticular system, based on a reed bed treatment system, was used the cost could be reduced to £0.5 million. Those schemes are now in operation. When a sewerage scheme is put in place in a town or village it means a housing scheme can be developed at a faster rate.</P>
    <P>The latest initiative on those sewerage schemes is what is known as a design, build and operate &ndash; DBO &ndash; scheme, which the Minister piloted in County Meath. Much progress has been made with the scheme throughout the country. In the village of Woodpark, near Portumna, that scheme will be used to provide a sewerage scheme for a townland which was omitted from the scheme in Portumna. I welcome that type of initiative. If that relatively small sum could be spent in every town and village there would be real development and more families living in those areas.</P>
    <P>Recently when the Minister launched the RAPID programme I was to the fore in welcoming it because it applied to the towns of Tuam and Ballinasloe in my constituency. I was subsequently told I lived in the poverty zone. I recalled the musical, &ldquo;Fiddler on the Roof&rdquo;, in which the leading character said, &ldquo;to be poor is nothing to be ashamed of, but it is nothing to be proud of either.&rdquo; Tuam and Ballinasloe would be regarded as towns in the poorer regions if one were to apply the RAPID programme criteria but it means that whatever funds are available under the national development plan will go to such towns. Parts of Galway city come under the RAPID programme yet that city is one of which those who reside outside it are envious.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that one of the reasons Tuam was designated as suitable for the RAPID programme was that it had a large number of local authority houses. I am not sure what those who designed the programme were talking about when they stated there were too many local authority houses. I am of the view that more such housing will have to be built. The more recent schemes have been well designed and finished. Where communities have made an effort to provide more housing, they should get assistance as is happening in Tuam and Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>Another development I welcome and one which is obvious on the ground is that many families are moving out of cities into the smaller towns. For example, people are moving out of the Galway Corporation area into the county council area. In the town of Headford I have met many who have moved from Galway city. They made the point that they are able to get a good quality house at a more reasonable price but they also want services, such as transport, that we take for granted. It is worth noting that local authorities have drawn up town plans for all these towns, including Headford and Athenry. The Government should ensure they contain plans for transport and education facilities. It is a very welcome sign of growth that the cities, which are getting too big, are spreading out to smaller towns.</P>
    <P>Under the rural development scheme, families move back to smaller towns and villages which is <Col N="123" /> a welcome development. Galway County Council, for example, has given priority to families who want to move from Dublin to Galway. There have been problems with the scheme caused by the poor condition of some of the houses allocated to the families. A further difficulty is the inability of families to buy the houses they have been allocated despite being willing and able to do so. In some cases, Galway County Council has come to the rescue by buying some of the houses. According to the old saying, a person's home is his castle. People should be given the opportunity to buy out houses if they so wish. At present, however, the elderly and people participating in the rural housing schemes have a problem doing so.</P>
    <P>Another problem faced by the elderly is the cost of refuse collection. In County Galway and, I am sure, many other counties, refuse collection services have been privatised. Additional costs for the service providers at the tipheads, together with increased maintenance costs, whether in diesel or the costs associated with employing people, have led to difficulties which did not exist when local authorities were responsible for the service. It appears these issues were not fully thought out when people were allocated their houses.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council and other councils have taken the very positive step of appointing housing liaison officers. I welcome this step, having seen them visiting and keeping in touch with families who are seeking housing. However, only two liaison officers have been appointed for the entire county which is the second largest in Ireland. It is very frustrating for people applying to the local authority under any scheme to have to wait for someone to call and investigate the most appropriate scheme for their circumstances. The liaison officers fulfil a very important role in this respect, visiting people and reporting back to the housing section of Galway County Council or the health board on which scheme is suitable for applicant families. I call for the appointment of further liaison officers.</P>
    <P>The CLÁR programme announced by Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Éamon Ó Cuív, will prove to be a very useful scheme. In announcing the programme, which is almost an adjunct of the RAPID programme, the Minister of State highlighted that some townlands and villages have lost half their population in a 70 year period. Two towns in this position are Milltown and Creggs, both of which are on a waiting list for sewerage schemes. Milltown is higher up the list than Creggs. If the Minister pursues his idea of giving 50-50 type grants, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to towns and villages, there is no doubt they will get a sewerage scheme and housing will follow. The residents of Milltown, which has won the tidiest town competition in County Galway for the past four years as well as many regional awards, <Col N="124" /> argue that, while it is a beautiful village located on the N17, no more houses can be built in it. The only way to build houses in Milltown, Creggs and similar places is to install a sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State receives the necessary backing and support for the CLÁR programme, which is an excellent idea for creating another kind of rural renewal. I wish him success and hope it is properly funded. I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister will be able to put his proposals into practice as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government does not lack initiative or imagination &ndash; there is a raft of schemes available for the provision of housing or housing facilities. The problem is one of a distinct lack of urgency and drive to achieve targets. Every public representative in the House faces the same range of problems with regard to the housing crisis. We are besieged by constituents trying to find out what can be done through the political process to help them achieve their ambition of owning a house or being allocated one. Although some of the schemes are very good, there has been no drive or consistent attempt on the part of the Government to achieve the highest targets. In the early 1980s, Castlebar Urban Council gave three bedroom houses to single mothers because there were no other applications for houses. The proviso it attached was that the houses might be taken back if families came on to the housing list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the background of the best years we ever had and an urgent requirement to deal with housing, the Minister's performance has been pathetic. He stated that the affordable housing scheme enables local authorities to construct new houses which will be offered for sale to eligible purchasers at cost price and, accordingly, at a significant discount from the market value of comparable houses in the area and went on to say that the necessary funding to facilitate an output of 1,000 units per annum under this scheme has been provided for in the national development plan. He also stated that 300 units were completed last year with 150 completed so far this year and that 6,270 units were either under construction or planned. If 150 have been completed, does this mean that 6,120 remain to be completed this year? Will somebody spell out how many of the 6,120 units will actually be completed and <Col N="125" /> how many are planned? Given that the Minister is aware of the range of problems we face, why is the scheme not driven forward more vigorously? </P>
    <P>Section 17 gives the Housing Finance Agency powers to provide funding for non-housing related capital expenditure purposes. Is this a parallel scheme to public private partnerships, where the full operational and marginal costs will be recovered from non-domestic, commercial and industrial uses? The Government and the Department's drive to impose PPPs in towns like Castlebar, where there will be a £40 million scheme, will result in business people being fleeced over a 20 year period. Commercial rates will be imposed by another door if somebody does not explain what is going on here. Will the non-housing elements of housing works, such as water treatment, be provided by the Housing Finance Agency or local authorities? How will the moneys be recovered in schemes where there are no commercial or industrial users?</P>
    <P>I compliment the architectural departments of county councils for building beautiful schemes in many parts of the country. There are a few such imaginative schemes in my far-flung western constituency, such as Inver, Barnatra, Ballyvary, Bohola and Achill. We need a streamlined system, however, so that the provision of housing can be much more efficient. The building unit of the Department of Education and Science has run together all the various stages that had to be passed, and may be able to spend another &euro;100 million this year. I am quite sure that a similar situation applies in the case of local authorities. Once land is acquired by local authorities, we should try to achieve many more projects such as I have mentioned and on a much more efficient basis.</P>
    <P>I seek a response to queries on the issue of the Traveller community, as the Minister's remarks, that he has asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explore whether the movement of large scale encampments needs to be dealt with on a broader front, were a complete cop-out. Have we moved away from the promotion of halting sites as a solution to many of these problems? Nobody seems to be able to answer this question. The Government is committed to housing all Travellers, but no moves have been made on halting sites because of the impending election. It seems to me that the Government wants to acquire houses for Travellers willy-nilly. Will somebody explain the policy in this area?</P>
    <P>A problem mentioned by a number of Deputies on the Government benches should be dealt with. Why do people have to wait for two years for a shower to be installed? They should be allowed to buy the equipment and contract someone to do the work. Local authorities could then make a grant payment and we would be finished with it. It is not right that people have to endure an endless bureaucratic process, including medical and engineering assessments and plans, <Col N="126" /> during which time they move closer to leaving this mortal world we share. The essential repairs, disabled housing grant and voluntary housing schemes should be encouraged by the Minister to a far greater extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to revisit the subject of grant payments that was raised by Deputy Kenny at the end of his contribution; in particular special housing aid for the elderly, essential repairs and disabled person's grants. The Deputy was right to suggest it is crazy to put people through the mill to save a very small amount of money. It takes so long for a grant application to be made that by the time it is approved by a health board or local authority, the cost of the work that is needed may have doubled. Why is it necessary to have so much red tape? If a scheme that costs less than &euro;10,000 is genuinely needed, why can we not approve grant aid immediately? Payments can be made when it is certified that the work has been done.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted by residents of County Mayo's three islands on many occasions in relation to another anomaly. Those who live on Clare Island, Inishbiggle and Inishturk often complain about the system of allocating grant aid to Gaeltacht residents. It is disgraceful that English speakers on Gaeltacht islands do not get certain grants as they cannot speak Irish. Island life is so tough that islanders should receive double the grant paid to those who live on the mainland, regardless of whether they speak Irish. Basic services often cost twice as much on islands as on the mainland because it is expensive to bring goods across the sea. The suffering of islanders, for example in relation to transport during bad weather, is shared by those who speak both languages. I would like to see grants for islanders doubled across the board, for those who live in Gaeltachtaí and those who do not. They should be treated equally.</P>

      <P>The most recent census of population indicated that 1,900 people in County Mayo do not have a toilet or running water. Health boards and local authorities have adopted a policy of seeing people as elderly at the age of 65. I ask the Minister of State to send immediately a letter to local authorities and health boards telling them that a person is not of old age at 65. If a person of 55 or 58 needs a grant for a shower, bath or running water, they should not have to wait until their 65th birthday. I do not agree with the policy of approving grants only when people reach this age. I ask the Minister of State to eliminate this daft anomaly, as it deprives those in need of basic facilities from receiving the requisite grants. Cases were taken against local authorities and health boards as a result of what happened in nursing homes and I predict that somebody will take a similar case having been refused a grant for being 58 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" />I encourage those without a toilet or running water to apply for a grant immediately. For three years I have been demanding shower and bath facilities for a woman in my constituency, but the project will only begin next week because of red tape in the council and the health board. They even made this 80 year old woman go through the planning process so that she would no longer have to go to the toilet in a field every night. The matter should have been dealt with as soon as the application was made, but the health board was unable to do so. The health board should have ordered a contractor to do the work immediately without need for planning. There should be no restrictive criteria for anyone without running water or a toilet who applies for a grant to a local authority or health board. Permission should be granted immediately in such circumstances as it is disgraceful that people should have to do without these facilities in this day and age. I was outraged to be told that there were 1,900 such people when the last census was taken.</P>
    <P>The housing crisis is a problem for many young people, who contact me every day looking for local authority housing. Students and those working in Dublin face similar difficulties. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will have to address the problems of those paying high rent, especially in Dublin. Subsidies or tax breaks are needed for those who find it difficult to find affordable accommodation. Students in Galway and other university towns have to pay above the odds for housing. There have never been so many young people on the housing list and there has never been such a poor return from local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and his Department have to deal with the fact that many people who want to build homes in rural areas are being stopped by the planning process. Many people are applying for planning permission to build houses in the northern part of my constituency, but are frustrated by septic tank regulations and puraflow systems which cost a fortune. No houses would have been built 100 years ago if so many rules and regulations had existed. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will have to give people in rural areas an opportunity to build their own homes, especially in their own areas. Land owners should be allowed to build homes for their sons and daughters on their land instead of being pushed into towns.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a category of people who have been discriminated against since the foundation of the State, namely, single men and women in their 50s and 60s who do not qualify for a council house simply because they are single. Some of these people do not have the means to buy their own homes. If they had the will, many local authorities could build apartments in towns and give these people an opportunity rather than debarring them because they are single and of a certain age. These people should be assisted by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The objectives of the shared ownership and affordable housing scheme are laudable in that they aim to facilitate access to full home ownership in two or more stages by persons who could not afford to buy their homes immediately. Given the cost of housing, this scheme should be operating in a more meaningful way. However, it is not being taken up by a sufficient number of eligible people and is not having the impact which it should have. One must ask the reason eligible people are not joining the scheme. We must examine and modifying the scheme where necessary, a point to which I will return.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State continually highlights his objectives in the area of social and affordable housing. In his speech he stated that unprecedented progress has been made in meeting housing needs since this Government took office. However, it seems that the Minister of State and the Government are not living in the real world. The Government's housing policy has been an utter disaster. When it came into office there were approximately 26,000 applicants on local authority housing waiting lists. We cannot obtain the official figures as they will not be available until after May, but those involved in the area of housing have informed me that over 50,000 applicants are now on housing waiting lists. If one multiplies this figure by a conservative factor of three, it means that over 150,000 people &ndash; men, women and children &ndash; are living in deplorable, over-crowded conditions or in doorways and on the streets. This is the Government's record.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we know of the situation regarding homeless people and those with a child, partner, husband or wife who, given the cost of rented accommodation, have to live with their parents in over-crowded conditions. Young and not so young couples with families are living in mobile homes. Last weekend I had to cross a few hundred yards of muck to get to a mobile home to meet a husband and wife and their two children. Condensation was dripping from the ceiling and the bed clothes were wet. A heater in the mobile home was the cause of the condensation, but these are the conditions in which this couple and their two children live. This is the Ireland of today. After five years of unprecedented growth and affluence over 150,000 people live in unacceptable conditions. How can the Government take credit for this situation? The people are waiting to give the Government its answer in the general election.</P>
      <P>This Bill does nothing to rectify the shortcomings in the current social and affordable housing scheme, particularly with regard to income eligibility. A constituent of mine stated that the current limit of £25,000 for a single person precludes a significant number of people who would otherwise be unable to afford housing within Fingal County Council, which is my local authority area. The £25,000 income criteria has to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" />My local authority has a priority list regarding social and affordable housing. Some people on the top of the list since 1998 have annually produced documentation regarding income. Is it right that after waiting for four years on the list and being eligible for the scheme, the income eligibility limit should change to £25,500 for a single person or a cumulative figure of over £62,250 for a couple? Something is wrong. Why is there a need for an income limit given that one is not entitled to a shared ownership or affordable housing loan if one does not qualify for a mortgage from a financial institution or building society? We must do away with the income limit.</P>
    <P>Why is there a need for the 40% limit? Why is it not 30% and 70% rent? There are many elements to this issue and this is a good scheme. However, issues have to be dealt with and I hope that when the Minister of State responds to this debate he will give a commitment to put his record before the people. His record regarding housing is dismal and the young people are waiting for him.</P>

      <P>At a time of unprecedented resources neither I, nor my constituents, understand the reason schools projects in the constituency are still being held up. I wish to refer to the sports hall at Firhouse community college. The complex and tardy planning phase of this development has been completed and the project has been waiting to go to tender for months. This is a hugely populous area and although the facility is very badly needed, it cannot get the go-ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to Glenasmole national school at Bohernabreena. The school which was built in a beautiful part of the Dublin mountains in 1958 is now desperately in need of facilities such as toilet facilities. There is a prefab building that is barely functional and there is a complete lack of indoor sports and recreational facilities. The building is unsuitable for young children, the prefab is shabby and in poor condition and there are rusty pipes, cisterns and toilet bowls and toilets which do not work. The condition is generally very poor. I ask the Mini<Col N="131" /> ster to make a decision before he leaves office to approve the necessary works in that school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the presence of the Minister for Education and Science. I am delighted to have the opportunity of saying what I want to say to him directly. I know he is a conscientious and hard-working Minister, committed to the implementation of his brief. I remind the Minister that I have raised with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions the fact that my colleague, Deputy Shortall, the Labour Party spokesperson on education, requested on 4 December, 12 December and 31 January that the Minister publish the list of 850 schools which are at different stages of being cleared for construction or refurbishment from the building unit in Tullamore.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow, I will be in Cork city for my 20th constituency visit since December. In all the schools I visit, I hear the same song of frustration, despair, anger and attacks on bureaucracy. The last mentioned is quite unfair because I have spoken to people in Tullamore and, although they are instructed not to give the information in writing, under pressure and in sympathy and solidarity with the parents and teachers they may provide information unofficially.</P>
      <P>Can we have some <i>glasnost</i> in the Department of Education and Science 13 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall? Can it not publish the list of schools and their standings in terms of applications for stages 1, 2 or 3 and when they are likely to get the go-ahead to proceed to the next stage? Nobody believes that any Government has a magic wand. Every one recognises that there must be a queue and a prioritisation process. However, people are being driven mad by their complete inability to penetrate this extraordinary wall of obfuscation and Kafkaesque departmental workings. We are told that this is coming from the political top of the Department and the Minister now has an opportunity to refute this if it is not the case.</P>
      <P>I can sing a song in chorus with Deputy Rabbitte about the sports hall for the school in Firhouse. On a visit early in February to Dublin West, I had the pleasure of meeting people from Castleknock Community College which, I was informed, has 1,100 pupils after only six years in existence. It is a fine school, well-constructed and well-designed. It is not part of the legacy of the early 1980s when schools were built on a wing and a prayer and are now lethal buildings because of the poor quality of construction. Castleknock Community College had taken in children from another catchment area on the explicit commitment that it would get its desperately needed 806 square meter sports hall. Approval in principle was officially sanctioned by the Department in August but the school still cannot obtain any hard information from the Department, the Minister or anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are realistic people. They are not stupid and know that resources have to be allocated and <Col N="132" /> rationed. However, they deserve to be told the truth and to be treated as adults. They deserve a response from the Department. The issue here is the treatment of citizens, more importantly the people who give up their time for parent-teacher associations and boards of management, not to mention the teachers themselves, particularly the principals, who do not have the sort of back-up resources, in terms of secretarial staff or support systems, required to make these calls. They must deal with pupils, teachers and the basic running of a school all at once.</P>
    <P>In Cork North-West before Christmas, I received representations with our candidate Mr. Coughlan about Aghinagh national school which has become a legend due to the poor treatment it has received. I will put into the record of the House the chronicle of events I received from the school principal, Ted Vaughan of Macroom:</P>
    <P>In 1995, the board of management discusses the health and safety issues associated with the deterioration of the school premises. First contact made with the Department of Education. On 10 December 1997, a deputation from the board and the parents' association meets the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin. On 5 March 1998, during the Adjournment debate on the issue, Deputy Martin states: &ldquo;I accept that there is a long-term accommodation problem for two classrooms.&rdquo;  He also states: &ldquo;It is not acceptable that children should have to accept such conditions.&rdquo; 13 August &ndash; the planning process has begun, a site is chosen. 21 December &ndash; after a year and a half's delay, planning permission is finally applied for by the Department of Education and Science. This delay included a nine-month wait to have a percolation test done. 15 March 2001, planning permission is finally received. The delay in issuing planning permission was on the part of the Department, not Cork County Council. July 2001, the Office of Public Works purchases the site for a new school. 8 October, officials of the Southern Health Board officially classify the school as substandard. 12 December, a delegation from the school meets Deputy Woods. No commitment given or response received, to date, resulting from that meeting. [Perhaps the Minister could respond to this.] General Semiconductor, a company in the area, donates funds to the school building project before departing from the community with the loss of 700 jobs. 18 January 2002, a delegation from the school meets Deputy Martin, who agrees to pursue the issue. It goes on.</P>
    <P>A similar litany could be provided for many of the 850 schools on that list. My colleague, Deputy Shortall, accompanied me, during a visit to her constituency, to the Mater Christi school which is in dire need of additional funds and requires a response. There is a most aggravating common thread running through all the visits I have made. What is it about this Minister and this Depart<Col N="133" /> ment that makes them incapable of giving to the citizens of this State the sort of transparent treatment which has now become the law of the land in relation to many other aspects of the operation of our society?</P>
    <P>In support of Deputy Rabbitte's comments, it is an incredible indictment of the administration and management of the country's finances that a Government which inherited a surplus of unprecedented proportions and an unprecedented set of economic statistics should be leaving office in May with the treasury of the Department of Finance effectively mined and a Department of Education and Science incapable of telling anybody where a school is on the list because the Minister has been allocated so little money, he is embarrassed to outline the true position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The people are very appreciative. I stress that because there is a misconception in the Opposition commentary. The facts and figures speak for themselves. The Government has undertaken the largest capital investment programme in the history of the State. Last year the Department approved over 1,400 capital grants for primary schools and that was up from 800 the previous year. In 1997, 450 capital projects were approved. Those figures speak volumes for the efforts made by the Government to bring forward the capital programme about which we are now talking.</P>
      <P>For many years we were coming from a low base and everybody would acknowledge that for decades investment was not put into the capital side of primary education. Some schools around the country were in a poor state but it must be acknowledged that this Government is now addressing the issue. The INTO produced a list of schools it considers to be sub-standard and, in most cases, the Government dealt with them, a fact acknowledged by Senator O'Toole and an indication of the Department's commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are passionate about education and about their children being in a proper and modern school environment. Teachers are also passionate about their work and are entitled to work <Col N="134" /> in modern complexes. We must continually improve and move forward to ensure that the commitments we make are backed up by funding. The figures are there to show we are doing that and the education budget has been massively increased over the years. Nobody should make accusations against the Minister in regard to delays. For years projects were not given the go-ahead and people were knocking on doors to get sanction to move to the initial stages of developments. Staff in the Department have come in for unfair criticism in this House and I take exception to that. I have always found them courteous, able and willing to assist public representatives, boards of management and principals and I compliment them on that.</P>
    <P>It is timely that we address the fact that there is a demographic change in the make up of Irish society. The movement away from rural areas towards urban areas must be addressed. The Department must look at county development plans and assess where population demands will be. Years ago I remember fighting for a second level school in Glanmire which again was sanctioned by a Fianna Fáil-led Government. The problem was that the population had increased dramatically and we were just playing catch-up at that stage. We need to look at the demographic issue and if county councils bring forward a county development plan indicating where populations will be based, the Department should take that into account.</P>
    <P>This Government has been totally committed to the capital projects in primary education, a fact which is very evident when a person drives around the country and sees the number of building projects completed or under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm seans a bheith agam cuidiú leis an athrún atá faoi bhráid na Dála ón Rialtas um thráthnóna<b>. </b>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science has already outlined to this House, the record achievements of this Government in improving the physical infrastructure in our education system. In fulfilment of our commitment to tackle substandard school accommodation we have, over the lifetime of this Government, progressively increased the level of capital investment in schools to the point where we now have a record number of school building projects under construction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed, to judge by his opening contribution yesterday evening, does not seem to be even aware of the extent of the programme being undertaken by the Government. He speaks of a survey relating to 75 schools with inadequate facilities as if, somehow, the problem could be completely resolved if these were dealt with. He forgets that there are 3,300 primary schools in Ireland, more than 50% of which are two-teacher schools, giving a choice of location and the opportunity to young children to attend school in their local area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" />Deputy Creed conveniently ignores the fact that the number of major building projects at primary level currently under construction exceeds the number in that survey on its own and that six times that figure, or 450 school projects, are in the pipeline and undergoing architectural planning. As the Minister, Deputy Woods, indicated last night, we have also approved over 1,350 capital grants for primary schools in 2001 alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I never worry about those matters, I let the people make their decision. In 2000, the Government approved 750 projects.</P>
      <P>Unlike the confused Opposition, the Government has never underestimated the scale of the task facing it and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under-investment in school infrastructure. We have not only recognised what needs to be done but have set about doing it in a systematic way. The very notion, as implied by the Deputies opposite, that this Government is suddenly going to produce major capital projects for electoral purposes, like rabbits out of a hat, is ludicrous and betrays an abysmal lack of knowledge of the long-term planning required to put a major building project on site.</P>
      <P>No amount of crocodile tears shed by Opposition Deputies can disguise the fact that when they were last in office their record was abysmal when it came to providing the appropriate level of resources to deal with school buildings, in particular, and education, in general. Deputy Creed indicated last night that he and his Fine Gael colleagues had &ldquo;a vast array of proposals&rdquo; to deal with the situation. We must examine his &ldquo;vast array&rdquo;. It seems to consist of proposals such as public private partnerships, which are already being successfully implemented by this Government in the education area, or of proposals which demonstrate his total lack of knowledge and misunderstanding of the important task of modern school building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already have PPP projects which have been brought to construction in record time at a cost of &euro;81.5 million which will cater for 3,500 pupils. There are many more projects in the pipeline. How Deputy Creed can deduce from this that the Department of Education and Science is reluctant to embrace the concept of PPPs is quite mystifying. Indeed, I might add that no PPP projects involving schools were ever initiated by Deputy Creed's party or the other Opposition parties <Col N="136" /> when they were in office, despite the fact that the concept of funding educational projects in this way was already a reality at that time in many countries outside of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed speaks of the use of generic designs which are, of course, a good idea. Generic designs have been used successfully in the past and are currently used, as appropriate, on primary schools designed in-house in the Department. Measures are being developed to further extend their use. However, because the majority of major primary school building projects involve the upgrading of existing accommodation and the provision of an extension, the use of generic designs is not technically feasible in all cases. They are much more suitable for new schools on greenfield sites.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed also mentioned design and build contracts, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of all school building projects are already designed and built by private sector design teams and private sector building contractors. The Department and the Minister are in favour of the elimination of bureaucracy as called for by Deputy Creed. The Minister, Deputy Woods, outlined in detail last night the measures already in place in this area and the proposals being developed through the use of new technology.</P>

      <P>Deputy Creed said the Department's only role would be to establish standards and conditions, a claim which begs a simple question. Whose role is it to manage the dispersal of funds to individual projects and to ensure value for money? Is the question of ensuring value for taxpayers' money an irrelevancy, as it seems to be with so many proposals emanating from Deputy Creed's party these days, a trait typical of their last performances in Government.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what the Opposition has been trying to claim over the past two nights, there are no easy solutions to the provision of improved school accommodation on a nation-wide scale. It requires a sustained input of financial and other resources&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate. I compliment the Minister for what he has done regarding the Department's operations, which as the Minister realised when he took office were in need of reform. I congratulate the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. John Dennehy, on carrying out a review of the Department's operations. Mr. Sean Cromien was asked to review the Department's operations, systems and staffing needs. The Minister has expressed his concerns about the need for a local services network, a matter on which recommendations have been made by Mr. Cromien.</P>
      <P>The phrase used by Mr. Cromien about the Department was that &ldquo;the urgent drives out the important&rdquo;, a phrase much quoted in the media. However, that phrase also shows that there was a lot of day-to-day work within the Department and that there was a need to look at long-term strategic thinking. That is one of the reasons Mr. Cromien referred to the planning and building unit of the Department as an area that should be looked at.</P>
      <P>Obviously, one of the reasons for this workload is that we have had increased funding for capital purposes in the Department, and credit goes to the Minister and his officials for that. Mr. Cromien recommended in particular that the building unit should become an executive agency with a national remit to handle the construction and modification of schools. This, he said, would free the Department from the present heavy operational burden in this area, allowing it to focus on policy monitoring and evaluation. The Minister delivered on that when he announced a framework of regional offices for the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The Department is obviously very busy; it is also very centralised and there is a need for a presence around the country. This has been commented on by the Minister on a number of occasions. The Department is in contrast with other service Departments where there is more of a local presence, for example, in the areas of agriculture, health and social welfare. It is important and welcome to have local offices as the Minister intends and, in particular, to move towards a one-stop-shop approach for educational services as recommended by Mr. Cromien. With the work in the area of special educational officers, the proposed educational welfare officers, those dealing with adult education under the stewardship of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, and with the number of psychologists available, there is a need for this type of one-stop-shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the INTO survey. The INTO list of 73 schools referred to schools in the constituency of Galway East which I represent with my colleagues. Brownsgrove, Moyglass and other schools were mentioned. Many of the problems raised by the INTO, such as heating and washing facilities, have been addressed <Col N="138" /> through the devolved grant. A situation has arisen over the years in which 165 schools have been highlighted by the INTO, so some must have come off the list. However, we hope that the Minister will be able to provide funding for the schools on that list which are regarded as substandard.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking about schools, I should mention the Minister's allocation of grants to the board of management of St. Cuan's national school in my own village of Castleblakeney. This is evidence of the Minister's commitment. St. Cuan's is a school with just 200 pupils and the Minister has also made that type of commitment at second level to small vocational schools and lay schools, where there is a viable school and, in many cases, a stand-alone school. The Minister has also shown his commitment to small primary schools with the amount of activity now occurring in the Department.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister continues with the work he is doing. I understand he is aware of the difficulties in the structure and staffing of the Department and is working on that. His announcements give me the impression that he has the confidence to continue with the school building projects which are now with the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply to the motion tabled by the Opposition in relation to this matter. We must recognise reality and the Minister's speech clearly recognises there has been an exponential increase in the scale, scope and cost of school building in recent years. That is as it should be and the Minister and his predecessor embarked on a comprehensive programme of upgrading existing schools and developing new schools.</P>
      <P>As a representative of a growing area, I have had first-hand experience of dealing with the Minister and his officers in relation to this matter. I congratulate his officers for the courtesy and patience with which they deal with representations from so many members of the public about the development of new school projects. With a big increase in population in suburban areas, and a big influx of population into the country, huge challenges are being posed for the primary and secondary level systems in education. It is very important that we devise a structured way of responding to the increase in needs.</P>
      <P>All of this has happened at a time when we have seen substantial withdrawal of the traditional religious interests from education, both at primary and secondary level. It is important that the Minister takes command of the administrative system in his Department, which has been short-staffed in the past and has not had the capacity to deal with the huge increase in demand. When the amount of investment outlined in the Minister's speech and the scale and number of the projects, it is a remarkable credit to the Department that it has brought matters along to such an extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" />In terms of future funding, it is important that we get the public private partnership system on the rails as far as primary and second level developments are concerned because we need some way of funding this vast increase in capital investment. That is the obvious way forward and anything that can be done to progress that system is welcome. I could mention a litany of projects in my constituency. At present, there are three national schools being developed in my constituency &ndash; parish schools at Clonee and at Diswellstown and an &ldquo;educate together&rdquo; school at Castleknock. The Minister has been very supportive of these projects and I am anxious to progress them as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>However, to progress these projects, we need more extensive use of the public private partnership approach. I also urge the Minister to look at the question of the sports hall provision. An important initiative was announced a number of years ago and these plans are now coming to fruition. In funding terms, they will require more public private partnerships. These are important developments. It is important we plan for education in a structured way because one of the difficulties I see emerging with increasing parental choice under the Education Act is that we are going to have to respond to that increased demand for a diversity of educational type and invest in the necessary school buildings to afford it.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for outlining the position to the House. No Government, irrespective of who is in office, would be able to fund in a single year the amount of projects this Administration has got up and running. It is a tremendous tribute to this Administration. What we are looking at is a record schools building programme moving to a much higher level of intensity than has ever been seen before. I have full confidence in the Government that it will find the necessary finance through more flexible financial instruments to advance these most important projects.</P>

      <P>The motion tabled by Fine Gael is trying to contend that the Government is not committed to a higher standard of education. I do not agree with the contention of the Fine Gael party that this Government is not committed to a strong building and refurbishment programme at primary and second level schools. The Government's commitment is matched by a strong commitment to improving education standards.</P>
      <P>Before talking in greater detail about the specifics of this Government's schools building programme, I would like to make some general comments about improvements which have been made to the education system since the Government came into office in the summer of 1997. The schools information technology programme has made a major impact in our schools and has brought the information age into our classrooms. This is one of the largest initiatives of its type in the world and there are now over 60,000 multi-media computers in schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools IT 2000 programme will bring all schools into the computer age which will play a very important part in the education of our school children who will be able to continue to effectively compete in the workplace in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The new education technology investment fund has unprecedented Exchequer support. This is addressing severe capacity constraints at third level and is developing new areas of activities in third level institutions where emerging skills needs have already been identified. In response to the report of the expert group on future needs, 5,400 third level places in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas have been created. We have also ensured the vibrancy of work outside the sciences by establishing the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences.</P>
      <P>We have also cut pupil-teacher ratios to the lowest level in our history and having already more than doubled teacher training places, we have pledged to ensure that teaching support problems do not occur. The Government has established a Teaching Council whose function is to promote higher standards for first and second level teachers. A revised primary curriculum was launched in September 1999, representing the first significant revision of the primary curriculum in almost 30 years. This Government is to continue to provide funding for a series of initiatives, including the early school leavers initiative and the stay in school initiative to identify and help children aged eight to 15 who are at risk of dropping out of school or being caught in the cycles of disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has extended the remedial teachers service to all primary schools with effect from September 1999 and the home school community liaison service to all primary schools with disadvantaged status. It has also established a <Col N="141" /> special needs education forum and is committed to promoting higher standards of adult education. No Government can match our record of consistent investment and development of new policies to address educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>It is to this latter point that I turn to address some of the issues which have been raised by the Opposition as regards the Government's commitment to the schools building programme. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, has already informed the House that 84 major primary school projects are under construction this year or are due in a matter of weeks at a cost of over &euro;110 million. Work is proceeding on the acquisition of sites for a further 60 new primary schools. Architectural planning is continuing on over 450 major primary school building projects. Over 100 of these are at an advanced stage of the planning process at an estimated cost of &euro;170 million. The Minister has confirmed to the House that a number of these projects will be ready to go to the tender process within the coming weeks and others will be ready later in the year. The statistics clearly spell out the commitment of this Government to improve the standard of school buildings.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed a substantial level of finance for capital funding projects for primary and secondary school buildings. The level of capital funding in 2002 will be over &euro;153 million for primary school buildings and &euro;184 million for post-primary schools, totalling over &euro;337 million. The Government is going to add to these figures projects which will be undertaken through public private partnership. I strongly support the role of public private partnership in our education system as I do in other areas of our society because the public and private sectors can work together on many issues.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the political programme as announced by the Minister to the House in which he stated that no other Government has matched the performance of this Administration in terms of meeting the needs of our schools for modern, state-of-the-art buildings and facilities. Notwithstanding the achievements, there is still a substantial amount of work to be done on our building programme, which must change and adapt to meet emerging curricular and other needs.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to addressing historical deficit in terms of our education infrastructure. We have continually allocated substantial extra funding in each of the budgets over the last number of years to improve the level and quality of our school buildings. This Government has provided almost four times as much this year as the Opposition did when in Government up to 1997 for this purpose alone. In 2001, the Government approved over 1,350 capital grants for primary schools compared to only 420 when Fine Gael was a member of the rainbow Government. Some 31 of these grants approved by the Government in 2001 exceeded over &euro;1 million.</P>
    <P>We cannot deny the strong challenges facing us in the future in terms of improving all schools to <Col N="142" /> a higher standard. Many of the schools built in the 1970s and 1980s were low cost, high maintenance buildings that are now at the end of their natural lives and will have to be rebuilt over the coming years. I agree with the Minister when he states that the approach taken by the Opposition on these matters is too simplistic because many of the issues involved, particularly in the area of major construction projects, are quite complex. Opposition Deputies are well aware of that but they like to play politics now and again, especially when there is an up coming general election.</P>
    <P>Many schools building projects depend on factors such as the size of the project, architectural planning, land acquisition if necessary, the granting of planning permission and the carrying out of competitive tenders and procurement procedures with prospective contractors. Notwithstanding all of these stages which must be undertaken, this Government has achieved much in this regard and far more than the Opposition achieved when in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Farrelly, Kenny, Neville, McGrath and Ring, the Green Party and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to support Deputy Creed's motion. However, I express alarm and pity at the Minister's inability to acquire sufficient funding to progress the many projects at national school level in his Department. Some of these projects have been waiting up to eight years to be progressed and not one has shown any degree of progress over the last four years. I have replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister and each one, especially since Deputy Woods took office, contains the same jargon. The same clichés are used and the only difference is the address of the particular national school.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the deliberate failure of the Minister for Education and Science to keep the boards of management, parents associations, students, staff and elected representatives informed of the current status of individual school projects. The replies from the Department have been an insult to practically every member of the Opposition. I do not blame the Department officials but the Minister who has deliberately stifled them. What we heard from Deputy Kelleher is now out in the open. The news is beginning to filter through. At the same time as other schools projects similar to this are being told &ldquo;no&rdquo;, letters have gone out to backbenchers telling them the news is good. It is an insult to Members of this House, and to members of the Opposition in particular, that such shenanigans are going on at official level. The Minister himself signs those letters. It is a pity that is going on and that he is playing politics with parents, boards of management, students and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one thing this Minister is determined to do and that is break the morale of the teaching profession. He has gone a long way on <Col N="143" /> this course in the past two years, facing down every action and legitimate claim of the teaching profession. Now he has advertised in the newspapers for outside people to supervise. If that is what is going to happen, it is time the teaching profession did one thing, that is teach and walk away. Parents would then realise the commitment of the teaching profession, but the Minister has broken the morale of the profession across all sections.</P>
    <P>I have heard various backbenchers speak of the wonderful progress being made. There are 840 projects on the lists. Let me instance what is happening in one small section of the Galway East constituency where there has been no progress on a number of schools for at least eight years. One such school is St. Coleman's National School, Corofin, which was built for four teachers but now accommodates 200 students and nine teachers. Recently plans they submitted to the Department of Education and Science were rejected on the basis they were too elaborate. When I investigated the nature of the elaborate design it was that the walls were curved and it would not be possible to put up notice boards. It was just a stalling tactic by the Minister in order not to finance it. He has not the determination to do it. That galls me when I read his amendment that notes the determination of the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to continue the greatly expanding schools projects. Who could believe that? </P>
    <P>The other schools on the list are Cappataggle National School, Ballinasloe; Ballinakill National School, Loughrea; Abbey National School, Loughrea; Duniry, Cahergal, Tuam; Labane, Ardrahan; Kilternan, Gort; Killeenadeema, Loughrea; and Ballymana, Craughwell. In that instance the only reason there was any response to my representations was that there was asbestos and under the Health and Safety Act the Department had to respond. Moyglass National School is one of those mentioned by the INTO as unsuitable for habitation. Kilcooley National School has been eight years without any progress. Newtown Girls School, Tuam; Barnadearg, Tuam and Peterswell, Gort, are all in appalling condition and in need of expansion.</P>
    <P>We have, on the one hand, a declaration of the Minister's intention to provide resource teachers and remedial teachers but, as other people have said, we have IT resources in boxes in toilets and corridors. That is where resource teaching and remedial teaching is carried on in many of the schools I have listed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion tabled by Deputy Michael Creed. In our constituency there are a number of schools in similar circumstances to those mentioned by my colleagues. Meath Hill, Drumconrath, Navan has been looking for improvements for between ten and 12 years. Lismullen, Cros an Ghearlaigh has been looking for improvements to move chil<Col N="144" /> dren out of dilapidated prefabricated buildings. The Department continues to tell them they must wait to see what kind of school is to be built in the new area of Johnstown where there are 2,000 houses. That is the excuse being given to pupils, teachers and parents of Lismullen Primary School in Navan.</P>
      <P>Cortown, a very old school built in the 1930s, includes a number of prefabricated buildings which are unacceptable as a place to teach children. The Department has offered a new prefabricated building when the school was built more than 60 years ago. The school at Clonard, on the road to the west, which many Ministers from the west pass on a daily basis, was built in 1910. Government backbenchers referred to schools that needed to be repaired in the 1970s. That school, built in 1910, has two classrooms. I took the opportunity to take a photograph which the Minister might like to look at &ndash; I will pass it to him later. There are only two toilets for the use of 35 boys and only two for the use of 40 girls. That is an indictment of a Government that had more money to provide proper educational facilities than any Government in the history of the State. There are seven computers in one room in that school, only two of which can be switched on at the same time because to switch on more would overload the wiring. They have been informed by an electrician that it would be unsafe to plug all of the computers in at once, that it could lead to a fire. However, the Minister tells us that this school, and many others that I have mentioned, are proper schools with proper accommodation where children can be taught.</P>
      <P>We listened on numerous occasions to the Minister of State telling us what people are entitled to and what the Opposition should and should not do. I challenge the Minister of State to go to the school in Clonard. About 200 people attended a public meeting there looking for the right to have their children taught in proper and not sham facilities, for which Ministers will be indicted in the next six or eight weeks when they go to the country looking for support.</P>
      <P>That school is within 20 miles of where the Minister for the Environment and Local Government lives. I wonder whether he has been at Cabinet for the past five years. Does he even know where the Cabinet room is when funds are being allocated? Nothing is happening in respect of the schools I have mentioned &ndash; Clonard, Meath Hill, Lismullen and Ratoath. The bottom line is that it is an indictment of the Minister that children have to put up with such facilities.</P>

      <P>After discussing the matter with those involved in education, I would like to recommend the removal of the 10% local contribution, which is a burden on small schools, in particular, where only a small number of parents send their children, requiring them to make a very high level of contributions for facilities as a result. With the streamlining of building provision in the Department of Education and Science, <Col N="145" /> delivery time for new buildings should be reduced. Grant assistance should be made available to local contractors to build many of the extensions under consideration. The timescale under the old system in the Department is too long.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has an enormous number of schools on his desk: Gortjordan &ndash; which won the community award some years ago, Parke national school, St. Patrick's national school, Scoil Raiftirigh, Gaelscoil na Cruaiche, Westport, Carrowkennedy national school, Cooneal national school, Ballina, where the buckets are on the floor every time it rains and Cornanool national school outside Castlebar, my alma mater, where I went to school in my bare feet under the watchful eye of the late John Egan, a man who sent writers and poets all over the world.</P>

I spoke to the Minister personally about this last week when he reopened Carraholly national school outside Westport. I explained that he should look after this school because it is the place where I learned to read and write. As a ministerial concession, he should decide that a new school will be built there.</P>

      <P>We have heard the responses to matters raised on the Adjournment in recent weeks and they all state the same &ndash; that projects are now progressing to architectural planning and construction. This seems to be how all questions about school development are answered.</P>
      <P>In my area several schools are in need of improvement. Pallaskenry national school has ongoing difficulties and been identified by the INTO as severely substandard. Pupils are cared for in two classrooms in totally unsuitable prefabricated buildings, where the remedial and resource teachers also work. When purchased the plan was to use the buildings for eight years, but they have been in use for 17. This is unfair to teachers, who cannot work properly in such conditions, and pupils, whose education is being inhibited as a result. The external walls of the rooms are rotting and there is dry rot in the classrooms. I saw the school using scaffolding poles to ensure the roof did not fall in on the pupils. Classes must be taken outdoors in warm weather and the rooms are intensely cold in winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kilfinane national school was also nominated by the INTO as substandard. A year ago I raised the situation in the school on the Adjournment and was given the same reply as I received in a parliamentary question today. There has been no movement in construction for the school in the past year. The existing building dates back to 1909 and the school is housed in a converted church. It consists of six small classrooms, three <Col N="146" /> of which are only 35 square metres. There is a tiny ancillary room which is used as a library and a tiny office and cloakroom. There is a small central area accessible from the classroom, but no staff room and the toilets are outdoors. The playing space outside is very limited. In addition, three of the classrooms are seven metres by five metres and house classes of up to 30 pupils. The partitions between the classrooms are wafer thin boards, but, in spite of all these complaints, there has no been no improvement in 12 months.</P>
    <P>Scoil Naisiúnta Droim Trasna in Mainistir na Féile has two prefabricated rooms and the main building an asbestos roof. It is totally unsuitable. It is accepted that a new school should be constructed. This was a two teacher school in 1980, but now caters for seven teachers and 140 pupils. The parish purchased the outgoing land for &euro;30,000 on the understanding that the school would be built immediately. I ask the Minister to ensure work is commenced on the school as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Cappagh national school is in urgent need of extension. The classrooms are overcrowded and the conditions for teachers and pupils are unacceptable. Will the Minister please move on these four schools &ndash; Pallaskenry, Kilfinane, Scoil Naisiúnta Droim Trasna and Cappagh? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, is not present for this debate. It is indicative of the manner in which he treats his portfolio. He cannot be bothered to listen to the full debate on one of the most important matters in education. It is only three hours, but he cannot be here.</P>
      <P>We are at crisis point. There are 850 schools waiting for major extensions or reconstruction and here we are on the eve of a general election discussing them. Looking back over the record of the House, there have been endless questions about schools and Adjournment debate after Adjournment debate about the matter, but what do we get from the Minister? A very poor response &ndash; the same speeches and statements churned out time after time and no real action. Where are we in these schools? It will take &euro;250 million a year for the next ten years to deal with the school system and provide new schools and extensions.</P>
      <P>If we are to give our young people the facilities they need and deserve, there will have to be a radical approach. We should go further down the road of public-private partnership arrangements. Five schools are being provided under that process. Let us extend it in order that more of the schools needed can be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are myriad schools which require construction work. Within a stone's throw of my office in Mullingar there is the CBS with its leaking roofs. On wet days they put out buckets to catch the water and the walls are dripping. A school designed for 300 pupils now has an enrolment of 620. Is this acceptable? Stage four and <Col N="147" /> five drawings were submitted to the Department in May last year, but there has been no progress.</P>
    <P>Loreto College, Mullingar, has submitted plans for a major extension, but what has happened? Very little. Mullingar community college has been told for the last seven years that it will get a new gym, but the Department is in the process of designing a protocol for gymnasiums across the State and so nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>Coláiste Cionn Torc is the college to which the Taoiseach headed to cut the sod in Castlepollard. It was a wet and windy day and there was no sod cutting. I do not know if the weather had an effect, but the real reason for the cancellation was that the money had not been sanctioned by the Department and he could not proceed. Construction was announced several times by Senators from the constituency, but nothing happened.</P>
    <P>Correllstown national school was told in 1998 that it would get a new school. The local community raised money for the local contribution, obtained planning permission and a site. They were told recently that they might be in the school in five years time. Is this acceptable? Outdoor toilets are outrageous and unacceptable. I will discuss this matter later on the Adjournment. Dysart National School was promised new facilities but no progress has been made. Planning permission was sought for the Gaelscoil in Mullingar and everything was ready and waiting, yet there was no progress from the Minister. I am glad the Minister has arrived in the Chamber at last to hear the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. Like many other Members of the House, I have often raised on the Adjournment the issue of schools. So many schools are affected in County Mayo that I would not have time to list them all. A number of weeks ago, I tabled a parliamentary question to obtain a breakdown of the schools in Mayo, but I am still waiting for that reply. Will the Minister get his officials to reply to that question immediately? I wrote to the Department of Education and Science last August and it took about 12 months to get a reply. That is why we have to table parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an outrage that some 850 school projects are awaiting funding. I compliment the Govern<Col N="148" /> ment on its answer which is typical &ndash; it has now engaged new consultants to see if there is another problem. The Government has spent &euro;300 million on consultants but how many schools would that build in Mayo, Meath, Limerick and elsewhere? Consultancy is the new business. The 1916 Proclamation spoke of cherishing all the children of the nation equally, yet at a time when there has never been so much money available, children around the country are attending schools in terrible conditions. It is not right for teachers to have to work in such conditions, either. This the only Government that has had surpluses to spend, yet it gave the money to bookies, race courses and jockeys. Now the Government will also reward sportsmen and women who do not do a great deal for this country. At the same time, children are arriving at school wet and returning home in the evening wet, also. They have to wear their coats in school to keep warm. How can the Minister and the Government stand over such a situation and allow it to happen? </P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to approve all the schools in my constituency that have been awaiting approval. Last week the Minister appeared in my town, Westport, and I have to admit that if there is one thing he is good at it is singing. I heard him singing &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo; on the radio.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Creed's motion. In recent months I have received more letters about delays in necessary improvements and building works for primary and secondary schools than on any other issue. With 850 schools awaiting sanction, however, that is no surprise. The most persistent pressure recently has come from the Pope John Paul II National School in North County Dublin, which has more than 598 pupils on the roll but has had no general purpose or PE hall for the past two years. The requirements of special needs pupils there have been put at risk or sacrificed because of inadequate accommodation. Extra staff at the school will have nowhere to work even though the posts have been sanctioned. That type of difficulty is being created by the low priority afforded to schools <Col N="149" /> and the education sector generally by the Government.</P>
      <P>When nurses or doctors visit the school, chaos is created because no accommodation or storage facilities are available. Even the staff in that school, who number more than 30, have had to give up toilet facilities to the pupils to get by from day to day.</P>
      <P>I have visited most of these schools and, as a former school principal, I can see that the work has changed. It has become much more difficult to be a member of a school's staff. At secondary level, schools such as Pobail Scoil Íosa are crying out for new premises, yet the Department is telling them they will have to make do with refurbishment. With 1,200 pupils in a school with a leaking flat-roof, the refurbishment option does not represent a good investment. It is bad economics and will certainly be bad from the educational point of view, especially when it will not result in any new PE or sporting facilities. A school of that size has those basic needs.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Loreto Convent in Balbriggan requires that type of extra accommodation. When one sees the lack of play facilities in our schools it is clear the position of the Minister and the Government is basically unjust. They fully support projects such as Campus Ireland, or the Bertie Bowl as it is more commonly known, while many urban and rural schools in North County Dublin are left without halls and PE facilities. That demonstrates the Government's peculiar set of priorities.</P>
      <P>Schools such as Hedgestown National School, Corduff National School, and my own former school, St. George's, are all told to manage without any PE facilities in wet and cold weather. That is a basic injustice and represents a lack of priority by the Government for the most basic needs. Hedgestown National School was promised a new premises but it seems that all bets are off. This is an absolute disgrace to a rural community in which the school is a key facility. Likewise, Corduff National School, in common with many others that have lost FÁS assistants, does not have the necessary money because it does not have sufficient pupils on the roll to pay for a caretaker, even with the allowance that is provided.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science needs to be restructured and it needs a new Minister who will become a champion of education, obtaining sites from local authorities for extra schools that are needed. Scoil Bhóroimhe, the gaelscoil in Swords, is situated in a sports club facility rather than in a designated school building. God help our schools and children if this Government is re-elected.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the motion's condemnation of the Government's failure to manage the school building programme. The general secretary designate of the Irish <Col N="150" /> National Teachers' Organisation, Mr. John Carr, has described the primary schools' repair, refurbishment and building programme as &ldquo;a complete shambles&rdquo;. This afternoon, my office was contacted by the principal of a school in County Cavan. It is one of the schools on the INTO's short-list of the worst primary schools in the State in terms of grossly sub-standard accommodation endured both by pupils and teachers. There are 68 pupils in three class groups, in a two classroom school. One of the classrooms is a pre-fab for which the school's insurers are now refusing to provide cover. The school's application has been with the Department of Education and Science for the past three years.</P>
      <P>I have deliberately not named the school because it is just one example that is typical of many more throughout not only my constituency but also sadly and regrettably, as many other Deputies have outlined, throughout the jurisdiction. What message does this send to our children when we as a society can construct luxury homes at the top end of the market in unprecedented numbers, hotels on a scale never before seen in this country, and palatial new buildings for financial institutions? Yet, the buildings in which we educate our children are neglected and dilapidated. This is a shame and a disgrace. We need radical action now to shake up the entire system of delivering the schools building programme. Even at this late hour, I appeal to the Minister to do something in the remaining weeks of this Administration. The children of this nation demand and deserve nothing less.</P>

      <P>The capital funding in 2002 for primary and post-primary education is four times the 1997 level. While this level of funding is unprecedented, it clearly cannot address all the problems that have been identified. That will be the challenge of next year and succeeding years. I reiterate that the Government intends that all of those projects currently in architectural planning will proceed to construction in an orderly way as part of the expanded building programme. The Department of Education and Science will assess major projects for funding having regard to a clear order of priority. Much is being done to improve the position in a substantial number of schools and this has even been acknowledged by Senator Joe O'Toole who is no fan of the Government. However, much remains to be done and the Government will continue with the task it has set itself until the problem of substandard school accommodation has been permanently resolved.</P>
      <P>The parties opposite paid lip service to this issue when in office and are now engaged in empty bombast. By contrast, we have delivered and go on delivering. We have continued to provide increased funding which has made a real difference. Let there be no doubting our resolve to deal with those matters. Our track record over the past five years demonstrates the seriousness with which we view this area of public policy. This year's school building construction programme will be the most substantial in the history of this State. We will continue to advance other much-needed projects through the design and planning process to the point where they will be ready to form the construction programmes of the future. We are engaged in prudent management and forward planning. The difference is that the Opposition talks about it and looks for headlines. We get on with it and deliver and make a real difference.</P>

I am shocked by the sheer incompetence and ineptitude of the Opposition, particularly the main Opposition party, which does not seem to have the slightest grasp of the basic essentials of the school building programme. This incompetence has not happened in a vacuum; it is part of the general malaise affecting the main Opposition party, the malaise that triggered the panic which caused the knee-jerk change of leadership last year when they dumped John Bruton and put in Michael &ldquo;if I won the lotto&rdquo; Noonan.

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, a minute of my time has elapsed listening to Deputy O'Dea. The Minister is well aware of the list of schools in Wicklow that need attention. Lacken primary school is one of the schools listed as condemned. There was a recent newspaper article about the gaelscoil in Wicklow town where classes are held in a funeral parlour. We have always prided ourselves on our education system but our educational facilities are in very poor condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" />I have tabled parliamentary questions over the past few months and I get the same rote answer every time that everything is on hold. I ask the Minister to tell us what is happening. Every school in the country cannot be at the same stage and we would appreciate the information. The Minister should not try to be all things to all people.</P>
    <P>Our system is archaic. It takes almost five years for a school to be built. There should be a more up to date system for the implementation of the building programme. Some speakers referred to the public private partnership and I am aware that the Minister has sanctioned some schools. I am aware that other schools have applied, including a school in Woodbrook in Bray, which is in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the issue of school caretakers. They are poorly paid and have a difficult job to do and I ask the Minister to examine their conditions of employment. I also urge him to inform the vocational education committees and the boards of management of the timetable for the building works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, might have been amusing if it were not for the fact that 300 pupils from his alma mater in Ballyfin, County Laois, had to resort to the ultimate tactic of demonstrating outside Leinster House because of the Government's performance in relation to the school. That speaks volumes about Deputy O'Dea and the Minister, Dr. Woods, sitting beside him.</P>
      <P>The counties of Laois and Offaly have been officially confirmed as the poorest in the country, thanks to the neglect of the current Government. Unemployment is higher than the national average and third level educational attainment is bottom of the league in terms of participation rates. If poverty and disadvantage is to be tackled, education must be prioritised. A greater level of investment is needed in the areas of greatest demand. Sadly, that does not apply to the counties of Laois and Offaly. The greatest demand for improved primary education, buildings and facilities is in the Laoighis-Offaly constituency. I wish to remind the Minister about Portlaoise because he does not remember his visit there or, if he does, he certainly did not act on it.</P>

      <P>An extension is badly needed in Scoil Bhríde, Knockmay but there is no sign of it. A new school building has been promised for Maryborough national school but there has been no progress under the Government. In Rathdowney in south County Laois, the amalgamation of Scoil Bhríde was announced by his predecessor and the school buildings are at either end of the town with nothing in terms of services or planning. The Church of Ireland school in Rathdowney is old and unsuitable but there has been no action on the part of the regime of Woods and O'Dea, the Laurel and Hardy duo. The story is the same in Mountrath where Clonenagh must be updated to meet the requirements of modern-day education. In south County Laois, Graiguecullen and Killeshin are rapidly-growing areas on the perimeter of Carlow town. School extension applications have been with the Department for years but there is no reply from the Minister. The extension to Camross national school in the Slieve Bloom mountains is moving along at a pace that would do justice to a snail. County Offaly has the worst record in terms of educational facilities under the current Government. The parents of the children in Lumcloon national school took them out after Christmas because of the decrepit facilities. Charleville national school in Tullamore has the same story as has Lusmagh national school on the banks of the Shannon, near the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Ulick Burke.</P>

      <P>There has been no progress in Clareen national school in Birr under this regime. The application for Pollagh national school, located in a rural area near Ferbane, is gathering dust in the Department's building in Tullamore. If Charles Dickens appeared in Laoighis-Offaly tomorrow he would say nothing has changed since the time he was writing in Britain. Last week Prince Charles paid a quasi-royal visit to this country. If his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had accompanied him she would have said that the schools in Laoighis-Offaly had not changed since she reigned in Britain more than 100 years ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, referred to the inactivity of successive Governments. However, no previous Government had such wealth at its disposal and never before has a Government delivered so little to the people who are most deserving or squandered an economic boom in such a comprehensive manner. The parents, students and children of Laoighis-Offaly are suffering as a result. It is time for the general election and for the Government to step aside.</P>

      <P>In Limerick they are good at throwing around rugby balls but the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, would take the biscuit for <Col N="155" /> throwing insults. He is very good at it but he will not ever become a senior Minster. When Deputy Creed's father was a junior Minister in the Department of Education between 1983 and 1987, he sanctioned 25 projects for County Kerry, including every project that we needed.</P>
      <P>The following projects are at different stages of planning in the Department: a new primary school at Lissataggle, Tralee; a new primary school at Blennerville, Tralee; a new primary school and secondary school at Ballybunion; an extension at Castleisland community school; an extension to the all-Irish school at Moyerwell, Tralee; an extension at Currans national school, where the conditions are deplorable; an extension to Kilconly national school, Ballybunion; an extension to Lixnaw national school; an extension to Kilflynn national school; an extension to my local school, Killocrin national school; an extension to Balloonagh national school; a new gaelscoil for Listowel; and an extension to Presentation primary school, Listowel.</P>
      <P>When Deputy O'Rourke was Minister for Education she said she wanted to get rid of portakabins but they are back again in County Kerry and are everywhere on school grounds. Other projects being undertaken by the Department include the Nano Nagle school for the handicapped at Listowel. I am attending a 25th anniversary mass at the school on Friday. The school moved into its present building approximately ten years ago and was promised an extension that was to have become a centre for autism in County Kerry. However, there are no facilities for autistic children in the county. There is no policy and no audit. Nobody knows how many autistic children are in the county. The centre was promised but it has not been provided.</P>
      <P>Only three primary schools in County Kerry have a gymnasium where physical education can be undertaken. As a former physical education teacher, I know the value of PE in schools. Some 76% of schools in the country have no physical education facilities. The Government will stand indicted for that. An article in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> considered the growing number of people in the country with weight problems. The Government's failure to deliver physical education facilities is contributing to it.</P>
      <P>The electorate will decide who will form the next Government. My party leader, Deputy Noonan, is a constituency colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. As a former teacher he understands education and he will deliver.</P>

It appears there are no difficulties in the schools in the constituencies of the Independent Deputies.</P>
      <P>Last night I referred to the need to publish data bases to ensure that people would know the exact status of all 850 school projects awaiting progress in the Minister's Department. In this respect the Minister has, at the least, been economical with the truth and, at worst, has misled the House. On 19 February I asked him if, in connection with Aghina national school in my constituency, his Department has received all outstanding information requested regarding projected enrolments at the school and the situation regarding the provision of a new school in view of the information provided. He replied:</P>
      <P>My Department has recently received, from the management authorities of the school referred to by the Deputy, detailed information regarding enrolment and demographic trends, housing and birth statistics for the area concerned. This information is currently being assessed in the planning section of my Department. A report in the matter has been sought from the inspector for the area.</P>
      <P>On receipt and consideration of this report, a decision will be made on how best the accommodation needs of the school should be addressed. The school board of management will be advised of the decision at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Your job is to protect Members of this House and their interests. Two days earlier the Minister had written to my constituency colleague, Deputy Donal Moynihan as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Donal</P>
      <P>Thank you for your ongoing representations on behalf of Aghina National School, County Cork concerning the proposed building project at the school.</P>
      <P>I am please to inform you that when the revised mechanical and electrical element of the stage 4/5 submission from the school's design team has been approved by my Department the project will proceed to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> The Minister stands guilty as accused of deliberately massaging the 850 schools on the list to politically and cynically exploit students and teachers who operate in sub-standard schools so that his party colleagues in marginal constituencies can pull a rabbit from the hat in the lead up to the general election. The Taoiseach has toured marginal constituencies and has pulled other schools out of the hat. It is disgraceful exploitation of a very difficult situation for schools.</P>

      <P>My party made a number of sound proposals which I hoped would have gained support in the House as a non-adversarial forum. We seek greater use of public private partnerships, a move to design and build and a greater role for boards of management to save money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this progressive Bill, which is necessary in the current circumstances. As I listened to many of the speeches earlier today, I was struck by how easy it is for people in public life to delude themselves. The reality and mythology of housing are interesting in terms of their contrast. My constituency colleague from another party, who was once the Minister responsible for housing, did not last five years like this Government.</P>
      <P>The last five years have seen a record level of house building. Over 52,000 houses were built last year, which constitutes a record. Since 1997, a staggering 215,700 new houses have been built, a record which has seldom, if ever, been surpassed. Over 5,000 local authority houses were completed or acquired last year, the highest number for 15 years and certainly a far better record than that of the previous Government. Over 1,200 new houses were completed under voluntary housing programmes last year, which, again, is the highest figure in the history of the State. It is a record I welcome as a huge amount should be done in the voluntary and co-operative housing sectors.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, there are still huge pressures on housing, particularly social housing. A Government Deputy would be foolhardy to say there is no such problem as it manifests itself daily in our clinics, constituency postbags and the queries and requests we receive from constituents. We have to remind ourselves, however, that we are still building at a rate of 13 houses per 1,000 population, the highest level in the European Union. The demand for social and affordable housing is growing at a rate which is unprecedented in our history or that of our neighbours. We have witnessed a remarkable increase in population over a short period of time and, more importantly in the current context, seen a dramatic growth in the number of family units. The reality is that housing policies have not been able to address these challenges and traditional approaches to housing have been inadequate. An extraordinary amount of the population increase in recent years has resulted from inward migration, which has not only boosted the number of people in the country as a whole, but also the number of family units seeking housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system has been incapable of meeting the demands placed on it. Two factors have come together in recent years to dramatically change the face of the housing market and the profile of <Col N="161" /><Col N="162" /> those looking for social and affordable housing. Deputies on all sides have made the valid point that those looking for social and affordable housing would not have been in that market five or ten years ago. The dramatic increases in house prices have been driven by a number of factors, including inward migration, dramatically improved income levels and higher levels of disposable income. Although the latter feature is specific to certain industries, it impacts right across the spectrum. We must not forget that the housing market in Ireland is relatively small. Movements which would be considered insignificant elsewhere have a dramatic impact here.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including one of the senior spokespersons opposite, made the point that an insufficient amount of land has been zoned for housing. It is an interesting observation that has been made before. There has certainly been an insufficiency in the supply of zoned and serviced land ready for house building. The Government has moved to correct the problem, however, especially by introducing the serviced land initiative. Its efforts in that regard have not always been welcomed, however, and have been heavily attacked by certain vested interests.</P>
    <P>The Government's most dramatic intervention has been the section 5 requirement that up to 20% of housing to be built should be either social or affordable. The effects and objectives of this policy have been misrepresented to a great extent. Members on all sides are acutely aware of Irish housing trends in the recent past. There has been a degree of social isolation and segregation, even ghettoisation, which is an unhealthy development. There has been a propensity to build houses at the upper end of the market and ignore the middle and lower ends. It is right and proper that the Government should intervene to suggest that such an isolationist approach is not acceptable. Those who have gained vastly from rezoned land will not be allowed to operate on that land. It is right, proper and fitting that society should express in legislation its views as to how those who operate in the housing market should be allowed to do so. The idea that any type of house should be built in an untrammelled way, according to the demands of the market and without any social intervention, as long as the land is zoned, is anathema to me and all Members of the House with a social conscience.</P>
    <P>I am proud to represent a constituency which has witnessed a huge surge in housing demand in recent years and which has had a vast increase in population. It is interesting to note, if one looks at housing movements and the construction of houses in recent years, that there has been an awful lot of cherry-picking by housing developers. I do not blame people, including house builders, for fighting their corner, but public representatives have a duty to fight on behalf of those less capable of exerting pressure within society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" />The Bill centres on its provisions in relation to affordable and social housing, to which I will return after I have once more outlined the real measure of the Government's commitment to the housing programme, which has been brought into question in this debate. This Administration is spending three and a half times more on housing than was the case as recently as 1997, when a member of the Labour Party was in charge of housing during the rainbow coalition. Politicians and political parties must be judged on delivery rather than rhetoric. The truth is that the record of the last Government was far from exemplary and, equally, this Government faces grave difficulties at this time. The criticisms that have been made of our performance are valid, provided they are kept in perspective. Had past policies been retained, we would face a much worse situation.</P>
    <P>In coming to the House tonight, it was not my intention to continuously refer back to the past, as I wanted to say something positive about the Bill, its aims and objectives, and to point to a few possible areas of improvement. The Bill seeks to add a range of legislative and policy instruments to those already in operation in the housing market, which we all would welcome. It will provide for a significant increase in the borrowing limit available to the Housing Finance Agency, which offers capital to local authorities for housing, among other matters. The funding available to the agency is, therefore, of considerable significance in combating the current housing difficulties.</P>
    <P>A second feature of the Bill is that it places the affordable housing scheme on a statutory basis, which is very important. I am sure that Members of the House and members of local authorities will recognise that many local authorities are confused about how the affordable housing scheme should be administered. It certainly seems to be the case that there is no consistency of operation across the board.</P>
    <P>The third feature of the Bill is that it provides for a claw-back mechanism which will apply to the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes. I am somewhat surprised that a number of Opposition Deputies have criticised this measure. I cannot believe that they have given the issue any real consideration as had they done so, they would have been less critical. A welcome element of the Bill is that it introduces greater flexibility to the administration of new house plans schemes. A fifth element of the Bill is that it makes available a statutory framework for assistance to organisations providing advice and research on housing issues.</P>
    <P>It has been my view for some time that the affordable housing scheme has not, as yet, been fully exploited by local housing authorities and has been approached in a conservative manner in <Col N="164" /> many, if not all, cases. In County Wicklow I have been more than a little frustrated by the failure of local councils to exploit the scheme to the full. The councils have moved too cautiously. There has, for example, been no creative use of the dual role of planning authority and housing authority. As with many local authorities, we have been discussing the county development plans and revisions of town development plans and we have not taken a proactive role. We have not approached people with land to tell them that the land will be considered for rezoning provided a creative use is found for it and that there is some element of social integration and a degree of equity in the houses which come from the zoning. Interestingly, the only radical proposition for the use of the affordable housing scheme which I have seen in my local authority area has come from a private developer. If I was to give the name in the House it would raise more than a smile.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is particularly welcome in that it clearly defines the basis on which the affordable housing scheme can be employed by councils and voluntary bodies. Hopefully the clarification will engender a little more activity on the part of local authorities on the ground.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister try to establish within the Department some idea of best practice in local authorities? One Opposition Deputy made the valid point that there is a variation in the application of policies. The Department should carry out an audit of best and worst practice and we should be aiming to ensure that the best practice becomes the norm rather than the exception. If there is some form of reporting mechanism brought into place, section 6 will allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>The following sections of the Bill are of particular interest. I welcome the clarification in section 8 which provides the basis for the establishment of schemes to determine the priority to be given to persons availing of the scheme. In County Wicklow there has been a great degree of discontent regarding the allocation of the small number of affordable houses which have been made available to date. In Kilcoole, where the council's largest scheme to date is under way, there has been grave discontent regarding the small number of local people who have been awarded houses. In parts of Wicklow where there has been a huge influx of couples forced out of Dublin by escalating prices in the housing market, there has been a knock-on effect in that local people who are trying to enter the same market are being priced out. For example, someone living in Dublin 4 or 6 who decides to sell his or her house and to retire to Wicklow will outbid any young couple looking for a house which casually comes on the market. This is the case in north County Dublin, Meath, Louth, Kildare and all the <Col N="165" /> surrounding areas. More attention has to be given in the affordable housing scheme to local need.</P>
    <P>This influx of people is welcome. New people give life to an area. They also add a sense of vibrancy and bring new money. However, it causes problems. The affordable housing scheme must be geared in a way which pays attention to local housing needs. If friction is to be avoided, the allocation system should give more consideration than the Bill provides to people who have been born and reared in a particular area. Nothing but good can come from allowing young people to settle in their own area. Living in the community with members of the extended family provided young couples with the type of social support which has been a traditional part of life.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide a degree of control on the resale of houses which have been bought under the scheme. However, this provision has attracted a degree of negative comment from Deputies opposite. A situation recently arose in Wicklow which should never be allowed to happen again. A highly subsidised site in one of the most desirable housing areas in the country, in which it is impossible to get a house on the market for under £250,000, was sold by the council for under £10,000. Along with other public representatives I made sure that young couples buying into the council scheme were given the opportunity to get a foothold on the housing ladder. This site was sold for less than £10,000, planning permission was granted and a contract was signed for the development of the house on the site. However, before the house was completed it was put on the market and sold for almost £250,000. This is a classic example of what can happen if a subsidised housing scheme is introduced without some form of clawback mechanism. I advise Members opposite to talk to their party colleagues in Wicklow following which they would be less critical of this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to new housing grants and the framework for financial assistance for certain voluntary organisations. I welcome all the Bill is doing in this regard and there has been a general welcome for these provisions. This section excited Deputies on all sides to question and comment adversely on aspects of the grants schemes currently in operation, particularly those for emergency or essential repairs or repair work for the elderly or the handicapped. I wholeheartedly support Members on all sides who raised this issue. The comments made about these issues, particularly the essential repair grant scheme, must be taken on board by the Minister and the Department. The level of bureaucracy in this area in mind-blowing.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides have pointed out that there are extraordinary examples of disgraceful and unforgivable delays in making grants available for essential repair work. If I wished I could regale the House with a remarkable number of <Col N="166" /> examples of delay and costly, bureaucratic time wasting, but I will not do so because other Members have done so adequately. However, I wish to add my voice to those who have earnestly requested the Minister to take a harsh view, particularly of the level of bureaucracy involved in the administration of the essential repairs grant scheme. This situation must be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>One final issue which is not dealt with in the Bill, but which comes within the broad parameters of housing policy, is housing estate design. There is a temptation on councils to build anywhere and everywhere they possibly can without giving any thought to the social consequences of building huge, amorphous and anonymous estates. We have gone down that road in the past. We all recall crash programmes of house building which created problems, ghettos and areas of social stigma. We should not allow this to happen again. When we build a housing estate it will last and have an effect which is intergenerational in terms of its impact.</P>
    <P>There has recently been an extraordinary controversy in Wicklow because of the so-called part 10 provisions and the so-called consultation which goes on. A local authority decided to build adjacent to about 200 houses, to increase the number of houses in one estate to 330 and to then build 180 additional, mostly affordable, houses adjacent to that. This would have created one large mass of council housing in an area far removed from social services, shops, schools and public transport, yet this is called good policy. This situation has arisen simply as a panic reaction that we have to build houses because of the crisis. The attitude was that the council had this piece of land on which it would build because no one else would get planning permission to do so. What was amazing was that local residents lodged the most remarkably concise response to this proposal. They did not say, &ldquo;Don't build the houses.&rdquo; They suggested that the council should address some of their social problems and build the houses. Another Member of this House, who is not a member of my party, and I decided to make representations on behalf of the residents. We were treated to an astonishing example of bureaucratic temper tantrums. Ultimately, the Department intervened and said it too had an interest in this issue. Rather than listening to the Department, the local authority has reacted very negatively. In the past when there were housing crises major mistakes were made. It would be astonishing if bureaucratic arrogance allowed us to ignore the past and fail to absorb its lessons. This is a good Bill. I compliment the Minister on its introduction and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Healy and Ó Caoláin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of housing needs is now greater than it has been in more than a generation. The <Col N="167" /> reason is that the Government failed to forecast accurately the changes that have occurred in the market. The increase in demand for accommodation in the rental sector occasioned by the introduction of workers from abroad and asylum seekers has snapped up the availability at the lower end of the market. This, coupled with the disastrous decision of the Government which resulted in the elimination of the investment sector from the rental market, has generated this crisis in accommodation needs.</P>
    <P>I have been a public representative for more than 25 years and I have served many years &ndash; and still do &ndash; on local authorities. I hoped I had heard the last of these heart rending stories of families forced to live in over crowded conditions with poor or non-existent facilities. People regularly call on me seeking my intervention with the housing authorities in an effort to secure safe accommodation for them and their families. This Bill does not provide the response required by these people. Immediate, direct intervention is called for. This Government must empower the local authorities to acquire new home units and it must do it now.</P>
    <P>This Bill would be well and good if we were dealing with a market that was already well-serviced. However, as we all know, this is not the reality. Councils with more than 1,000 people waiting to be housed will find cold comfort in this Bill. The people currently on local authority housing lists have no financial reserves. They see no future, nor do they have any hope. This is a generation that needs concrete action from the Government &ndash; the delivery of house units to be allocated to them as tenants so that they may re-establish themselves before moving on to purchase, whether under the shared ownership scheme or the voluntary co-operative. It is now 25 years since the first-time home-purchaser's grant of £3,000 was introduced. That was about 25% of the purchase price of an average three-bedroom house in the Dublin area. Let us intervene in the current market in the same way by increasing the grant to &euro;50,000, or more if possible. This will restore balance in the construction industry and enable our children to obtain homes of their own.</P>
    <P>I realise the urgent need for housing, but we should not build willy-nilly. We should not create concrete jungles or have Hong Kong type developments in the Dublin area. The Minister's guidelines on densities are a serious danger to proper planning. In my constituency we recently introduced the area action plan for the Baldoyle area. It is proposed to build roughly 2,400 houses. We in the council spoke to the manager and urged him, with the support of the local residents, to ensure that the densities suggested by the Minister, at 60 units per acre, were lowered to some 26 or 24 per acre. With proper open space <Col N="168" /> and proper planning this will be a very good plan for the Baldoyle area, especially when we provide 270 acres of open space, a hundred-acre park and so on. However, just across the railway line &ndash; and we are also providing a DART station, which is most welcome &ndash; in the corporation area at Grange Abbey, Donaghmede, there is another estate in which it is proposed to develop at 60 units per acre. The matter is before Dublin City Council whose members, before the last election, re-zoned at 60 units per acre. This is outrageous planning and will have a negative impact on the communities of Grange Abbey and Donaghmede. The density is much too large for the purposes of good planning.</P>
    <P>The urban trend towards commercial green space at the expense of household gardens will result in generations of children whose only playground will be the hallway, kitchen or sitting rooms of their homes. This is what we are offering them with this development opposite Grange Abbey. The culture of urban gardening and of growing vegetables and flowers will be lost forever along with everything else that people enjoy. Densities in the established area of Grange Abbey are roughly 20 units per acre, while on the far side of the road densities will be 60 units per acre. Estates will become separatist and elitist. We must stop this type of planning. We know there is an urgent need for housing but we should try to encompass both ideas. We should ensure that we provide housing but also that we plan our estates properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nationally, there are now 50,000 families on local authority housing waiting lists; that is, anything from 130,000 to 150,000 individuals. In my constituency there are a thousand families on local authority lists, possibly 3,500 individuals. In Cahir, a small town in my constituency, a housing applicant can wait for anything from four to six years for a local authority house. That is unacceptable, particularly as there have been huge amounts of money available for house building. It is another indication that the fruits of the Celtic tiger have been squandered by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we have built large housing estates without any reference to other necessary facilities. In many of our towns and estates across the country there are serious problems with anti-social behaviour. In the vast majority of our estates there is no estate management. There are no community facilities, except in a small number of estates, and we continue to build local authority estates without these. There are no community buildings or outdoor facilities. Building estates without these facilities and without proper estate management gives rise to anti-social behaviour, particularly in the larger towns. Those facilities and a higher level of estate management <Col N="169" /> should be put into not only all our future estates but also our existing estates.</P>
    <P>It should go further. This Bill should provide for communication with the Garda Síochána and work with it to provide community gardaí in our estates. Obviously that cannot be done in every estate but it could certainly be done in a group of estates. In the town of Clonmel, one of the larger towns in my constituency, and in larger towns throughout the country, community gardaí are absolutely necessary nowadays to ensure that anti-social behaviour in our estates is stopped. This Bill should provide for the appointment of community gardaí.</P>
    <P>The housing aid for the elderly scheme is a fine scheme in principle. The idea of the scheme is that work should be carried out for elderly people in relation to leaking roofs, rotting windows, dangerous wiring and sanitary facilities. These are fine principles. However, the practical application of the scheme leaves a lot to be desired. Last year in south Tipperary there were 450 applicants for the scheme, which had a small budget. The allocation from the Department was only £237,500. This meant that 300 of the applicants were not visited or even considered for the scheme. This year it is dealing only with last year's applicants and no new applicants are allowed. The allocation is the very same as last year with no increase. If the scheme is to work and do what it is supposed to do, at least £500,000 per annum should be made available for it. Probably, £1 million per annum would be necessary, over a number of years, to make it an aid to people who have given their working lives to the country and are now looking for reasonable accommodation.</P>
    <P>In relation to voluntary housing schemes, the Bill should provide for the possibility of purchase of houses by tenants. The way the scheme is operated does not allow tenants to purchase their houses. This is becoming a serious problem. Many housing applicants on local authority lists are now refusing to accept allocations of tenancies in voluntary schemes because they will never own the house. That should be changed and the Bill gives the opportunity to change it.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the purchase schemes in operation, the valuation of houses has gone through the roof in recent years. The discount has not kept pace with it. It has remained at 3% per year to a maximum of 30%. This should be increased to 5% per year up to a maximum of 50%. Most local authority houses in my constituency would be valued at £70,000 which puts them out of the reach of ordinary tenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for sharing their time with me. This legislation will not be the housing legacy of the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats coalition Government. The real legacy is, and will be, the continuing housing crisis, with some 60,000 applicant units or <Col N="170" /> households, representing around 150,000 people, on local authority waiting lists. Since 1996 the number on local authority waiting lists has risen by over 40%. There are, of course, many others not on local authority housing waiting lists for whom housing has become unaffordable and they, too, must be counted as part of the huge need for decent homes in our society.</P>
      <P>I accept that the numbers in need of housing have risen dramatically during the Government's term of office and it is a real challenge to meet that need. With the resources at its disposal over the past five years no Government has been better placed to do it. Much has been done and there have been improvements in local authority provision, but this Government has been driven by a market ideology. Its housing policy, such as it is and as reflected in the Bill, relies almost totally on the market, and the profit motive of developers and the construction industry, to meet a massive social need. This policy has failed and always will.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides a legislative basis for what is called social and affordable housing. The very terminology is an admission of failure. It reflects the reality that decent housing is beyond the affordable reach of huge sections of our society. The National Economic and Social Forum in its report on social housing concluded that &ldquo;home ownership is now beyond the reach of most people on average incomes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is often said that some people know the price of everything and the value of nothing. In the marketplace, on which the Government relies totally for housing provision, what matters most is the price of houses as products for sale and as investments, not their value as homes for real people. Perhaps the additional measures on social and affordable housing in the Bill represent a recognition of that failure, but it is a belated recognition.</P>
      <P>The mindset of market price rather than social value is apparent in some of the objections we have heard raised against the provision of a proportion of new housing developments for social and affordable housing. So fixated with house prices have some people become that they object to what they regard as lower class housing in their neighbourhood. This is partly a product of the over-inflated prices which people have to pay for houses and, regrettably, also a form of snobbery. Elected representatives have a duty to educate and persuade all members of the community of the social value of this provision. Some elected representatives, no doubt, will be tempted to exploit fears and prejudices and thus create further division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own view of the scheme is that it is positive in itself but that there is an over-reliance on it by the Government. It is no substitute for an all-out attack on the housing crisis based on a comprehensive social housing programme led by the <Col N="171" /> local authorities, with front-loading of funding under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing continues to be the Cinderella of the system. Of the 49,812 dwellings completed in the year 2000, for example, only 3,155 were local authority housing, a sad fact. The construction industry gives it low priority and concentrates on the lucrative upper tiers of the private housing market. Local authorities, even where they have the resources, often find it impossible to attract contractors to construct housing. The existing housing stock of local authorities suffers from under-resourcing with lack of staffing and funding for maintenance, repair and refurbishment. Again, some welcome progress has been made in this area in recent years, but our local authorities, like our health system, have had to make up for years of neglect and cutbacks. More needs to be done.</P>
    <P>When the Government has been called upon to switch the whole emphasis of housing policy to direct provision by local authorities it has repeated a mantra that it does not wish to return to the large local authority housing estates of the past with no facilities and high unemployment. This is another admission of failure. Successive Governments allowed housing estates to be built in our cities and towns with low quality housing and little or no facilities, as evidenced in constituencies throughout the jurisdiction. When people's income improved many moved out, leaving a concentration of deprivation in such estates.</P>
    <P>We need to learn the lessons of that experience. Instead, the Government has thrown the baby out with the bath water and relegated the local authorities to a marginal role in housing provision. There is no valid reason we cannot have well planned, well constructed local authority housing, in modern well maintained estates with the best community facilities. That is the objective I hoped we could share. The disasters of the past do not have to be repeated if the political will is there. Regrettably, the Government has not yet demonstrated it. The disasters of the past do not have to be repeated if the political will is there. Regrettably, the Government has not yet demonstrated that will.</P>
    <P>In budget 2002, the Government restored interest relief on rented residential property and reduced stamp duty rates for investors. This will worsen the housing crisis by increasing property prices. The housing charity Threshold has said that the major effect of these budget measures would be to stimulate the production of exclusive residences at the top end of the market. The Bill cannot make up for the housing failures of this Administration. Its housing record is a catalogue of lost opportunities as the tens of thousands on waiting lists know only too well.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, by agreement. I am happy to have the opportunity to raise some issues at the end of this Government's period in office. This Bill deals with social and affordable housing, shared ownership and related matters. The legacy of this Government is that in Monaghan town a house that cost £95,000 at the start of the Government's term in office was sold recently for £260,000. That is totally out of the reach of any young couple on middle income.</P>
      <P>There is a housing crisis. One will know that if one spends time in a local Deputy's office or talks to council officials, or if one sees the look on young people's faces as they wonder how they will manage to get the flats that are available, while others face the prospect of no accommodation whatsoever. With flats costing £100 per week at the bottom end, how can any young couple save money to provide for a deposit on a house? Two people on reasonable incomes cannot afford a mortgage even in a county such as Monaghan.</P>
      <P>There is a need for more local authority housing and this must be made available to stop spiralling prices. There is a need to speed up the provision of houses. I recently spoke to a council colleague who had been told shortly after his election that 37 houses would be built in the town of Ballybay. That development has not yet started. When will those houses be available? Will it be three or four years down the road? This is unacceptable and the system must be changed. In Monaghan town, one full year went by without one house being built because of difficulties over issues such as contracts, bonds etc. We were told that no money was lost but a full year's building was lost. The people of Monaghan have realised that ever since.</P>
      <P>It is hard to understand why some counties have a reasonable uptake of voluntary housing. In Carlow, for example, in the last five years £10 million has been spent on voluntary housing; in Monaghan that figure is just £1 million. It is difficult to get some local authorities to act. I do not blame the Minister for this but there needs to be better co-ordination between local authorities and the Department to ensure houses are made available at a reasonable cost.</P>
      <P>Second-hand houses are often available at reasonable cost. However, if a young couple buying their first house buy a second-hand house they are immediately loaded with stamp duty. A step must be taken to ensure that somebody buying a house for the first time does not have to pay stamp duty, be the house new or second-hand. It is only a once-off payment and there will be no difficulty finding a way to claw back the money if there is skulduggery going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for grants towards the restructuring and refurbishing of old houses is another issue. This was available under the Fine Gael led <Col N="173" /> Government in the 1980s. While there may have been some problems with that, they could have been sorted out in a much better way. The measure did not have to be scrapped; limits could have been put on it and it could have been tied to the person's residence because in some cases holiday homes were being grant aided. There were many ways in which that measure could have been kept. It would have helped to restructure villages and towns, and to maintain older houses in rural areas where it is now almost impossible to get planning permission to build a house. If we are to maintain the rural population, this is something which we must look seriously at. There was relief of tax in the Shannon basin but that is no benefit to somebody on a low or middle income. It needs to be in grant form.</P>
    <P>The essential repairs grant and the aid from the health boards is very useful and should be of major benefit. However, there is so much delay and so much red tape that whoever is in Government after the next election, and I believe that my party will be, must sort it out once and for all. A person looking for a grant for a disabled person must go through the health board and then the local authority; files are lost and all sorts of problems occur. If that person is dying of cancer, they could be dead before the authorities come around to allowing a change of bathroom or house extension. That is unacceptable and must be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Crawford for sharing his time. A Bill that raises the borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency from &euro;1.5 billion to &euro;6 billion could be misinterpreted. Many people will think that this automatically means that a major impact will be made on the housing crisis. This is not so. I do not have the time to develop what one might expect from a Bill called the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, but I want to list some of the points not dealt with in such a miscellaneous title.</P>
      <P>The first point is an important one in relation to what has happened to create the housing crisis that now exists. That point is that since the previous Government, of which I was a Member, left office, house prices have risen by about seven times the rate of inflation, by four times the rate of pay increases and by three times the rate of increase in the cost of building. This tells one how the housing situation has been allowed to deteriorate in such a way that it has torn the heart out of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the consequences of inflation in housing prices has been the destructive impact on social life. It may seem unfashionable to say so now, but there is something inherently wrong with a society that allows housing to spiral out the reach of couples to the extent that they no longer have a choice of one of the partners perhaps staying at <Col N="174" /> home, or working at home, or spending their time with their family. There is something inherently crazy about a society where two people on average income must leave home at 6 a.m., stop at 7 a.m. to leave off their children, work until 8 p.m., collect their children on the way home, pay an enormous amount for child care, have little time for themselves or for participation in the community, and where both are contributing to the massive jam of cars on our roads.</P>
    <P>Somehow, the housing situation was allowed to deteriorate to the point at which market ideologue suggested that it was important to allow people to move into this area of necessary social provision and make a killing. People should speak frankly. Is it any wonder that a small number of people who were involved in land speculation purchase, not necessarily builders of houses, are currently before our tribunals? What we are witnessing in 2002 is what was mentioned earlier, a change in our demographics with returned emigrants replacing what was an out migration flow for many years. However, that does not explain what has happened to the housing figures. Why are the figures not being published? If all the local authorities have made an assessment which they have sent to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, what is wrong that we simply cannot have the figures on how many people are on the waiting lists, how many people are projected to be on the waiting lists over the next few years and how many houses will be finished? These are figures to which we should have ready access but to which we do not.</P>
    <P>Members have been speaking about their own constituencies. I represent Galway West which includes Galway city where people are told they must wait on the list for five years. One of the reasons they must wait five years is that people who previously were in the private, starter homes sector are now joining the list because homes have moved out of their reach. As well as that, there is a number of other points which are very important. How can one say one has been successful if the 25,000 houses pledged in the PPF will not be provided? If one takes the gross figure of all the houses built, is one to put Bono's new house in the same scale as somebody, for example, who is waiting five years on Galway Corporation's list? There has been a retreat from public housing and that retreat has to be reversed.</P>
    <P>As the lists have grown, the way the people who wait on the lists are treated has not significantly improved. There are many local authorities without points systems. There are many local authorities to which people desperately go one week after another to ask the question, &ldquo;Is there anything for me?&rdquo;. They are told, &ldquo;No, go away and come back. You have only done two of your five years.&rdquo; That is absolutely reprehensible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" />Again, there has been a destruction in the maintenance of public housing. With the tenant purchase schemes came a retreat, very often lead by management, both in terms of staff and commitment to the management of estates. Where, for example, in the Bill or anywhere else, has any opportunity been taken to upgrade all those estates built in the 1950s and 1960s before installation standards came in and to which an imaginative Minister would have returned? Where is there a dynamic system of, for example allowing innovative models of management? The Minister of State should not tell me they exist on paper; I deal with it every day and they are simply not there. We are running the housing system on a 19th century model much more akin to the Poor Law than to anything modern. Contrast the person who is well off going into an estate agent's office with the person going into a housing office in any local authority and one can answer the question for oneself.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned the extraordinary, unnecessary delays in providing for the disabled and for the elderly. There is not a single reference in this Bill to the implementation of recommendations or a legislative response to the commission on the private rented sector which reported in July 2000. Is it of no significance that small units which cost less than £500 per month less than five years ago cost £1,200 per month today? Is it not significant that the number of evictions this year is probably greater than any year during the 19th century when people were being evicted and we had a large movement of people? So many Deputies can make good suggestions but where is the innovation in all of this such as, for example, a rural refurbishment scheme.</P>
    <P>It is time we dealt with the housing crisis by acknowledging it, by publishing all the figures and by seeking a genuine partnership to put an end to the disgrace of homelessness. When it comes to providing a starter home, a first home, the rights of people to shelter should come before the speculators who have not only destroyed our economy but who have gone so far towards destroying our democracy itself through a mixture of bribery and corruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State. I do not wish to exaggerate but there is a local authority housing crisis in Kerry. At the moment there are 1,602 approved applicants on the waiting list for Killarney, Listowel and Tralee. Approximately 400 more people have applied since these lists were drawn up. At the present rate of building, they will not be rehoused for at least another five years. It is not acceptable. <Col N="176" /> There is a particular problem in Tralee town which is a growing urban area. It seems to have a greater housing problem and housing shortage than most other towns of its size. I welcome the affordable housing scheme and the provision made here. It is a very good scheme and I commend the Minister of State on it and on the efforts he has made in regard to affordable housing.</P>
      <P>The provision of sewage treatment systems in villages and rural areas is very important in terms of the provision of affordable housing in the future and without any subsidy from the State. A site in Tralee costs £60,000 to £100,000 while a site in my village of Finuge costs £25,000. There is no sewage treatment system in Finuge, a village with, unfortunately, an decreasing population. If we had a sewage treatment system, the population of the village would quadruple within a very short period and there would be affordable housing there without any intervention from the State. I am sure that example could be replicated throughout the country. It is a big factor. I say to the Minister and to whoever is in the next Government &ndash; I hope it is my party and will say the same thing to the Minister if that is the case &ndash; that the provision of sewage treatment systems is paramount. The sewage treatment systems in many villages are antiquated and need to be replaced and extended. The solutions are there but they have to be implemented.</P>
      <P>The rent allowance from health boards is now well over &euro;150 million. One should think of the number of houses that could provide. If a large number of people who receive rent subsidy were rehoused, it would save the health boards a considerable amount of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their valuable contributions to the debate on this Bill. This Government has a clear, comprehensive and credible housing strategy backed by a record of solid and unmatched achievement over the past five years. Our emphasis has been on maintaining a high level of housing output, stabilising house prices, expanding the range and supply of social and affordable housing, developing the private rented sector and improving the quality of the management of the public housing stock.</P>
      <P>We have backed up our commitment to housing provision with the necessary resources. Total funding for housing in 2002 is &euro;1.7 billion which is three and a half times that provided in 1997. The overall capital provision this year is &euro;1.6 billion, an increase of 20% on last year. The equivalent capital provision in 1997 was &euro;442 million. The overall revenue provision this year is &euro;113 million which is six times the amount provided in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" />I refer to some of the issues raised by Deputies in relation to the Bill and on housing issues generally. The proposal to extend the borrowing powers of the Housing Finance Agency for certain non-housing capital purposes is not being introduced by stealth as has been suggested by Deputies Olivia Mitchell, Gilmore and Timmins. This proposal has been well flagged and was contained in the Local Government Bill published in May 2000.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to levying charges on non-domestic users of water services is now well established. Traditionally, local authorities have levied charges on non-domestic users of these services, although not in a uniform or comprehensive manner. Arising from a Government decision taken in 1998, the relevant authorities are now applying a water pricing policy framework which will bring much greater transparency and equity to the charging system. This framework was the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders during 1999 and no fundamental objections have been raised to it. Arising from a Government decision taken in 1998, the relevant authorities are now applying a water pricing policy framework which will bring much greater transparency and equity to the charging system. This framework was the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders during 1999 and no fundamental objections have been raised to it.</P>
    <P>Regarding house price increases, it is worth noting that house prices began to accelerate into double digit growth in late 1995. When the Government came into office in 1997 not only did it recognise the importance of addressing this issue, it also took immediate action. The various measures taken by it in recent years have proven successful in addressing the outrageous and unsustainable house price increases that we inherited due to the failed policies and inaction by the previous Government. The most recent data published by my Department show that year on year average house price increases at the end of September last ranged from 3.4% for second-hand houses nationally to 6.7% for new houses in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Total housing output reached 52,602 units last year, up 5.6% on the previous year. Last year was the fifth successive year of record housing output under the Government. Housing output in the greater Dublin area reached almost 16,500 units, the highest level ever recorded. Private housing output in 2001 was also up last year by about 2%, not down as suggested by Deputies Mitchell and Timmins. The reality is that the private house building sector is in a healthy state, due to the wide-ranging measures that the Government has taken to increase housing supply, most recently in the budget.</P>
    <P>There were claims on the Opposition benches that there is an inadequate supply of zoned and <Col N="178" /> serviced land. This is simply not the case. As well as massive investment in the main water services programme, we have also targeted investment specifically at schemes supporting housing development under the serviced land initiative. In addition, the Government has provided significant funding to support the development of small towns and villages under the rural towns and villages initiative. This investment is bearing fruit. A detailed national inventory prepared by my Department in consultation with the local authorities shows that there is about six years' supply of zoned and serviced land nationally. The supply of land in the Dublin area and other major urban areas where housing need is greatest is also sufficient. The position is set to improve significantly on the back of investment in water, sewerage, roads and public transport infrastructure under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, we had another record level of housing output last year, annual house price increases have come back to low single digits and the first-time buyer has been afforded greater space in the housing market. These positive developments allowed the Government to introduce measures in budget 2002, including the reintroduction of interest deductibility for rental property, which will increase the supply of rental accommodation, thereby moderating rent levels. I welcome Deputy Mitchell's support for this measure and the support of my colleague on the Government benches, Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>Increasing the supply of rental accommodation must go hand in hand with improved regulation of the sector. Deputies Gilmore and Hayes will be pleased to know that the reforms relating to security of tenure, rents, graduated notice periods, tenancy obligations and dispute resolution, contained in the report of the commission on the private rented residential sector, are included in the general scheme of a Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill which was approved by the Government in January. Pending the enactment of the Bill, the Private Residential Tenancies Board was established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis last October. It is putting in place procedures for dealing with disputes and, having done so, will begin to accept disputes voluntarily referred to it by the landlords and tenants concerned.</P>
    <P>There have been various claims in this House and elsewhere as to the number of households on waiting lists for local authority housing; figures of up to 60,000 households have been suggested. The real picture will not emerge until the results of the triennial statutory housing needs assessment, due to be undertaken next month, are known. It is worth noting that the last assessment carried out in 1999 showed that the total number of applicants for local authority housing was just over 59,000. When the applicants who were not approved were netted off, double counting factored in, and other more appropriate social <Col N="179" /> housing options taken into account, the net approved need amounted to 39,176 households.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the assertions of Deputies Hayes and Gilmore, the Government has left no stone unturned in dealing with the issue of homelessness which was also raised in the debate. The Government announced its integrated strategy on homelessness in May 2000. One of its central planks is that homeless action plans are to be drawn up at local level jointly by the local authority, health board and voluntary bodies, to set out clearly what services are available for homeless persons and outline what services need to be provided for them over the three year life of the plan. The plans for the main urban areas are completed and work is well under way on those for other areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore claimed that during its term of office the Government has not produced any specific housing legislation. I have a clear recollection of him being in the House when Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 was being debated. Part V is a fundamental change in the housing landscape in Ireland. The housing strategies prepared under it will ensure the overall housing needs of communities are planned for in a coherent and comprehensive way. It will ensure specific targets for social and affordable housing provision are set out at local level.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect that there will be a period of bedding down in terms of the operation of Part V. My Department will shortly be issuing guidelines to local authorities on implementation issues arising in relation to housing developments under Part V. It would be unrealistic, as well as being in contravention of the Act, to exclude apartment developments from its provisions as Deputy Mitchell suggested. Apartment development is now becoming much more widespread in the major urban areas.</P>
    <P>Deputies Carey and Timmins supported the idea of a national housing agency during the course of the debate. The establishment of such an authority was recommended by the National Economic and Social Forum in its report on social and affordable housing and accommodation published in September 2000. This question merits careful consideration and the NESF report, its recommendations and policy implications are being examined by my Department in the context of the comprehensive range of measures being taken in relation to housing. We have focused considerable effort in recent years on strengthening the structures in place in the Department and local authorities and significantly increasing the resources available to secure the necessary supply of housing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the generally positive comments of Deputies in relation to schemes aimed at providing housing for the elderly and people with a disability. Since coming into office, the Government <Col N="180" /> has greatly improved the terms of the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes. Payments increased from 896 in 1997 to 1,700 in 2001. Funding for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly has more than doubled from &euro;5.2 million in 1997 to &euro;11.9 million this year. The improvements introduced also enabled local authorities and health boards to extend the type of work that can be undertaken in individual cases, including the provision of heating systems.</P>
    <P>Deputies Daly, Connaughton, Durkan, Neville and Ring also pointed to problems with the various schemes. It is a matter for the local authority to decide the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid and to ensure there are no undue delays in the processing of applications. The evidence is that, notwithstanding delays in certain cases, the local authorities and health boards have considerably ramped up activity under the schemes.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate which ranged across a broad spectrum of housing issues, which either have been or are being addressed by the Government. There are a number of important provisions contained in the Bill which are essential to maintain and increase the output of social and affordable housing going forward. I look forward to further discussion on the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing Deputy Penrose and me to raise this important issue. While I acknowledge that there is a Minister in the House, I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science is not present for the debate. It is a reflection on his commitment, not just to the school in question, but to all the schools around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coralstown national school, situated between Kinnegad and Mullingar on the N4, has an enrolment of 71 pupils and a staff allocation of three <Col N="181" /> teachers. The original school, consisting of two classrooms, was built about 70 years ago. A prefabricated classroom was added at the back of the school about four years ago. The location of this school, within feet of the very busy N4, with up to 900 vehicles per hour passing at high speed, gives rise to the constant worry about an accident at school opening or closing time. Recently a car crashed into the boundary wall at the school and luckily this accident occurred out of school hours.</P>
    <P>The school toilets are located in an annex at the back of the building and pupils must go outside in all weathers to get access to them. I visited the school yesterday and in the prevailing weather conditions a trip to the toilet and to the prefabricated classroom was not without its hazards, negotiating the weather and the floods around the school. The toilets are wet and damp and there is no running hot water. There is no staff room or toilet. The shared remedial and resource teachers attending the school must operate from a cold, damp cloakroom. The classrooms, while brightly painted and well kept, are overcrowded and unfit for modern teaching methods and requirements.</P>
    <P>The teachers at this school are well known for the high standard of their teaching and their professionalism. They are forced to work in these dreadful conditions yet such is their reputation that students flock to be enrolled at the school. A new school was announced by a local Senator for the area in March 1998. He proudly announced that the school would be occupied in September 1999. A site was purchased and planning permission was obtained. Such is the motivation of parents in this locality that they have already collected £30,000 as their share of the costs.</P>
    <P>Pupils in this school are not getting a fair crack of the whip. The teachers are asked to do a job without adequate facilities. Empty promises are not enough. I want a commitment from the Minister tonight that he will give immediate approval for this school to proceed and that it will be put in place in the minimum possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to raise the disgraceful record of the Government in the provision of a much needed new school in Coralstown. Like Deputy McGrath, I am disappointed the Minister for Education and Science &ndash; whom I have never seen come in to take a debate &ndash; is not here. While I have the utmost respect for the Minister of State, he is being put in the hard spot. It is the Minister's job to answer some of these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I first raised this issue in Dáil Éireann on 17 June 1998. In reply to a parliamentary question, the then Minister, Deputy Martin, confirmed that the Department had sanctioned the construction of a new school building. I raised the issue time <Col N="182" /> and again since, but still the Minister for Education and Science is dragging his feet. Little or no progress has been made in four years, in spite of the numerous promises given.</P>
    <P>On 17 June 1998, I was told the Department had sanctioned &ldquo;approval to commence the architectural planning for a new school building on a green field site&rdquo;. Four years later, in the most recent parliamentary reply, I was told that the project is in architectural planning. How can any Government stand over such a record? Nearly four years has passed in this urgent project and little progress has been made. The political will to deliver at Coralstown does not exist in this Government. The teachers, pupils, community and ourselves are being given the run around on this matter. The Government has sent out a message that the school can wait. Deputy McGrath and I will not accept that message any longer and we have been told by our constituents not to accept it.</P>
    <P>The community at Coralstown is fully behind the project. It has already raised a local contribution of £30,000, the site for the school has been purchased by the parish and planning permission for the school was granted in September 2001. At a meeting in December with officials of the Department, members of the board of management were told that construction might not begin for a number of years and after that it would take another two years to complete. It is unacceptable that this could mean the school might not be in place for four years. Everyone knows it is needed and that the pupils of Coralstown deserve it.</P>
    <P>The situation in the school is untenable and cannot endure for another four years. The school is cheek by jowl with the N4 and there are serious concerns that a major accident can occur. In addition students have to endure outside toilets that are often wet and damp, there is no medical room, no staff room or toilets, and no facility where a teacher can have a private conversation with a pupil or parent in comfort. This Government stands over that situation. That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to turn his attention belatedly to the urgent needs of Coralstown National School. The project is ready to go, it only needs a green light from the top. The school must become a priority for the Minister immediately. Nothing else is acceptable. There are 71 pupils at the school and 77 are expected in September. The school is growing. I ask the Minister to give a positive response tonight.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I concur with the comments of Deputies McGrath and Penrose on the absence of the relevant Minister or Minister of State within whose sphere responsibility for this important issue lies.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday evening, a DART train travelling between Tara Street and Pearse Station developed a major technical fault. When the train left Tara Street Station the doors remained open. The train gathered speed and momentum and the passengers inside had to cling to their seats and the chrome railings to avoid being sucked out of the carriages. To say they were frightened is a gross understatement.</P>
      <P>Eventually the driver realised the doors were open. He slowed the train down and it was taken out of commission after the passengers had disembarked. All we have had from Iarnród Éireann is a short, terse statement and a refusal to go before the media and explain what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This incident was very serious. Thankfully, a tragedy was averted. I want the Minister of State to spell out precisely what happened. I want him to indicate what caused the system failure that led to the doors not closing. Was it one of the original <Col N="184" /> DART trains or one of the newer models? Will the Minister assure the House that all DART trains have been inspected in the interim to ascertain that their door locking mechanisms are in perfect working order? Will the Minister give a guarantee that there will be no further or similar occurrences? </P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has been informed that the circumstances of the incident, which occurred at approximately 9.10 a.m. on Monday morning, are as follows. While the 7.23 a.m. passenger service from Dundalk to Bray was between Tara Street and Pearse Station, one pair of sliding doors opened and closed on vehicle number 2701. The train consisted of eight 2700 class railcars. The door opening was detected by the onboard safety devices and the traction power on the train was cut and the door automatically closed.</P>
      <P>The driver immediately notified the occurrence by radio to the central traffic controller at Connolly Station. The Minister for Public Enterprise understands that the incident was also notified to larnród Éireann by telephone by a passenger on a train.</P>
      <P>The train was taken out of service at Pearse Station for technical examination. larnród Éireann has confirmed that the train has been examined by its own engineering staff and by engineers from the vehicle manufacturer. A stationary inspection and a test run to Drogheda were carried out and the fault could not be repeated.</P>
      <P>The railcar unit involved in the incident has now been transferred to Inchicore Works, and is undergoing further examination. These technical investigations are under way with the vehicle manufacturer's specialist engineers with input by the vehicle design experts at their design office.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise understands from larnród Éireann that there are three electrical circuits which must be activated in order for the door-open command to be generated. The probability of the three circuits spuriously operating simultaneously is very remote according to larnród Éireann. The technical investigating team are concentrating on this aspect. In particular, the electrical circuits are being examined for any signs of contamination which could contribute to faults. As a result of the incident, Iarnród Éireann immediately instigated a technical examination of all diesel railcars in the class 2700 fleet. It is understood that this will be completed by the end of this week, but the results so far have indicated no similar problems on other railcars examined. In addition, the manufacturers of the vehicles are considering a number of additional improvements to add to the security of the door circuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise understands the doors in question are designed in such a way <Col N="185" /> that they should not be capable of opening when a train is in motion and exceeding a speed of five kilometres per hour. While the Minister is concerned that the doors did open in this instance, she is extremely thankful that none of the passengers suffered any injuries. Nevertheless, the fact remains that an incident of this nature could have had more serious consequences.</P>
    <P>These vehicles have been in service since 1998 and accumulated eight million kilometres in running. Iarnród Éireann has advised that this is the first incident where the door safety circuit permitted the door to open above the designated threshold speed.</P>
    <P>It is too early to ascertain the cause or causes of the incident. Iarnród Éireann has informed the Minister for Public Enterprise that it deeply regrets this occurrence. The company has initiated an internal inquiry at senior level to investigate the cause of the incident. The Minister has asked the company for a speedy completion both of its technical investigations and its formal inquiry, and for a report on its conclusions as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the work done in this area by our colleague, Deputy Neville, who has a deep knowledge and understanding of the issue and in many ways has been one of those most responsible for the progress made so far.</P>
      <P>Each week, in various parts of the country, more families must face up to the pain of the loss by suicide of one of their loved ones. I have gained some sense of the devastating effect on family, friends and the community of sudden death by suicide. Recently, I spoke to members of the Rosbrien suicide awareness group in Limerick &ndash; a support group established as a result of a number of suicides in a particular part of Limerick. Its campaign arose from its members' collective experience and a determination to ensure preventive caring and supportive measures are a reality rather than an aspiration.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the national task force on suicide are excellent and while progress has been made, many measures have still not been implemented. I want to focus on what needs to be done, while acknowledging the work that has been done, particularly by the regional inter-agency groups and suicide strategy co-ordinators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As most of those who take their own lives are young, school awareness programmes are crucial. From talking to the Rosbrien suicide awareness group, I understand the social and personal health education programme in secondary <Col N="186" /> schools does not deal with depression and suicide. Young people, particularly young men, need to be given the skills to understand and cope with latent negative feelings that may eventually lead to them to consider taking their own lives. School-based programmes have a major role to play in this regard. General practitioners, out-patients' staff, psychiatrists and other medical and paramedical staff need updated training. Protocols have to be rigorously established whereby no distressed or parasuicidal young person is allowed to walk away because of a lack of awareness of front-line health staff. Appropriate follow-up through community based services is also crucial. I have been told that the onus to return to the services is frequently left with the young person whose state of mind may make him or her walk away and try to deal with his or her problem in isolation. This issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The geographical basis of psychiatric community services is too rigid as is its hierarchical system. A psychologist or counsellor may be the most helpful professional for such a young person, but he or she must first be referred by a psychiatrist with a large case load and perhaps too long a waiting time. Having spoken to people with direct experience of the service, it is clear that a more flexible system is required.</P>
    <P>When suicide occurs in a family and community, many people who were close to the person concerned experience complex feelings of grief, sometimes guilt, and other responses. There must be a response for those who need it. Helpful booklets are produced by health boards and other bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate. More people die by suicide in Ireland than in road accidents. It is accepted that an undetermined number of road accidents are suicides. In 2001, the Government spent an inadequate £22 million on road safety outside the cost of traffic duties by the Garda Síochána. In the same period, just £1.02 million was spent on suicide prevention, some 5% of that spent on preventing road accidents.</P>
      <P>Suicide is the number one cause of death in young people. The Minister must initiate serious research to determine the reason, since the 1960s, the number of suicides has increased from an average of approximately 65 per year to the current figure of 450. We must examine the reason at a time of unprecedented prosperity so many people feel so despairing that they choose to take their own lives. This causes devastation to the family and friends of the victim, as well as the community at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suicide is a terrible act against human nature. While the current fiscal health of young people may be better than years ago, the same cannot be said of the social and psychological pressures to <Col N="187" /> which they are now being exposed. This is partly due to the increasing instability of family life and the changing sense of personal and family relationships. We need to seriously examine the situation regarding young people, especially young men, and the changes in society that have caused them to feel so depressed and despairing that some choose to take their own lives.</P>
    <P>Serious research into this matter is required. Since May 2000, I have been seeking the establishment of a small-scale, inexpensive task force to examine what is happening with young people and the reason some of them are so despairing that they choose to take their own lives. The Minister should seriously examine this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Sullivan and Neville for raising this matter. We all agree that there is a need for ongoing investment in researching the issues that have been raised. This was outlined by the report of the national task force on suicide, published in 1998. It also outlined a comprehensive strategy to reduce the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide. Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report, which is reflected in the reduction in the number of recorded suicides for the past two years. Many of the recommendations of the task force, however, require continuous development, particularly in the area of training and the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>Central to the report of the task force was the provision of a national suicide prevention strategy which is now in place. The key components of the strategy include the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups, provision of information and training on suicide prevention for relevant professionals and organisations, and research into suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national suicide review group by the chief executive officers of the health boards was central to the strategy to prevent and reduce the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide. It was a core recommendation of the task force report. The group was established in 1998. Its membership includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. Its main responsibilities are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, co-ordinate research into suicide and make appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group also publishes an annual report which provides a comprehensive overview of activities in suicide prevention. This publication includes the annual statistics on suicide as well as providing regional reports and overviews. It draws together progress reports from all the <Col N="188" /> health boards, statutory bodies and the voluntary sector, and presents data as provided by the Central Statistics Office on both a regional and national basis. The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001, provides that the Minister for Health and Children will make a report each year to each House of the Oireachtas on the measures taken by health boards in the preceding year to address the problem of suicide. The work of the National Suicide Review Group will inform the preparation of this report, which will be presented to the Oireachtas later this year.</P>
    <P>Health boards have also established working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on suicide. The working groups are multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary and engage in the promotion of positive mental health and the destigmatisation of suicide, provide information in relation to suicide and parasuicide, liaise with the media and provide training requirements for staff in relation to all aspects of suicide and parasuicide. Resource officers with responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the task force have been appointed in all the health boards. Their responsibilities include the provision of staff training in risk assessment, production of information literature and events aimed at raising public awareness of suicide and parasuicide.</P>
    <P>In order to further reduce the number of suicides it is essential that people undergoing life crises should get appropriate support. In this regard over &euro;4.9 million has been provided since the publication of the report of the task force on suicide for suicide prevention activities and for research aimed at improving understanding of this issue. Additional funding has also been allocated to the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork to support its work in the development of a national parasuicide register.</P>
    <P>The task force also recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to young people. Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people. In this regard additional funding has been made available to further develop consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. The level of capital funding which has been made available for the development of community &ndash; based mental health facilities has increased significantly in recent years and community services such as home nursing, day centres, family support, hostels and day hospitals, will continue to be developed in order to make services more accessible to people who may be at risk. I am also very conscious of the great work being done by a number of voluntary organisations and support groups throughout the country. I recently launched a very beautiful book <Col N="189" /> called <i>Echoes of Suicide</i>, edited by Siobhán Foster Ryan and Luke Monaghan. It is a very sensitive treatment of the subject and will be of great use to many people. Deputy Neville was one of the contributors as I was myself.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash;  A Health System for You , which includes a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes over the coming years. The Government is fully committed to ensuring that further investment takes place in this area, building on the achievements to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter. There is a need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce measures to amend the Planning and Development Act, 2001, and the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, to restore the planning approval requirements for the erection of all telecommunications antennae support structures.</P>
      <P>The issue of mobile phone masts was one of the first I raised in the Dáil after my election in 1997. I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in October 1997, asking the Minister to initiate independent studies into the environmental and health implications of mobile phone masts. The response was unsatisfactory: in fact, no reference was made to my call for independent studies. Since that time, many more telecommunications antennae and support structures have been erected all over the country, but it is also the case that the concerns of communities at the effects of microwave radiation from these installations have not been allayed. Indeed, they have been compounded. Structures have been erected at unsuitable sites close to residences and schools and sometimes are obstructive new features on the landscape. The Minister repeatedly reassured communities that their fears were groundless. Under the Planning and Development Act and the Planning and Development Regulations, he has exempted these structures from normal planning procedures. He has taken away the right of communities and their elected representatives to scrutinise applications to erect these structures. The Minister and his colleagues in Government have dispensed with democratic accountability, a move I vigorously opposed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. How could communities have confidence in the Minister or in the telecommunications companies when they proceed in such a manner? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the legitimate right of communities to protest peacefully against mobile phone masts <Col N="190" /> where there is concern at their imposition and their health implications. At Lough-an-lea mountain in County Cavan, the local community has recently mounted a round the clock protest against the siting of a new 41 metre high mast on top of the mountain which already has a complex of masts and other support structures. The new mast has been erected beside an ancient cairn burial site and members of the community are protesting in order to protect the heritage and natural beauty of the area and to protect their own and their children's health.</P>
    <P>I must reflect the anger of the community at Lough-an-lea and elsewhere, including Kingscourt, at some recent media coverage which has attempted to smear their campaign. They have been falsely accused of intimidation and in a disgraceful article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 17 February, a photograph of the protest at Lough-an-lea was captioned &ldquo;Vigilantes&rdquo; with a picture of an armed and masked man superimposed. The same article attempted to portray the role of my party as sinister and exploitative and tried to link both Sinn Féin and the community groups to incidents of damage to installations and alleged intimidation. These are lies. I have supported communities in their campaigns on this issue since my election and before. I know many of the people involved in these campaigns and they are decent, honourable people who are active out of genuine concern. They are good citizens exercising their rights.</P>
    <P>There have been incidents of malicious damage and I wish to put on the record of the House that I condemn those incidents. I regard as scurrilous the suggestion in the <i>Irish Independent </i>of 12 February and the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 17 February, that republicans have been involved in such incidents. I reject any attempt to use such incidents to discredit legitimate local campaigns against masts. I uphold the right of all members of the community, including republicans, to involve themselves in these campaigns and to participate in the democratic pursuit of this issue. I fully accept the need for a modern telecommunications infrastructure, especially in neglected regions such as the Border region, but developments should be subject to normal planning regulations and should respect the concerns of local communities.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to re-visit the legislation in a serious manner and to treat local communities with the respect they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and allowing me an opportunity to explain the situation regarding the planning regime for telecommunications antennae and support structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning permission is required for the erection of new telecommunications antennae support structures, or masts as they are commonly known. This remains the case under the Planning <Col N="191" /> and Development Regulations, 2001, which were made on 19 December 2001 and which came into operation on 21 January 2002. The replacement of an existing mast with a new mast is, subject to certain planning conditions, an exempted development as it has been since 1994.</P>
    <P>Arising from the enactment of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, a comprehensive review of the planning regulations was undertaken and a new set of regulations was prepared. These regulations made no change in relation to the erection of new telecommunications masts &ndash; they need planning permission.</P>
    <P>In relation to antennae, the draft regulations restate with minor amendments the exemptions contained in the 1994 to 2000 planning regulations. The only significant change for antennae is the exemption of disguised or hidden antenna on or in existing structures. From a planning point of view, disguised and hidden antennae are considered to be the least visually obtrusive form of installation.</P>
    <P>However, all disguised or hidden antennae must comply with strict conditions and limitations &ndash; otherwise planning permission is required. These conditions include that the installation must comply with all requirements set down by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The Director of Telecommunications Regulation sets the limits on non-ionising radiation emissions from such installations based on best international practice and monitors compliance with these standards. In addition, the planning authority must be notified by the operator of the proposed location of any such antennae at least four weeks before installation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" />As the Deputy is aware, the exempted development regulations now require the joint approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government discussed the regulations last December. There was agreement that once the antennae stayed within the internationally derived emission levels they were safe from a health point of view but there was also concern that sufficient monitoring should continue to ensure that once erected, they would remain within these levels.</P>
    <P>These concerns were acknowledged and the argument was accepted that the public needs reassurance on this matter. The Minister gave a firm commitment to put in place a compliance regime, following consultation with all relevant interests, to ensure that all telecommunications antennae adhere to the strict limits for non-ionising radiation emissions. Since then, my Department has been working with the Department of Public Enterprise researching best practice abroad so as to ensure that the new compliance regime will be as thorough as the best systems in place in other countries. Proposals are expected to be finalised in the near future.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, and having regard to the fact that the telecommunications antennae support structures need planning permission, there are no proposals to amend the 2001 regulations in this regard. This would only serve to needlessly increase the burden on an already stretched planning system. The correct way forward is to put in place a regime to ensure compliance with emission limits and this is being done.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 February 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with a Government decision on value-for-money reviews, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme was undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. The aims of the review process are: to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme; and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this review was to address the following issues: the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which current objectives are being met; the efficiency, effectiveness and equity implications of the current subvention scheme; the need and the likely future demand for private nursing home care; the supply of nursing home care in the future; the role of the nursing home sector in an integrated public-private care system; the role of the social economy in an integrated, community-based, long-stay care system; optimal funding arrangements for long-stay care; and the major policy questions for the future.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from this expenditure review, taking into account the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might also like to know that in 2001, additional funding was sought by my Department to implement the provisions of Article 10.6 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993. This provision allows health boards, in addition to paying the appropriate subvention rate, pay an amount up to the rate of old age non-contributory pension in respect of subvention applicants whose means are assessed as less than the weekly rate of old age non-contributory pension. Funding of &euro;10 million was distrib<Col N="194" /> uted to health boards to ensure that everyone who receives a subvention is granted an amount to bring their income, following the application of Article 8.2, the disregard of one fifth of old age non-contributory pension rate, back up to the rate of old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that in 1997 when this Government came to office, the funding available for the scheme was £27 million. This year £72 million, &euro;92 million, has been made available by my Department to health boards to meet the costs of nursing home subventions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The current level of vacancies for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in the public hospital service is small in comparison to the overall complement of posts. However, every effort will continue to be made to increase post occupancy levels to the maximum. In addition to the efforts to fill posts being made at local level, a national medical recruitment and retention monitoring group has been established, which, as one of its tasks, will keep the situation pertaining to NCHD vacancies under review.</P>
      <P>My Department has been involved in a number of initiatives to improve the recruitment and retention of NCHDs in the public health service over the last number of years. The Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation negotiated a substantial agreement for improved terms and conditions for NCHDs. Legislation was passed which amended the Medical Practitioners Act to allow for the temporary registration of doctors to be extended from five to seven years.</P>
      <P>A recruitment drive in India and Pakistan involving this Department, the faculty of anaesthetists, the Medical Council and the health boards took place to encourage doctors in those countries to come to Ireland for practical training. Over 50 doctors, specialising in anaesthesia, have taken up posts in Ireland as a result of this initiative. Recently, my Department, in association with the health boards and FÁS has undertaken an initiative to encourage Austrian non-consultant hospital doctors to take up posts in Ireland. The potential for further international medical recruitment initiatives is being reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government approved the establishment of a national task force on hospital medical staffing to, <i>inter alia</i>, prepare and oversee the execution of a detailed implementation programme based on the recommendations of the report of the Medical Manpower Forum and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors. The recommendations which will be made by the task force will have implications for the number of doctors, both consultants and NCHDs, required in the public hospital service. The inaugural meeting of this task force will take place tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 94 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to inform the House of the many initiatives which I and this Government has taken to improve the provision of accident and emergency services in hospitals. As the Deputies will be aware, the hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on elective beds because of the growing number of admissions through accident and emergency departments. Available data indicates that about 70% of all hospital admissions are through accident and emergency departments. In addition, a growing proportion of bed capacity is being taken-up by the elderly who have a higher than average length of stay.</P>
      <P>Hospitals providing accident and emergency services experience a seasonal increase in activity and surge in admissions during the winter months. Every effort is made to keep waiting times to an absolute minimum and to ensure that appropriate medical care is provided at all times. A triage system of assessment operates at accident and emergency departments whereby each patient attending at an accident and emergency department is assessed and treated according to his/her medical priority, the objective being to ensure that a person requiring treatment has access to a senior clinical decision-making service and is treated without undue delay.</P>
      <P>One of the initiatives taken by this Government to improve services in accident and emergency departments included the provision of &euro;40.63 million investment package in the winter of 2000-2001 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including the recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alter<Col N="197" /> native setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted more than 700 beds under this initiative in the winter of 2000-2001 and this helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospitals. Funding was also allocated to the ERHA and each health board for the contracting of private nursing home places for the final three months of 2001.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware of the health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You recently published by this Government. This strategy outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services starting immediately and continuing up to 2011. As part of the preparation work for the strategy my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of that review entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which I published in early January the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. I announced on 16 January a &euro;65 million investment package in the current year for the commissioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals and these will come on stream before the end of this year. I am confident that once these beds are put in place, there will be a visible improvement in accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives have been identified in the health strategy which are designed to improve the operation of accident and emergency departments. These include: the establishment of 24-hour GP co-operatives which will reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise attend at accident and emergency departments. &euro;17.292 million is being invested in the development of this service in 2002; the appointment of additional accident and emergency consultants (12 additional consultants have been appointed over the last year and funding has been provided to recruit a further 17); the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs) (emergency) in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments and the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments. Such information will provide <Col N="198" /> staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is reviewing, at my request, the structure, operation and staffing of accident and emergency services and departments with the aim of improving the provision of patient care. This review has involved extensive consultation with the ERHA, each health board, relevant voluntary hospitals, appropriate professional bodies and other interested parties. The review also involved an extensive examination of literature regarding accident and emergency services in Britain, Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. I understand that the report of this review is almost completed and I look forward to studying its findings in the near future. Its findings will also inform and assist in the improvement of the provision of services in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Many of the initiatives which I have outlined above will take time to come on stream and to impact positively on accident and emergency services. Therefore, on 13 February, I announced that I intended to establish an accident and emergency forum to identify steps that can be taken immediately to alleviate current problems in accident and emergency services. The forum, which will be chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former president of Dublin City University, will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>Participants will include all relevant stakeholders: hospital management, members of the medical and nursing professions, para-medical and non-nursing personnel, staff representative associations and unions, patient advocacy groups and other interested parties. Preparations for the establishment of the forum are under way and I strongly urge all stakeholders to attend. It is with dialogue and the sharing of views that we can reach workable solutions which will assist in alleviating the current difficulties, prior to the other initiatives coming on stream.</P>
    <P>The issue of violence against any health service worker is a very serious matter. In the year 2000, I asked the ERHA and each health board to review their security arrangements in accident and emergency departments and to identify deficiencies. Arising from the review, I allocated &euro;1.27 million in 2001 to the ERHA, health boards and directly funded voluntary hospitals to improve security arrangements in accident and emergency departments. This money was allocated to address issues such as additional security personnel, installation of CCTV and training of staff on how to manage/handle aggressive patients.</P>
    <P>I met with the Health and Safety Authority in February 2001 and one of the issues for discussion was violence in the work place. The Health and Safety Authority informed me that they planned to step up the number of reviews of hospitals in relation to health and safety issues, of which work place violence is an important issue. I welcome this development and I have since written to the chief executive officers of the ERHA and the <Col N="199" /> health boards informing them of the need to take all necessary measures to address risks to health service staff in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the range of initiatives which I have outlined will contribute to a significant improvement in services to patients attending accident and emergency departments and represents tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to the development of a patient-centred health service.</P>

      <P>Uptake in respect of childhood immunisations in each health board for the years 1998 &ndash; 2000 and for the period 1 January &ndash; 30 September 2001 are set out in the following table. The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards, who enter into contracts <Col N="200" /> with general practitioners for the delivery of the service. The objective of the programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95%. The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of unimmunised children contacting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and over 1,500 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. I understand that this report will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>On a positive note, since the introduction of the national immunisation programme against group C meningococcal disease there has been a dramatic reduction in this disease in Ireland. Provisional data provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre indicates that in 2001, 35 cases of group C disease have been notified compared to 139 cases in 2000, a reduction of 75%. The most dramatic reductions were seen in the age groups targeted by the meningitis C vaccine, ranging from a 93% reduction in 5-9 year olds to a 70% reduction in the ten-14 years age group. This represents a very significant reduction and highlights the importance and success of the campaign.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of such services is a matter for the individual health boards in the first instance. My Department asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is responsible for the delivery of health services in counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, for its comments on this matter. The difficulties experienced by clients in waiting for assessment, therapy and the provision of appropriate aids by the authority is acknowledged. These difficulties arise from problems encountered in recruiting specialist staff such as occupational therapists.</P>
      <P>The authority informs me that the resolution to the current difficulties associated with the recruitment/retention of occupational therapists continues to be actively pursued by local and area health board management. Recruitment-retention difficulties extend right throughout the health service and across a wide range of disciplines, including occupational therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address the overall issue of shortages in the therapy profession, which includes occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy, an overseas recruitment of therapy grades initiative is currently under way. A group representative of the ten health boards nationally has been established and, in conjunction with other assisting agencies, has been given the brief <Col N="202" /> of sourcing and validating suitably qualified therapists from overseas to fill shortages within the service currently. Work on this project has only commenced recently. However, it is envisaged that progress will be made in this area.</P>
    <P>The approach of health boards in overcoming these problems is by way of positive and pro-active intervention. They are, at present, developing an overall strategy to ensure that current and future staff requirements can be achieved in order to maintain continuity in the delivery of a quality service delivery throughout boards. The development of a long-term strategy for recruitment/retention will be based on a consultation process with interested parties including staff, managers, staff associations/unions, professional organisations, etc.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above, other initiatives have been taken or are at an advanced stage of introduction. These initiatives include the following: review of current advertisement arrangement, i.e., content, coverage, focus, appeal to prospective applicants and overall presentation; advertisement in overseas newspapers, journals, professional bulletins, local newspapers periodicals, etc.; further enhancement of already established contacts with the schools, colleges and professional bodies; discussions in regard to increasing the number of training places in third level colleges; the question of sponsorship of students and further overseas recruitment drives will be directed towards a range of disciplines including occupational therapy staff.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is anticipated that the above initiatives will assist the authority in overcoming existing difficulties relating to staff recruitment/retention. It is in this context that the recruitment of staff for the occupational therapy service area is being addressed. Other initiatives are being promoted in the ERHA region include one which will give hospital-based occupational therapists direct access to aids and appliances with which to supply people on discharge from hospital, thus reducing the community waiting lists.</P>

      <P>In October 2001, I had the great pleasure of launching the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care, thus completing a commitment made by this Government to formulate a national hospice plan. As part of its work, the national advisory committee sought submissions from and consulted with many groups on all aspects of palliative care including the particular needs of children. The national advisory com<Col N="203" /> mittee was in contact with a committee that had been established under the auspices of the faculty of paediatrics to examine the future development of palliative care services for children and which had not concluded its work by the publication of the report.</P>
      <P>While the report made a number of specific recommendations relating to palliative care it did not reach any firm conclusions in relation to the future development of children's services. It is generally accepted amongst those working in the field that a key requirement is the completion of a needs assessment. This would provide a firm indication of the extent to which current needs are being met as well as the extent of unmet need. I am glad to say that discussions between a number of groups, including my Department, on a needs assessment study are at an advanced stage and it is expected that this process will be significantly advanced in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of the needs assessment, my Department will continue to liaise with health boards and other groups on the orderly development of palliative care services for children. While I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the needs assessment I should point out that the current thinking both in Ireland and other countries would suggest that the provision of children's hospices is not the favoured option and that the demand is more likely to be for respite services for children with life shortening illnesses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 February 2002, I received a letter from the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists regarding the Green Paper on Abortion. The college drew attention to a quotation contained in the Green Paper from a report entitled, The Physical and Psycho-Social effects of Abortion on Women, which had been produced in 1994 by a private commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of Lord Rawlinson of Ewell. The college indicated in its letter that the quotation in question did not accurately represent the statement to the Rawlinson commission of one of the psychiatrists who gave evidence on its behalf. The college stated that the psychiatrist had said that there were no absolute psychiatric indications for termination of pregnancy and that termination of pregnancy would always have to be worked out on the basis of an individual patient.</P>
      <P>The quotation about which the college has expressed concern was quoted in the Green Paper on Abortion in good faith. It appeared in chapter 5, which dealt with the many submissions which had been received and the arguments made in them. The Green Paper stated explicitly that the inclusion of a particular argument or statement in that chapter did not indicate that the Cabinet committee which was responsible for the preparation of the Green Paper was in agreement with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals which will be put to the people in the referendum on the Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution follow a detailed process of consideration and consultation. This included the preparation of the Green Paper and the detailed hearings held by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution at which the issues were explored in detail with many of those who had made submissions. In the <Col N="205" /> course of this the all-party committee met representatives of the medical profession, including a number of psychiatrists, the churches, legal experts and a range of other interested parties to explore in detail the complex medical, legal and social issues involved. The Government believes that the evidence considered in the preparation of the Green Paper, and also the testimony and conclusions in the report of the all-party committee, do not support the maintenance of suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland and would not justify the enactment of a legal basis for abortion to avoid such a risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
      <P>MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this programme. There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines. On the basis of currently available information there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines. Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time and be at greater risk of contracting the diseases concerned. To my knowledge no other country advocates the use of three separate vaccines rather than the MMR vaccine. MMR vaccine is in use worldwide. Most countries implement a two dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved. My primary concern and that of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and <Col N="206" /> autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee, and the British Committee on Safety of Medicines in the UK, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Paediatrics in the USA as well as the World Health Organisation, and UK professional organisations. Most recently, the United States Institute of Medicine also concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that observations made regarding the onset of autism following the administration of MMR vaccine do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest that the vaccine is the cause. It has also indicated that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children in its report on childhood immunisation which was published in July 2001 concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by the Irish Family Planning Association regarding the availability of the morning after pill. The question of licensing any medicinal product and the conditions which should attach to its sale are matters for the Irish Medicines Board in the first instance. The board has informed me that, to date, it has not received an application for the licensing of a particular product intended for use as a post-coital contraceptive pill.</P>
      <P>The current medical practice in Ireland is that an increased dose of the ordinary contraceptive pill is prescribed as emergency contraception and, in this form, the morning after pill has been available in this jurisdiction for many years. In addition, the Irish Medicines Board, after careful consideration, including the obtaining of legal advice, has decided that the drug specifically intended for use as emergency contraception may be classified as a contraceptive. It has concluded that, subject to the normal requirements of the licensing process, this drug may be authorised for sale in Ireland. That position would be consolidated by the Government's proposals under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons who will no longer be eligible to obtain a medical card under the income limit guidelines recently issued by his Department; if he is considering the need to change these guidelines again in view of the recent increase in social welfare payments as a result of the budget; and the total number of medical cards granted to persons under seventy years of age here.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be <Col N="208" /> awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as the carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card. For this reason and because of changes in income generally, it is not possible to project the number of medical card applicants who will not qualify for a medical card. The total number of persons under 70 years of age currently covered by a medical card is 870,167.</P>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy launched by the Government late last year. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to last year's extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This Government's commitment to extending medical card coverage should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasises on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society.</P>
    <P>A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including many of the recommendations drawn directly from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, such as: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. During 2002, the Government's priorities for improving the health system will include: 709 additional acute public hospital beds and 200 <Col N="209" /> beds contracted from the private sector; addressing waiting times through a new treatment purchase fund and maintaining investment levels in the general programme to reduce waiting lists; commencing implementation of the new model of primary care; services for people with a disability; and services for older people.</P>
    <P>My Department has advised the health board chief executive officers in writing last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget. In addition, the chief executive officers have been asked that every effort be made to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card. In response, the chief executive officers have indicated that they are currently reviewing the guidelines used to assess applications for medical cards.</P>

      <P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service has advised my Department that it has sufficient personnel, equipment and finances to ensure that it is in a position to maintain an adequate blood supply. There are sufficient supplies of blood at the present time to meet all hospital requirements.</P>
      <P>The service, like other transfusion services internationally, experiences seasonal difficulties especially over the Christmas period in maintaining adequate supplies. In order to improve the blood supply, the IBTS invested considerable resources in a major donor recruitment campaign during January which was highly successful. In January, 23,800 donors attended clinics throughout the country which is a 56% increase in the number of donors who attended in January, 2001. A total of 4,200 new donors attended which is an increase of 127%. These donor figures also reflect the significant investment which the service has made recently in local donor recruitment initiatives and in decentralised mobile collection teams in Ardee, County Louth and Carlow. A new team will be established in Tuam, County Galway in the coming weeks. These teams will augment the existing collection services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The response of donors to the appeal over recent weeks has been exceptional and I wish to acknowledge their generosity. I would ask donors to continue to donate during the year to ensure that the service can maintain adequate supplies for use by patients in our hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise. As part of this plan stocks of iodine tablets were distributed to all regional health boards in 1991 for use as a counter measure in the context of an overall response to a nuclear emergency. It emerged that some health boards disposed of these stocks as they were past their &ldquo;best-before&rdquo; date and these boards believed that they were ineffective. I am advised that current stocks held by boards are as follows: Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; 720,000, tested 14 months ago and usable at that time; South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 360,000, tested recently and usable; North-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 180,000, tested in 1999 and usable at that time; North-Western Health Board &ndash; 30,000 untested tablets; Mid-Western Health Board &ndash; 300,000 untested tablets; Midland Health Board &ndash; nil; Western <Col N="211" /> Health Board &ndash; nil; Southern Health Board &ndash; nil.</P>
      <P>Ingestion of stable iodine tablets can effectively block the body's uptake of radioactive iodine and may be effective in preventing thyroid cancer in certain populations, especially in children exposed to radioactive fallout. Only a severe nuclear accident close to Ireland may require the use of iodine tablets depending on the nature of the accident and any resultant radiation release. Staying indoors and avoiding the consumption of certain foods that may be contaminated would most likely be the advice given in the early stages of any emergency.</P>
      <P>The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I accepted this recommendation and my Department, through the Eastern Regional Health Authority, following an appropriate tendering process under EU legislation, placed an order for the manufacture of new stocks on 21 December 2001. Delivery of these stocks to the ERHA is expected by the 22 March 2002.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Government task force on emergency planning it has been decided to distribute the tablets directly to each household in the country through the postal system. My Department is currently liaising with An Post and making the necessary mail fulfilment arrangements in order to ensure the secure delivery of a carton of tablets to each household as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Assisted Human Reproduction raises a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. While there is no legislation regulating this area, medical practice is governed by guidelines issues by the Medical Council. However, these apply only to registered medical practitioners and would be ineffective in the case of any such service operated by other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area. As a first step towards addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March <Col N="212" /> 2000 with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The commission has met on ten occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent on 17 January 2002. I understand that the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work. Initially, each discipline &ndash; medical, legal, scientific and social prepared a report outlining the current position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues which need to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the work group structure facilitates close attention to a relatively limited range of topics by a highly specialised group. It also facilitates the detailed exploration of a range of ethical and social implications that arise from assisted human reproduction.</P>
    <P>The commission organised a one day conference for commission members and an invited audience of about thirty in Dublin Castle in September 2001. The conference dealt with the social, legal and ethical factors inherent in assisted human reproduction. It provided an opportunity for an exchange of views between experts in the various fields from Ireland, the UK, France and Germany.</P>
    <P>When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. In order to inform itself of the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wished to do so, to make written submissions before Wednesday, 31 October 2001. In excess of 1,600 submissions have been received by the commission, and are currently being examined.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission is engaged in a number of information gathering exercises that include: (1) a survey of assisted human reproduction services provided in specialised clinics &ndash; a survey instrument was drafted by the commission with a view to establishing the extent of the provision of assisted human reproduction services in Ireland. The members of the secretariat are administering it and returns are already complete from the majority of recognised assisted human reproduction centres in the country; (2) a survey of general practitioners &ndash; the commission has issued a survey instrument to a random sample of 50% of GPs in all health board areas. Replies were requested by 15 February and I understand that a high proportion of those surveyed have responded; and (3) a survey of obstetricians and gynaecologists &ndash; the commission is <Col N="213" /> in the process of finalising a survey instrument for obstetricians and gynaecologists to elicit information on their level of involvement in assisted human reproduction services.</P>
    <P>Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined, it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work, but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue to work as expeditiously as is feasible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

      <P>Early last year, in response to a recommendation by the Nursing Education Forum, I established an interdepartmental steering committee to examine all funding and issues associated with the implementation of a new pre-registration nursing degree programme. This committee is composed of representatives of my Department, the Departments of Finance, Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. It considered that the most cost-effective way of proceeding with the integration of pre-registration nursing education into the higher education sector would be to commence with the first cohort of nursing degree students, who will begin their studies this autumn.</P>
      <P>In arriving at this conclusion, the committee was cognisant of the fact that the capital building programme required to be undertaken to accommodate nursing students on the campuses of the higher education institutions would not be completed until 2004. In the meantime, temporary accommodation has to be found for the first two intakes of nursing degree students. In these circumstances, the only viable approach is to continue with the present arrangements for second and third year nursing diploma students. I emphasise that in years two and three of the diploma programme, nursing students spend an increasing proportion of their time undertaking clinical placements in the health services. The fact that they are not being integrated into the higher education sector to coincide with the introduction of the new nursing degree programme does not in any way diminish their status as students.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening Programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, over 50,000 women have been called for screening and over 34,000 women have been screened. This represents a 70% uptake.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance and best practice and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nation-wide. BreastCheck is currently in discussion with health boards concerning expansion of the programme nation-wide. My Department will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to nation-wide coverage as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the numbers of doctors and nurses he forecasts the State will need for the next decade; and whether plans are in place to meet these requirements.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have initiated a number of measures to estimate the number of doctors and nurses required by the State over the next decade and beyond. In relation to the numbers of hospital doctors the Deputy will be aware that the Government has approved the establishment of a national task force on medical staffing.</P>
      <P>The task force will, among other issues, consider the proposed development of a consultant delivered public hospital service and quantify the resource and cost implications involved. The task force will also address the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU Directive on Working Time and the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce. The task force's recommendations will have implications for the number of hospital doctors, both consultants and NCHDs, required in the public hospital service. The first meeting of the task force will take place on 21 February 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the number of doctors in general practice, the primary care strategy &ndash; Primary Care, A New Direction &ndash; which was published as part of the health strategy Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, states that a needs assessment of the composition and number of primary care teams in each health board area will be carried out within guidelines <Col N="220" /> and frameworks developed by the forthcoming national primary care task force.</P>
    <P>A primary care human resources plan will be produced by the national primary care task force and the health boards to develop the capacity of primary care. Immediate improvements in human resource planning as proposed in chapter 5 of the main health strategy document will be accelerated to enable projected longer term requirements for staff numbers and skills mix to be identified, particularly in the health and social care professions.</P>
    <P>The human resources plan will require the commitment and support of various professional providers and other staff involved in order to ensure that its successful development and implementation is progressed on a partnership basis. It will be based on the needs assessments to be carried out by individual health boards.</P>
    <P>With regard to ensuring an adequate supply of nurses and midwives to staff our health service into the future, the Commission on Nursing identified a need to strengthen the workforce planning functions in my Department. In response, my Department set up a study of the nursing and midwifery resource in December 1998. The aim of the project is to analyse the present position with regard to the nursing and midwifery workforce, to devise a system for the projection of future needs and to plan how these needs may be met. A steering group chaired by my Department's chief nursing officer is overseeing the project. The steering group's final report is due to be published in April 2002.</P>
    <P>The steering group published an interim report in September 2000, and the &euro;6.35 million, £5 million, recruitment/retention initiative announced by me on 29 November 2000 was my immediate response to recommendations contained in the report. The steering group has identified as an urgent priority the refinement of systems and processes used to supply essential information to ensure that forecasts for future nursing and midwifery requirement are feasible and improve over time. Highlighted in the interim report are the inadequacies of existing databases to yield reliable information on which to base forecasts. To address this, work is progressing on the development of a new personnel, payroll, attendance and recruitment system, PPARS, that will capture essential data on each individual and post within the health service. The PPARS project is a fundamental building block in developing dependable, reliable and robust quality information to forecast human resource requirements for the health service in the future.</P>
    <P>Increasing the annual intakes of nursing students is a central component of my overall strategy for addressing the nursing shortage in the medium to long-term. In 2000 there was a 25% increase in the number of nurse training places, from 1,200 to 1,500. The number of <Col N="221" /> training places will rise to 1,640 in 2002. Over the lifetime of the national health strategy, quality and fairness, 10,000 nurses will be trained.</P>

    <P>This table shows an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment at the end of the December 2001 quarter when compared with the corresponding figure in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that the breakdown of this information according to category of severity is not available. Similarly, the number of patients who opt to avail of treatment from private practitioners, independent of the health boards, is not available.</P>
    <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the <Col N="223" /> grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the post graduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a Professor in Orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to, among other things, recruit additional staff for the service.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, the total number of patients on the waiting list for treatment was 11,890. This is a reduction of 1,613 in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter.</P>
    <P>Guidelines issued by my Department prioritise patients according to severity of need. As a result, I am satisfied that the 17,295 patients currently in treatment reflect those who are most in need. As the number of patients in orthodontic treatment increase, services will be provided to patients who would benefit from, rather than be in severe need of, orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <P>Alternative medicines, including herbal and traditional medicines, are distinct types of medicinal products. In many instances these medicines are used in conjunction with conventional medicine rather than as an alternative to it. In order to gain the most from medicines such as these, it is essential that they are licensed by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicines, they are of appropriate quality, safe for use, and can be expected to act in accordance with any claims made. It is clear that many of these medicines have a tradition of use that is indicative of potential benefit. The value of medicines such as these to the health of the Irish nation specifically can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for assessing them and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to clearly determine any potential benefit.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has recently submitted to me a proposal for an interim national licensing scheme for traditional and alternative medicinal products including herbal medicines. This scheme is in line with proposed European legislation in this area and will assure consumers that the traditional medicinal products which they buy are produced to an appropriate quality and can be expected to act in accordance with any claims made.</P>
      <P>It is my view that, in the context of a regulatary scheme which would ensure their quality and safety, many alternative medicines, including traditional and herbal medicines, may have a constructive role to play in improving the health of the nation.</P>

      <P>Under the waiting list initiative, which was introduced in 1993, dedicated funding is made available to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out additional in-patient waiting list procedures. In order to monitor the performance of health agencies under this initiative, my Department collects and evaluates in-patient waiting list figures on a quarterly basis. There is no corresponding dedicated funding line in the case of out-patient services and, as a result, my Department does not collect or publish information, nationally, on out-patient waiting lists. The management and monitoring of the out-patient waiting lists is a matter for the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access <Col N="225" /> for public patients. It outlines measures which are designed to address the issue of efficiency in the delivery of out-patient services. Protocols for investigation and referral to hospital out-patient departments will be developed in conjunction with general practitioners. Nurse-led clinics for selected conditions will be introduced where feasible. I am confident that these measures will result in an improved service for out-patients in public hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The proposals to be put to the people in the forthcoming referendum represent the culmination of a detailed process of consideration and consultation over a four year period. In the first instance the Government decided in 1997 that a Green Paper on Abortion would be prepared. This document was published in September 1999 and was welcomed by many interests as a clear and balanced document, setting out as it did the history of the issues and the different arguments advanced, and discussing the principal constitutional and legislative options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government referred the Green Paper to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan. The all-party committee embarked on a detailed process of consultation, first seeking submissions on the options discussed in the Green Paper. The committee then held hearings at which the issues were explored in detail with many of those who had made submissions, including representatives of the medical profession and of the churches attending. The Women's Health Council made a submission to the all-party committee and representatives also participated in the hearings subsequently held by the Committee. The committee's detailed report was published in November 2000 and was then examined by the Cabinet com<Col N="226" /> mittee established by the Government to consider the issues.</P>
    <P>It was the task of Government to consider and decide on the appropriate response to the detailed process of consultation and discussion which had preceded the publication of the all-party committee's report. To have engaged in a further round of consultation would not have elucidated matters any further. There was a period of more than two months between the publication of the referendum proposals and the completion of the legislation's passage through the Oireachtas. It would have been open to the council to convey its views on the matter to me during that period but it did not do so.</P>
    <P>The council raised a number of specific issues in its recent public statement. It suggested that the proposed legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy is inconsistent with the WHO definition of health. The WHO definition concerned is couched in non-legal terminology. The proposed legislation deals with the criminal law and as such must be precise as to the meaning of the terms used and their effect.</P>
    <P>The Government has carefully considered the question of whether it is appropriate or feasible to permit legal abortion in the State where there is a threat of suicide. Having considered the evidence available in this regard, and also the testimony and conclusions in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the Government is of the view that these do not support the maintenance of suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland and would not justify the enactment of a legal basis for abortion to avoid such a risk.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee heard a considerable amount of evidence about this issue, and the Government has carefully weighed up the arguments made. Testimony heard by the committee indicates that the appropriate response to a pregnant woman considered to be at risk of committing suicide should be to help and support her and to treat her underlying mental condition &ndash; not to offer her an abortion. The committee also heard expert evidence that there is no test or fail-safe way of saying that a person will or will not commit suicide, and that where suicide occurs it is due to the interaction of multiple factors, rather than just one. The Government has concluded, having considered all of the evidence on this complex matter, that providing an abortion cannot be considered the appropriate response where a pregnant woman threatens suicide.</P>
    <P>The council also raised the question of legalising abortion in cases of rape, incest or where the foetus is non-viable. The question of the appropriate response where pregnancy follows a sexual assault is one which was also discussed at considerable length by the all-party committee. The Government acknowledges that this is a particularly sensitive and difficult issue and it has reflected carefully on the arguments. Having carefully considered the issues, the Government is of the view that it would not be appropriate to <Col N="227" /> provide for legalised abortion where a woman has been the victim of sexual assault.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognises the very sensitive and difficult nature of a pregnancy involving a serious foetal abnormality. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution heard testimony from a number of experts, including the masters of the maternity hospitals, in this regard. The issue was also discussed in the Green Paper on Abortion. It is clear that there would be great difficulty in deciding where the line should be drawn if such a regime were proposed. It is not possible neatly to define conditions incompatible with life and there is a wide spectrum of congenital malformations which cause greatly differing degrees of incapacitation or disability.</P>
    <P>Depending on the condition and the circumstances of a particular case, the period of survival after birth can vary from nil to some hours, several days, weeks or even months. The Government has decided that it would not be feasible to provide in law for a regime where abortion would be permitted in cases of severe foetal abnormality, and to confine such an arrangement only to cases where the child would not survive after birth.</P>
    <P>In relation to the morning-after pill, the legal advice which the Government has received is that its proposals, if passed, will resolve doubts which may exist in relation to the legality of such emergency contraception measures. The envisaged legislation deals with the offence of abortion within this jurisdiction and does not seek to curtail women's rights to avail of services that are legally available in other countries. Section 4(2) of the proposed legislation states that the Act will not operate to restrict any person from travelling to another state on the grounds that his or her intended conduct there would, if it occurred in the State, constitute an offence under section 2 of the Act. This will remove any doubt which may have existed about the right to travel for an abortion, even though it would be illegal to have such an abortion in Ireland. The Government's proposals do not prohibit a health board assisting a young woman in their care from having an abortion, should a rare case such as the C case arise in the future.</P>
    <P>The Act's provisions in relation to approved places are to ensure that women who, during pregnancy, are suffering from a life-threatening medical condition, can receive the most appropriate care, and in the most appropriate facilities.</P>
    <P>The expert medical advice received in the course of preparing this legislation is to the effect that procedures of the type envisaged are not carried out at very short notice. The type of medical condition, such as cancer of the womb, pre-eclampsia or Eisenmenger's syndrome, would have been diagnosed and monitored and managed for a period, before the stage was reached where the question of having to intervene so as to save the woman's life arose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" />Therefore, there would be time for the woman to be treated in the most appropriate facilities, where the highest level of medical care, expertise and other supports are available. The Government considers that it would be undesirable to increase the scope for a medical practitioner to intervene in a place where perhaps the necessary supports and other expert advice would not be available.</P>
    <P>Normal medical practice where certain conditions, such as haemorrhaging, arise during pregnancy, will not be affected by the Act. In such a situation a doctor would act to stabilise the woman's condition, rather than to end the pregnancy and the legal advice to the Government is that the Act will not affect the provision of such medical care.</P>
    <P>The Government does not accept the suggestion that, in enabling the people to have the final say on the proposed legislation, and on any subsequent amendment of it, this could have negative health consequences for some women.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>I established the Forum on Fluoridation in May 2000. The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum held its first meeting in September 2000.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are as follows: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area and to report to the Minister. The forum invited members of the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum's web site (http://www. fluoridationforum.ie), gives details of the forum's progress. The forum was originally to report in September 2001. As a result of foot and mouth disease precautions, the March 2001 meeting was cancelled and consequently, a one month extension was approved to October 2001. I am informed by the chairman of the Forum on Fluoridation that a number of complex issues arose <Col N="229" /> during the finalisation of the report. These caused a further delay due to the additional and unexpected workload involved. Finally, I understand that the report's editor suffered a serious illness over the Christmas period from which he is only now recovering. The chairman of the forum has informed me that he expects to present the forum's report to me in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI).</P>
      <P>The international consensus is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR and autism. The institutions involved include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, the World Health Organisation, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) USA, the American Academy of Paediatrics, and UK professional organisations (the RCGP, the Royal College of Paediatrics, the Faculty of Public Health Medicine, the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society). Most recently, the United States Institute of Medicine also concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism/inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that observations made regarding the onset of autism following the administration of MMR vaccine do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest that the vaccine is the cause. It has also indicated that there has been no new scientific <Col N="230" /> evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the RCPI.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children in its report on childhood immunisation which was published in July 2001, concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>Immunisation uptake rates in respect of the years 1999 and 2000 were 77% and 79% respectively. The most recent MMR uptake figure &ndash; January-September 2001 &ndash; shows that the national MMR uptake rate in children at 24 months has declined to 75%. This falls considerably short of the target figure of 95% uptake which is necessary to generate &lsquo;herd immunity'.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates because of the risk of unimmunised children contacting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and over 1,500 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake. Measles is a highly infectious disease and is not a trivial illness. Approximately one in 15 children with measles suffers serious complications. These include pneumonia, ear infection and, less commonly, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), myocarditis and sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) which may result in permanent brain damage usually occurring many years after infection.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards established a National Immunisation Steering Committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. I expect this report to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>This year, my Department has provided additional funding of &euro;0.662 million to the ERHA for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.405 million was for an orthodontic training programme. Four dentists from the authority commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Furthermore, my Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;2.971million was provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;2.044 million was for an orthodontic initiative in the authority. The chief executive officer of the authority has informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative: two consultant orthodontists, two specialists in orthodontics and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; a six-surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five-surgery unit at the St James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; and three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards.</P>
      <P>The Northern Area Health Board has engaged the services of specialist orthodontic practitioners from outside its own area. The board announced in October 2001 that up to 300 patients from its orthodontic treatment waiting list would be treated under these arrangements, beginning last November.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has further informed me that at the end of the <Col N="232" /> December 2001 quarter, there were 3,776 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority. This is an increase of 488 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the corresponding figure at the end of the September 2001 quarter. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures in the orthodontic initiative take effect.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the concerns expressed by the Adelaide Hospital Society in its public statement regarding the implications for women's health of the Twenty Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 15 February I wrote to the Adelaide Hospital Society in response to its letter 1 February. I indicated that the Government shares the society's concern about the significant number of Irish women who have abortions abroad each year. It acknowledges that a comprehensive range of compassionate, supportive and non-judgmental services is vital to provide women with the supports they need to deal with a crisis pregnancy.</P>
      <P>It is for these reasons that, having considered the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, I have established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which will have the task, in consultation with Government and other statutory and non-statutory agencies, of drawing up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and overseeing its implementation. Funding of &euro;6.5 million, £5.19 million has been allocated to the agency in 2002.</P>
      <P>The prevention of crisis pregnancy in the first instance will be a primary task of the agency. Preventative issues concerning education of young people and adults as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles will be addressed. The agency will work to develop strategies to make women more aware of their options, should they have a crisis pregnancy, and to improve the supports and assistance available to women in this situation so that they will feel that they have genuine alternatives to abortion.</P>
      <P>Women who have had an abortion, either recently or some time ago, have particular needs also and this is another area the agency is being asked to address so that women are treated with compassion and understanding and that their emotional and physical health needs are attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is intended to play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services. The Government hopes that, over time, it will be possible to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and ensure that women who find them<Col N="233" /> selves in this situation will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them to deal with their situation.</P>
    <P>Abortion is already a crime under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, with a penalty up to life imprisonment for a breach of the Act. The maximum penalty under the Act envisaged in the referendum proposals therefore represents a reduction on that currently in force. The envisaged legislation deals with the offence of abortion within this jurisdiction and does not seek to curtail women's rights to avail of services which are legally available in other countries.</P>
    <P>Section 4(2) of the proposed legislation states that the Act will not operate to restrict any person from travelling to another state on the grounds that his or her intended conduct there would, if it occurred in the State, constitute an offence under section 2 of the Act. This will remove any doubt which may have existed about the right to travel for an abortion, even though it would be illegal to have such an abortion in Ireland. The Government's proposals do not prohibit a health board assisting a young woman in it care from having an abortion, should a rare case such as the C case arise in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government has carefully considered the question of whether it is appropriate or feasible to permit legal abortion in the State where there is a threat of suicide. Having considered the evidence available in this regard and also the testimony and conclusions in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, it is of the view that these do not support the maintenance of suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland and would not justify the enactment of a legal basis for abortion to avoid such a risk.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee heard a considerable amount of evidence about this issue and the Government has carefully weighed up the arguments made. Testimony heard by the committee indicates that the appropriate response to a pregnant woman considered to be at risk of committing suicide should be to help and support her and to treat her underlying mental condition &ndash; not to offer her an abortion. The committee also heard expert evidence that there is no test or fail-safe way of saying that a person will or will not commit suicide, and that where suicide occurs it is due to the interaction of multiple factors, rather than just one. The Government has concluded, having considered all of the evidence on this complex matter, that providing an abortion cannot be considered the appropriate response where a pregnant woman threatens suicide.</P>
    <P>The question of the appropriate response where pregnancy follows a sexual assault is one which was also discussed at considerable length by the all-party committee. The Government acknowledges that this is a particularly sensitive and difficult issue and has reflected carefully on the arguments. Having carefully considered the issues, the Government is of the view that it would not be appropriate to provide for legalised <Col N="234" /> abortion where a woman has been the victim of sexual assault.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the very sensitive and difficult nature of a pregnancy involving a serious foetal abnormality. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution heard testimony from a number of experts, including the masters of the maternity hospitals, in this regard. The issue was also discussed in the Green Paper on Abortion. It is clear that there would be great difficulty in deciding where the line should be drawn if such a regime were proposed. It is not possible neatly to define conditions incompatible with life and there is a wide spectrum of congenital malformations which cause greatly differing degrees of incapacitation or handicap.</P>
    <P>Depending on the condition and the circumstances of a particular case, the period of survival after birth can vary from nil to some hours, several days, weeks or even months. The Government has decided that it would not be feasible to provide in law for a regime where abortion would be permitted in cases of severe foetal abnormality, and to confine such an arrangement only to cases where the child would not survive after birth.</P>
    <P>The Act lays down conditions to be met so that women who, during pregnancy are suffering from a life-threatening medical condition, can receive the most appropriate care and in the most appropriate facilities.</P>
    <P>The expert medical advice received in the course of preparing this legislation is to the effect that procedures of the type envisaged are not carried out at very short notice. The type of medical condition such as cancer of the womb, pre-eclampsia or Eisenmenger's syndrome would have been diagnosed and monitored and managed for a period before the stage was reached where the question of having to intervene so as to save the woman's life arose.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there would be time for the woman to be treated in the most appropriate facilities where the highest level of medical care, expertise and other supports are available. The Government considers that it would be undesirable to increase the scope for a medical practitioner to intervene in a place where perhaps the necessary supports and other expert advice would not be available.</P>
    <P>Normal medical practice where certain conditions, such as haemorrhaging, arise during pregnancy will not be affected by the Act. In such a situation a doctor would act to stabilise the woman's condition rather than to end the pregnancy and the legal advice to the Government is that the Act will not affect the provision of such medical care.</P>
    <P>The envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act will be capable of amendment in the same way as any other piece of legislation. However because of the provisions of the proposed Article 40.3.5 of the Constitution, any amendment would have to be approved by the people in a referendum before it could be prom<Col N="235" /> ulgated as a law. The Government is of the view that on such an important issue as the protection of unborn human life the people have the right to be consulted on any change in the law which may be proposed in the future.</P>
    <P>The legal advice which the Government has received is that its proposals, if passed, will resolve any doubts which may exist in relation to the legality of emergency contraception such as the morning after pill.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals are not intended to address issues in the area of assisted human reproduction. In February 2000, I established a commission on assisted human reproduction with the following terms of reference, &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am aware of the survey carried out by the Institute of Community Health Nursing which showed that 89.5% of respondents favoured the retention of the midwifery qualification as a mandatory requirement for entry into public health nursing. However, I am also aware that the response rate for the survey was 35% and that the survey population was larger than the number of public health nurses currently working in the public health services.</P>
      <P>My Department's chief nursing officer has written to the institute seeking a copy of the questionnaire and guidelines which were forwarded to public health nurses. The chief nursing officer has also asked for a critique of the research study and findings, or if no such critique is available, permission to have a critique of the study carried out in the Department of Health and Children. A reply is awaited.</P>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the Government's commitment to the full implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. The commission recommended that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the range of services offered by public health nurses and the on-going development of nursing and midwifery services in the community, registration as a midwife should no longer be a mandatory requirement for entry to the higher diploma in public health nursing <Col N="236" /> or registration as a public health nurse. An alternative education programme relating more closely to the core generic maternal and child care service requirements of public health nursing should replace the mandatory midwifery requirement.</P>
    <P>The commission went on to recommend that An Bord Altranais &ldquo;establish a working party composed of PHNs, health service providers and nurse educators to determine the content and duration of a course in maternal and child health as an alternative to the mandatory midwifery qualification.&rdquo; Following its meeting in January 2002, An Bord Altranais established such a working party as recommended by the Commission on Nursing. The working party is scheduled to report by June 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the increasing number of reported cases of sexually transmitted infections, STIs, in recent years. The national health promotion strategy 2000 to 2005 made a commitment to promoting sexual health and to support education programmes in the areas of human sexuality, relationships, reproductive health and contraception. My Department continues to endorse the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programmes in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other effective approaches to raising awareness about positive sexual health undertaken by my Department include the &ldquo;Convenience Advertising&rdquo; campaign. This campaign disseminates messages in a range of public places such as third level colleges, health centres and leisure and entertainment facilities. By targeting venues which have a particular customer profile, a message can be directed to a tightly defined audience <Col N="237" /> and is particularly valuable in reaching groups which may be normally hard to access.</P>
    <P>The ERHA report is a welcome one and makes recommendations for the future delivery of STI services in the eastern region. Additional funding has been provided each year to the ERHA to develop STI and HIV-AIDS services. There are currently five consultants specialising in STIs working in the Dublin area.

      <P>The primary care strategy document acknowledges that primary care is the appropriate setting to meet 90% to 95% of health and personal social service needs. Accordingly, the strategy sets out a plan to achieve equity of access and outcomes for all regardless of means or location, but it is to be a staged implementation process in co-operation and partnership with relevant stakeholders.</P>
      <P>Figures available to my Department, as prepared by the GMS (Payments) Board, suggest that the net extra estimated costs of extending free general practitioner service and other attendant medical card benefits to all non-eligible GMS persons would be &euro;1,185 million. This estimate is based on existing capitation rates and does not take account of any possible premiums that might be sought by doctors in respect of high usage groups. Also, no account is taken of the loss to the Exchequer of income generated by the health levy which, at present, is not paid by persons with full eligibility.</P>

      <P>In 1994 my Department issued a health services waste policy to all health boards and acute voluntary hospitals. The policy advocated good environmental and health and safety practices in the management, handling and disposal of all <Col N="238" /> wastes generated in hospitals. A national contract has been in operation for the last two years for the collection and treatment of health care risk waste by alternative technology. All acute hospitals now have their health care risk waste treated and disposed of in this manner. The non-risk hospital waste, which is largely domestic in nature, is disposed of by the municipal or commercial waste disposal route. A further guidance document was issued in 1999 on the segregation, packaging and storage of health care risk waste. This latter document is being updated currently in the light of recent regulatory changes relating to the transportation and carriage of such materials. The guidelines will be reissued as soon as the changes have been effected.</P>

      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards, who enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service. The objective of the programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95%. The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Provisional data provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre indicates that immunisation uptake for the period 1 January to 30 September 2001 is as follows: DTaP/DT&ndash;85%; Hib&ndash;84%; Polio&ndash;85%; MMR&ndash;75%. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of unimmunised children contacting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and over 1,500 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The steering committee was assisted by four working groups, which examined the following areas in relation to immunisation, communication, material management, IT systems and <Col N="239" /> planning and organisation. I understand that this report will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>On a positive note, since the introduction of the national immunisation programme against group C meningococcal disease there has been a dramatic reduction in this disease in Ireland. Provisional data provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre indicates that in 2001, 35 cases of group C disease have been notified compared to 139 cases in 2000, a reduction of 75%. The most dramatic reductions were seen in the age groups targeted by the meningitis C vaccine, ranging from a 93% reduction in five year olds to nine year olds to a 70% reduction in the ten year old to 14 year old age group. This represents a very significant reduction and highlights the importance and success of the campaign.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>I established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency on 2 October 2001 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961. I subsequently appointed the board of the agency, with Ms Olive Braiden as chairperson. Two staff have been seconded from my Department to enable the agency to become operational as soon as possible. Premises in Capel Street, Dublin 1 have been acquired by the agency and have been fitted out and equipped. The agency moved into these offices on 9 January.</P>
      <P>The agency has informed me that its first priority is the recruitment of key staff. The position of director was recently advertised and the closing date for applications was Friday, 15 February. Three managers will be recruited to enable the agency to fulfil the functions required of it under its establishment order. The process for the recruitment of these staff will be beginning shortly. When these staff are in place the agency intends to conduct a wide-ranging process of consultation leading to the drafting of a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to a recent survey carried out by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This survey was undertaken to determine the level of genetically modified, GM, content in dried soy products, soy substitutes for dairy products and soy infant formulae to ensure that industry is adhering to food labelling regulations.</P>
      <P>The results of this survey reveal that though 18 of the 37 samples tested were found to have GM ingredients, all were under the threshold of 1% that triggers mandatory GM labelling and those identified were derived from an EU authorised GM soybean. EU labelling regulations relating to GM foods require that food containing genetically modified ingredients above the 1% threshold, must have clear labelling to indicate that it contains GM ingredients. Six of the 18 samples that tested positive for GM ingredients were mislabelled; five indicated they contained no GM ingredients and one was labelled as organic. Under current European legislation, for a food to be labelled as organic or GM free it must not contain any GM ingredients. The FSAI has advised that there are no known health implications arising from the presence of the GM ingredients identified in these products.</P>
      <P>EU legislation governing the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs is clear in its stipulation that food labels must not mislead the public on the composition or production methods of a food or make false claims as to the properties of a food.</P>
      <P>The FSAI has contacted the retailers, suppliers and manufacturers whose products were included in the survey to inform them of the test results and to ensure their future compliance with labelling regulations. This survey and others planned for the future will ensure that only EU licensed GM foods are available in Ireland and that such foods display the appropriate labelling information.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Life expectancy at birth has increased substantially for Irish men and women over the past four decades though it is still poorer for men. At the same time life expectancy in Europe has <Col N="243" /> increased at a faster rate. Life expectancy in Ireland is lower than the EU average because Ireland has a high rate of premature mortality, that is, mortality of people aged under 65 years, when compared with our EU neighbours. Approximately one-fifth of all deaths in Ireland are in people aged under 65 years of age. Cancer, cardiovascular disease and accidents account for the majority of these deaths. Many of these are preventable.</P>
      <P>Health status and mortality rates are influenced by several factors. These include people's natural endowment, the physical and emotional nurturing they receive, the lifestyle they adopt, the degree to which the health services and the wider environment support and complement their attempts to prevent disease and to improve their health as well as the access they have to quality health and personal social services in times of need.</P>
      <P>The national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, recognises that to improve life expectancy and health status generally, it is necessary to address the many factors which influence health. The strategy sets out a programme of investment and reform that will stretch over the next decade. The first goal of the health strategy is better health for everyone. Key objectives under this goal are: the health of the population is at the centre of public policy; the promotion of health and well-being is intensified; health inequalities are reduced; and specific quality of life issues are targeted.</P>
      <P>The action plan accompanying the strategy includes a wide range of actions which will address health status and life expectancy issues. These include the following: health impact assessment will be introduced as part of the public policy process; statements of strategy and business plans of all relevant Departments will incorporate an explicit commitment to sustaining and improving health status; the national environment and health action plan will be prepared; a population health division will be established in the Department of Health and Children; a population health function will be established in each health board; actions on major lifestyle factors targeted in the national cancer, cardiovascular and health promotion strategies will be enhanced; a national injury prevention strategy to co-ordinate action on injury prevention will be prepared; a programme of actions will be implemented to achieve national anti-poverty strategy and health targets for the reduction of health inequalities; and publication of a national health information strategy, the preparation of which is at an advanced stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy acknowledges the central role of primary care in the future development of the health services. A major refocus on primary care services is marked by the introduction of a new model of primary care involving a core interdisciplinary primary care team which will work with a wider network of health and social care pro<Col N="244" /> fessionals and will offer 24 hour cover. A task force to drive the implementation of this new model is currently being established. The 15 million to 16 million visits by people to GPs each year as well as the contacts with a range of other primary care staff provide considerable opportunities for prevention of premature mortality by supporting people in their own self care; through other health promotion-prevention work; by early identification of illness and appropriate referral to hospital services. To increase people's timely access to hospital treatment the health strategy envisages the provision of 3,000 additional acute hospital beds by 2011. Commissioning is to begin immediately of 709 of these beds for public patients. Funding has been provided for the contracting of 200 beds from private hospitals for the treatment of public patients, with the objective of reducing waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>As the main causes of premature deaths and therefore of lower life expectancy, cardiovascular disease, cancer and accidents are identified as requiring special attention if we are to achieve our national objective of moving over a period of time to the higher levels of life expectancy which are enjoyed by our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>Cardiovascular diseases cause over 40% of all mortality in Ireland. Premature death rates from cardiovascular diseases in Ireland are significantly higher than the EU average and contribute to Ireland having a lower life expectancy than the EU average. In the first three years of an investment programme following on the adoption of the cardiovascular health strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts launched by the Taoiseach in late 1999, a total of &euro;45.71 million, revenue, has been allocated to fund the strategy. The medium-term objective of the strategy is to bring Irish levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. The longer term goal is to reduce Irish rates to those of the best performers in the EU. Building Healthier Hearts, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy set a target of reducing the proportion of deaths from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15%. Since the launch of the strategy, over &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. This includes the provision of &euro;23.5 million which was allocated between all health boards from national cancer strategy funding this year for the continuing development of oncology/haematology services, funding for oncology drug treatments and the continuing development of symptomatic breast disease services. Among other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 64 additional consultant posts in key areas of medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology together with support staff.</P>
    <P>In the context of the national health strategy, my Department will continue to be advised by <Col N="245" /> the National Cancer Forum in relation to the planning, development and implementation of cancer services for the country. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of 2002 of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. This plan will be prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The national health promotion strategy 2000-2005 focuses on three key areas in health promotion, policy development and implementation, programme development and implementation and re-orientation of the health services. The strategy addresses the needs of individuals, communities and key population groups and outlines an action programme aimed at maximising the health of the population with a view to increasing the opportunities for attaining and sustaining health in a manner that is compatible with the broadest aspirations for positive health and well-being.</P>
    <P>This year the Government is investing over &euro;8 billion, £6.4 billion, in the health services. This represents an overall increase for the health services since this Government came to power in 1997 of 124%. The &euro;2.539 billion, £2 billion, at 2000 prices earmarked in the NDP for health capital for the seven year period 2000-06 represents the largest capital investment programme ever undertaken in the health sector. This investment will provide a physical infrastructure to underpin a public health service characterised by ongoing improvements in quality and accessibility and will also be an ingredient in improving life expectancy in our society.</P>
    <P>The above mentioned strategies, and in particular the overarching framework provided by the new national health strategy, together with this Government's programme of investment, will continue to contribute to the improvements in life expectancy that have been taking place in our society.</P>

      <P>The number of births in the eastern region has increased from 20,646 births in 1996 to 22,813 in the 2000 with a further increase expected in 2001. A further contributory factor to the current pressures is the level of referrals from outside the regions. The ERHA advises that 10% of the workload in the Dublin hospitals relates to women from outside the region. The ERHA has recommended to the Dublin maternity hospitals that, in general, referrals from outside the region should be based on an assessment by a consultant in the woman's own region that such a referral is warranted on clinical grounds. The ERHA is also contacting other health boards with a view to facilitating women to access maternity services in their local areas in keeping with a policy of regional self-sufficiency. However, services will continue to be provided to patients living outside the region who require access to specialised obstetric services. The ERHA has also set up a working group with the three maternity hospitals to develop proposals for immediate, medium and long-term solutions to the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I established a special forum in October last to examine the difficulties experienced by the three Dublin maternity hospitals in recruiting and retaining midwives. The forum made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the relative attractiveness of working in these hospitals through introduction of better career opportunities and significantly enhanced support for those who take up appointment. These recommendations have been considered by my Department, having regard to the pressures on the hospitals and the cost and other implications of the measures proposed.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared to sanction the proposed upgradings and new clinical support posts as follows: introduction of shift leaders in each of the larger in-patient clinical areas within the hospitals; upgrading of experienced clinical midwife managers 2 in the labour-delivery suite in each of the three hospitals to clinical midwife manager 3 level; and the introduction of a midwifery practice development co-ordinator, assistant matron level, and clinical skills facilitator, CMM2 level, posts at each of the three hospitals in order to provide additional support to student midwives and newly qualified midwives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" />In addition, I wrote to the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery requesting that a review of the criteria for the establishment of clinical midwife specialist positions be carried out. It is my intention to make the council's report in the matter available to all interested parties, as recommended by the forum.</P>
    <P>However, my Department is not in a position to sanction the recommendation that full salary be paid to general nurses undertaking midwifery education. At present, a nurse is paid on the first point of the staff nurse scale for the two year duration of the midwifery education programme. Under the forum's proposal, the nurse would retain her existing pay and receive an increment during the second year of training. This is because this measure cannot be confined to the three Dublin maternity hospitals. It should be noted that the present position is a substantial improvement on the situation which existed before the academic year 2000 to 2001 when I increased the student midwife rate by 9.75%. At the same time, I made provision for the refund of fees to student midwives. My officials will be in contact with the Eastern Regional Health Authority shortly to confirm the position in relation to these recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised by the ERHA that a study was commissioned in 2001 to project the number of births over the period 2000 to 2016 for the greater Dublin area, which includes Counties Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Meath. The findings of the report, which will form an important part of the planning process for the future development of maternity services in the eastern region, indicate that a short-term rise in birth numbers was predicted up to 2004 with a subsequent decline for future years.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Deputy that capital developments have been planned for the three Dublin maternity hospitals with some funding set out in the national development plan for each hospital. I have been advised by the ERHA that a &euro;10 million development plan is currently under construction at the Rotunda Hospital. These works include the amalgamation of the paediatric unit with the neonatal intensive care unit and the refurbishment of post-natal accommodation. The National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street has developed proposals for a major hospital development. In the short-term, the hospital has proposed an expansion of 12 beds which is under consideration by the ERHA. With regard to the Coombe Women's Hospital, I have been advised by the ERHA that approval is imminent to establish a design team to enhance the facilities at the hospital. Some 15 extra beds will be provided in the upgraded and expanded services planned in this development.</P>
    <P>Based on the workload projections, planned enhancement of the facilities together with the range of initiatives already outlined, it is expected that the three Dublin maternity hospitals will be <Col N="248" /> in a position to cope with anticipated demand. I can assure the Deputy that the provision of a comprehensive, safe and high-quality obstetric service for the eastern region will continue to be of the utmost priority.</P>

      <Quest>if it is intended to raise the income guidelines for medical cards, in view of the fact that some social welfare recipients are over the limit; if it is intended to restore parity between social welfare levels and income guidelines for medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The Deputy is no doubt aware that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as the carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy launched by the Government late last year. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to last year's extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low <Col N="249" /> incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This Government's commitment to extending medical card coverage should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasises on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society.</P>
    <P>A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including many of the recommendations drawn directly from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, such as streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. During 2002, the Government's priorities for improving the health system will include: 709 additional acute public hospital beds and 200 beds contracted from the private sector; addressing waiting times through a new treatment purchase fund and maintaining investment levels in the general programme to reduce waiting lists; commencing implementation of the new model of primary care; services for people with a disability; and services for older people.</P>
    <P>My Department has advised the health board chief executive officers in writing last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget. In addition, the chief executive officers have been asked that every effort be made to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card. In response, the chief executive officers have indicated that they are currently reviewing the guidelines used to assess applications for medical cards.</P>

      <Col N="250" />The provisions of the disabled persons grant scheme, which enables housing modifications to be made to the homes of disabled people, are entirely a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and such grants are administered through the relevant local authority. Use of health board staff, that is, occupational therapists, to provide assessments for this scheme is a matter for discussion between the relevant local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>The special housing aid scheme for the elderly is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and its basic objective is to make the houses of older people more habitable. It is administered in a flexible manner. If there are delays in having work carried out due to lack of funding, the matter would have to be considered, in the first instance, by the funding Department, namely, the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of assisting older people to live at home, my Department has provided considerable funding to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority over the past three or four years to improve community based services through the employment of additional home helps and nurses-care attendants, together with the provision of additional day care places.</P>

      <P>The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, launched in July 1999, sets out the blueprint for tackling heart disease in Ireland in the long-term. The overall aims include: reducing the risk factor profile in the general popu<Col N="251" /> lation; detecting those at high risk; dealing effectively with those who have clinical disease, and ensuring the best survival and quality of life outcome for those who recover from an acute attack.</P>
      <P>To date a total of &euro;46.71 million has been allocated to the funding of the implementation of the strategy. Almost 300 additional posts were filled by the end of 2000 while a further 500 were planned for 2001. These include health promotion officers to provide guidance on smoking cessation, nutrition and physical activity across a range of settings; community and hospital nutritionists; nursing staff in the community and hospitals; technicians essential to the diagnostic service, and cardiac rehabilitation staff including co-ordinators and physiotherapists.</P>
      <P>With regard to progress to date on health promotion, a national media campaign Ireland needs a Change of Heart, which includes an all island physical activity campaign, Get a Life, Get Active and other health promotion campaigns such as NICO, an anti-smoking initiative, were developed and launched. On 28 February 2001, I announced Government approval for the drafting of a public health and tobacco Bill to give effect to the proposals in the policy document Towards a Tobacco Free Society. At regional level, a broad range of service developments and initiatives occurred in the areas of smoking cessation, nutrition, physical activity and dissemination of good practice.</P>
      <P>With regard to primary care, there was the introduction of nicotine replacement therapy to GMS patients from April 2001. From the launch of nicotine replacement therapy to November 2001, 33,289 prescriptions have been issued to medical card holders at a total cost of &euro;1 million. Discussions on the implementation of the pilot phase of the programme for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in general practice with all stakeholders are now at an advanced stage. It is hoped that agreement will be reached shortly. At regional level, funding has been used for the purchase of training equipment, defibrillators and ECG transmission equipment, and training has been provided for general practitioners, practice nurses and other community based staff on areas such as brief intervention techniques for patient counselling, information technology and life support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national ambulance advisory council has been replaced, on a statutory basis, by the Pre-hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, while significant investment in cardiac equipment for use in ambulances was completed. A joint working group, chaired by Comhairle na nOspidéal, produced an interim report in May 2001 on additional consultant cardiologist requirements for 2002. The final report is expected during 2002. Specific developments in hospital services included extension of the catheterisation laboratory in Cork University Hospital; a pacemaker service in the South-Eastern Health Board region; angioplasty services in the Mid-Western Health Board and provision of diagnostic coron<Col N="252" /> ary angiography at Sligo General Hospital on a sessional basis. Chest pain assessment facilities were considerably enhanced in the ERHA region.</P>
    <P>With regard to cardiac rehabilitation, all boards have begun developing cardiac rehabilitation in acute hospitals. A national steering committee to develop a hospital based heart attack register, coronary heart attack Ireland register or CHAIR, was established on 14 October 2001. As part of the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy, &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;, a pilot project of CHAIR has been set up in the Southern Health Board region. It is envisaged that the pilot will run for one year and following its evaluation a hospital based heart attack register will be established nationally. The rate of premature death from heart disease in Ireland is significantly higher than the EU average. Through the implementation of the strategy, the objective is to reduce Ireland's levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease to the EU average in the medium term and, in the long-term, to reduce our rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>
    <P>Major developments in the treatment and care of patients with cancer have taken place since the launch in November 1996 of the national cancer strategy. Since 1997, more than £103 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. This includes the provision of £23.5 million which was allocated between all health boards from national cancer strategy funding this year for the continuing development of oncology-haematology services, funding for oncology drug treatments and the continuing development of symptomatic breast disease services. This level of funding far exceeds the £25 million that was initially envisaged in 1996 and is a clear indication of this Government's continued commitment to the development of co-ordinated and patient focused cancer treatment in line with the recommendations of the national cancer strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 64 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.</P>
    <P>Funding of £5.22 million was provided in 2001 to enable health boards to commence the development of centres of excellence for the care and treatment of symptomatic breast disease. To date, approval has been given for eight new consultant surgeon posts with a special interest in breast surgery. In 2000, national screening programmes for both breast and cervical cancer were initiated on a phased basis and both BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, and the national cervical screening programme are currently in discussion with health boards concerning expansion of the programmes nationwide. The importance of screening programmes that are underpinned by international quality assurance criteria and best practice is a key objective and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate <Col N="253" /> the process of planning and organising the roll-out of these programmes countrywide.</P>
    <P>Regional directors of cancer services are in place in each of the health boards to oversee and co-ordinate the development of cancer services in their respective areas in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards. These posts are proving to be of great benefit in assisting in the development of appropriate future cancer services. In October 1999, health Ministers from Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United States signed an historic memorandum of understanding that establishes an Ireland-Northern Ireland national cancer institute cancer consortium. Under this initiative, a research programme has been launched which will allow Irish hospitals to participate in high quality clinical trials of new therapies for cancer, helping to ensure that new and effective treatments are made available more quickly as a result of these awards.</P>
    <P>These actions have been complemented by initiatives in the field of health promotion. The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives that have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. These include mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The unit also provides funding to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives, including the yearly Europe Against Cancer campaign.</P>
    <P>Under the national cancer strategy, the national cancer forum was established to advise on appropriate developments and structures in the area of cancer. The term of office of the first forum expired in 2000 and I subsequently appointed Professor Paul Redmond as chairman of the second national cancer forum. The forum is representative of the medical, palliative and the voluntary organisations involved in cancer services and continues to play an important role in the provision of quality services to people with cancer. In the context of the national health strategy, I will continue to be advised by the national cancer forum in relation to the planning, development and implementation of cancer services for the country. It is currently examining a number of issues of tremendous importance to the effective progression of the development of cancer services in this country. Areas such as protocols for the care and treatment of cancer patients, information requirements, audit and evaluation of our services, genetics issues and further screening programmes are all important component parts of the appropriate future development of cancer service, and the forum, as the established expert advisory body, will report to me on these issues.</P>
    <P>This Government is constantly striving to provide the best and most appropriate cancer services for the country. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of 2002 of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. <Col N="254" /> This plan will be prepared by my Department in conjunction with the national cancer forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert group on radiotherapy services.</P>
    <P>In terms of directing the way in which investment takes place, ensuring integration of services and that the objectives of the cancer strategy are realised, the health strategy provides a significant opportunity for the forum to shape its work. It is also intended that the national cancer forum will work with the national hospitals agency and the health information and quality authority to ensure service quality, accessibility and responsiveness.</P>

The strategy contains a number of strategic aims and identifies a range of objectives which are required to enhance the promotion of men's health.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service, such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the post-graduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 mill<Col N="256" /> ion was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year, of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative. Two consultant orthodontists, five specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited. A six surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational. Three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year. The chief executive officers of the health boards have also informed me that the number of patients awaiting orthodontic treatment fell by 1,613 between June and December 2001. They further informed me that there was a reduction of 1,133 patients awaiting assessment for the same period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to supporting the establishment of a lung transplant facility in Ireland and to ensuring that the programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung and heart-lung transplantation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" />The Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. The provision of a transplant unit forms part of a major capital development at the Mater Hospital. An expert consultative group, which includes representatives of the Mater Hospital and the Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to advise on the development of the programme. The report of the consultative group has recently been received and is being considered by my Department. A letter issued on 14 February to the director of planning and commissioning in the ERHA with a view to arranging a meeting later this month with representatives of the consultative group so that the matter may be progressed.</P>
    <P>Pending the establishment of an Irish based programme, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant.</P>

      <P>The report of the ombudsman on the nursing home subvention scheme raised certain questions about older persons' entitlement to services. The ombudsman outlined his interpretation of the Health Act, 1970 which is that any person in need of nursing home care has a statutory entitlement to the provision of that service by a health board. My Department's position, based on legal advice which it received, is at variance with the view expressed by the ombudsman. What is clear is that the uncertainty that undoubtedly exists in relation to eligibility and entitlement should be resolved. The new health strategy acknowledges this and sets down a commitment to introduce new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement. In addition, proposals on the financing of long-term care for older people will be brought forward.</P>

      <P>The current funding system together with alternative funding mechanisms were examined in the context of the value for money, VFM, audit of the health services carried out by consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche. The consultants, working with the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children, carried out inten<Col N="258" /> sive consultations with health boards, voluntary hospitals, staff organisations, etc.</P>
      <P>As part of the audit, a detailed examination was carried out of the funding of health care internationally, the methods of raising revenue and the effect on different parts of the health care system. The consultants found that in insurance based systems, demand is not well managed and expenditure is not well contained and concluded that:</P>
      <P>A new financing mechanism may address certain deficiencies, but create others. Changing the financing mechanism does not, in itself, necessarily improve health service delivery. Change should only be undertaken when the complex interrelationships between financing, cost access and delivery are assessed in detail.</P>
      <P>The work of the consultants informed the considerations given to the new health strategy. It was seen as one of the key documents supporting the work on that strategy together with the primary care model and the review of bed capacity.</P>
      <P>The health strategy notes that throughout the world, there is a variety of methods used for raising and allocating the funds required by health systems. In many cases, what appear to be simple models can in fact be much more complicated, with items such as co-payments not being immediately obvious. Similarly, systems have generally evolved over a considerable period and reflect distinct administrative, political and economic traditions. This said, there are some common factors which can be seen in all systems, such as the presence of an element of private finance. Similarly, there are some problems, such as waiting lists, which can occur across widely different systems.</P>
      <P>During the preparation of the health strategy, considerable analysis was carried out on the most appropriate method of funding the Irish health system. In particular, the relative merits of social insurance, private insurance and tax based systems were carefully examined. In social insurance systems, the bulk of health care funding is financed separately from general taxation. Contributions are made into a sickness fund or set of competing funds, usually by employers and employees, with the government sometimes topping up contributions. Those who advocate such systems claim that they give stability through ring-fencing funding and promote both equitable access and responsiveness. In response, the critique of such systems is that they undermine reasonable cost control, involve significantly higher administrative and transaction costs and prevent integrated service planning. The strategy also noted that many social insurance systems require top-up payments from the Exchequer and are not in fact separate from general taxation. Therefore, they may not achieve the objective of stability through ring-fencing funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy concluded that &ldquo;the present centrally funded tax-based system of <Col N="259" /> funding, complemented as at present by private health insurance will be retained&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there have been any cases, other than the X and the C cases, where the issue of abortion has arisen in Ireland in recent years.</P>
      <P>The legislation envisaged under the referendum proposal is intended to remove any doubt there may be about the legality of treatment which doctors may consider necessary where some women, during pregnancy, are suffering from certain rare, life threatening medical conditions. It will provide certainty for doctors who may have feared that some interventions, although accepted medical practice in such situations, might nonetheless be unlawful. The proposal seeks to ensure the protection during pregnancy of the lives of women and the developing human life within a mother's womb.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposed Act will be that a threat of suicide will no longer be a ground for legal abortion in the State. The Government believes that the evidence considered in the preparation of the Green Paper on abortion and also the testimony and conclusions in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, do not support the maintenance of suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland and would not justify the enactment of a legal basis for abortion to avoid such a risk.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has overall responsibility for prison health care policy. However, my Department and health boards assist and support the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the delivery of health services to prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department was represented on the group that reviewed the structure and organisation of prison health care services and published its report in May 2001. The group endorsed the concept that there should be equivalence of care between the prison population and the general <Col N="260" /> population and made a number of recommendations in order to achieve this goal.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Irish Prisons Service is in consultation with a number of agencies, including my Department and health boards, in order to implement these recommendations. The national health strategy also endorsed the report and I can assure the Deputy that my Department and health boards will work in partnership with colleagues in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and with the Irish Prisons Service to ensure that services are developed and delivered in an equitable fashion to all persons, whether they are inside or out of prison.</P>
    <P>A good model of such partnership is the development of drug treatment services in prisons. A formal partnership has been set up between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and five major Dublin based prisons. A co-ordinator has just been appointed by the authority, who will be based in the Irish Prisons Service, and will ensure that there is a continuum of treatment and care for drug misusers, both in prison and in the community on release.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs was conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review, which was published on 16 January 2002, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the publication of the review, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds, of which 335 are in the eastern region. These additional beds include 70 beds at St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, and 42 beds at St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire. Both were formerly private hospitals and control of them has now transferred to the public system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the national review of bed capacity, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, prepared a comprehensive needs assessment, indicating a requirement for 1,276 additional acute beds by 2011 to meet increasing demands in the region. The objective of the ERHA review was to determine the number of additional acute beds required within the eastern region having <Col N="261" /> regard to good standards of efficiency, population characteristics and medical-healthcare developments.</P>
    <P>I also invited the ERHA and the health boards to submit proposals on measures which could be put in place in the short-term to bring additional bed capacity into the acute hospital system. In this regard, the ERHA submitted proposals to my Department which identified potential to increase the acute hospital bed complement in the region by 325 beds and ten extra day care places by 2003. I was pleased to allocate revenue funding of £3 million to the ERHA in May 2001 to support the initiatives proposed. This funding was utilised by the ERHA to fund the early commissioning of 53 additional beds and to support a number of initiatives aimed at alleviating pressure on A&amp;E departments and improving patient services.</P>
    <P>Additional proposals identified by the ERHA are being examined by my Department and will be considered in the context of available funding and other competing demands.</P>

      <P>In December last year, the St. Paul Insurance Company announced its withdrawal from the provision of medical malpractice insurance cover. This decision affects the company's operations worldwide. Non-consultant hospital doctors have been covered under the medical indemnity scheme by the company since July 1997. The existing policy will expire on 30 June and will not be renewed or extended.</P>
      <P>Preparations are at an advanced stage on the introduction of the new clinical negligence scheme, based on the principle of enterprise liability, from 1 July.

There is no need for concern on the part of doctors or patients as to the indemnity status of doctors after that date.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal of an insurer of the St. Paul status and reputation is clear evidence of the difficulty being encountered by hospitals and doctors in securing professional liability cover.

      <P>The numbers on waiting lists and the waiting times for cardiac surgery, orthopaedics and ophthalmology for the periods September 1996 and September 2001, in the format collected by my Department, are being provided separately to the Deputy. Some hospitals did not provide details of the procedures to be carried out within the specialties of ophthalmology and orthopaedics. Therefore, the number waiting for cataract operations and hip operations is unavailable to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people on public hospital waiting lists in September 2001, was 26,345. This figure represents an overall decrease of 5,174 or 16% on the comparable figure for September 1996. The number of adults waiting for 12 months and over for cardiac surgery decreased by 92% during the period September 1996 to September 2001, and the number of children waiting for over six months for cardiac surgery fell by 71% in the same period. The <Col N="263" /> number of adults waiting for 12 months and over for orthopaedic operations decreased by 35% during the same period.</P>
    <P>The new health strategy will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists, particularly waiting times. The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. Until these targets are achieved a new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients either in the private sector or, if necessary, abroad.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context, a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospitals agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>When a couple wishes to be considered for suitability for foreign adoption they approach their local health board which then assesses them. Assessments in all health boards are carried out in line with the national standardised framework for assessment for inter-country adoption launched in 1999.</P>
      <P>The standardised framework was developed based on experience in Ireland and best practice internationally. It aims to ensure that at all times in the process the welfare of the child is the primary consideration. At the same time it supports the prospective adoptive parents through preparation and the assessment process. The framework has been welcomed by health boards and couples. Over the past three years additional funding of over &euro;2 million or £1,655,000 has been allocated to inter-country adoption assessment aimed at reducing time spent by couples on waiting lists. There are still difficulties in some health board areas because of the difficulty being experienced in recruiting social workers at present.</P>
      <P>When the assessment stage has been completed the health board makes a recommendation to the Adoption Board. Applications for approval to adopt abroad, as well as a review of such applications, are then dealt with by the Adoption Board which is an independent statutory agency.</P>

      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 October 2001. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>While all sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations-retirement, employers reported that 1,322 vacancies existed at 31 October 2001. These circumstances arise where the volume of additional nursing posts being created outstrips capacity to recruit. The combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime working provides the equivalent of around 1,150 full-time nurses to the service to cope with difficulties arising in the provision of services while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies.</P>
      <P>A major recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million or &euro;6.35 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. In particular a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February 2001. Under the scheme nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</P>
      <P>As part of my overall recruitment-retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses: payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for back-to-practice courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses; financial support to State enrolled nurses working in the health service wishing to undertake nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy problem. A total of 2,576 working visas-work authorisations were issued to nurses from non EU countries between June 2000 and December 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department is also engaged in strategic planning through the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. The focus of this work is on long-term planning. The primary objective of the study is to forecast, as far as is possible, future nursing and midwifery workforce needs. An interim report was published in October 2000 and widely circulated within the health services. The final report is due to be published in April.</P>
      <P>On 1 November 2001, I launched the new four year undergraduate pre-registration nursing degree programme commencing in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" />The new nursing degree programme, to replace the current three year diploma programme, will put the education of nurses on a par with that of other health care professionals. The nursing profession has long been seeking such parity and the Government's decision implements a central recommendation of the Commission on Nursing. Educating nurses to degree level will enable them to develop their clinical skills to a greater extent and to respond to future challenges in health care, for the benefit of patients and client groups.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved a capital building programme totalling £176 million or &euro;223.5 million for the construction of facilities to accommodate nursing students at 13 higher education institutions here. This programme is due to be completed by September 2004.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,640 places nationally will be available annually on the degree programme as follows:</P>

    <P>I also announced a new sponsorship scheme for experienced health care assistants wishing to train as nurses. Up to 40 sponsorships will be available annually. Successful applicants will be allowed to retain their salary during the four years of the degree programme.</P>
    <P>Over a period of 18 months, 66,000 bed days represents only 1% of available bed days within the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>In the Government's recently published review of bed capacity the question of bed days lost owing to bed closures was factored into the calculation of an additional requirement for 3,000 extra beds in the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>In this regard I was pleased to announce last month that additional funding of &euro;65 million is being provided to commission 709 extra beds in public hospitals. As announced in the health strategy, this is the first phase of the provision of 3,000 additional acute hospital beds by 2011. The additional beds represent further tangible evidence of this Government's commitment to investment in the development of additional facilities for the treatment of public patients and to the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>In response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and <Col N="267" /> demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. It concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of speech and language therapists requiring a significant increase in training places.</P>
      <P>The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. To this end, an interagency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the working group. In addition, a concerted overseas recruitment campaign will be initiated shortly on behalf of the health boards for scarce speech and language therapy personnel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4(2) of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act states that the Act will not operate to restrict any person from travelling to another state on the grounds that his or her intended conduct there would, if it occurred in the State, constitute an offence under section 2 of the Act. This is intended to remove any doubt which may have existed about the right to travel for an abortion, even though it would be illegal to have such an abortion here. The Government's proposals do not prohibit a health board assisting a young woman in their care from having an abortion should a rare case such as the C case arise in the future. The circumstances in <Col N="268" /> which the woman became pregnant would not be a factor in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The forum on Dublin maternity hospitals made a number of recommendations to improve the capacity of the hospitals concerned to recruit and retain midwives. These include: (a) introduction of shift leaders, 105 experienced staff midwives to be upgraded to clinical midwife manager in each of the larger in-patient clinical areas within the hospitals; (b) upgrading of experienced clinical midwife managers &ndash; two in the labour-delivery suite in each of the three hospitals to clinical midwife manager three level &ndash; 18 upgradings in all; (c) introduction of midwifery practice development co-ordinator at assistant matron level and clinical skills facilitator posts, CMM2 level, at each of the three hospitals in order to provide additional support to student midwives and newly qualified midwives, a total of six posts and (d) payment of a full salary to general nurses undertaking midwifery education in return for a commitment to work as a midwife with the training hospital for two years following qualification. At present a nurse is paid on the first point of the staff nurse scale for the two year duration of the midwifery education programme. Under the forum's proposal the nurse would retain her existing pay and receive an increment during the second year of training. Another recommendation made by the forum is that a review be carried out by the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery of criteria for the establishment of clinical midwife specialist positions. These recommendations have been considered by my Department having regard to the pressures on the Dublin maternity hospitals and the cost and other implications of the measures proposed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last recommendation, I wrote to the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery last week requesting that a review of the criteria for the establishment of clinical midwife specialist positions be carried out. I asked the council to let me have a report setting out its considered views in the matter as quickly as possible. It is my intention to make this report available to all interested parties, as recommended by the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not in a position to sanction recommendation (d) &ndash; payment of full salary to <Col N="269" /> general nurses undertaking midwifery education. This is because this measure cannot be confined to the three Dublin maternity hospitals. It should be noted that the present position is a substantial improvement on the situation which existed before the academic year 2000-01 when I increased the student midwife rate by 9.75%. At the same time I made provision for the refund of fees to student midwives. These arrangements also applied to student paediatric nurses.</P>
    <P>My Department is prepared to sanction the upgradings referred to at (a) and (b) and new clinical support posts referred to at (c) above. Particular reference will be made to the fact that the three Dublin maternity hospitals are tertiary referral centres, to their acuity levels and the high volume of births in each hospital. My officials will be in contact with the Eastern Regional Health Authority shortly to confirm the position in relation to these recommendations.</P>

      <P>A sum of &euro;1.27 million was provided in 2001 to the WHB for the development of symptomatic breast disease services in line with the recommendations of the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. In November 2001, following extensive consultations with the board, my Department issued financial clearance for the posts of consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast cancer, consultant radiologist with a special interest in breast cancer and consultant histopathologist with a special interest in breast cancer, with sessional splits between University College Hospital Galway and Mayo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I established an expert working group on radiotherapy services to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services here. The work of the group is at an advanced stage. I have been advised that all health boards, including the WHB, are being afforded the opportunity to meet the group. It is not possible to give an exact date for the group's report because of the importance and complexity of its work. However, it is anticipated that its work will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>The Insurance Compensation Fund levy was introduced by the Government on 1 January 1984, following the collapse of PMPA in 1983. The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc, formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc.</P>
      <P>Until December 1991 levies were paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2% of gross premium income. The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992. Some £148 million was collected by way of the levy. This was used to finance the administration of Primor plc. The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government levy, which at present applies to insurance policies, is a general stamp duty, the proceeds of which go to the Exchequer and not to the Insurance Compensation Fund. Therefore, <Col N="272" /> any information in relation to this levy is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Under the regional industrial grant aid rates, approved by the EU Commission on 26 October 1999, the grant aid intensities for new industrial development projects in the Border Midland and Western &ndash; Objective 1 regions are set at 40%, plus a further 15% allowable for small and medium sized enterprises for the period 2000 to 2006. This compares with an aid intensity of just 17.5% plus a further 10% for SMEs in the Dublin area. Additional aid for training and research and development may also be approved. Thus the Objective One status granted to the north-west region, including County Donegal, by the EU allows the State to provide a higher level of support in comparison with other regions of the country.</P>
      <P>The latest CSO live register analysis shows that those claiming unemployment benefits in the north-west region, counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo, fell from 17,822 in March 1997 to 13,347 at the end of 2001, a drop of 25%. To maintain this trend the development agencies continue to be particularly proactive in the region. Letterkenny, Buncrana and other regional centres such as Sligo are significant locations and are drivers for enterprise development in the region.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland, the agency under the aegis of my Department charged with the attraction of overseas industry to Ireland, has committed itself to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. Among the projects secured for the region in recent times are; PacifiCare Health Systems, expansion with an additional 160 jobs; Prudential Insurance Company of America, 300 additional jobs; Sterling Fluid Systems, 16 jobs; Kirchhoff Ireland, expansion with additional 25 jobs; Interventional Technologies, 90 additional jobs in Letterkenny; Claddagh Group, 35 jobs in Buncrana; and Eire Limited, 15 jobs in Ballyshannon. In addition, Abbott Ireland has recently announced two major projects in Donegal town and Sligo creating 190 new jobs. Recently MBNA opened a new office facility in Carrick-on-Shannon. This will create 300 new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, which has responsibility for the development of the indigenous sector, provided funding to its clients to the value of &euro;30,416,941 in the BMW region, &euro;1,831,891 in Donegal in 2000. In 2001 the figures were <Col N="273" />&euro;30,939,907 and &euro;2,872,511, respectively. This funding would, for example, be used for research, development and training projects. The 99 new jobs supported by Donegal County Enterprise Board during 2001 made Donegal the third highest of all counties and represent a 20% increase on the prior base level.</P>
    <P>Forfás, the industrial policy advisory agency under my Department's aegis, has produced a database of the enterprise base, and social and physical infrastructures, of towns in the north-west with populations over 1,500. These profiles are being used to guide and inform future infrastructure investment and enterprise development initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the very significant infrastructure needs of the region. These needs are being addressed through the national development plan and the national spatial strategy. The north-west's status as an Objective One region has enabled the Government to maximise the benefits of this strategy for the region.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the review of adventure centre activities that was carried out by my Department in 1999. The results were published that same year under the title &ldquo;A Review of the Safety Regulation of Adventure-Activity Centres, Report of the Interdepartmental Working Group&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that publication my Department introduced the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill, 2000. This Bill was passed through both houses of the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President on 16 July 2001. The general scheme of the Act follows the principal recommendations of the interdepartmental working <Col N="274" /> group established to examine this critical safety issue.</P>
    <P>In essence the Act provides for the putting in place of a legislative framework to allow for: the establishment of an independent adventure activities standards authority; mandatory registration of adventure centres and providers with the authority for specified activities; mandatory codes of safe operating practice for specified adventure activities; implementation of a regulatory scheme, involving inspection of centres and providers for adherence to safety codes; and powers for the authority to order cessation of the provision of any or all adventure activities in the case of failure to observe safety codes.</P>
    <P>Recently I established a new maritime safety directorate within my Department to undertake the State's marine regulatory safety services, including the co-ordination of all aspects of safety at sea. The directorate will incorporate the current functions of my Department's marine survey office and its maritime safety and marine environment divisions. It will also take over the safety functions in relation to pleasure craft and adventure activities at present dealt with by the marine leisure division. It is my intention that work will now be progressed under the directorate to have the new adventure activities standards authority established as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware Ireland negotiated the splitting of the country into two regions for the 2000 to 2006 period &ndash; an Objective One region, the Border, midlands and western region, and an Objective One region in transition, the south and east region. The new Objective One scheme for the 2000 to 2006 period is the promotion of the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind. The designation of the BMW region as a full Objective One region for the current programming period brings a number of advantages to County Donegal and the north-west region in general.</P>
      <P>The fact that the EU Structural Funds contribution is in general 75% of co-financed expenditure in the Objective One region compared to 50% in the Objective One region in transition is an incentive to public investment in the north-west region. This is reflected in the &euro;1.7 billion programme under the national development plan in respect of the marine and natural resources sectors. The total EU structural funds contribution towards this investment is &euro;485 million of which &euro;340 million, or 70%, has been earmarked for the BMW region. The main beneficiaries of these preferential investment levels and aid rates in the north-west region will be aquaculture, woodlands, forestry harvesters, fishery harbour infrastructure and the sea fishing sector.</P>
      <P>The advantages to the north-west region of Objective One designation are not confined to EU co-financed investment programmes. The Government's objective of achieving more balanced regional development is also reflected in the targeting of a proportion of investment under all programmes, including non EU co-financed programmes, to the BMW region. In the case of marine and natural resources NDP programmes &euro;863 million or 51% of total investment is earmarked for the BMW region. The following table, at Annex I, gives details in this regard. It also provides examples of specific projects in County Donegal which have benefited to date from investment under the NDP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the outstanding questions about the circumstances surrounding the 1969 Act of Free Choice in West Papua, or Irian Jaya as it is now known, and the role of the UN in that process. I am concerned about reports that the rights and freedoms of the West Papuan people were restricted at that time and at current reports of ongoing human rights abuses in that province.</P>
      <P>As Ireland was not a party to the 1969 Act of Free Choice it is not within this Government's power to re-examine the outcome of the Act. As the Deputy correctly points out, this is a matter for the UN secretariat and the office of the Secretary General to consider.</P>
      <P>At this time there appears to be no significant support among UN member states for a review of the decision of 1969. There is concern that such a review may prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the Government authorities in Jakarta and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the West Papuan people.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that it is necessary to address the fundamental causes of tension in Irian Jaya. As an immediate step we see a need to promote greater decentralisation and autonomy. Dialogue and negotiation needs to take place between the local representatives and the authorities in Jakarta. The Indonesian authorities must exercise full and proper control over the security forces in Irian Jaya, ensure that the human rights violations of which they are accused are investigated and the perpetrators prosecuted, and that such abuses are brought to an end.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep the situation under review, including through our permanent mission in New York.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main aims of the Communications Regulation Bill are as follows: to create a commission for communications regulation; dissolve the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and transfer its functions to the commission; increase penalties for breach of certain offences; and provide for the improved management of public road opening for the purpose of laying telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the provisions of the general scheme of the Bill during the course of drafting, I decided that some of its provisions can be more appropriately progressed through alternative legislative means. Accordingly, some provisions in the general scheme have not been included in the text of the Bill. A number of these provisions are covered by the new European regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector which consists of five European Parliament and Council Directives and a decision. These provisions will be transposed into Irish law by means of regulations under the European Communities Acts.</P>
      <P>The Bill was approved at yesterday's Government meeting. It is my intention to present the Bill immediately to the Dáil or Seanad and to circulate it to Deputies and Senators with a view to enactment as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>I can advise the Deputy that my Department has received a request under the FOI Act in respect of the notification to the EU Commission of the public service obligation relating to the peat stations for Lanesboro and Shannonbridge.

      <P>Under the national development plan, &euro;192 million was provided for the development of regional public transport initiatives, other than mainline rail. Of this amount, &euro;15 million has been allocated to upgrade regional public transport outside the cities.</P>
      <P>To date, Bus Éireann has allocated five new buses to the north-west region. The company has also continued its programme to provide high frequency, quality services between the north-west and Dublin, as well as the introduction of a number of local services between towns in Donegal, Sligo and Tyrone. Town services were also introduced in Sligo.</P>
      <P>Under the rail safety programme, significant investment has been made in upgrading the railway line from Dublin to Sligo. Upgrading the rolling stock will commence with the delivery, in mid-2002, of the first of a batch of 80 new diesel rail cars.</P>
      <P>A sum of &euro;10.1 million in grant aid was provided under the Airports Measure of the national development plan to the four regional airports in the BMW region &ndash; Donegal, Sligo, Knock and Galway. The primary aim of the measure is to provide grant assistance to support compliance by the airports with safety and security issues and also to aid, where appropriate, certain infrastructural upgrades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project submission from Donegal Airport, together with those from the other regional airports, are currently being finalised and it is envis<Col N="281" /> aged that, following the completion of site visits by my officials to the regional airports, we will be in a position to issue project approvals very shortly.</P>
    <P>While not directly reflected in the designation of the BMW region as an Objective One area, my Department has supported the provision of fast, reliable air access, on a daily basis, between Dublin and the regional airports in the West and North-West, through the Public Service Obligation regime.</P>
    <P>Two PSO routes serve the people of County Donegal and surrounding areas, namely, the daily service to Donegal Airport and the twice daily service to Derry Airport, which serves east. I established the Derry-Dublin service as a new PSO air route on 18 January 2001. I also established a new daily PSO service between Knock Airport and Dublin and I increased the frequency on the Galway-Dublin route from 21 to 28 flights per week. Sligo Airport is also served with two daily flights to Dublin under the PSO regime.</P>
    <P>In addition, under my Department's grant scheme last year to support marketing, safety and security measures at the regional airports, I doubled, compared to the previous year, the allocations to both Donegal and Sligo Airports to approximately &euro;254,000. A similar sum was allocated to Galway Airport, representing an increase of 60% on that airport's allocation in 2000. Knock Airport was allocated a sum of approximately &euro;444,000 last year.</P>
    <P>An allocation of &euro;24.1 million has been made for communications infrastructure initiatives in the BMW region under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I signed a contract with Chorus in 2000 entitled, BMW Broadband Communications Corridor. This project will provide broadband access to the north-Midlands and north Connaught and will cover Buncrana, Letterkenny, Donegal, Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Sligo, Ballina, Galway, Monaghan, Cavan, Longford, Athlone, Ballinasloe, and Tullamore.</P>
    <P>I also signed a contract with ESB Telecoms in 2000 to roll-out a national 48-fibre optic trunk route communications infrastructure using ESB's existing high voltage overhead power lines at 400kV, 100kV and 38kV. There are two main service areas which form the basis of this project, broadband managed backbone services and dark fibre lease. The areas of Cavan, Sligo, Galway and Donegal will benefit from this project.</P>
    <P>No payments have been made on either of these projects to date.</P>

    <P>* As reported to the Chief of Staff through established statutory redress procedures </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The Department is obliged to investigate such cases in accordance with the procedures set out in, A Positive Working Environment &ndash; An Anti Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying Policy for the Civil Service. The Department is satisfied that the procedures are capable of leading to a resolution of such cases of bullying within the Civil Service and civilian employee contexts.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have had their own formal policies and procedures on sexual harassment and bullying in place since February 1996. These procedures are outlined in an Administrative Instruction on Interpersonal Relationships available to all members of the Defence Forces. Lectures and briefings in this area have continued over the years as an integral element of the training syllabus on recruit, cadet and career courses, and in addition on those occasions when troops are formed up for overseas training.</P>
    <P>The Chief of Staff has established a special military steering group to examine these issues. Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, is the expert civilian chairperson of this group. Her task is to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures, and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. Dr. Doyle and the joint civilian-military group will produce their report by next March.</P>

      <P>The early retirement pension is not subject to a means test. However, it is a requirement of the EU Council regulations governing the schemes of early retirement that the early retirement pension may only be granted as a supplement to any national retirement pension that participants, or their spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, may receive. This means the amount of any national retirement pension must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The recent agreement obtained from the European Commission, which I welcome, was that widow's and widower's pensions should not be regarded as national retirement pensions until the recipient reached the normal retirement age of 66 years. Once these pensioners reach 66 years the amount of their early retirement pension must be reduced by the amount of widow's or widower's pensions that they receive. As regards invalidity pension, however, the Commission has taken the view that this is a national retirement pension whatever the age of the recipient. Disability benefit or allowances are not regarded as a national retirement pension for the purposes of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Leader is the EU Community Initiative for rural development that provides approved local action groups with public funding, EU and national, to implement multi-sectoral business plans for the development of their own areas. In accordance with the bottom up philosophy of the initiative, the local Leader group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving actions falling within its business plan. The approval of grants by groups is made within detailed operating rules drawn up by the Department and approved by the EU Commission. There is particular emphasis on community development in the programme and each of the groups is obliged to implement a programme in its area to encourage, support and facilitate the process of rural development, especially at community level.</P>
      <P>The Leader II programme was introduced in May 1995 and continued until the end of 1999 but final payments under the programme continued until the end of 2001. Leader II had a total allocation of £93 million of EU and national funding for the period.</P>

      <P>Donegal and the North-West will benefit in line with other parts of the Border, Midland and Western Region from the measures in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The plan provides a total indicative allocation of some &euro;5.5 billion in relation to agriculture, food and related rural development. The following are the details:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;The CAP rural development plan contains a &euro;4.3 billion allocation for its rural environment protection (REPS), early retirement and compensatory allowances' elements. This allocation is on a national basis. While REPS and early retirement are demand driven schemes from which farmers in Donegal and the north-west will benefit to the extent that they participate in them, the compensatory allowances scheme is of particular relevance to Donegal as the county is disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Support for the food industry, agricultural research and training is provided through two national operational programmes. The indicative allocation is &euro;547 million. The Objective one status of the Border, Midlands and Western Region is reflected in the support available for food research and training. The maximum rate of grant is 45% of eligible expenditure as compared to 35% in the Southern and Eastern Region.</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;The two Regional Operational Programmes include sub-programmes on agriculture and rural development that support structural improvement, alternative enterprises, general rural development, and agricultural services. The allocations are &euro;321 million for the Border, Midland and Western Region and &euro;271 million for the Southern and Eastern Region.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that there are now 434,000 qualifying mortgage loans registered for tax relief at source. While it is difficult to give a precise number, Revenue estimate this represents about 97% of those entitled to claim the relief, leaving about 13,400 who have yet to submit claims.</P>

    <P>Revenue has indicated there was a very positive response to its information campaign in <Col N="287" /> relation to the new relief at source arrangements. It is still operating a help line for enquiries concerning the new scheme.

      <P>I understand the Deputy has put a similar question down to all Ministers who will respond in respect of their areas of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" />The general benefits for the BMW region, including County Donegal of being classified as an Objective One region are significant. As a result over the 2000-2006 programme period, the BMW Region secured an additional &euro;595 million in structural fund assistance compared to if it were an Objective One region in transition as is the case with the Southern and Eastern Region</P>
    <P>Objective One status allows the BMW Region to receive EU co-funding of up to 75% for individual projects whereas the Southern and Eastern Region receives EU co-funding of 50%. Objective One status also allows the BMW region to benefit from a higher rate of permissible State Aid.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, my Department is responsible for the direct allocation and spending of funds under the Technical Assistance Operational Programme and also the Peace and INTERREG programmes. The amount spent on each of these programmes is not currently available at county levels. Therefore the amounts I will give are for the BMW region.</P>
    <P>In the NDP-CSF Technical Assistance OP 2000-2006 the total allocation for the BMW Regional Assembly area was &euro;1.6 million in 2000 and 2001, of which &euro;0.16 million has been spent from 1 Jan 2000 to 30 June 2001. Spending on technical assistance traditionally accelerates as programmes progress.</P>
    <P>My Department is also responsible for the allocation and spending of funds for the Peace II OP. The Peace II Programme was agreed with the European Commission late last year and therefore spending has just begun. This programme has EU Structural Fund assistance of &euro;106 million and matching Exchequer funding of &euro;35 million and in the South is exclusive to the Border region including Donegal.</P>
    <P>County Donegal also benefits from the INTERREG IIIA programme, which runs from 2000-2006. Under the Ireland-Northern Ireland programme the Border region receives &euro;53.6 million.</P>

      <P>A significant number of staff who are serving in legal posts in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions were appointed from open recruitment competitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidates who are successful in an open recruitment competition receive a starting salary equal to the minimum of the incremental pay scale in question, irrespective of whether they are already working in the Civil Service or working in outside employment. However, both categories <Col N="289" /> of candidate may, in certain circumstances, receive a starting salary which exceeds the minimum of the pay-scale in question.</P>
    <P>Where a prospective appointee is working outside the Civil Service immediately prior to appointment and is not a civil servant, the employing Department may consider offering the candidate a starting salary above the minimum of the pay-scale in question provided that; such a provision has been made in the conditions of service set by the Civil Service Commissioners for the competition; the candidate is deemed to have appropriate qualifications and-or experience which merit the payment of additional increment(s) on the pay-scale concerned; the candidate can prove that he-she is currently in outside employment and is being remunerated at some point above the minimum of the incremental pay-scale for the position concerned; and the candidate has applied in writing to negotiate his-her starting salary in advance of accepting his-her appointment to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Any higher starting salary which, in compliance with the conditions just outlined, is determined by negotiation between the Civil Service department and the prospective appointee, cannot exceed the salary of the individual concerned in his-her previous employment.</P>
    <P>In the case of an existing civil servant, starting pay may be set at existing pay plus an &lsquo;accrued increment', i.e. that portion of the current increment which has been &lsquo;earned by' or has been &lsquo;accrued' by the officer, if such a level of remuneration is more favourable than the minimum of the grade to which the individual is being appointed.</P>
    <P>This affords a significant protection to the candidate who is already a civil servant in that it at least preserves his or her existing level of remuneration in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>Other than the points outlined above, I am not aware of any differential in the terms of employment of staff serving in legal positions within the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of child sexual abuse allegations is extremely important and a highly emotive subject. As a result it is of extreme importance that there are <Col N="290" /> clear guidelines on the responsibilities of the statutory agencies involved in this area. These guidelines are clearly set out in Children First, &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which were published by my Department in September 1999. The objectives of the guidelines are to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse. Children First are over-arching national guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies who have contact with children and represent a major development in strengthening arrangements for the protection of children.</P>
      <P>The guidelines clearly set out the following principles of best practice in child protection.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;The welfare of the child is of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;A proper balance must be struck between protecting children and respecting the rights and needs of parents or carers and families; but where there is conflict, the child's welfare must come first.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Children have a right to be heard, listened to, and to be taken seriously. Taking into account their age and understanding, they should be consulted and involved in all matters and decisions which may affect their lives.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Early intervention and support should be available to promote the welfare of children and families.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Parents have a right to respect and should be consulted and involved in matters concerning their child.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Intervention should not deal with the child in isolation, the child must be seen in a family setting.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Children should only be separated from parents or carers when all alternative means of protecting them have been exhausted. Reunion should always be considered</P>
      <P>Total additional funding of &euro;9.47 million has been made available to assist the implementation of Children First since the publication of the guidelines. I believe that the Children First Guidelines provide appropriate guidance to health boards on the matters raised by the Deputy, and do not propose to establish a Dáil Committee to inquire into these matters.</P>

      <P>Payments are made <Col N="291" /> in respect of children who are taken into the care of the health board under the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995 Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children. Responsibility for the provision of foster care allowance in this case rests with the ERHA. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to her directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group.</P>
      <P>In addition, I understand that a concerted overseas recruitment campaign will be initiated shortly on behalf of the health boards for scarce physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy personnel.</P>
      <P>I am aware in the context of work carried out by my Department with health service employers and IMPACT on the joint review group on psychology services in the health service that shortages of psychology staff including clinical psychologists exist in the health service. The review group identified that a key factor was the inadequate number of post-graduate training places available. A workforce planning exercise carried out under the aegis of the review recommended the provision of approximately 30 additional post-graduate training places in psychology. Following a process initiated by my Department, 30 additional places are now being provided from 2001 through the Psychological Society of Ireland's post-graduate diploma course.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, that the national educational psychological service, NEPS, is undertaking a joint survey with the Principal Psychologists in Northern Ireland of supply and demand of educational psychologists in the island of Ireland and that he is awaiting completion of that survey along with its report and recommendations. In the interim the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority have agreed to a proposal to increase the annual output from the MA in Educational Psychology at University College Dublin, NUI Dublin from six to ten.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been playing an important role in promoting the environmentally conscious management of waste in the health services. In <Col N="294" /> 1994, my Department issued a health services waste policy to all health boards and acute voluntary hospitals. The policy advocated good environmental and health and safety practices in the management, handling and disposal of all wastes generated in hospitals. The policy promoted the environmental principles of reduction, reuse and recycling. It placed particular emphasis on the segregation of different waste systems. A degree of waste segregation is now practised throughout our hospitals and work is ongoing to bring about further improvements. In addition a comprehensive environmental management system leading to the environmental quality ISO14001 certification, which has been on trial at one hospital in Dublin, is now being promoted amongst the health boards.</P>

      <P>Gross health expenditure for 2001 was &euro;7,077.260 million, of which capital was &euro;373.620 million and non-capital was &euro;6,703.640 million. Gross health expenditure for 2002 will be approximately &euro;8,188.582 million, of which capital is &euro;496.575 million and non-capital is &euro;7,692.007 million. The gross expenditure total for 2002 represents a 16% increase on the 2001 out-turn. When account is taken of the appropriations-in-aid income, the net expenditure total is &euro;6,991.848 million, representing a 17% increase on the 2001 out-turn. This is further proof of this Government's commitment to the provision of a quality, patient-centred health service.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy may be referring to the procedure for the civil registration of a birth. The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. The facts required to be recorded in the register of births are determined principally by the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act, 1863, as amended by the Registration of Births Act, 1996 (No. 36 of 1966) and the particulars to be entered in the birth register are set out in the Schedule to the latter Act. The details required to be registered in respect of the child include date and place of birth, sex, forename(s) and surname. In addition, the mother's and father's forename, surname, address and occupation are registered. Births are registered in the districts in which they occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manuscript registers are retained by the local registrar of births, deaths and marriages until they are full. They are then forwarded to the superintendent registrar of births, deaths and marriages and are retained at that office. In addition, at the end of each quarter each registrar makes a certified copy of each birth registered in the previous three months and these are forwarded to the An tÁrd Chláraitheoir, together with copies of deaths and marriages. These returns are used for the compilation of the <Col N="296" /> national index of births, deaths and marriages. Once processed the copies of the birth, death and marriage entries are held on microfilm in the general register office with the exception of some recent years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. The paper copies of the quarterly returns of births, deaths and marriages are held in the office in Roscommon and are being scanned onto an electronic database. The associated indexes are also being converted to an electronic format. Copies of returns made for recent years referred to above are being scanned directly onto the electronic database. The Deputy will appreciate that this project will improve the efficiency, flexibility access and management of the records and the associated indexes. The Deputy may also be aware of the associated project for the direct electronic registration of births, deaths and marriages. It is anticipated that the direct electronic registration of births will commence later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Southern Health Board that all vacancies in the mental health services are filled by either temporary staff or overtime working. The board has recently recruited 14 permanent nurses from Trinidad and Tobago to take up positions in west Cork and St. Stephen's Hospital.</P>
      <P>A major recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, &euro;6.35 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives, including psychiatric nurses. In particular a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment and retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses &ndash; payment of fees to nurses and midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses, payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses and midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice, abolition of fees for back-to-practice courses <Col N="297" /> and payment of salary to nurses and midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>On 1 November 2001, I launched the new four year undergraduate pre-registration nursing degree programme commencing in 2002. The new nursing degree programme, to replace the current three year diploma programme, will put the education of nurses on a par with that of other health care professionals. The nursing profession has long been seeking such parity and the Government's decision implements a central recommendation of the commission on nursing. Educating nurses to degree level will enable them to develop their clinical skills to a greater extent and to respond to future challenges in health care for the benefit of patients and client groups.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved a capital building programme totalling £176 million, &euro;223.5 million, for the construction of facilities to accommodate nursing students at 13 higher education institutions throughout the country. This programme is due to be completed by September 2004.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,640 places nationally will be available annually on the degree programme as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Southern Health Board is responsible for the provision of ambulance services in its functional area, which includes Killarney. I am advised by the board that in 2000 it embarked on a plan to further extend, on a phased basis, the on-duty cover in its 16 ambulance stations outside of the Cork and Tralee area, and Killarney was prioritised for this development with the addition of an ambulance and an extra crew. The additional resources to give effect to this improvement in the service in Killarney enabled the board to extend the level of in-station duty cover at night <Col N="298" /> up to 1 a.m. and to enhance cover at weekend nights in particular.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that the new rostering arrangement, which is in place with effect from July 2002, will ensure that the service in the Killarney area will be improved in the most effective way and that it directs additional resources to where they are most needed. This reduction of on-call cover and increase in duty cover on a phased basis to 24 hours at the Killarney station is but one of the many aspects of the board's ambulance service which is being developed by it across its functional area.</P>
      <P>Government policy on the development of emergency medical services is as set out in a number of policy documents, most notably the report of the review group on the ambulance service, which was published in 1993 and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. The report of the review group addressed, <i>inter alia</i>, the issue of the level of cover currently being provided by ambulance crews and made recommendations on how improvements might be made.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to pursue a policy of investment aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service including 24 hour cover. I am committed to the further development of this vital service in the context of the recommendations of the 1993 report, the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy and in response to the priorities identified by the health boards. I will, therefore, continue to provide additional resources for the continuing development of the emergency services nationally to ensure that those calling on the service continue to receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Southern Health Board that an independent review of the nursing establishment in Tralee General Hospital was carried out in October and November 2001. This review was commissioned by the board and was carried out by the company referred to by the Deputy, with the following terms of reference: to review staffing levels in Tralee General Hospital having regard to the existing service requirements and to identify the skill mix and staffing levels appropriate to needs of the service in ward areas and departments, and to take account of the report of the commission on nursing and other relevant local and national strategies. An execu<Col N="299" /> tive summary of the review was presented to senior staff on 4 February 2002.</P>
      <P>The reviewer made 16 recommendations across five main areas &ndash; nurse management, staffing numbers, support staffing, women and child health services and environment. The main approach was to commence the process of developing the roles of nurses at all levels, as proposed by the commission on nursing. This included developing nurses as managers to provide clinical leadership and to ensure protocols based on good practice to assist in patient care. Additional staffing will be necessary to facilitate this process and an additional 6.5 WTE posts on day duty and 16 WTE on night duty were identified. A further 14 posts were identified for specialist areas such as theatre, dialysis, cancer care, parent craft and infection control. The report addressed the utilisation of health care assistants to assist and support the nursing and midwifery function in the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the following action has been taken to date. Five additional nursing staff were recruited in October 2001 for theatre. The 2002 service plan will increase the nurse complement by a further nine posts to bring the total complement to 392. These posts will address the priority areas outlined in the review, including the establishment of a women and child health care unit. The review found that if the number of staff allocated in the service plan was actually filled, many of the problems on the ground would disappear. Management of the hospital are examining the issues in the report. A steering group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations will be established at local level with representation from the Irish Nurses' Organisation and SIPTU.</P>

      <P>Funding provided by the Government under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, represents a very significant increase in health capital investment nationally compared to previous years. A sum of &euro;2.5 billion, £2 billion, was made available for the health sector at the commencement of the plan. Funding provided to the North-Western Health Board under the NDP reflects the regionalisation priorities contained in the plan overall whereby a <i>per capita</i> weighting of 20% applies within the Objective One or Border, midland and western region. It is intended that investment will benefit all healthcare programmes of the board and that a greater balance of funding will be achieved by 2006 between the acute and non-acute hospital sectors.</P>
      <P>As this was the first time that the health sector was included to any significant degree in a national capital investment programme, transitional arrangements applied in 2000 in relation to NDP funding among boards to ensure that pre-NDP commitments were met and to allow a certain number of new initiatives to commence. Funding to boards, including the NWHB, was therefore indicated in 2000 in respect of the years 2001 to 2006. Boards were asked by my Department to draw up NDP plans in line with the funding resources indicated to them for this period. The funding indicated to the NWHB for 2001-06 was &euro;131.67 million, £103.7 million, excluding separate provision for information and communications technology.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board has primary responsibility under the NDP for the prioritisation and delivery of capital projects within its area, subject to agreement with my Department in relation to the normal criteria governing individual capital projects. These include issues such as approvals, cost validation and compliance with relevant national and EU guidelines and regulations. Given the scope of initiatives planned or under way in the north western region under the NDP, and the fact that health services are administered on a health board rather than county basis, it would not be practical for me to detail here the extensive number of capital projects undertaken by that board or to outline the advantages accruing to County Donegal. In addition, a number of these initiatives relate to minor capital works such as re-equipping, refurbishment or health and safety, or may benefit more than one county within the board. In the circumstances, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to examine the matter and reply direct to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. Over the past four years, I have initiated a range of measures to increase the number of patients in orthodontic treatment. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review, known as the Moran report, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. One of the review group's recommendations was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics and agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the orthodontics service. This agreement resulted from complex and time consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics.</P>
      <P>Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for such training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group also recommended that auxiliaries be employed in the regional orthodontic units of the health boards. In order to enable the achievement of greater caseloads, the Dental Council has been approached concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxili<Col N="321" /> ary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade, to be known as orthodontic therapist, will act as a support to the consultant orthodontists, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic units thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan, both of which are operational, and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed in 2001.</P>
    <P>Last year, given that it may be some time before the structural changes take effect, I funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative. Two consultant orthodontists, five specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited. A six surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open and the treatment of patients there has commenced. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational, and three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards. Furthermore, under this initiative my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, the total number of patients on the waiting list for treatment was 11,890. This is a reduction of 1,613 in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter. The chief executive officers of the health boards have also informed me that at the end of the same quarter there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when <Col N="322" /> compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the range of measures that I have initiated continue to impact on the orthodontic service. Finally, over the next four years, my Department will continue to develop the public orthodontic service in line with the recommendations of the Moran report and ultimately implement the above structural changes envisaged for the service.</P>

      <P>From 1997 to date, over &euro;103 million has been invested in development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Amongst a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 64 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff. This level of funding far exceeds the £25 million which was initially envisaged in 1996 and is a clear indication of this Government's continued commitment to the development of co-ordinated and patient focused treatment in line with the national cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of 2002 of a revised implementation plan for it. This plan will be prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. The health strategy also provides a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of an <Col N="323" /> additional 3,000 beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy. The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospitals agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review, entitled &ldquo;Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review,&rdquo; examines and reports on current acute hospital bed capacity and clinical activity, and it suggests a framework for the estimation of future bed requirements based on current activity levels, current indicators of inadequate capacity, increasing patient demand, potential changes to clinical practice and projected demographic changes. The review, which was published on 16 January 2002, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In tandem with the publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds, of which 335 are in the eastern region.</P>

      <P>The provision of modern facilities across all areas of the health services is being undertaken through funding made available under the National Development Plan 2000-6. The plan represents the greatest ever level of investment in health infrastructure with the provision of &euro;2.5 billion, £2 billion, at year 2000 price base date, planned over the period. The decision to implement investment on such a scale indicates a clear determination by the Government to address meaningfully the infrastructural deficits that existed in the health service. A fundamental objective of my Department's NDP is to achieve a greater balance of capital investment by the end of the plan between the acute and non-acute sectors than previously occurred. Primary responsibility for the prioritisation and delivery of capital projects under the plan rests with each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Many of these initiatives, whether at major project or minor capital expenditure level, are now well under way in terms of delivery and a significant number of further initiatives are at present subject to detailed planning processes. The NDP for the health service nationally encompasses all of the services referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services for people with disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Between 1999 and 2001, 395 new respite places were put in place in addition to an increase in the availability of home support services, for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The provision of further additional funding in 2002 will see another 75 new respite places come on stream this year. Since 1997, additional funding of &euro;175 million has been allocated to the ongoing development of health <Col N="327" /> related services, including respite and home support services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This significant level of funding has provided an additional 95 respite places and &euro;19.681 million in ongoing revenue for the development of home support services.</P>
      <P>In addition to this funding, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector, is currently developing a national physical and sensory disability database which when complete will provide a detailed picture of the service requirements, including respite and home support services, of people with physical and sensory disabilities over a five year period. This database will enable a co-ordinated and planned approach to be taken in the delivery of services to individuals as required.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage comment on specific funding for any element of the health services prior to the conclusion of the annual Estimates and budgetary discussions. However, as these services are vital in enabling families to continue to support their family member at home, the Government is committed to the continued expansion of these services.</P>

      <P>This payable order was returned in May 2001 as the person disagreed with the interest rate applied. Since that time her solicitor and the Chief State Solicitor's Office, acting for Waterways Ireland, have been in correspondence regarding this issue. Waterways Ireland advise me that they are endeavouring to bring this case to a successful conclusion at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>My Department does <Col N="335" /> not propose to undertake further works at Portumna Castle. Consultants engaged by my Department to prepare the draft management plan for the Portumna estate recommended conservation of the castle itself rather than its full restoration. The reasons for this are to avoid conjecture in any such restoration; the need to study, preserve and present the surviving fabric; and the possibility offered by the building in its current state of creating a unique experience not to be found elsewhere in Ireland. My Department has accepted this recommendation.</P>
      <P>The significant investment made by my Department to date at Portumna Castle has resulted in a distinctive tourist amenity for the region. My Department's major objectives for Portumna, which were to provide extended public access and an enhanced exhibition for visitors, have been achieved. Expenditure at Portumna Castle during the period 1990-2001 amounted to some £3,109,510.</P>

      <P>I understand the company referred to by the Deputy set up business in a factory owned by Údarás na Gaeltachta under a short-term lease and on a pilot basis in September 2001 without grant aid. Discussions on the development of the company and on a possible package of financial assistance for an ongoing business have continued since that time. The position is that approximately ten people were recruited initially by the company. Employment subsequently rose to 19 &ndash; 18 full-time and one part-time &ndash; staff by end 2001 and remained at this level until 8 February 2002. On that date the company temporarily laid off 13 staff due to large stocks of its product being on hand. I understand, however, that the company expects to re-employ this staff in about six weeks time.</P>

    <P>It is clear from the above that Donegal is benefiting significantly from my Department's NDP programme.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to quantify the degree to which the funding for County Donegal under my Department's element of the NDP has been influenced by the retention of the Objective one designation by the Border, midland and western region. However, as the funding generally available in this region has been increased proportionately, it is reasonable to assume the level of funding to date for Donegal, and the allocations for future years, would not have been as significant had the Objective One designation been lost.</P>

Following discussions with officials of my Department, the operator has lodged an informal appeal to have the area of the existing quarry and an additional adjacent area removed from the candidate special area of conservation, on the grounds that the habitat in this area is damaged and does not qualify for designation.</P>

      <P>Tenders for the carrying out of a Garda public attitudes survey were sought last year by way of a notice in the Official Journal <Col N="338" /> of the European Communities. Tenders were subsequently received from six companies and initially evaluated with reference to the completeness of the tender documentation and the stated ability of the tenderer to meet the requirements of the invitation to tender. The following award criteria were then applied: conformity to specification, sound methodology, price, delivery within acceptable timeframe and added value. The successful tender &ndash; having regard to the award criteria &ndash;  was submitted by a company outside the State. This was also the lowest cost tender submitted. Sanction was therefore sought and received from the Department of Finance for the carrying out of the survey by this company.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress are preliminary report, contract document, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>I gave approval for the appointment of consultants for the preliminary, design and construction stages for the proposed new swimming pool in Loughrea in January 2001. This proposal will be considered further on receipt of a preliminary report from Galway County Council.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan the BMW region including County Donegal was granted Objective One status which allows the State to provide a higher level of support, up to 75% in certain instances, in comparison to other regions of the country where the maximum level for State aid is 50%. Funding is allocated on a regional basis and as a result it is not possible in most instances to provide specific information in relation to any individual county.</P>
      <P>Details of allocations under the NDP to the BMW region in respect of the various programmes for which my Department has responsibility are set out hereunder:</P>
      <P>A sum of about &euro;108 million has been provided to the BMW region for social inclusion measures under my Department's remit over the seven year period of the programme. Of this amount &euro;2.06 million has been expended to date in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Some &euro;52 million has been allocated under the BMW regional operational programmes for three tourism sub-measures under the local enterprise development priority. This funding will be administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann under its new tourism product development scheme 2002-06 which, late last year, secured state aids approval from the European Commission. Project proposals have now been invited by the board.</P>
      <P>Under the employment and human resources development programme &euro;47.62 million has been allocated to the BMW region over the seven year period of the programme. To date &euro;3.3 million of this has been spent in Donegal.</P>
      <P>Additionally, more than &euro;440 million has been allocated under the tourism marketing fund of the productive sector operational programme under the NDP. This funding is being used to promote Ireland internationally as a tourist destination in key markets and to support the development and marketing of special interest products. Due to the nature of these activities it is not possible to disaggregate the expenditure on a county basis.</P>
      <P>Some &euro;32 million has been allocated to the region for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme. The Department will begin preparations for the implementation of this sub-measure, once the national spatial strategy, currently being undertaken by the Department of Environment and Local Government, has been completed and the gateway towns, which are the proposed target of the sub-measure, have been identified.</P>

      <P>The national development plan does not make specific provision in relation to education services for individual disability groups.</P>
      <P>Education support services for children with autism, in common with services for all children, are funded through annual allocations to my Department which are based on models and levels of support agreed with the education partners.</P>
      <P>In the case of children with special needs, including children with autism, special reduced pupil to teacher ratios apply. Children with special needs are also supported by the special needs assistant service on the basis of agreed levels of support which are based on the assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Depending on their assessed level of need, children with autism can attend dedicated classes in special schools or attached to ordinary schools or may attend mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis. The special units dedicated to chil<Col N="347" /> dren with autism operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each unit also has the support of two special needs assistants. Children attending such units attract a special increased rate of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service. At present, there are 98 such special units in place with a capacity to cater for up to 588 pupils. A further 48 pupils with autism are being catered for in three pilot projects which are using an applied behavioural model of response.</P>
    <P>Children with autism who attend ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis are entitled to the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant service. At present there are some 1,500 resource teachers and 3,000 special needs assistants in primary schools supporting children with special needs in integrated settings, including children with autism.</P>
    <P>In October 2000 I established a special task force on autism to review current provision and make recommendations for the future development of services in this area. The report of the task force, which is lengthy and complex, was received in November 2001. Among the areas addressed in the report are the role of the parties to which the Deputy refers and how their interests can best be supported and developed.</P>

      <P>The administration of the State examinations annually, catering for about 130,000 candidates in over 4,500 examination centres, is a major logistical challenge. The task would become impossible to administer if students, having been registered to take the examination in one school, were free to subsequently take the examinations in another school. The only reasonable position that my Department can adopt is that once entered by a particular school a student must take his/her examinations in a centre in that school.</P>

      <P>There is provision in the National <Col N="348" /> Development Plan 2000-2006, for funding in the education sector, through the employment and human resources development operational programme, the productive sector operational programme as well as the two regional operational programmes.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Border midland and western region was designated in 1999 as an Objective One region. In general, programmes in the education sector are delivered on a national basis.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to County Donegal and the north west region, due to the wide range of programmes in the education sector, it would require an inordinate amount of official time to answer the question in the detail requested. However if the Deputy has any queries regarding a specific measure, I will be happy to seek to obtain the information for her.</P>

      <P>The first task of the National Educational Welfare Board was to develop proposals for the appointment of a chief executive. Proposals were developed and approved by me. An open public competition has been held and the appointment of a chief executive is expected very shortly.</P>
      <P>Following from the appointment of a chief executive, arrangements for other appointments, including appointments as educational welfare officers, will then proceed. The existing school attendance officers will also transfer to the new service. Negotiations are under way in relation to the transfer arrangements.</P>
      <P>The new educational welfare service is a major new national service, which requires the design of a new national organisation and structure together with a staffing requirement analysis and the development of suitable proposals in this regard. The board has engaged the services of a management consultancy firm to assist it in these matters. The main elements of the consultancy work are now very advanced and are under detailed consideration by the board.</P>
      <P>I will be commencing sections of the Act as soon as possible, taking account of the plans being prepared by the board and the recommendations which they will make to me on the matter. It is my intention and that of the board that the new services will be phased in as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she or he may be enrolled in a national school.</P>
      <P>Section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act, 1998, provides that a board of management of a primary school &ldquo;shall publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school,&rdquo;, and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
      <P>My Department will carry out an investigation where it is claimed that a board is operating its enrolment policy in a manner that discriminates against a particular child. On the basis of the details supplied by the Deputy this does not appear to be the case in this instance.</P>
      <P>In cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to a school, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of its inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that s/he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses. There are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, s/he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view <Col N="351" /> that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000/01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>A proposed building project for Clochar Coca Naofa national school will proceed to architectural planning and to the preparation of tender documents, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>
