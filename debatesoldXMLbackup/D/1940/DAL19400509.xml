      <P>A complaint was recently received by the Commissioners of Public Works from the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Drainage Trustees relative to flooding stated to be due to the condition of a sluice at Ballyconnell Mill.  The matter has been investigated and found to be one in connection with which the Commissioners of Public Works have no functions, and the drainage trustees are being so informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to statements made at the annual delegate meeting of the Association of Officers of the Employment Branch (Department of Industry and Commerce), and reported in the Press, to the effect that the Dublin Employment Exchange is incommodious and insalutary; and, if so, whether he will consider the advisability of establishing regional employment exchanges in the Dublin County Borough area for the dual purpose of easing congestion at the Gardiner Street premises and the facilitation of applicants who have to walk long distances, particularly in inclement weather.</P>

      <P>The question of accommodation at the Employment Exchange, Dublin, has been under consideration in my Department and the possibility of obtaining suitable additional accommodation is being examined.  Meanwhile, congestion is avoided by relaxations of the regulations governing the attendance at the employment exchange of applicants for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance and by systematic arrangement of times of attendance.  Since applicants who reside over six miles from the employment exchange are not required to attend at all and are dealt with by post, and those who reside at lesser distances are required to attend once a week or on alternate days or daily according to distance, the establishment of employment exchanges at different centres in the County Borough of Dublin would not facilitate applicants to an extent that would justify the increased cost involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the recent heavy exportation of vegetables, which has resulted in a price being demanded for vegetables for home consumption which many persons cannot afford to pay; and, if <Col N="209" /> so, if he will take steps to control the export of vegetables so as to ensure for home consumption a sufficient supply at reasonable prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that exports of fresh vegetables, such as cabbage, in recent months have been considerably greater than in the corresponding months of previous years and that prices of these vegetables on the home market have been much higher than in other years. The advance in prices has not been due solely to the increase in the volume of exports.  Supplies coming on the market have so far been much below normal on account of the exceptionally severe weather experienced during the past winter and of the slow growth in the early months of this year.  It is anticipated, however, that larger supplies will be forthcoming in the course of the next few weeks and that prices will then show a downward tendency.  I do not think the circumstances are such as to warrant the taking of action with a view to restricting exports.</P>

      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death of Deputy Seán Tubridy, a member for the constituency of West Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion I should like to say this: The Taoiseach has declared that a dangerous situation exists as a result of armed attempts to challenge the authority of Government. He has asked for a united front against violence in this situation.  The Government sees fit to call a by-election in the constituency of Galway.  In the light of the Taoiseach's statement, and recognising that the maintenance of order is of paramount importance, we do not propose to contest this election in Galway and we do not propose to move the motion standing in the name of Deputy Doyle for the writ for the by-election in the constituency of Kilkenny. We shall not move for this writ until the Taoiseach finds himself in a position to say that this danger of civil disturbance is passed, when we propose to move, and in the ensuing election challenge the political and economic policy of the Government Party, so that our people may with calm deliberation pass judgment on the respective merits of the opposing policies of our Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

It is to give an opportunity to the Opposition to contest Government policy that a by-election like this would usually be held.  At the same time there are other considerations, and I would ask that the matter should be left over for decision until some time before the House adjourns to-night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And I do not blame him, for the long arm of the <i>Irish Times</i> has reached out to gather him to its bosom. His predecessor, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was Minister for Finance spent many years negotiating his way into the capacious bosom of that organ and when he got there he found its ardour was somewhat embarrassing and he moved to another Ministry.  His successor, who has been much criticised in the columns of this paper for whipping John Bull, has all his past misdeeds forgotten, and <Col N="213" /> the <i>Irish Times</i> emerges this morning to bestow its somewhat questionable accolade upon him in terms to which I think the attention of the most obscurantist Fianna Fáil T.D. should be directed.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the average citizen,&rdquo; says the <i>Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;in fact, the Budget has made no difference whatsoever.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is very true, certainly.  He is left to groan as he has been groaning for the past three years.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;His attitude,&rdquo; says the <i>Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;will be that &lsquo;no news is good news.&rsquo;  He neither will understand, nor will seek to understand, the curious accountancy by which Mr. O'Kelly has transformed the considerable deficit which the published Estimates revealed a few days ago into the comforting equilibrium of yesterday's Budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Was there ever a more glorious comment on a Minister for Finance's Budget?  Do we blame the poor man for slowly sinking through the floor?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will be enough for him that he has nothing more to pay.  We congratulate Mr. O'Kelly not only on a Budget which is a miracle of ingenuity, but also one which, in every practical respect, is calculated to satisfy.  He may have juggled with figures; he may have taken a chance or two; but the fact remains that, for the time being, he has eased the taxpayer's mind and has brought an access of popularity to his Party.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What a glorious epitaph to write on the reputation of a public man.  There is not a tight rope walker in the world who would not glory in that tribute from an acrobat's newspaper.  But that is not all.  This article goes on for a column and a half.  The Minister has quite intoxicated Westmoreland Street this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is possible&rdquo;, says the <i>Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;&mdash;and not unreasonable&mdash;to complain that his calculations are misleading, inasmuch as they follow the novel system of accountancy&rdquo;&mdash;what a glorious euphemism&mdash;<Col N="214" />&ldquo;which was adopted by his colleague and predecessor, Mr. Seán MacEntee; but calculations appeal to nobody; the public, let us repeat, desires to know one thing only&mdash;how much it has to pay&mdash;and the answer is &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That does not seem to correspond with the poor Minister's estimate of the future because he says that when he contemplated what he had to ask the people to pay, his heart sank and that it represented an increase of £10,000,000 per annum on what they were being asked to pay when he came into office.  However, the <i>Irish Times</i> is undismayed and ends up with this envoi&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Can a consoled, but still bewildered, country hope that this first step towards a solution of its ills is near?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think every member of the Fianna Fáil Party should get that article and have it reprinted in his local paper and then he should recover the copy from the local paper and have it framed in plush and hang it on his parlour wall so that when his confidence in the present Minister for Finance begins to flag he can reassure himself that Westmoreland Street is pleased, the <i>Irish Times</i> is satisfied, and what more could any loyal supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party ask than that their Minister for Finance should have measured up the most pleasurable anticipations of that pillar of national feeling in Ireland, the indomitable <i>Irish Times</i>?  However, the <i>Irish Times</i> notwithstanding, with great temerity, I am going to ask the Minister for Finance a few questions in regard to this Budget.  He is a very ingenuous man, of course, the Minister for Finance, as simple as a child, always anxious to take us all fully into his confidence and lay all his cards upon the table&mdash;no sleight of hand here.  He produces a White Paper to tell us all about it, to explain in detail the reasons for every increase that he has had to make, not on the expenditure of ten years ago, but the increases that he had to make on the expenditure of last year and, as you read the list you are constrained to say: &ldquo;Who can <Col N="215" /> blame the poor man?  All these increases are increases beyond his control.&rdquo;  But it is strange that this ingenuous and honest man, when he was preparing this elaborate return, did not invite the men who compiled it to cast their minds back to 1931 and compare the increases in every subhead of this year with those of the sub-heads of 1931 and set out opposite each of those increases a similar informative paragraph to that which he has been good enough to give us in column 5 of Table 2 of the tables he has published in connection with the financial statement for 1940.  However, to assist him in that task, I am going to direct the attention of this House to what some of these increases are and, bear in mind, the Fianna Fáil Deputies on the back benches had better start scratching their heads with a view to working out an explanatory statement to the effect that these increases were made in respect of social services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputies opposite started scratching their heads they might get something out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was going to say that his colleagues had no heads to scratch.  The first increase relates to the Taoiseach.  I do not know whether he is a social service or not.  Perhaps he is one of the chastening plagues that have been visited upon this country for its spiritual improvement.  If so, he is costing £3,476 more than his predecessor cost in 1931.  The Revenue Commissioners, a blessed social service, are costing £292,000 more this year than in 1931.  The Gárda Síochána, an admirable force of which we are all proud and which I think the Fianna Fáil Party hoped at one time to be able to reduce by 50 per cent. on the ground that we were all loyal and law-abiding people, has gone up in cost by £293,000 since the Minister came in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department for which this magnificent palace is being <Col N="216" /> constructed in Kildare Street at present, has gone up in cost by £214,000.  I trust the Minister is making a note so that, with his characteristic honesty and straightforwardness, he can give us a reproduction of this little list in column 5 to explain the reasons for these increases.  The Army, another social service, has gone up by a trifle of £2,108,000, and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, whose activities are now answered for by the mild and inoffensive Minister we have, has increased in cost by £423,000.  Army pensions are up by £388,000.  I wonder would the Minister explain to us the reasons for these increases, and I wonder did he ask his economy committee, which he says completely failed to recommend any acceptable economies to him, to inquire into these increases to see whether nothing could be done to bring them down?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Childers when he said, during the discussion on the Central Fund Bill, that the question of our financial future was very grave and required close attention.  I think that is perfectly true.  Does this Budget statement show any indication that the Minister is awake to that fact? The <i>Irish Times</i> is satisfied, but do Deputies think that, in our conditions here and in our surrounding circumstances, it is desirable to balance our Budget by the borrowing of over £1,000,000?  I know that many Deputies will say: &ldquo;What is the borrowing of £1,000,000 when England is borrowing £2,000,000,000 to balance her Budget,&rdquo; but have Deputies ever thought of this, that, in the countries at war, these immense borrowed moneys are being rapidly expended, and that their expenditure represents, as to 60 per cent., the payment of wages to wage earners, with the result that, in England, the numbers of unemployed are decreasing daily and at a steadily accelerating rate, until, for the first time in 15 years, the unemployed figures in Great Britain are substantially below 1,000,000 people?  In this country, however, we are cheerfully borrowing, and we have immense numbers of persons engaged, not on productive <Col N="217" /> works, but on famine works throughout the West of Ireland, and approximately 100,000 people unemployed, and, but for the fact that thousands are emigrating to England, we would have nearly 150,000.  Has the Minister simply given up all hope of reducing expenditure?</P>
    <P>Many people thought that the developments on the Continent of Europe would result in so rapid an increase in the price of our agricultural exports that the increasing wealth would save the Minister and provide the extra national income out of which the inflated expenditure could be financed; but is it not nearly time we woke up to the fact that these immense prices which we hoped for are not going to materialise and that, in so far as they do materialise, they will be largely offset by our increasing costs of the raw materials of the agricultural industry which will fall upon us as a result of war conditions and as a result of the fact that, with the disappearance of the Norwegian mercantile fleet from the seven seas, we are obliged to import everything we want from outside through Great Britain and by licence of Great Britain?</P>
    <P>We did enjoy for the first months of the war a somewhat advantageous position, in that we were in a position to use neutral ships for direct shipment of many commodities to our own shores, but the day that Norway was invaded, the entire tramp fleet of Norway was taken off the oceans or taken into British hands, and we are now compelled by circumstances to import everything through one of the <i>entrepot</i> ports of Great Britain.  And it is to be borne in mind that any commodity delivered on the shores of Britain to-day becomes the property of one Department or another of the British Government and can be acquired by us only under their licence and, incidentally, only for the price at which they are prepared to give it to us.  By the mercy of God, we are dealing with reasonable people there.  As I have often said in this House, they are people who are too astute in business affairs ever to make a hard <Col N="218" /> bargain because they know that a hard bargain is a bad bargain, but, nevertheless, the result of it is going to be that the costs of our raw materials will be higher than they might otherwise be, and that is going to mean that our profits in this war are not going to be anything like the profits we made in the last war.</P>
    <P>In that situation, the taxation we are called on to bear is about twice or three times what we were required to carry during the war of 1914-1918.  The <i>Irish Times</i> may say that no citizen is interested in calculations or cares where the money comes from so long as he has not to find it, but surely even the <i>Irish Times</i>, decrepit as it may be, does not take the view that legislators should not know or care where the money comes from.  Surely if we are the trustees of the public welfare, we ought not to throw our hats in the air and say: &ldquo;We do not give a damn where it comes from so long as we get a chance of spending it.&rdquo;  We are the trustees of the people and if the people are tempted not to care where the money is coming from, is it not our public duty to tell them that no man can spend his patrimony and escape the workhouse in the end?</P>
    <P>Are we going deliberately to pursue a line of policy which will afford the people at present the pleasure of spending their patrimony in the certain foreknowledge that this country will end in the workhouse?  Because, if we are, we ought to ask ourselves what it means to a nation to end in the workhouse. There is no workhouse for nations.  The only system of public relief for a bankrupt sovereign State is the system of boarding out, and if this country goes smash, the world will board it out to some country that can manage it better than our own people showed themselves able to do.  Newfoundland found that, by bitter experience, to be true.  When she found herself unable to meet her commitments, the world boarded her out to the British Government and her sovereignty was pawned for the funds to redeem her debts.</P>
    <P>The danger to this country of invasion has been harped upon by the <Col N="219" /> Government.  I want to tell this House that the danger to the sovereign independence of this country from bankruptcy is just as great and just as fatal as the danger of invasion.  The collapse of Denmark may not have been glorious.  The collapse of Norway and Poland certainly was.  They went down fighting in defence of their sovereignty, but inglorious as the disappearance of Denmark may have been as a sovereign State, it will shine forth as an example amongst nations compared with this country if we lose our sovereignty because we could not manage our own affairs.  There is not a Minister sitting on the Front Bench who does not know that that danger overhangs us.  There is not a Minister amongst them who has the courage to face up to it, and to tell the people that the clap-trap and &ldquo;cod&rdquo; in the leading article of the <i>Irish Times</i> is of no significance and that it does matter where the money comes from, that it is something of vital interest to every citizen in this State that this country shall not live beyond its means indefinitely, that it is just as vital to the survival of this country, as a sovereign and independent nation, that we should meet our bills as that we should be in a position to defend the shores of this country against physical invasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there are limits to the burdens which he can create and impose upon our people. Would he be good enough to tell us, when he is winding up this debate, what those limits are?  What is the point beyond which he will not sponsor legislation?  He can be very easily deceived in this matter.  The Minister himself, in the course of his Budget statement, spoke of the rising Budgets of every State in the world but, in so speaking, he chose to compare our circumstances with those of the belligerent nations of the world.  He seemed to forget for the moment that we glory in a neutrality that has little of the glorious about it for me.  He forgot that there are some States, like Portugal, which are neutral and whilst this Minister is congratulating himself on his ability to keep step with the <Col N="220" /> belligerent nations in the scale of their expenditure, the Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr. Salazar, is congratulating himself, rightly congratulating himself, that he has at last reached the point when he has extinguished the entire external debt of Portugal.  Surely, that is worth thinking about or are we to assume that neutrality is more expensive and more onerous to the community than war?  Perhaps if that thought were carried home, some people who are so passionately anxious for the glories of neutrality might choose what appears to me to be the more honourable course.</P>
    <P>I have said before, and I say now, that I believe we have reached the point where it is doubtful whether any political Government can save this country from a financial crisis, to escape from which it would be necessary to get outside help.  I regard that as an appalling disaster to this country. I know that so long as there are funds at the disposal of the joint stock banks, so long as they have external assets in excess of their external liabilities, the Government can scoop considerable sums out of them by way of loan.  It is right to say now that there comes a point in a banking system such as we have got in this country, if its traditional solvency and security are to be maintained, when you cannot further tie up your liquid funds in Government securities.  If Deputies of this House, or the <i>Irish Times</i>, believe that we can go on indefinitely squaring our Budgets by borrowing money, when every source of external borrowing is dried up, and the only means left is to get funds from the joint stock banks, they are doing the economic life of this country a very great injury.  I do not believe there is a financial centre in the world at present in which the Minister could float a loan for 6d.  If he cannot, the only substantial source of borrowed money for him is the banks of the country.  If he imagines, if any Deputy imagines, or if the <i>Irish Times</i> imagines, that we can carry on this country on money borrowed from the joint stock banks they are mad, and that is what this Budget means.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a reimposition of all <Col N="221" /> the taxes in last year's Budget and in the Supplementary Budget with the realisation of the increase in income-tax and £1,000,000 to boot, plus £1,000,000 odd, to be borrowed from someone.  Who is that someone? Where is the Government going to borrow?  If they borrow £1,000,000 and if they intend to maintain the same scale of expenditure as they are at present maintaining, if the war should continue and certain essential services bear more heavily upon us in future, where will they get the money to finance the necessities that lie ahead? Surely these are questions we should be asking ourselves now as trustees of the economic solvency of this country for the people.  There is no use in asking ourselves these questions when the crisis is upon us.  There is no use asking these questions on the morning the Government cannot draw cheques to pay their daily dues.  It is then too late to meet it and no combination of Parties, no adjustment of the democratic system of government is then adequate to meet that situation. Unless this democratic State looks forward to the day when that event may occur and makes provision before it occurs, as certain as we are in this room the arrival of that event may end democracy in this country or certainly end democracy as operated by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It means the end of government of the Irish people by the Irish people for the Irish people.  There may be substituted for it the tyranny of one individual supported by armed forces of one kind or another, or the detestable alternative of the surrender of our sovereign rights to some other nation for the purpose of restoring our finances to reasonable order.  These are two prospects which are too utterly horrible to contemplate.  But unless we grapple courageously with the national economic situation and reduce our annual expenditure to within that sum of money which can be raised by reasonable taxation, considering our national income, that fate lies ahead of us as certainly as to-morrow's day will dawn.  There is no use in the less-enlightened members of <Col N="222" /> the Fianna Fáil Party saying: &ldquo;You are only crying wolf.&rdquo;  It is the duty of any intelligent member of this House to cry wolf before the wolf is in the kitchen, because when it is in the kitchen you cannot get it out except at sacrifices that I for my part am not prepared to make.  The sooner that that plain, simple fact is driven home into the most solid skull on the Fianna Fáil Benches the better it will be for the country.</P>
    <P>That is the national aspect of this question.  But there is no shopkeeper in rural Ireland who does not see this problem from another angle; and I am a shopkeeper in rural Ireland.  The other angle from which this Budget must be viewed is the effect it has on the day-to-day life of the people.  Taxation bears heavily on us all.  But, to those of us who have a surplus, it merely means that we enjoy less comforts and less amenities than we have had in the past, and that is something that no individual citizen may legitimately complain of if the national need requires he should so suffer.  But, in addition to the taxes set out in the Budget of this year and the Finance Act of last year, there are the concealed taxes on flour, on sugar, and on milk consumed by the people of the City of Dublin and Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have frequently ventilated the nature of the concealed taxation on flour.  Before the war the millers were robbing the people of this country of £1 per sack of flour.  Since the war the process of calculating the amount of their robbery has become so complicated that I am no longer in a position to make the computation.  But I am satisfied that at this moment the millers are robbing our people of a substantial sum every year, and in evidence of that I call the dividends that are being paid by the big milling concerns of this country.  That robbery is being done with the connivance and by the leave of the Minister and his colleagues. There is also the concealed taxation on sugar, which amounted before the war to £1,000,000 per year, and which to-day represents in the form of direct and indirect taxation about 3d. per lb. of sugar.  There is <Col N="223" /> the concealed taxation on milk, which is imposed by a system of levy and payment to the milk producers to supply milk to this city and other cities of Ireland, a transference of the subsidy on milk from the Exchequer on to the backs of the consumers of milk.</P>
    <P>What I want to put to the House is this.  Grave as the consequences may be for society as a whole from the over-taxation of the comparatively well-to-do, that evil is nothing compared to the literal want that is imposed on the person who is earning 30/- a week; and there are thousands and thousands of people in this country whose weekly income is 30/- a week.  I want to ask Deputies, who, at least in so far as our parliamentary allowances are concerned, are circumstanced as I am, how could they live on 30/- a week?  I know a man who has a wife and five children and their sole income is 30/- a week. How does that man live?  He dresses his children in rags; that goes without saying; he is very lucky to be able to cover their nakedness at all.  Every time that man comes to my shop to buy a quarter of a stone of sugar, which is a modest ration for a family of seven people for a week, I collect from him in taxes for the Government on that quarter stone of sugar approximately 10½d.  When that man comes in to buy a cwt. of flour he buys it on the instalment plan, because he is quite unable to pay for it out of his weekly earnings. He gets a bag of flour and pays a couple of shillings on it and every week pays another couple of shillings. He cannot get another bag until he has completed the instalments on the first one.  If the bag of flour is used before he has been able to complete his instalments, he goes over to potatoes and salt, or Indian meal stirabout if he can afford it.  Every time he buys a bag of flour I have to charge him approximately 11/- more than he would pay for that bag of flour if he bought it in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not want the House to think that I am misleading them by failing to direct their attention to the fact that at present it is unquestionably <Col N="224" /> true the British are subsidising flour and that the gap between the price here and in Great Britain has been further widened by the fact that we are taxing flour and the British are subsidising it.  I do not honestly know what the price of flour would be in Great Britain and Northern Ireland if the British subsidy was not operating. But the fact remains that the man who has 30/- a week here is actually being asked to pay, not 11/- for his bag of flour, but 11/- more for his bag of flour than if he were living in Northern Ireland.  The price of a cwt. of flour in rural Ireland to-day is 22/-, more than two-thirds of that man's total wage.  If you take from his total wage his standing charges like rent and rates, a bag of flour nearly represents his entire week's earnings.  Of course, tobacco has long passed out of that man's life, because he has not been able to afford the price of a pipeful of tobacco for years; he simply gave up smoking.</P>
    <P>Do we consider that that is a satisfactory arrangement?  When we consider these facts, should we go on levying this money in order to maintain Lyracrompane bog, the industrial alcohol factories, and the purchase of immense quantities of ammunition which are going to serve no useful purpose? Does the Minister for Finance tell me that when these facts are brought to his attention his answer is: &ldquo;No, I must go on with Lyracrompane bog, I must maintain the industrial alcohol factories, because to give them up would be to lose face for my colleague the Minister for Supplies, and, therefore, these people must be screwed into the dirt by the price they have to pay for food, without which they cannot live, because I would not let my colleague lose face&rdquo;?  Surely these economies could, at least, be made for the reduction of the cost of food to the poor.  The British Government quite deliberately asked Sir John Orr and another man to consider the food problem of the poor in war time, and to tell them what food the poor must have in order to preserve basic health. We are not saying by any means that we want to level the poor down to the lowest subsistence, but our object is to <Col N="225" /> ensure that they get sufficient so that although surplus expenditure be on luxuries, those luxuries will not be purchased at the cost of essential foodstuffs to maintain the health of their children.  Having made a most exhaustive investigation from the dietetic point of view, Sir John Orr reported that they must be provided with flour, sugar, green vegetables, milk, and if possible, a bit of bacon. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You can leave out the rest.  If you can give them the other four things in adequate quantities, then you need not worry about malnutrition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whereupon the British Government said: &ldquo;Very well, we will subsidise these four things that are necessary for the maintenance of public health during the period of the crisis, so that no matter how poor, they will be guaranteed, at least, minimum quantities of those commodities requisite to maintain normal health, and no more.&rdquo; In fact, they said that no child would starve in England and that the poorest would be able to buy minimum quantities of food to keep body and soul together and maintain health.</P>
    <P>What do we do?  Do we subsidise these commodities?  Not at all.  Do we leave them at prices at which they would ordinarily be available?  Not at all.  We pick them out and tax them in this Budget, tax them in a Finance Act introduced into this House, incorporating provisions of Finance Acts that went before; tax them to the point that I have seen poor men unable to buy food that their children ought to have.  I have seen the children of prosperous persons, and the children of the poor, walk together to school, and I have seen the comfortable man's child growing, while the poor man's child shrunk away, and if there is any Deputy who wants proof of these words I will show him the two families I have in mind.  I have seen the parents of children, children whom I know are starving, coming to my counter to buy food to keep them alive&mdash;because he is not giving them food adequate to assuage their hunger&mdash;by instalments, <Col N="226" /> because he had not the money to pay for it on the nail.  I have known him to keep away, and not attempting to replenish the larder because he had not completed the instalments on the last consignment he got.  That is what this Budget is doing, and that is what the one before it did, but the <i>Irish Times</i> says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We neither will understand it nor seek to understand it, but just rejoice that we are not asked to pay any more&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What consolation is it to the man whose child is starving to be told that he need not pay any more?</P>
    <P>There are Deputies here who will say that this is exaggeration, that there is no one starving.  This fact cannot be too often repeated, starvation has a meaning other than the literal cry of a child who suffers the pangs of actual hunger.  Starvation can be of more kinds than one.  There is the starvation born of an empty stomach, the signal of which is that the child cries out for food and we hear it.  Those who run may read that signal.  You can fill that child's stomach with food and still the hunger pains, but its bones will be crooked, its face will be blue, and its physique will dwindle, until eventually it carries within its body all the potentialities of the invalid of middle age. Remember that is not the comfortable invalid with a pension or with a fixed income who can go to a spa or a convalescent home, but the invalid whose natural end is the county home.  To any trained observer such a child is as clearly starving, as the child crying with hunger is clearly starving to the uninitiated who passes it by.  I do not want to be taken as suggesting that the Minister for Finance is a heartless ghoul, dabbling his fingers in the blood of the poor.  I am quite sure that when his mind is directed to this question he is as sympathetic as I am, but it is his job to do something about it.  It is his job to take a stand in the Executive Council and say: &ldquo;I am prepared to listen with a sympathetic ear to the demand for further moneys for social services, but I have also got a duty, as <Col N="227" /> Minister for Finance, to speak for the poor, and that is to protest against a policy which is going to make permanent an intolerable burden of taxation on the food without which the poor must starve.&rdquo;  He is not doing that. He is consenting to a system which he knows is not making adequate nourishment available to the poor.</P>
    <P>I have obligations to the poor.  Do you realise who the poor are?  The poor are the people who are working on the land and they are poor because we fixed 30s. a week as their statutory wage.  It is the most that the industry can afford to pay.  They are the people we are all living out of.  It is the agricultural labourers and the people working on the land that are producing the wealth out of which we all live, out of which the professional men in this city and out of which the whole commerce of Ireland live.  They are the poor.  Is it any wonder democracy would collapse in this world when the people that democrats chose as trustees of their income convert the producers, the essential element of the population, without which the whole country would crash, into paupers and condemn them to the permanent shadow of hunger?</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is possible&mdash;and not unreasonable&mdash;to complain that his calculations are misleading, inasmuch as they follow the novel system of accountancy which was adopted by his colleague and predecessor, Mr. Seán MacEntee, but calculations appeal to nobody; the public, let us repeat, desires to know one thing only&mdash;how much it has to pay&mdash;and the answer is &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the mother of these five children who cannot get food for them, subscribe to that dictum, or does she legitimately complain that one man in Ireland is being asked to pay 11/- more than he ought to be asked to pay for the food to keep his children well; and is being asked to pay 12d. more for the quarter-stone of sugar which they must have than he ought to be asked to pay, and is her voice <Col N="228" /> not more eloquent to those of us who are proud to be drawn from such people than the gilded accents of the <i>Irish Times?</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should take Deputy Dillon's advice or warning and once more suggest that he is exaggerating the position, that, in actual fact, of all the countries in Europe at the present time, we are probably in the soundest position so far as our future is concerned.  We have noted that the savings of the people continue to a considerable degree, that our foreign trade has recently expanded, that there is no evidence in any of the indices of trade that we are approaching a calamitous position.  We also have the good fortune to have very large external investments of a kind which will continue to bear interest as long as there is any hope of our continuing any kind of export trade.  We have gilt-edged investments in the neighbouring country.  These securities may be in danger at a later date.  We cannot tell that, but we are at present in an extraordinarily lucky position. Having said that, I am, nevertheless, fully aware that we are opening a new era in our economic life through the intervention of the war and that a very dark future looms before us&mdash;not immediately but ultimately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, instead of making exaggerated statements about our present position, it would be a good thing if both sides of the House considered the position of the country when this war is ended, having regard to all the circumstances. I wonder if any Party is making sufficient provision for us to face the adversity that will come to us then.  It is well the people should know what adversity will come to them and that they should be prepared in advance to make the necessary sacrifices to meet it.  We should study the foundations on which we are building so as to see whether, at the end of this war, when, after a short period of temporary inflation, agricultural prices inevitably collapse, we are prepared to meet that collapse of prices.  We should consider the equipment we have in our community at large&mdash;equipment <Col N="229" /> both so far as the State and every individual farmer are concerned&mdash;to meet that collapse of prices and see how far we can alter our economy to meet the new conditions.</P>
    <P>In saying these things, I am not, as the Opposition might suggest, making any criticism of present Government policy.  Everything the Government has done in its economic policy to date has helped us to prepare, to a considerable degree, to face these conditions. To the degree that we have become self-sufficient will we benefit by that self-sufficiency during the present conflict. To the extent that we have induced our people to grow wheat, will we benefit during the present crisis. To the degree that we have met the housing problem will we have already given our people decent housing prior to a period when raw materials may be scarce?  We have secured a large proportion of our people from absolute want by our social services.  That again, in time of crisis, is a good thing to have done.</P>
    <P>I will now repeat the view of the Minister for Finance himself when, in his Budget Statement, he commented on the nature of our export trade.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This brings me to another point &mdash;the character of our export trade. The demand from our principal market may increase by direct war-buying and by the withdrawal, in whole or in part, of other supplies. But it is too often and too hastily assumed in this country that such demand takes no account of cost, and that, accordingly, we are relieved for the present from any obligation to produce for that market on sound commercial lines.  There is also a widespread belief that quality does not matter, that big profits are going to be made and that the burden of rising costs can be lightly accepted and easily passed on to the consumer. Whether we take the short-term or the long-term view of the position, it should be realised by all that this is far from being the case.  Costs of production must be kept down to the minimum.  There is not going to be <Col N="230" /> now, as there was a quarter of a century ago, a continuous upward surge of demand and of prices, due to unregulated buying and defective monetary policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the warning of the Minister so far as our future is concerned.  In view of that, I think we should study the question of our development in this State coldly and deliberately not only with reference to recent years but since the foundation of the State and find out whether there is not some fundamental factor lacking in our community which needs to be corrected if we are to face these new conditions.  I think we should account for past facts to indicate their effect on the future and take whatever bold action is necessary for curbing the weaknesses in our financial structure.</P>
    <P>All of us admit that agriculture is the foundation of the State, that it occupies 48 per cent. of our people, that eleven-sixteenths of our land is purely agricultural land, that 10,000,000 acres are free for export purposes aside from those acres we can use for the purpose of supplying our own needs.  We know that 30 per cent. of the income of the country comes from agriculture and that, at least, another 30 per cent. depends, in its turn, on that income.  It is time those in political life, who speak more with a desire to please the electorate than to face facts, should examine our relation to the world situation so far as agriculture is concerned.  We all know that agricultural demand in the world is inelastic.  Agricultural production goes on remaining the same while industrial production diminishes in order to curb the result of financial depression.  We know, for example, that if you take the figure of world production as 100 in 1924, it was 98 in 1925, and 102 in 1932.  In contrast with that, in the case of industry the figure of 90 in 1925, had gone down in 1931 to 73, indicating that less was being produced in order to meet the reduced demand and the reduction in price.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in the most highly competitive industry in the whole world, an industry whose producers <Col N="231" /> are unable to organise themselves as, for example, those who take part in the activities of the international steel cartels organise themselves.  We are at the mercy of the world situation so far as agriculture is concerned.  We know also that in every country the peoples of other countries have found it difficult, if not almost impossible, to reduce their cost of production to enable farmers to make profits and, if we study the figures given in the League of Nations Economic Handbook, we will find that for the year 1932 the majority of the farmers of all the principal countries of Europe were making losses on their farm operations, quite apart from any local situation which we might have had here.  Therefore, the whole business of farming has been at a low ebb during the last 10 years and we may assume that after this war is over the situation will revert more or less to what it was in 1932, if not to a still worse position. We know also that we have a market available to us, but how much of that market will remain at the end of the conflict and what the price will be are matters for speculation.  We can take it that we shall have to face a very serious issue.</P>
    <P>I want to place before you the situation so far as agriculture is concerned, not based on our unfortunate dispute during the last eight years, not based on the dispute we had after the foundation of the State, but taking the history of the State since its foundation, and I think it is time that every farmer sitting by his fireside in the evening should know what has been the economic development of this State since its foundation, that they all should know the truth and be made face the facts. In the light of the present Budget and the enormous burden of expenditure we have to bear, I think the farmers should study those facts.  I have taken a great deal of trouble to obtain information as far as possible from accurate sources, principally from the International Institute for Agriculture, with its foundation in Rome, and we may assume that whatever errors may exist in the statistics for the separate <Col N="232" /> countries, they are more or less of the same kind and the comparative figures may be regarded as having considerable value.</P>
    <P>Let me first of all examine the question of how far our cattle population has changed in comparison with that of other countries since the foundation of this State.  Taking the period 1923 to 1938, we find that the German cattle population went up 22 per cent.; the Danish cattle population went up 28 per cent., and the Irish cattle population diminished by 3.7 per cent.  I might mention that a considerable part of the decrease took place before the economic war began; in other words, there was no marked increase prior to the economic war.  In the case of New Zealand the cattle population increased by 29 per cent. and in Great Britain and Scotland the increase was 15 per cent.  Thus, there is a large capital increase indicated in the case of these countries, most of them rivals in our only market, whereas there was little or no increase in the case of our country.</P>
    <P>Let me now take the case of sheep. You will find a reduction in the case of Germany of 12 per cent.; a reduction in the case of Denmark of 50 per cent.&mdash;the numbers were very small in that country&mdash;and in our case there was an increase of 3 per cent.  In the case of our principal rivals the position was that in New Zealand there was an increase of 38 per cent. and in Great Britain an increase of 25 per cent.  That represents another failure on our part since the foundation of the State to increase our capital structure in so far as that particular type of trade is concerned.</P>
    <P>I now come to pigs and there was an increase in Germany between 1923 and 1938 of 64 per cent.; in Denmark the numbers were the same, but in our case the pigs are down by 17 per cent.  In Great Britain pigs have gone up by 36 per cent. and in New Zealand by 89 per cent.  Let me now take the case of a very ordinary farm product, the fowl. As regards fowl, they may sound unimportant, yet they represent 14 per cent. of our agricultural output.  In Belgium and Denmark there was an increase of 27 per cent. and in our own country <Col N="233" /> there was a reduction of 11 per cent.; in the Netherlands there was an increase of 14 per cent.; in the United Kingdom a decrease of 5.4 per cent. and in New Zealand an increase of 5.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>These are very important matters and they give us an idea of what we have to face in the future.  We have not yet got down to the fundamental fact that we must take advantage of our nationhood by increasing our production very largely.  Take the question of the increases in our animal population up to the time that the last Government took office.  In the case of cattle there was an increase of 3 per cent. between 1912 and 1921; in the case of milch cows there was an increase of 4 per cent.; in the case of sheep, 6 per cent., and in the case of pigs, 16 per cent., indicating there again that there was no large capital increase in our animal population.</P>
    <P>We have been for a very long time debating the question of the big and the small farmer.  Examining the annual population, where there were decreases they were greater in the case of the small farms and less in the case of the larger farms.  Where there were increases they were smaller in the case of the small farms and larger in the case of the larger farms, indicating that the whole production position of the small farmers needs revision.</P>
    <P>Now let me examine our position in relation to England's imports.  Taking the proportion which we enjoy of the total English market, the total volume of English imports, we find that in 1924 we enjoyed 4.3 per cent, and in 1932 4 per cent., a reduction from 1924. In 1938 we enjoyed only 2.49 per cent. In the case of Denmark we find that they enjoyed 4.2 per cent. in 1924 and it went up to 6.1 per cent. in 1932 and was reduced to 4.1 per cent. in 1938. They found alternative markets during that time and their total income increased by over 25 per cent. from 1925 to 1932.  In the case of New Zealand you find a steady improvement. Their English imports showed an increase from 3.5 in 1924 to 5 per cent. in 1938.  We find also in the case <Col N="234" /> of our other rivals there were increases at our expense.</P>
    <P>If we examine the yields of crops, we find that although in some cases we improved our yields enormously, other countries improved at a faster rate than we did.  These are important matters showing the position in regard to our live stock and our inability to compete in the English market.  In the matter of crop yields, it is interesting to examine the position.  We have naturally a fertile soil and our yields compare favourably with those of other European countries and yet, by modern methods of production, sound production, they are gradually increasing their yields and their income at our expense.</P>
    <P>I recommend the House to examine the figures for the yield of oats, a good Irish product and one which we manage successfully.  It is a product in which we have exceeded the efforts of other countries so far as our yield is concerned.  Let us see what has been done here since 1938 and what other countries have done in order to out-rival and outstrip us.  In the case of nine countries which principally grow wheat, we were second highest in the 1928-1931 period in our yield of crops. In 1938 we were fourth.  There was no great decrease, yet it is interesting to note the increases in other countries, countries that were low on the list before.  They increased enormously from the 1928-31 period to 1938.  By 1938 we had an increase of 7 per cent.; Belgium had increased by 22 per cent.; Denmark had increased by 61 per cent.; Finland had an increase of 100 per cent.; Holland 45 per cent., and New Zealand 17 per cent.  All those countries discovered new ways of treating oats more successfully and producing more oats per acre.  In that way they removed our advantage as far as that particular production is concerned.</P>
    <P>If one examines the question of output of agriculture here and compares it with those of other countries how does that output compare in terms of pounds sterling in our country?  While our output is £528 per 100 acres of crops and <Col N="235" /> pasture per year the output in Denmark is £1,115, England £822 and Scotland £759.  Then, again, if you take our more serious competitor, New Zealand, the country which exports frozen beef, mutton and butter and each of which competes with our products in the English market you will find that there has been an increasing production since 1918.  That increase in production has been nothing short of phenomenal.  You will find that the number of their dairy cows there in 1918 was 800,000; in 1938 it was 1.87 million cows; their sheep in the same time went up from 26,000,000 to 32,000,000; butter exported in 1921 from New Zealand was 900,000 cwts. and in 1937 it was 2.95 million cwts.</P>
    <P>That is the country that is continuing to be our greatest rival in the English market now.  If you study the figures of agricultural production in New Zealand since the beginning of the century they are astonishing.  The volume of production taking the 1900 figure as 100 is now 290, and their exports which were £13,000,000 in 1900 have now gone up to £35,000,000 at 1900 prices.  Then again I notice with pleasure that the Government this year are giving £100,000 additional subsidy for fertilisers.  Let us examine the situation as far as the treatment of grass land is concerned.  In New Zealand, 60 per cent. of the entire area of the finest grass land in the world in the North Island is sown with fertilisers every year.  The amount of fertilisers used has gone up from 200,000 tons in 1925 to 400,000 tons in 1936.  We find from those responsible for the conduct of agriculture in New Zealand that half the entire value of butter-fat production is based on the amount of fertilisers used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the further question of the future agricultural production, the securing of sufficient fertilisers is a very serious one for this country. What is the reason for this failure to improve in our position since we <Col N="236" /> obtained independence?  Why is it that the national income of this country even weighted according to prices remains so rigid?  Why is it that all that time a very large proportion of our grass land is practically derelict according to modern standards of grass cultivation?  Why is it that over two-thirds of the land was as backward at the end of this administration as it was at the end of the last administration? What is the cause of the lack of vitalisation? Is it that we lack intelligence? I instantly answer &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Is it because of any peculiar form of currency? The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, because our rivals have no remarkable forms of currency.  Is it because we are linked with English currency?  No, because some of our rivals have been linked to the Bank of England.  Is it because of some special trade relationship? No, because as far as that is concerned our condition is the same as other countries.  Is it due to the absence of credit?  No, because other countries that have been able to increase their production are in the same position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton might let me make my speech.  I am referring to agricultural production since 1922. I am giving figures that are correct. There has not been any great volume of increase in agriculture in this country since 1922.  I am not making any Party capital out of it.  It is an impossible situation considered in relation to this and other Budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the lack of increase in output is obvious.  It is due to the lack of peaceful conditions in this country. It is not the fault of this House.  It is the fault of the Irish people because they were divided amongst themselves. It is due principally to the fact that in my opinion we have done nothing substantial since 1922 to link up science with tradition in agriculture; whereas all our principal rivals operate agriculture on a purely scientific basis we have as yet left that task uncompleted. That is the only distinction I can find between this country and those other <Col N="237" /> countries that are successful rivals to us and that are more and more securing a bigger proportion of the English market at our expense and are continuing to do so ever since the foundation of this State.  To my mind this is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>One of the most fantastic facts that I met the other day was that the net output of industry, small as it was during the régime of the former Government was actually greater in 1926 than in 1931 while the net output of agriculture declined.  In spite of the falling prices and in spite of heavy competition and without any artificial protection or very small artificial protection the industrial production output actually increased by 10.9 per cent. from 1926 to 1931, according to the figures provided by those who were the economic friends of the Opposition.  Whatever the cause, we decreased in agricultural production by over 15 per cent.  I might add, of course, that our industrial production increased enormously during the period of our administration.</P>
    <P>While we gave very large employment and where net output in industry increased by £2,600,000 from 1926 to 1931, the increase from 1931 to 1937 was £9,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Either way, by prices or by bulk.  Now, it seems to me that in view of that position we should examine the situation that exists at present.  We may ask ourselves <Col N="238" /> whether in view of coming prices in the future, further self-sufficiency is possible?  The answer is that from the standpoint of war undoubtedly there are opportunities for further substantially safeguarding ourselves against possibilities later on.  If we examine self-sufficiency in relation to the ultimate future it is very difficult to say, but we can say this that it is definitely limited to a certain degree. We can make certain progress, but our progress is limited, and unless we are forced by world circumstances to adopt a different programme we can count on no great increase in prosperity by that means.</P>
      <P>The only other alternative besides examining the question of our production and of expanding our exports is an artificial limitation of imports through financial control which, I trust, will not be necessary.  Therefore, we arrive at the position that somehow in the future we have got to face the people of this country with the necessity for so far improving their output per acre and so far lowering their costs of production, that they can face the future with confidence.  In my opinion that is going to be very difficult to do. How many farmers in this country at this moment know that there are ten farmers to their one in our rival markets pouring out fertilisers on their land, taking advantage of the most modern methods of education and converting their farms from being farms run purely by traditional methods to the extent that they can almost be described as factories for producing food? How many farmers in this country are aware of that position and how many of them are aware of the fact that that condition is going to continue: that at the end of the war there will be nothing to stop the same steady scientific methods of the New Zealand farmers from continuing to place us still more at the mercy of New Zealand even should there be a collapse of prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor will the decision of whether we are to adopt a purely <i>laissez faire</i> policy, indicated at one time by the Opposition, or whether we are to continue a policy of high protection finally make the difference.  This question of <Col N="239" /> producing more at a lower cost is ultimately partly one of human initiative. There has evidently been, ever since the establishment of this State, a lack of will to produce more on the part of the agricultural community.  There is something there which they need and which they have not had, something they will require to be taught and which they have not been taught, but no Party and no Government has yet made them face up to the fact that when this State was founded there should have been sacrifices made by everybody: that if the young generation were to benefit by independence the older generation and the younger would have to work harder, to expect, if anything, less advantages rather than more advantages, and that this must continue until we can increase our production and so defend ourselves and make ourselves impregnable against any violent lowering of world prices.</P>
    <P>There is no blame on anybody in this House for that, but as I have said we have had a disturbed condition of affairs in this country and an acute division of opinion amongst our people. The fact remains that no matter what any Government does in this country, at least 80 per cent. of the whole effort required has to come from the people rather than from the Government. The necessity of making our people realise that was never greater than to-day.  We hear Deputies on both sides of the House admit that.  It is not for me in this House to make suggestions as to how that should be faced, but when we are discussing the Budget, I think it is the duty of Deputies on both sides to realise that that position exists: that if we are to continue the present burden of expenditure there will have to be a mental revolution on the part of the people of this country, and also a recognition, on the part of members on both sides of the House, that this House, for reasons excusable or otherwise, has never yet given a lead to the people of this country since the foundation of the State.  Now, there is a great deal of good that we have done in this House.  I do not wish to asperse the <Col N="240" /> qualities of democracy.  I do not wish to suggest that any individual member of the House has failed to act up sincerely according to his own beliefs. I am as much responsible as anybody else for that because, although I am a young member of the House, I have been in politics and have said the same things as everybody else has said, but the fact remains that the position is a serious one.  I think that in guiding the future of this country, in considering this Budget, we could do more good to the people of this country if we were to consider our position since the foundation of the State rather than in continuing the eternal squabble on issues in respect of which both Parties have definitely modified their opinions: we should be doing more good to the country if, instead of concentrating on those issues, we considered our life since the foundation of this State, and I commend that view to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest, I confess, to the speech of Deputy Childers.  I grant him immediately that by the statistics he quoted as regards the advances that have been made in other countries, he has put a problem that, I think, the whole House, and particularly the Government, ought to consider.  I am not going to try to make any Party capital whatsoever out of his speech, but he ought to recognise, I think, that if he will indulge in asking explanations he is bound to get them, according to the views of the people who think they can give them.  I shall try to give them without any bitterness or any controversy.  The position that the Deputy has dealt with is very unsatisfactory, but I do not think it is quite fair to throw the major portion of the blame for that condition on the farmers.  Let us consider their position, say, during three distinct periods: the period of the last War, referred to also in the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance, in which they could get any price practically they wished for anything they produced, and then they had no need to bother too much about quality.  Then came the postWar years which were exceedingly difficult.  Now the farmers are not <Col N="241" /> alone&mdash;I suggest that the members of this House can at least rival them in this&mdash;in failing to overcome difficulties consequent on a change of policy.  A new situation confronted the farmers and the people of this country between the years 1922, when this State was set up, and, say, the period when we left office.  If the Deputy will look into the matter he will, I think, find that it is not a fact that the then Ministry was quiescent in accepting that anything was good enough, nor do I think it is true to say either that on the whole the farmers did not come to respond.</P>
      <P>In the Budget statement, as well as in the speech of the Deputy, there is a reference to the necessity of improving quality.  If there was one place in which our Government did make a strong, definite effort to increase quality, to get everybody in this country to realise the necessity of bringing our farming methods up to date, it was in connection with agriculture. It was the life work of the late Mr. Hogan to try to do that.  All his thoughts were governed by that particular effort.  Remember, however, as a result of what he received, he was starting, so to speak, behind scratch; he had to try to bring the methods of this country up to date.  He tried, and tried manfully.  I believe there was a certain amount of grumbling.  That was natural, it would be made by any other class of the community if similar reforms were attempted and if efforts were made to enforce those reforms on them.  Yet, on the whole, that policy succeeded admirably.  Then came another period in which there was a complete reversal of that policy, in which the farmer was taught, by speeches from responsible Ministers, that production for the foreign market was not to be his main effort, that it would not pay and that he should drop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have, therefore, three periods of about eight years each, during which the farmers were subjected to three different types of policy.  One was: &ldquo;Go-as-you-please&rdquo;: that was during the last European war.  Then: &ldquo;Improve your methods, because only <Col N="242" /> in that way can you even keep your hold on the foreign market.&rdquo;  The policy of the third period was: &ldquo;The foreign market must go.&rdquo;  Can you blame the farming community if they are not as up to date as Deputy Childers would like them to be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that, and I am glad that the Deputy has had the opportunity to say so, as blame of them seemed to have been the burden of portion of his speech&mdash; of the end of it.  Here were the farmers, confronted with three different types of policy.  I suggest to the Deputy that the policy pursued, as far as agriculture is concerned, between 1922 and 1931 was sound.  I put it to him also that that sound policy was overshadowed for a number of years &mdash;not for ever, I am glad to say&mdash;by politics.  I do not say whether they were good politics or not, but let me put it in this way without being offensive; for pure political considerations that policy was scrapped for a certain period.  I am glad to see it advocated now and accepted fully by all sides of the House.  I hope that we can regard as something quite definite for the future not merely the views put forward by Deputy Childers but the actual statement of the Minister for Finance himself&mdash;quoted, I think, by the Deputy:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have to rely on our export trade&mdash;and that means on our agriculture&mdash;to ensure that in spite of vast war demands we will obtain the wide range of imports required to maintain stability of conditions at home.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He lays down that, in order to do that, the quality must be attended to. I put it to the Deputy&mdash;since he asks the question&mdash;that that was the policy in agriculture of the late Mr. Hogan from start to finish of his political career.  It is sound policy, and I am glad that it is being adopted&mdash;if we are to take the words at their face value&mdash;and that its soundness is being fully realised by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> The struggle is going to be difficult; I think the Deputy is quite right in saying that.  I may not be as competent as he is to know what the problems of the future will be.  If&mdash;as seems likely&mdash;this is going to be a long war, I confess that I, for one, have no conception of the world or the Europe which is going to come out of the war. That it will mean a fundamental change in many matters, I think, is probable: that it will bring forward grave problems, as Deputy Childers has suggested, is almost inevitable, and I fear that those problems may be even much more grave than he has suggested.  I am afraid there were occasions when both the Minister for Finance and Deputy Childers showed in their speeches evidence of complacency; and we ought to ask ourselves if that complacency is due to anything we have done.  It was summed up by Deputy Childers in two words&mdash;though I do not know if he meant it in that way&mdash;we are in a &ldquo;lucky position.&rdquo;  That is just it; we have escaped the main onslaught of the European War, and up to the present we have escaped the principal repercussions from that war, not through any great foresight on our part, but through our being in a lucky position&mdash;a lucky position, metaphorically, in the sense that we are able to be neutral in this particular war, and in a lucky position also in our geographical situation, in our not being on the direct route to either of the belligerents; and our luck in the first instance depends on that.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Deputy has stressed the necessity of thinking, not merely of the present Budget but of the situation which is likely to confront a Minister for Finance who has to deal with a continued war position and what, perhaps, may be even more difficult, the situation that is likely to occur after the war.  I must confess that I do not find&mdash;and I wonder if the Deputy finds&mdash;any evidence in the Minister's Budget statement, to show that either of these two problems is seriously engaging the attention of the Minister or of his colleagues.  What is he doing?  He is saying, quite rightly, <Col N="244" /> that the war did not develop along the lines expected by everybody in every country.  The Minister confesses that it is largely due to that that the increased burden put on in the Supplementary Budget some six months ago need not be still further increased.  But he is deliberately shutting his eyes to precisely those problems which Deputy Childers wished him to consider.  We have got through those six months better than we thought we should, not on account of anything we have done, not because of the way in which we have tried to face our problems, but because the war did not turn out as everybody thought it would.  If the war continues as at the present time, no doubt we may have a little more respite so far as our immediate troubles are concerned.  I remember that, in this House, when we were discussing the question of peace and when we were somewhat pessimistic about it, I made the suggestion that we could have peace so long as England and France were content to submit&mdash; to use a perfectly neutral word&mdash;to the demands of Germany.  If they were prepared every six months to give way to those demands, then a short period of peace could be anticipated.  It is the same way now: I think now that the Minister can look forward with a certain amount of complacency even to another six months of undisturbed financial trouble&mdash;that is, without its being so serious that even he would have to wake up to it&mdash;if the belligerents, and especially England and France, decide that it is not really necessary to wage the war in order to win it.  However, just as I was not sure that there was no limit to which England and France would go to preserve the peace, I am not sure now, either, that they might not start waging the war, and then I fear that, on the return of the gloomy picture painted by the Minister for Finance six months ago, we shall have to wash off a little of the varnish the Minister has been able to put upon it in his Budget speech of yesterday.</P>
    <P>Now, elsewhere, we were told, in the speech to which we have listened, Governments have found it impossible <Col N="245" /> to reduce the costs of agricultural production, but what we object to, and strongly object to here, is not that our Government has set about the difficult task of reducing the costs of agricultural production, which is our principal industry&mdash;it is now admitted by everybody to be our mainstay and something on the success of which everything else depends&mdash;that is common ground now&mdash; it was not to that problem of diminishing the costs of agricultural production that our Ministers have turned their minds over a number of years, it is to increasing the costs of our agricultural production.  Other countries may have found it difficult, as Deputy Childers pointed out, to face the other problems placed on them by natural causes, but we have not been content with that.  We have deliberately gone out of our way to increase the costs of the raw material of the farmer and the costs which he must incur in order to buy.  We could at least have spared our farmers that.  Deputy Childers, quite rightly, has drawn attention to the slow advance we have made in all articles of agricultural production. That has been done again and again from these benches.  The attention of the Government has been called to it repeatedly from these benches, but I am glad that a voice comes from their own benches to call their attention to that important fact.</P>
    <P>Unless there is that increased production the Minister for Finance must recognise that he or his successor will have an impossible task to face in this country if the war lasts, and a still more impossible task, perhaps, when the war ends.  We have to see that we are not caught in some of the difficulties that followed the cessation of the late war.  If, for instance, we see Great Britain making every effort to prevent what happened in the last war&mdash;the quick inflation of prices&mdash;then we ought to have some foresight with a view to guarding against the more obvious problems that we may have to face.  There may be others, as I have said already, the nature of which no one can foretell, but at least as much foresight as we have ought to be applied to that particular matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> Now, there was one matter raised in the speech made by Deputy Childers that he did not pursue.  I wonder where it would lead, and I wonder whether the country as a whole would care to face it.  The Deputy passed rather quickly over the effect of what I shall call the division of land.  He did not call it by that name, but he did point out that the decline or, as the case may be, the lack of progress, in productivity was more marked in in the case of the small farm than in that of the large farm.  I think the Deputy will acknowledge that that brings him into much more complicated and difficult problems upon which he did not even touch.  What lesson are we to draw from that, or did the Deputy want a lesson to be drawn from it?  Evidently not, since the Deputy shakes his head.  Then it was merely a matter of information for the House, but what I thought was that he would dwell on the lesson that was to be drawn.  However, I gather from the shake of his head that he deliberately refrains from that.</P>

However, as the Deputy did not pursue that matter, I do not intend to pursue it further, but I warn him that the problem is there.  Now, we have £100,000 for fertilisers.  After a great deal of cogitation the Government have determined to increase their grant by that extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for next year.  Let us consider the way in which they have helped, at the expense of the consumer or the taxpayer&mdash;and in tackling this question I make no distinction between them&mdash;let us consider the way in which they have given help to other industries not so vital as farming.  Here, when they realise, as I presume they do realise, the importance of increased productivity, this is as far as they can go in that particular matter.  Yet, I put it to the Minister that the consuming public is salted, and salted very severely, for the upkeep of industries that have not one-hundredth part of the value of agriculture, and the production of which cannot stand in the scale for an instant against the increased productivity on the part of agriculture. That is what makes me uneasy about some phrases in this Budget statement that otherwise I should accept with a great deal of pleasure.  In other words, I do not know how far they go beyond the mere words of the Minister.  I admit that is a gain in itself, but it is when I come to take the words of the Minister and compare these words with his performance that I am profoundly disappointed and really uneasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the question of economy. There are various portions of this Budget Statement from which you would think that the Minister had the question of economy at heart, but when you come to performance it is quite obvious that he has no intention, so to speak, of honouring what he considers to be a very wise policy.  From this side of the House we have put forward, in considerable detail, various economies that might be effected.  We have never concealed our belief that the increased expenditure on the Army is unjustified.  I believe that the defence of this country, or the better defence of this country, does not depend in the slightest on any of the increased expenditure for which the Department of Defence has been responsible in the last 18 months.  If I may again borrow the two words of Deputy Childers, I believe that the defence of this country depends on our <Col N="248" />&ldquo;lucky position&rdquo;, and I think the Minister himself will realise, and everybody will realise, that the real defence of this country does not depend on us at all.  I do not say that other people are protecting us for the love of us&mdash;I am not pretending that&mdash;but it is in the interests of other people to protect us for the love of themselves.  It is on the efficacy of that defence that our safety depends, much more than on any increased and wasteful expenditure in which the Ministry has indulged, as I say, for the last 18 months.  I think that is plain.  I think it must be plain, even to the Government.  What I object to is the slowness with which they react to obvious evidence.  I do not wish, any more than Deputy Childers wishes, to go into the past. It was he drew me into the past.  I do not wish to go into the past but I think that if the Government had realised the necessity for changing policy more quickly than they have done in many vital instances, the position of the country would be much more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I must say that I cannot at all sympathise with the Minister getting any comfort out of the fact that in other countries men holding similar positions have had to face vast expenditure. That is no indication that a similar course was necessary for us.  We have not to base our expenditure on the expenditure of countries that were liable to invasion at any moment.  We must take advantage&mdash;it is blindness not to take advantage&mdash;of what has been described as our lucky position, and if other countries have found it necessary to increase their expenditure enormously&mdash;and often, I am sorry to say, quite ineffectively&mdash;for defensive purposes, that is no justification whatsoever for our laying any balm to our heart because we are following the same road.  From beginning to end of the various debates on defence, I have never heard or read any argument put forward by the Ministers to show that what they have done in the way of increased expenditure for defence is of any service.  I think the Minister for <Col N="249" /> Finance ought be the first to realise that.</P>
    <P>There was a statement in which the Minister justified his expenditure and he used one sentence that perhaps I might call to his mind&mdash;I was anxious to call it to the attention of his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;namely:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since I assumed office as Minister for Finance it has been my object, in the course of the necessarily detailed study I have had to make of the many problems arising in the financial affairs of our country&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is not what I want to call attention to, I may tell the Minister.  I do not want to break into his profound studies of these problems.  It is the next thing&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to concern myself in the first place with ends rather than means and not to refuse the support of the public purse to schemes and projects which, on a strictly accountancy basis, could not be reckoned as profit-earning or revenue-producing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And yet, I think, his Department, as a whole, he himself, his predecessor, possibly, and the permanent Parliamentary Secretary, permanent during the tenure of office of the Ministers opposite, have turned down various important useful works, nationally useful works, on the ground that they were not economic, such as various drainage schemes, schemes that will have to be done sometime, schemes that will be undertaken by some Government, schemes that the longer they are postponed, will cost all the more.  If that phrase of the Minister is borne in mind much more useful work than much of the work in which the Government has wasted money, in a way that shocks a large number of the people of this country, could be carried out.</P>
    <P>When the Minister got to speaking of social services, the things he lumped together in order to increase his expenditure on social services might cause some amusement.  We will soon think that, possibly, the whole maintenance of the Ministry is a social service.  Perhaps it is.  There were things put into social services that I do not know that even his predecessors <Col N="250" /> tried to do.  When he was speaking of borrowing, he said that he thought he was entitled to borrow one-fourth of the Unemployment Vote. Why?  Is it because the unemployment situation is such as to give him the hope that in the near future there will be a diminution of that sum?  Does not he know he will have to meet that sum year after year?  Does not he know his predecessor in one of his Budget statements said that unemployment was to be endemic&mdash;it would be always with us?  I am not criticising his predecessor for having said that, but does not the Minister realise that if the present policy goes on, unemployment is going to continue and that there is no justification for borrowing any portion of that particular sum on the grounds that it is capital expenditure?  What does that matter when you have to meet it every year, one year after another, and when, if the difficulties we have to face increase, we may have to increase that sum rather than diminish it?</P>
    <P>Dealing with that whole subject of the work provided by the Government by means of various sums of money that the Government are spending which might give work here and there throughout the country, we have in one particular page of the Budget statement a mounting sum&mdash;£2,000,000, £3,000,000, £4,000,000, £6,000,000, spent by the Government, but he was not satisfied until he brought it to £8,000,000.  I think in unemployment schemes alone, technically so called, he pointed out that some 24,000 people &mdash;I cannot remember for the moment the exact figure&mdash;were engaged in that way.  Does he not think that that raises a problem as to the value, from the employment point of view, of the industrial policy that was pursued with such vigour and determination for at least seven years of the Government's existence?  If the Government find it necessary to spend all that sum, not merely on unemployment relief, but also to act as employers on a very large scale, is not that a serious problem?  Is it not quite as serious as some of the problems raised by his supporter, Deputy Childers? The Government is becoming daily <Col N="251" /> one of the principal employers&mdash;I speak of unskilled work&mdash;and yet the inroads into the unemployment problem are not at all as drastic or as great as we would like to see.</P>
    <P>We have seen that despite this immense expenditure of public money, despite all that the community has to pay in the way of tariffs, which increase prices to the ordinary consumer a great deal more than the amount collected in tariffs, the rate of people taken into employment has not increased.  I put that merely as a problem&mdash;but a very grave one.  It is one that surely is worthy of engaging the attention of the Government.  Is it not possible&mdash;and I again put this before them&mdash;that in the policy of increasing taxation you may find money to enable the Government to employ people, but you must also, as a counterpart of that, take into account the fact that you may be depleting the ordinary private employment fund?  The situation is extremely complicated and I can well understand Ministers, when they came into office, thinking in their enthusiasm, that by a policy of increasing and heaping on tariffs, they could cope with the problem of unemployment, but I put it to them that after eight years' experience that whole question is worthy of drastic review.  Otherwise, I fear you will have a continuation of the system and you will have people being driven out of private employment and having to be taken into Government employment.</P>
    <P>So far as economies in general are concerned, I find very little evidence, unfortunately, in the Budget statement of any real effort in that respect.  In respect of one of the most outstanding cases where an effort at economy might have been tried, I feel that the Government having, so to speak, nailed its colours to the mast in connection with their defence policy, refuses to take them down now.  I think it is a pity because I think there is big unnecessary expense there.  If it is merely a question of face-saving, the Government ought to be above it, because the crisis is sufficiently grave to <Col N="252" /> warrant a real attack on the whole problem by the Government.  You may want money soon for other things.  Do not squander it now, and do not dry up the source of supply merely because we have escaped the worst effects of the war, owing to its extraordinary character, for the last six months.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the Budget statement to the cost of living.  I think the Minister should not base his references to the cost of living merely on the Civil Service, because it affects everybody.  It is not merely the civil servant who is affected by it, but the ordinary person with 30/- a week. What I want to point out is that, as a result of the war, without any contribution whatever from the Government, the prices of essential commodities to a man with from 30/- to £3 a week, the prices of what are necessary to keep him and his family alive, are bound to go up, and surely it is an occasion for seeing whether you cannot come to his relief by taking off at least the Government contributions to the increased cost of living to him.  The Minister implied that these prices were bound to go up in his Supplementary Budget statement, and he implies it now when dealing with the Civil Service&mdash;higher costs and higher wages, other higher costs and other higher wages, and so the spiral goes up.  Assuming for the moment that that is so, is it not a time for a revision of the additional burden which the Government has put on these costs?  If that is done, economies will have to be made, and I suggest that providing money for contingencies such as invasion which, so far as we can see, are not likely to occur, and for measures which, if these contingencies did occur, would probably be quite useless, is not justified when you have problems much more vital to the people than the hypothetical future which we are asked to face and for which we are asked to vote a couple of million pounds per year.</P>
    <P>If this other problem is not attacked, you are certainly going to have a much more dangerous problem in your big cities which will not be hypothetical&mdash; but a very real problem.  You will have that to face, and not the possibility of invasion, which, if it occurs, <Col N="253" /> we have not got the forces to repel. Compare our armaments with those which have gone down like nine-pins before the invasion of a modern big State, and let us ask ourselves what are the chances of invasion, put in the balance against the chances of unrest due to increasing prices and the stablisation of wages?  You have the possibility of that unrest, on the one hand, and a hypothetical invasion, on the other.  You make grossly inadequate provision, if you intend to rely on yourselves, to repel an invasion of that kind.  You might as well have made none.  I put it to the Government that it is time they sat down and attacked these problems, leaving what might be called ordinary political considerations out of it.  I recommend these things, for what they are worth, to the Minister's attention.  The future is extremely uncertain, and I think we shall have to face, as the Minister says, very grave problems, but they will have to be faced by everybody.  A drastic revision of policy must be necessary on the part of any Government in this country, and whatever Government is in, this country ought to have the courage and the determination to undertake that drastic revision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Childers opened his remarks by stating that he had gone to great trouble to get his facts accurately, and as he was dealing with the situation of the agricultural community, I immediately, and wrongly, assumed that he was getting his facts from the farming constituency he represents, County Longford.  He then stated that he had got his facts from the Institute of Agriculture which has its headquarters in Rome.  He gave a very interesting survey of the position of agriculture since the establishment of the State.  He showed how we were rated, our production and the decline in the various articles of that production, together with statistics of cattle, sheep, pigs and fowl.  He showed how we had not improved our position with respect to other countries in the production of cereals, but, at the end of his speech, he said that he did not feel called upon to suggest anything which would get over this great <Col N="254" /> difficulty, this lack of modernisation of our agricultural industry, which would enable us to get into the position of other countries.  He advanced the most extraordinary reason I ever heard, or ever will hear, for the fact that the farmers did not come up to the mark compared with their foreign competitors when he said that the fault was partly that of the Irish people and that the cause of it was the political disagreement in the country since the inception of the State.</P>
      <P>That is the most extraordinary reason I ever heard advanced for the failure of agriculture in this country, or even for the lack of enterprise in agriculture.  Little as I think of a farmer who supports the Fianna Fáil Party, I would not go so far as to suggest that the mere fact that he is foolish enough to support that Party makes him a very bad farmer, and it is quite possible that, even in the ranks of Fianna Fáil supporters, you might find an odd good farmer; but I cannot see how the Deputy can argue that the fact that there was political disagreement in the country affects agricultural production.  I could see how it would operate during the period of civil strife, when there was general economic upset, and upset also so far as the Government was concerned, but, from 1923 to 1938, which covers most of the period he dealt with, I do not see that the political disagreement of our farmers had anything to do with the lack of development of agriculture, or their disinclination to link, as he said, modern scientific methods with tradition. He made one most sinister remark, a remark I never want to hear in this House, because it suggests that there is one thing vitally necessary before any good can come to this country and that is a revolution.  What he actually did say was that a mental revolution on the part of the people was required.  One thing I do not want to hear of is a revolution, mental or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I do not mind social revolutions because a social revolution, as understood by the Labour Party, does not mean anything.  We have heard of social revolutions from the Labour Party for the past 20 years. That is the one kind of revolution I do not mind hearing people refer to.  It is something like a Utopia.  They talk a lot about it but they never do anything to bring it about as far as I can see.  As my friend Deputy Hickey asked on one occasion recently, what is the use of commemorative demonstrations unless something is done?  The same remark might apply to other questions.  What is the use of talking about them unless something is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put this problem to Deputy Childers.  Was it really the fault of the farmers that they did not attempt to improve their position from the scientific viewpoint, in the period mentioned? Was it possible for the individual Irish farmer at any time to do what had been done in other countries?  I do not think it was.  It was still more impossible for the last eight years.  No matter how desirable the improvements which Deputy Childers would like to see, it would appear as if it is going to be still more impossible for the Irish farmer to improve his position in the near future. The Deputy put his finger on the cause of all the trouble.  We are meeting a situation now totally unlike that which prevailed in the last Great War when the Irish farmers could demand any price they wished for their products. We are meeting a situation where we have a market in Great Britain and where one of our main competitors has been completely removed but with this difference.  Unless the Minister for Supplies and his colleague, the Minister <Col N="256" /> for Agriculture, have done something or hope to do something of which we are not aware, the Irish farmer has got to face a position this time that he cannot demand and get any price he wants for his produce.  He is going to be met with a system of very rigid control of prices as far as Britain is concerned.  To make matters worse, his costs of production are increasing daily.  Is any effort being made to reduce his costs of production?  The first step, to my mind, would be to find out how these costs have increased over a period of years, particularly for the past eight years.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Childers went to any farmer sitting, as he said, by his fireside in County Longford and asked him to suggest some means by which the cost of production of agricultural commodities could be reduced, I think that farmer would be able to point out, inside in his own house, outside in his yard or out of his account books if he kept account books, quite a number of items in which there have been needless increases in the cost of feeding stuffs and other commodities which he has to buy.  It is all very fine for Deputy Childers to talk here in the strain in which he did.  His statement was magnificent from the point of view of research and figures, but I do not think it was very helpful as a contribution towards a solution of the farmer's difficulties.  I suggest to him that, if he goes down to County Longford, he will find that the position at the moment is that, having regard to the feeling in the hearts of most Irish farmers, owing to what they have gone through in the past eight years and owing to the small prospect they see of pulling themselves out of the mire, it will be very hard to convince them, unless something drastic is done on their behalf, that they should link science with tradition in the manner he suggests.  Ninety-nine per cent. of them are not in a position to improve their circumstances.</P>
    <P>Forty or 50 years ago one might say that the Irish farmers were the slaves of the Irish landlords.  In the period immediately preceding the Great War many farmers were in low water and <Col N="257" /> were indebted to traders in the surrounding towns.  I am afraid that for the past five or six years they have gone back to that position again.  The small farmers of the country are indebted to practically everybody with whom they have had dealings&mdash;to the local traders, to the local creameries, to the local authorities for rates and very often to the Government for land annuities.  That position is due to no fault of their own.  Mind you, the position of the bulk of our farmers is such that unless there is an extraordinary improvement in prices, such as occurred during the Great War, they will not be able to pull themselves out of the mire very easily.  Actually what has been happening for some years past is that these farmers have been getting themselves deeper and deeper into the mire and they have carried with them into the mire traders in the smaller market towns.  The farmers are not in a position to meet their indebtedness to traders in the country towns and the traders in turn are not able to discharge the liabilities to their creditors. There you have the vicious circle and the burden of debt grows all round. That was one aspect of the situation which the Minister did not take into consideration when he was introducing his Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated himself on the fact that he was able to carry on without increasing taxation, but he completely overlooked one vital aspect of the whole matter, that whether he increases taxation now or not, he is looking for a sum of about £35,000,000. If he never put on another penny as long as he remains Minister for Finance, does he really believe that it is within the capacity of this country to bear that huge sum?  I am beginning to think that the attitude of the present Minister for Finance is similar to that which his predecessor seemed to have adopted towards the end of his term of office when, it was said on one famous occasion, he saw the map of Éire as that of a country bounded on the west side by the Phoenix Park and on the east side by the Irish Sea.  I wonder has the Minister any conception of the conditions under which <Col N="258" /> ordinary people have to live in the small country towns and in the countryside surrounding them&mdash;the small farmers, the casual labourers and the agricultural labourers living in these areas?  Has he any conception of the conditions under which they are existing at present?  Will he go down to any one of these towns, live there for a period of, say, three months and put himself into the position of a trader or a small farmer, or even live with such people for a while and watch the business they do in any particular week? Let him see the size of the markets in these particular areas.  All over the South of Ireland, where formerly there were flourishing weekly markets, these markets have now practically disappeared. The fact that they have disappeared means that the productivity of the farmer has disappeared and that the trader in the town is not doing a fraction of the business which he did formerly.  Again, both these things mean that neither the farmer nor the trader is in a position to contribute to the national revenue as he could have done in the days when prosperous markets were in existence.</P>
    <P>One amazing feature of the Minister's statement, one I was rather surprised that he had the coolness to mention, was the fact that in the first page and practically in the last page he completely reversed Fianna Fáil policy.  On the very first page, he pointed out that revenue had shown an unexampled resilience despite the strain of adverse conditions.  He went on to say that our import and export trade consequently did not suffer as seriously as was expected.  That is the death-knell of self-sufficiency in this country.  The real explanation why the Minister is not looking for extra money is that even during the war we are still importing so much that he is able to collect sufficient in tariffs to enable him to tide over this particular Budget.  At the other end he again reversed the Fianna Fáil policy and said that if we are to look forward to the future we have to think of our agricultural export trade.  It is a great pity that our imports referred to in the first page and our exports referred to <Col N="259" /> on the second-last page were not thought a little more highly of by his predecessor eight or nine years ago.  If his predecessor and the Government paid as much attention in those days to our export agricultural trade as the Minister now suggests they are likely to do, I do not think either the Minister for Supplies or the Minister for Agriculture need travel to England to try to improve our position.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I say this £35,000,000 is vastly beyond the power of the community to bear is this. Imports are still high and tariffs show an increase, the tariffs are being charged on the cost of the articles imported, and, as he said, the landing price includes freight and insurance. These articles, therefore, are imported and have to be bought by our people at a far higher cost than six or seven months ago.  That means nothing else than a reduction in the purchasing power of the community, because the people earning £1 or 30s., unlike the civil servants, have nobody to estimate the index figure of 85 for the cost-of-living bonus for them, and no matter how the Minister's tariff returns may have increased, because he has been collecting tariffs on goods the prices of which have increased for the people of the country, they are not in a position to get any more for their £1 or 30s. In fact, they are in the position that they get far less.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated himself on the fact that he had not lost on the revenue from motor cars and petrol.  He may be a little bit optimistic in thinking that these duties were up to the mark.  If I remember rightly, when the scare started last year, more petrol, oil, motor parts and motor cars were imported in a short period than were imported for quite a long time before.  Even though the Minister said that the motorists stood up bravely to the increased taxation, they may not stand up to it so well in the future.  He may not have that happy event occurring again of the extra imports for a month or so which helped him to bridge the gap.</P>
    <P>It is significant that every year for <Col N="260" /> the last few years there has been a reduction in estate and death duties. In my opinion that is definitely a sign of a reduction to a certain extent of the capital of the country.  I remember the previous Minister for Finance arguing on one occasion that that did not necessarily follow, because, he said, it was very often explained by a reduction in the value of stock exchange securities.  That explanation may be again offered.  I remember that when the Minister introduced his Supplementary Budget one of the optimistic features about it was that he increased the death duties on very large estates.  At the time everybody was wondering why he did that, because most people assumed that there were scarcely any estates of that kind in the country.  But the death duties have gone down despite the fact that, after increasing the rate of duty on very large estates, he succeeded a day or two afterwards in capturing duties from one exceptionally large estate. Apparently it was intelligent anticipation on his part last September when he expected this estate to fall in and therefore increased the rates.  Still the death duties have gone down.  I do not think the Minister can say that the drop in stock exchange securities will explain that, because I do not suppose that out of 80 per cent. of the people who pay death duties of 30/- or so on estates of £300 or £40 or £50 on estates up to £2,000, 75 per cent. would have to pay in stock exchange securities.  In the bulk of the probates or administrations taken out in country districts or towns stock exchange securities would be the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at the Minister's reference to the phrase coined during the last depression that &ldquo;Budgets are being worn unbalanced this year.&rdquo;  I think he must have forgotten what happened before he came into office, because if &ldquo;Budgets are being worn unbalanced this year,&rdquo; I suggest that the Minister is wearing the same suit as his predecessor was wearing for eight years.  As far as I remember, the wearing of unbalanced Budgets has been quite a popular fashion, particularly since Fianna Fáil came into office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> With regard to the White Paper which has been issued explanatory of the Budget, I do not think it is right that the Budget should be balanced by a series of extraordinary calculations. The first of these which helps to balance the Budget is No. 4 on the expenditure side: &ldquo;Deduct unemployment assistance saving, £125,000.&rdquo;  A saving on the Vote for unemployment assistance can only come about in two ways: (1) a reduction in the number of unemployed; (2) an alteration in the rates of assistance or a tightening-up of the regulations.  If the Minister is to get his saving by a reduction in the number of unemployed, like every other Deputy, I would be delighted to see it, but I do not believe it is possible.  I do not believe that the Minister is likely to effect any saving on the Unemployment Assistance Vote by a reduction in the number of unemployed. Assuming he does not get that reduction, how is he going to save £125,000?  He must do it either by altering the rate of assistance or by tightening-up the regulations.  Nobody will suggest, with the rising prices of the necessaries of life, that there could be any alteration in the rate of assistance. I do not believe either that anyone would suggest that there should be any tightening-up of the regulations. If there are any regulations in this country that are water-tight, they are the unemployment assistance regulations.</P>
    <P>Another little bit of financial jugglery is the deduction for capital expenditure to be defrayed by borrowing.  Any person would naturally assume from the term &ldquo;capital expenditure&rdquo; that it referred to non-recurring expenditure. Will the Minister say that the £500,000 for defence expenditure will be non-recurring?  If so, I shall be delighted to hear it.  I can understand the items with reference to the Air Force and afforestation.  Then the £350,000 to be borrowed for employment schemes is likely to be a recurring item, unless the Government have some plan for reducing the number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>When the Minister, with a very modest appreciation of his own power <Col N="262" /> said at the end of his statement that he possibly would have a microscopic surplus of £4,000, he was not doing badly, because he started off by juggling with figures for capital expenditure and possible savings to the extent of £1,194,000.  Actually it means that, on his own figures, he has to borrow practically £1,250,000 to balance the Budget, and is borrowing in respect of items which should be defrayed out of revenue in a particular year.</P>
    <P>He also stated that when a Commission for Economies was set up last year, he was attacked from all sides, but he did not say what he was attacked about.  He was attacked when it was suggested that the economies would take place on such items as housing grants.  I do not think anyone here heard that the Economy Committee suggested any economies that he would be inclined to agree with.  I remember that on the last occasion on which the previous Minister for Finance introduced his Budget, there was the worrying question of social services.  I do not think he went as far as the present Minister, who suggested that practically everything concerned the social services.  He put them down at £8,000,000 while his predecessor did not go beyond £4,000,000. Taking the tables in the Financial Statement, on which there are increases, it will be found that they vary from the President's Department to the Irish Tourist Board, and that they are likely to increase year by year.  The number of pensions is also likely to increase.  Salary increments as well as retirements are likely to increase, so that next year and the year after the Minister will probably have to spend more money on them.</P>
    <P>Coming to the heading B&mdash;services on which expenditure was less than the previous year&mdash;it appears that some of these are disappearing services. Is the saving on the Gárda Síochána due to the change in the system of mid-month advance of pay and to reserve stocks not purchased? That seems to be a cheerful sort of saving, because reserve stocks were not purchased.  The saving on the Department of Local Government is accounted for by less housing grants. <Col N="263" /> There is nothing in that to give the Government any cause for congratulation. There is nothing for congratulation on the part of the Government in connection with the items from 1 to 72, because the increases there are likely to be maintained.  If the country has to face a Budget of £35,000,000 this year it may have to face a bigger one next year.  Even if the Minister congratulated himself this year on being able to balance the Budget by jugglery, and without increasing taxation, he will have to face up to the fact that unless the demands are cut down in some way taxation will eventually be beyond the capacity of the people to bear, and that the yield from income-tax, foodstuffs and entertainment tax will diminish.  If the purchasing power of the people is hit the volume of receipts from these taxes will be reduced.</P>
    <P>There is no use in telling the House that the entertainment tax is up slightly during the last six months. Thanks be to goodness the effect of the war has been very slight in this country during the last six months, but it does not follow that the effect will be as slight for the ensuing six months. I will give an example of one type of casual employment that helped in rural areas, and that was building schemes promoted by boards of health, by private owners and by urban authorities. If building is going to slacken, as the Minister suggested in his Budget statement, because of the difficulty of getting supplies, then the only means of employment outside of agricultural work in rural areas will be gone, and the Government will have large numbers unemployed.  The purchasing power of these people will be gone if they have no wages, and they will become a charge on the unemployment assistance or the unemployment insurance Votes.  We would then be faced with a period when people would have less money to spend and less money to utilise in business and the capacity of the country to bear higher taxation would be growing less.  Accordingly the Minister will be getting less money than he gets under the present system.</P>
    <P>Seeing that Fianna Fáil has changed its mind, and that it has no plan to <Col N="264" /> deal with unemployment, I hope that steps will be taken to show some ray of hope to the taxpayers.  The Minister brought in what I consider to be a middle-aged Budget.  He had not the pluck to go forward, and had not the pluck to go backward.  He had not the pluck to say &ldquo;You have to face this expenditure&rdquo; or to say &ldquo;I might be able to do something about it but for the Opposition&rdquo;.  Will it ever happen again that anyone on the Fianna Fáil benches from the Minister, the ex-Minister, or Deputy Moore, down along will get up to tell us how the country could be run on £20,000,000?</P>

When it is 16 years too late that Party is coming to its senses.  Sixteen years too late they can thank themselves for having to spend £5,000,000 on the Army and on the Gárda.</P>

      <P>My opinion about the Budget is that there is much unreality about it, and having listened to Deputy Linehan I cannot say that there has been anything but a great deal of unreality about his speech.  The Deputy spoke at great length about Deputy Childers' reference to what was wanted in this country&mdash;a mental revolution. I am quite satisfied that Deputy Childers is as far away from a mental revolution as Deputy Linehan, but I hope that what Deputy Childers had in mind was the social revolution which, I hope, is going to come about in the immediate future.  In his Budget statement the Minister said: &ldquo;While solicitous in the interest of the taxpayers about economy, the Government <Col N="265" /> has at the same time not been unmindful of its paramount duty to help in remedying unemployment&rdquo;. One of the things I want to have faced definitely by Ministers is the question of unemployment.  There is no problem except that of war, that has brought so much suffering and sorrow to individuals, and that is such a great danger to moral development, to health, and also to the stability of the State than this unemployment problem.  I am rather surprised at the light way in which the Minister passed it over.  Of course, Deputy Linehan in his speech only referred to it to tell us what the Minister and his predecessor said.  The Deputy has somewhat the same views.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not, but he did not deal with unemployment. I say that there is a great lack of appreciation of the situation, and that we are not facing up to the reality of the unemployment problem.  I want to say to the Minister in all seriousness that I am quite satisfied that most of us do not fully appreciate what unemployment means.  With a view to bringing to the minds of the Government and members of this House what it means, I want to give a few facts. We have in Cork a scheme under which differential rents are charged to some of our tenants.  We have 2,797 tenants and out of that number we are charging differential rents to 779.  These differential rents&mdash;I hope Deputy Linehan as well as members on the Government benches will take note of this &mdash;are based on one-tenth of the total income of the families in these houses. We got a return from our housing superintendent in December, 1938, which showed that, out of 779 tenants, 177 families were living on an income of 20s. per week, 154 families on from 20s. to 30s. a week, 127 families on from 30s. to 40s., 79 families on from 40s. to 50s., and 90 families on from 50s. to 60s. per week.  Take the two first-mentioned figures.  They make a total of 331 families and the average is a little over six persons per family.  The members of these families are unemployed and they have been transferred to these houses.  I want the Minister <Col N="266" /> for Finance, who, I am satisfied has a good deal of human sympathy, to realise the position so far as these families are concerned.  I meet these grim cases every day and I am satisfied that we have not yet come to appreciate the gravity of the position regarding unemployment.</P>
      <P>Picture 331 families, with six persons per family, trying to exist on an income of between 20/- and 30/- a week&mdash;£400 odd between 1,980 persons. These people are paying some rent for their houses.  The lowest rents are 3/- and 3/6 per week.  That comes out of their income.  Take £50 out of the £400 and what has each person to live on?  He has something like 3/7 a week for seven days a week to feed, clothe and otherwise provide for himself. That is less than 6d. per day and that applies practically to 331 families.  If we were to get a record of all the unemployed homes in the city and of the thousands of unemployed not only in the big cities but in the urban areas, what standard of living would we find? I know what is happening behind the scenes.  I know the mentality of these men and I know of the rumblings in the minds of many of the unemployed. Unless people are working somewhere&mdash;in factory, field, docks or ware-house&mdash;any talking we do here will be of very little use.  I happened to have a conversation with a maternity nurse during the past week.  She had to go to the home of an unemployed person, whose wife was being confined.  When she went there, she found the woman lying on a mattress without a bed. There was only one bed in the home. She asked that a cup of tea be got for the poor woman who was ill.  The cup of tea was got only after some delay because there was no fire.  When the cup of tea was brought, the nurse asked for milk but there was no milk in the house.  I should like to know from Deputy Linehan or from the Minister whether we are doing our duty to these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said in his Budget statement that the burdens must be equally distributed amongst all sections of the community.  That is a fine statement but are we honest about it?  We are not honest regarding it.  We could <Col N="267" /> talk about no more serious problem than unemployment.  It is not being talked of here.  What is the position regarding widows and orphan children? What is the position of our old age pensioners who are trying to exist on 10/- a week?  What is that sum of 10/- a week worth to them as compared with its worth before the war?  I have listened to fine, long speeches and to opponents scoring off one another but I agree with Deputy Childers that we should forget about these things and try to solve these problems.  No Party will go further in doing that than the Labour Party.  We have not dealt with the people really affected in this Budget.  Probably because of the position I hold at the present time, I could sear the minds of members of the House with particulars of unemployed men and their wives and families.  If I were not in the position in which I am, I would probably not hear of these cases.  When we find families, including eight children of from 14 years to six months, occupying a room 12' by 9', I think it is time for us to take this problem seriously instead of scoring off one another in this House.  I agree with Deputy Childers, if he is serious in what he urges. What we want is a mental and social revolution to bring about the necessary changes.  I am glad Deputy Dillon has come in and I am sorry he was not here to hear some of the things I have said.  If we are to do our duty in this House, we must take cognisance of the big problem of unemployment. We shall not do our duty by delivering flowery speeches or by making clever points against opponents across the House.  I heard no reference in these speeches to the 120,000 unemployed or their dependents.  Neither did I hear any reference to the widows and orphans who are trying to live on an allowance of about 1/- per week per person.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have learned much since 1914-18 and it should be realised now that the attempt to maintain unimpaired standards, in the face of the additional burdens and losses caused by war, is not only doomed to <Col N="268" /> failure in its immediate objective but will cause the greatest economic difficulty and social injustice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever increases are being got by the workers are mere tokens to meet the changed conditions.  It is not fair to those who are trying to have social peace to make these statements because they are interpreted as meaning that they must not look for any increases.  Having regard to the facts I have given and to the general situation, I want to see the Minister tackle the unemployment problem vigorously. In view of the present crisis, we should be mobilising the resources of the nation so that by so doing we might arrive at some solution of the unemployment problem.  Because we have not done that, I say that the Budget has not the reality I would like to see it have.</P>

The effect of this amendment, in my opinion, will be to provide those people who have been screaming for a properly organised system of admission into the hospitals with a placebo and it tries to minimise the organised opposition that the Minister has met with from the other <Col N="269" /> side.  I think it is a perfect and an absolute disgrace, and I am sorry to see the Minister departing so far from a perfectly good scheme such as the one he presented in this House in the first instance.  This is just absolutely typical of the Government, this wavering and wobbling.  It is the same in every other Department, and that is what is responsible for the rotten position we have in the country to-day.</P>

      <P>I have only one point to mention.  There is still this position, that if a hospital becomes associated with the bed bureau scheme, by so doing, it takes on itself the responsibility arising under the complaint section.  That is the situation as I see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I still regard that as something of a defect.  I know the Minister takes the Departmental viewpoint, that you cannot have exceptions, but the Minister knows that nearly all the best rules are the rules that have most exceptions to them.  I do not see any reason why you could not have a bed bureau system which would include people who are taking the grants and people who are not taking the grants; impose on the people taking the grants the liability under the complaint section, and leave those that do not take the grants, but may still desire to assist the public with regard to information free from that liability.</P>

      <P>In connection with the regulations, there is no real obligation on anyone to do excessive point duty in regard to the operation of the legislation.  It might be possible to frame it so that you would have two classes of hospitals in the scheme, one that would be, with regard to representation, <i>ex officio.</i>  In that case they might have the beds and get the <Col N="271" /> information from the medical men and so on.  To that extent I think it might be possible to operate the Bill without imposing those obligations on the hospitals, while at the same time getting all the advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hannigan appears to take the line that the amendments agreed to by the Opposition and introduced by the Minister are designed to militate against the success of the bed bureau system.  I want to say explicitly that my desire was to see the bed bureau operate in respect to every bed in Dublin hospitals, but it appeared to me that if we were to impose a series of conditions which would make it impossible for religious to carry on their institutions we might have forced hospitals that were anxious to co-operate to the full in this bed bureau scheme to withdraw from the scheme, not because they objected to the bed bureau system, but because the Bill was in such a form that if they joined in the bed bureau system they would call down upon themselves conditions and regulations that would have made it impossible for them to carry on their hospitals in accordance with the practice that they were prepared to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Deputy Hannigan may take the view that the attitude of this House to the charitable hospitals of Dublin should have been a Draconian condemnation of their past, with a declaration that we were going to reform them in accordance with our concept of what was right and proper. My acquaintance with the hospitals may not be as exhaustive as Deputy Hannigan's, but it extends over many years both in respect to myself and to the generations that have gone before me who have been intimately associated with the charitable hospitals of this city, lay and religious.  And while not pretending for a moment that these institutions are perfect, any more than any other human institutions, I am convinced that the charitable hospitals <Col N="272" /> of this city did their best to cater for the destitute poor of the city, and that is what I am concerned with. I believe that the religious who operated those hospitals are infinitely more solicitous for the destitute poor of this city than either Deputy Hannigan or myself.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister wanted to make it possible for all the hospitals to come in under this Bill and so did the Leader of the Opposition.  I believe the result of the amendments introduced by the Minister will be to remove any objections that would have kept vital hospitals out of the scheme. Had the Minister's amendments not been introduced and adopted by this House I would, if the hospitals had consulted me, have advised them to remain out.  With these amendments incorporated in the Bill it would take a good deal of argument on the part of anyone in the City of Dublin to convince me that this Bill gave legitimate grounds for remaining outside the Bill.  The object I had in mind was to create a position which would make it perfectly easy for any hospital to come in.  I believe that we have achieved that purpose and it is a ludicrous misrepresentation of the Minister's attitude towards the Bill to say that he has submitted to this emasculation in order to get the Bill through.  I do not often go out of my way to pay tributes to Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government.  But the Minister's attitude on this Bill and his desire to meet reasonable objections on the part of Deputies, even though those objections may not have commended themselves to his advisers, is the kind of attitude that will produce decent legislation through this House. I am grateful for the extent to which the Minister has met reasonable representations in connection with this Bill. In doing so I am satisfied he has given this bed bureau scheme a chance of success that it would not have if it had passed in its unamended form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Dillon has said about religious communities not being able to run their hospitals if some method of supervision is exercised in relation to beds may be <Col N="273" /> correct, but I should like to point out this fact that members of the same religious communities who are running the hospitals, which he contends they would not continue to run if supervision over the beds were introduced, have a very good measure of control over hospitals under the Local Government Department.  That is a point it would be well for Deputies to bear in mind.  If it is reliably contended that these communities cannot run hospitals if supervision is exercised, I would be quite prepared to accept that.  But surely if that is the case the alternative proposition which I put up ought to be adopted, namely, that in these circumstances the important hospitals of the type to which Deputy Dillon refers should secure proper hospital facilities for non-paying patients in this city. The Minister in these circumstances must adopt the alternative scheme of setting up a central hospital to secure these facilities for the non-paying patients in the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have to say on this, as I indicated the other night, is that I have no views, one way or another, about municipal or State hospitals, but I do say this that we have all to admire the wonderful work done by the voluntary hospitals.  The position with reference to the bed bureau was that it was contemplated when the new hospitals were built that a bed bureau should be established on the lines of this Bill; there would not be the same difficulty then to set apart a number of free beds and it would be easier and less repugnant to the people concerned.  If we want to get success in this matter it depends a lot on co-operation. I have always been quite prepared to meet any reasonable objection for the purpose of getting that co-operation.  Time will tell how this Bill will work.  If we get that co-operation it will work satisfactorily.  I am quite satisfied that we will get that co-operation and that the Bill will be a success.  This Bill has been necessitated by the present needs that exist amongst the medical profession and amongst the social organisations who have nothing more at heart than to secure medical attendance and hospital accommodation <Col N="274" /> for people in need of it. Those claims have been pressed in my Department for a good while.  The necessity was there, and very often patients had to be taken from one hospital to another because of insufficient accommodation.  If there were a bed bureau, that would inform medical practitioners where beds were available. Co-operation under this Bill will be a success and it will serve a long-felt want.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, line 43, to delete the words &ldquo;or near&rdquo; and to add after the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; the words &ldquo;adjacent to the site of the existing hospitals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to see if we can fix the site for this hospital. In the course of the discussion on the Second Reading, it was variously debated whether or not any decision had been taken to have the site of the new hospital otherwise than either on or adjacent to the site of the existing hospitals.  There was definitely a rumour current in the city, a rumour which was ventilated in this House, that a decision had been taken, or at least that there was a proposal to move the hospital from the present site up to Cabra.  Towards the end of the debate a statement was made that no clear decision had been taken to move the new hospital up to Cabra.  Later, I think, Deputy Hannigan asked if the House could get an assurance that the site at Cabra would not be lightly decided upon.  I understood from the answer given to that question that, so far from there being any idea of lightly deciding on a transfer of the hospital from its present position to somewhere else, it was almost outside the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary that the site should be so moved.  I would like to have it definitely stated now that the site is not merely to be in the City of Dublin&mdash; that, of course, would include Cabra&mdash; but that it is to be adjacent to the existing hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, as far as I can, to tie the Parliamentary Secretary down to this: that the new hospital will be built either on the site of the existing hospitals, or will be convenient to it.  In that connection the Parliamentary Secretary, on the last occasion the Bill was before the House, conveyed to Deputies the idea that it would not <Col N="278" /> be possible to erect a 550-bed hospital on the present site.  Dublin members know something about the site of the existing hospitals, but whether they know the amount of space available there is another matter.  Country members, I think, would have gained the impression from the debate on the last occasion that the present Richmond Hospital is in an area where it is completely surrounded by buildings, huddled together and almost on top of it, and that even if the site was cleared, or in some way reconstructed, it would not permit of a proper hospital of the 550-bed type being erected there.  If that is the impression that was thought to be created it is an erroneous one, because there is plenty of room there.  I think it can be said that of all the public hospitals in Dublin the Richmond has probably more room for extension than any of them. The Hospitals Commission, so far from reporting against the present site, reported in favour of it.  The commission had certainly in their viewpoint the necessity for a hospital of at least the 550-bed type.  It is right to say that if the new hospital were to be extended beyond 600 beds it might be a bit cramped.  I am told that medical authorities do not favour going beyond the 550-bed type of hospital.  If provision is to be made for a hospital over and beyond that figure, I understand it becomes rather uneconomic.  Circumstances will drive towards making for the building of a hospital of the 550-bed type.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of room for that on the present site, and the Hospitals Commission have so reported.  In addition, a number of architects have been engaged in investigating the possibilities of the Richmond site, and of the type of hospital that could be erected there.  Without a single exception the architects believe that there is the fullest scope for a hospital of the 550-bed type on the present site.  I, personally, from previous acquaintance with the medical world, had opportunities of visiting the Richmond site.  I made it my business to visit it recently, and up to the date of my last visit I was not at all aware of the possibilities of extension that are <Col N="279" /> there.  The site would have to be cleared, and while that was being done, no doubt some transitory arrangements would have to be made so as to provide for patients while portion of the new building was going up.  But, from the point of view of space, there is ample room on the present site.  There is a tradition about the present Richmond Hospital. It serves an enormous proportion of the citizens of Dublin.  I do not think that the proposals spoken of here as regards a site elsewhere, and of providing transport facilities for students and for visitors wishing to visit patients would at all equate the convenience of the present site, and the opportunity it offers for students to get their teaching there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  In my opinion the ideal place to build a modern hospital is in the suburbs.  The three indispensable factors in the struggle against disease are sunlight, fresh air and quiet, and I cannot understand the arguments put forward here in an effort to deny the sick poor of Dublin that boon.  From my reading of the position in other countries I learn that modern public health planning would seem to place hospitals on the outskirts of the cities.  I can cite the Manchester Royal Infirmary which has recently been completed, the new General Hospital in Birmingham, which has been built well outside the city, and the new L.C.C. Hospital in London, which is to be as far out as Tooting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of Deputy McGilligan's assertions that a proper transport service would not equate the loss, I think that if we had a proper bus service running right up to the door at a cheap fare, that would more than compensate for the inconvenience which might to caused to students or to visitors generally.  The patient is the first person to be considered in relation to a hospital, and after that the nurses; and I do not think either patients or nurses would have anything to lose by this hospital being placed <Col N="280" /> on the outskirts of the city, in proper surroundings in its own grounds, where the patients would have the opportunity to recuperate.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I might repeat what I stated on the Second Reading, that no decision has been taken in the matter of the site.  It is true that the Cabra site was suggested in the course of discussions with representatives of the governing body of the present institutions, but beyond that no further definite action has been taken as regards the Cabra area.  At the same time, if I conveyed the impression that Cabra was outside consideration as a possible site, I should like to disabuse the minds of any Deputies who may have come to that conclusion as a result of the discussion on the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>In that connection I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the north-western suburb is rapidly becoming an extensive housing area.  Already the Corporation has provided 1,634 houses and developed an additional area for 2,085 houses.  As I stated before, on the Second Reading, the density of population is moving, and if the city continues to extend&mdash;as it may reasonably be anticipated to extend&mdash;in the Cabra area, a future time might find us in the position that we would have a very large area of the city and a very considerable proportion of the city's population outside the range of any of our big hospitals.  All these matters will have to be taken into consideration, and I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment, which would definitely tie the Minister to the selection of a site adjacent to the present site.  The town planning committee have views on that matter too, and it is quite possible that the building of the hospital on the existing site would come into conflict with the intentions of the town planning committee.  At any rate, the question of site will be very carefully considered on its merits, and points in favour of building on the existing site, or adjacent to it, will be fully examined, but I could not agree to tie the Minister definitely to that site, or to any other site.</P>

      <P>It seems to me to be an astonishing thing that Parliament should be asked to pass a measure for setting up a hospital without any clear idea having been arrived at by the Department or by the hospital authorities or by those others concerned with the work to be done in the new hospital, as to what the hospital scheme is going to be.  Not only do we not know what the scheme is going to be, but we know so little about the scheme that we have no idea as to the location of the site on which the hospital will be built.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is any reason in the world why the time of Parliament should be taken up in discussing this Bill, when sufficient time has not yet been given to bring together those concerned in this future hospital and to get them to proceed with their discussions, that they may have such a picture of the hospital and of the work to be done in it and of its relationship to the city that they can say whether they are going to have the Cabra site or the present site.  This is an absurd way to treat the House and it is a scandalous waste of time in the House.  Let those in the Department who bear responsibility for looking after this work, those concerned with the present hospital, those upon whom the work of the hospital in future is likely to fall and the municipal authorities sit down together and do their work, that they may get their brains clear as to what is being and ought to be done and then it would be time enough to ask Parliament to consider the question.  The idea of discussing a Bill of this kind when no one is able to say where the hospital is going to be built is absurd.  Until we know the site and its particular relationship to the Richmond Hospital we cannot know the conditions which should exist between it and its neighbours and we can have no conception of the general hospital scheme.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the Minister should look around before making up his mind.  The Dublin Corporation are building very large modern flats in the vicinity of the Richmond Hospital and they propose to continue <Col N="283" /> that when money is available.  To deprive people who now desire to live in those flats&mdash;and in the flats to be erected&mdash;of a convenient hospital is a question which should receive very great consideration.  Besides, I would point out that North Brunswick Street and its vicinity is a very decaying neighbourhood&mdash;very decaying indeed &mdash;and must soon, I hope, be cleansed, cleared up and rebuilt, and in this case you will be removing these hospitals, the Richmond, Hardwicke and Whitworth, some miles away from that neighbourhood.  I think that the Minister should treat that matter with very grave concern before suddenly deciding to take away facilities for medical treatment some miles from that locality.  I do not say that the Minister should not do so, if it is considered to be necessary, but I think that the Minister should survey the matter properly first and then make up his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal with regard to Cabra, which is still in the offing, is to remove a hospital that is conveniently situated to another situation about three miles from O'Connell Bridge, and about four miles from the nearest medical school.  I understood that the proposal was based on a number of grounds; the first, that the present Richmond site did not permit of the erection of a 550-bed hospital, but, as I am informed, that contention is a mistaken one.  I understand that the present site of the Richmond Hospital would allow for the erection of a 550-bed hospital, or one with even greater accommodation.  It is my information, however, that anything beyond a 600-bed hospital would be uneconomic, but if it is considered desirable to extend it, then there might be occasion for extending beyond the Richmond site.  The second objection was that there were certain institutions of a charitable nature that could not be removed, and that the only thing that was left was to move in either of two directions, one of which might encroach upon a certain medical institution in the city, and the other, alternatively, upon one of these charities.  Now, I understand that these difficulties have <Col N="284" /> been overcome by co-operation between the staff of the Richmond Hospital and that of Grangegorman.  With regard to the charity, the person concerned there is open to co-operation, and if co-operation is called for from the person concerned, accommodation will readily be found, and accommodation is sought for, and eagerly sought for, by those who are connected with the other public institution, because they believe that a conjunction between the two institutions would benefit the public, and also benefit each of the institutions.</P>
      <P>The only other objection that I thought I would hear more about was that voiced on the Third Reading by Deputy McCann.  It is peculiar that it was not voiced by the Minister.  Deputy McCann said that there is better air, and that there are more salubrious surroundings in Cabra than on the Richmond site.  That, however, was not the Minister's contention. The Minister said&mdash;perhaps I may be allowed to parody his words&mdash; something to the effect that the slums were getting out to Cabra, and that we ought to try to get ahead of them. That was his contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there was any suggestion of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was definitely mentioned.  The Minister's attitude was not concerned with the question of fresh air, but with the question of the slums moving out.  As against that, Deputy Kelly's suggestion is that this area in the vicinity of the Richmond is to be cleared, and that it will be better and more salubrious than it is at the moment.  In addition to that, you have in the vicinity the grounds of Grangegorman and of the King's Inns.  You have a certain breathing space, or lung, as it is called, in that area, which allows definitely for the provision of fresh air and the salubrious surroundings that Deputy McCann wants in Cabra.  Now, this question of fresh air, and so on, does not cut much ice with me, because I understand that the average length of stay of a patient in a hospital is about three weeks, and the difference of three weeks, as between the present site and <Col N="285" /> Cabra&mdash;particularly when, as we are told, the slums are moving out to Cabra&mdash;in the case of a patient, is not going to be very great.</P>
      <P>Against the proposal to move outside the present area there are certain important considerations, and the main one is this: if one takes the area where the Richmond Hospital is at the moment and gets a survey of the population in the immediate vicinity&mdash;not the population from which patients are drawn, because they come even from across the river on the south side&mdash;but if you take the population adjacent, as you may call it, to the hospital, you find that it includes about one-sixth of Dublin's population.  Why should a hospital that is convenient to one-sixth of Dublin's population be shifted out to Cabra?  There are three lots of people concerned there.  Firstly, you have the patients; secondly, the relatives who may want to visit them; and, thirdly, the medical staff&mdash;those who must be in touch with some teaching institution.</P>

Accordingly, as the deceased Deputy belonged to our Party, we propose that the writ be issued and will nominate a candidate.

      <P>The Minister, towards the end of his Budget speech yesterday, expressed great pleasure at his wonderful achievement and, evidently, that pleasure was supported and appreciated by the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil, because they thought it deserved applause.  It may be felt by some people also that because of the fact that there is no new imposition of taxation the Budget is a good one. Nevertheless, if we are to examine what the Budget really means for the country, we must examine it from the point of view of what is the aggregate amount of taxation required by the Minister at the present time, and how it compares with previous years, and of the trend taxation is generally taking in this country.  The figure asked for in the Budget is, approximately, £35,500,000 and, there is no doubt about it, that is an appalling sum of money for this relatively poor country to find in any year, particularly in view of the difficulties we have to face in the present year.  The Minister himself referred to the steady and relentless growth of expenditure, and expressed his concern with the increase in expenditure.  He told us <Col N="287" /> that he set up an economy committee last year which he thought might effect economies to the tune of about £400,000, and he admitted that the work of that committee has now proved to be a failure, and that little or no economies have been effected as a result.  Of course, at the end of his statement, he pointed out the necessity of expanding our production here in this country, particularly our agricultural production.  I want to say that if there is really any sincerity or any anxiety on the part of the Minister and on the part of the Government to help to increase agricultural production in this country, the best way in which that can be done is by lowering those burdens of taxation that are crippling the agricultural industry at the present time.  We have been pointing out here at every possible opportunity that one of the main reasons why we have not a prosperous agriculture in this country is that our agricultural people cannot possibly bear the present burden of taxation that is being ruthlessly imposed on them by the Government.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies on the other side have expressed their anxiety as to the present position, notably Deputy Childers.  I have listened to Deputy Childers with a good deal of attention, and he certainly is entitled to great credit for the way in which he has amassed a pile of statistics, giving very useful information, comparing our agricultural production with the various competitor countries.  Although Deputy Childers did not say so in so many words, there was a suggestion by innuendo that he felt it was the responsibility of the agricultural community themselves, that we were probably lazy and not prepared to put the necessary energy and enterprise into our work to effect that improvement that has been achieved in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that when he was questioned by Deputy O'Sullivan on that, he said that that was not his intention but, at the same time that was the impression that was conveyed to me. I felt that he had a good deal of contempt <Col N="288" /> for the agriculturists in this country, that they had failed to put their back into the job and that it was they alone that were responsible for the present situation in our agricultural industry.  I can only say that it is a pity that Deputy Childers had not to make his living on a farm in this country during the past eight or nine years. If he had, he might not have adopted the same attitude as he did here this evening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers went back and traced the history of agriculture in this country as compared with other countries since the beginning of the century. He tried to prove that agricultural output in this country has not improved to any appreciable extent over that period.  He was very anxious to concentrate on the period of office of the predecessors of the present Government. He tried to tell us that although we here talk a lot about agriculture, when our people were in office no real improvement was effected in agriculture in this country.  I do not agree with that at all and I do not think he gave us any figures to prove that.  We must bear in mind one very important consideration: During that period the world was gradually slipping into a very deep trough of depression that reached bottom about 1929.  Taking that into account and considering that most countries suffered very severely as a result of that depression, comparatively speaking, we weathered that depression and fared fairly well, very much better than most of our competitors.</P>
    <P>In regard to the many points he has discussed here this evening, I would like to tell Deputy Childers that the late Minister for Agriculture was rather keen on developing agriculture along those lines.  Deputy Childers spoke about the cultivation of grass in New Zealand and about the amount of artificial manures that was distributed on the North Island in New Zealand annually.  I suppose we cannot blame Deputy Childers for not having a particular knowledge of this, but prior to the present Government coming into office we were carrying out quite a lot of experiments in the cultivation of grass and rotational grazing in this country.  We were anxious to develop <Col N="289" /> a better system of grazing, to get the best results from grass, to promote early growth, to hold up certain divisions of farms so that we would have early production of grass.  A number of experiments was carried out and the farmers were advised along those lines. They were advised to carry out a system of rotational grazing and in the matter of dressing our grasslands. While that was going on we had a political Party in this country that was decrying that system of agriculture and was calling in derision the late Minister for Agriculture the &ldquo;Minister for Grass.&rdquo;  Now we have a man who is studying agriculture from a scientific aspect, coming into this House to tell us that that system is working admirably and talking about the phenomenal increase in agricultural production in New Zealand because agriculture has been worked along those lines.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a practical farmer, I do not think that we could ever effect the vast improvement in production that has occurred in New Zealand over that period, because there is no analogy between the two countries at all.  New Zealand was a semi-undeveloped country at the beginning of this century. It has a wonderful climate.  You might say there is no winter there at all.  It is a country which enjoys beautiful climatic conditions; it is very fertile, and has a small population. Naturally, with all the opportunities there for development, agricultural production has increased.  We were an old country, developed to a very large extent, and there was not the same possibility for development here over that period, but there is no doubt about it, that a good deal could be done for the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>One of the points particularly referred to by Deputy Childers has been stressed over and over again from these benches, that is, the liberal use of artificial manures on all our soils, irrespective of whether they are in cultivation or in grass. One is equally as important as the other, and we have often said here that artificial manures should be available to the farmer at such a price that he would not spare them, and that he would be prepared <Col N="290" /> to spread them liberally over his land. What was the position here?  Under the policy pursued by the Government when they came into office, artificial manure manufacturers in this country were prepared to manufacture the basic manure, superphosphate, at a competitive price in respect to imported manures.  There was immediately clapped on a tariff of 33? per cent on all imported manures, with the result that the manufacturers here naturally formed themselves into a ring and pushed up the price to a point just below the level of the protection afforded.  The result is, from my experience as a farmer&mdash;and I say it without any hesitation&mdash;that there are scarcely any people I know who attempted to dress grass lands in this country during the last eight or nine years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it is nearly too late and when we cannot get them. And when, some six or seven weeks ago, there was a danger of a shortage, we had to press on the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture the necessity of extending that subsidy to imported artificial manures. There is one matter on which we have always disagreed fundamentally with Fianna Fáil, that is, the necessity of protecting agriculture but not in the sense in which Fianna Fáil talks about protection.  It is possible to afford protection by putting on tariffs, but the tariffs which have really been most injurious to agriculture are those which have been given to people who have started any and every type of industry here, without any regard for the effects they may have on our major industry. Deputy Childers, who now bewails the agricultural position of the country, lent a helping hand in the starting of industries which were in no way beneficial from the national point of view and which threw back very serious burdens on the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must always bear in mind the fact that we, as agriculturists, are producing a commercial article, and that, by reason of modern transport facilities and modern methods of production, the use of tractors, and so on, in countries with bigger areas than we have, competition has made the price of agricultural produce so very keen to-day that the introduction of anything which may affect the cost of production has the effect of destroying production. That is what has happened in this country, and that is what is happening up to the present time.  Difficulties <Col N="293" /> have been introduced, and the tariff weapon has been used by the Government in such a manner as to increase the cost of production of the agricultural community and retard agricultural production.  In other words, there is a definite clash of interests between industry and agriculture here, and it has been ignored all the time.</P>
    <P>These loads, these burdens and these difficulties have been thrown back on our agricultural people, and, naturally, having over and over produced an article which results in no profit, the farmer's morale has been broken to such an extent that he is not inclined to try any further.  The situation is really serious, and I agree with Deputy Childers that it is a grave situation that agricultural production has not shown that resiliency, that tendency to improve, since the settlement of the economic war.  The reason is that the entire resources of agriculture, the financial resources and courage of our people, have been broken to such an extent that they are not inclined to try, and are not putting their backs into their work as they should.  Firstly, they are handicapped financially, and secondly, the experience of the last seven or eight years has broken their courage.  There is no use in Deputy Childers seeking to find the reason for that state of affairs amongst our agricultural people.  Let him look to his own Party and to the present Government. They alone must shoulder the full responsibility for the present state of agriculture.</P>
    <P>To get back to the Minister's statement on the Budget, one thing that would help agriculture would be to reduce the burden of taxation.  It has been said, inside and outside this House, that the country is groaning under these excessive burdens and that you cannot hope for an improvement in production while that continues. The Minister said that orthodoxy had no appeal to him, and that he had used unorthodox methods while he was Minister for Local Government.  We admit that he used unorthodox methods, that he mortgaged the future to provide housing and to finance other schemes for the last seven or eight years.  That is what he is doing <Col N="294" /> also in this Budget.  He may get certain people to agree that it is a good Budget because he balances it, balances ordinary normal current expenditure, by borrowing £2,000,000 and throwing on the future a load that we should dispense during the present year.  A man cannot borrow for his breakfast every morning he gets up. That method of existence would soon come to an end.  Borrowing may be all right if a farmer wants to build a house or a cowshed, but surely borrowing cannot be carried on year after year? The Government are borrowing £350,000 to relieve unemployment. They did the same last year and the year before.  Do they expect that unemployment is going to come to an end this year and that we are going to have no unemployment problems in the future?  Next year we shall have to provide for unemployment schemes also, and we shall have to bear in addition the burdens of this year, last year and the year before, as well as the burden for the coming year.  That is the manner in which taxation has been piling up.</P>
    <P>The one thing that has struck me about the Government's methods of solving the unemployment problem is that they have attempted to settle it wholly themselves.  That is the worst possible method.  It may be good politics, I suppose, to have a big percentage of our people feeding out of the Taoiseach's hands and feeling that they must rely for their very existence on Government sustenance, but it is bad financial policy and bad economic policy.  The tendency is to develop that situation to an increasing degree. More and more people are coming to look for their bread, their very existence, to funds supplied by the Government. The increase in unemployment in this country over a period of years has been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition and other Deputies.</P>
    <P>We have been told, and it has been admitted by the Minister, that the number put into employment last year amounted only to 1,000, whereas 9,000, 10,000 and 11,000 per annum were put into employment in the late Government's time.  That is a serious situation. The explanation of that is that <Col N="295" /> this whole system of economy is crippling private enterprise.  The policy of any Government should be to promote private enterprise and private employment, which is the best possible source of all employment.  It costs a good deal to raise the taxation by which the Government finances some of these employment schemes and further expense is incurred in distributing that taxation.  Very often the schemes which they adopt are of no utility to the country.  All the schemes are non-productive. The amount provided for the dole is £1,500,000, while a sum of £1,400,000 is provided for the Office of Public Works.  Then something like £300,000 has to be contributed by the local authorities for minor relief schemes.  Add to that the contributions made for housing, sewerage and water supplies and you have an enormous figure.</P>
    <P>Some of these may be good social schemes but I want to point out that this method of providing employment constitutes an enormous drain on the resources of the country and it is work that is of a largely non-productive character.  These schemes are purely palliative measures; they are no solution at all.  We have no return for the money spent on them, no wealth is produced for the country by them.  If an individual attempted to live on work of that character; if a farmer, for instance, attempted to live by clipping his hedges or repairing the gravel patches in front of his door and ignored the really essential farming work, he would not exist, as a self-supporting member of the community, for long.  This country has been living on its fat for the last seven or eight years by schemes of that sort.  We have never got down to brass tacks to find a real solution.  I suppose we can continue to borrow and pile up debt. The Minister told us that the dead-weight debt of this country was £54,000,000 and that our gross capital liability at the present time was £100,000,000.  Does that not represent an enormous increase in dead-weight debt for an infant State, a State that has been in existence for a few short years?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> In that connection, we might consider the warning that has been given to the country by the Banking Commission. The Minister referred to the fact in his statement that the Banking Commission had expressed alarm at the ever-growing debt of the country.  The Banking Commission report stated that &ldquo;the growth of expenditure and the large and continuous expansion of the burden of dead-weight debt is one of the most serious matters which we are called on to review.&rdquo;  They gave us figures as to the debt per head of the population in this country, a matter to which Deputy Childers might have referred and which might have explained why agricultural production in this country is not improving.  In 1937 you had a debt in Denmark of £59,500,000, or £16 per head of the population.  In 1937 our debt was £73,000,000, or £24 per head of the population.  That £73,000,000 has now become £100,000,000, an increase of one-third, which means that the debt per head of the population is now £36. Sweden had a debt of £20 per head of the population, but it has no dead-weight charge.  It is offset by productive funds.  Austria in 1937 had a dead-weight debt of £21 per head of the population.  Notwithstanding the grave warning of the Banking Commission at that time, we are going merrily on and we get a clap from the Fianna Fáil back benches because the Government keep steadily on with this system of increasing the dead-weight debt and dead-weight charges.  Are we going to call a halt before it is too late or is the Minister going completely to ignore orthodox methods, to continue piling up dead-weight debt until the banking institutions say: &ldquo;No, we are not going to provide you with any more facilities&rdquo;?  Will he then with his unorthodox methods start the printing presses going or what does he mean? Will the only alternative be the starting of some of these madcap schemes of social credit&mdash;some sort of currency manipulation?  It is no wonder that you have a group of people in this country who were supporters of the present Government saying that, now that the great experiment has been a failure, they have come to the conclusion that it is our financial system that is wrong, <Col N="297" /> and that if the system is wrong we shall have to go outside the system and create money.</P>
    <P>I join with other Deputies in warning the Government of the danger towards which this country is heading. I agree with Deputy Childers that the situation is very serious, and that it is certainly time we should call a halt.  I do not want the House to take it that I am opposed to the development of industry here, but an industry ought not to be started by simply ignoring the effects that it may have on agriculture. Before we start any industry we ought to see what effects, or bur den, any tariff imposed for the development of that particular industry throws on agriculture.  If any serious burden is thrown on agriculture, that industry is not worth risking.  We have put money into all kinds of experimental schemes on the system of trial by error. The Minister for Supplies said his policy was trial by elimination.  We are not such a wealthy country that we can afford that system of elimination. We certainly have opportunities in this country.  We have a market up against our door; we have a good climate and a fertile country.  Our people are as intelligent as any other people, and can work the land as ably as any other people provided they get the necessary opportunity and assistance.  I do not want to have them spoonfed, but they ought to be relieved of burdens that they cannot bear.</P>
    <P>Take the Road Fund, for instance. The Minister, in referring to the Road Fund, said: &ldquo;There is no more justification for appropriating the proceeds of taxation on motor vehicles for road improvement than there is, say, for appropriating the proceeds of the excise duty on beer to the improvement of publichouses.&rdquo;  Is there any analogy between the two?  Was the Minister trying to be funny?  He would not be so funny if he lived down the country and was trying to pay poor rates at their present level.  In effect, the Minister's proposal means robbing the ratepayers of £150,000 to get the Minister out of a difficulty so that he can say: &ldquo;I have balanced my Budget by some sort of manipulation or other, but it is balanced anyway, and I have <Col N="298" /> not to increase taxation.&rdquo;  Actually it is increasing taxation in several directions. It is increasing taxation on the very people about whom Deputy Childers is worrying.  Incidentally, Deputy Childers, when comparing agricultural production in this country and other countries, should tell the House what system of local taxation obtains in New Zealand, Denmark, and these other countries.</P>
    <P>Are the farmers in these countries asked to bear the burden of providing social and medical services for the people to the same extent as we are doing here?  The Deputy knows they are not.  Even the people in Northern Ireland and the people across the water have not to do it.  Not only are we asked to provide for these services at a very high cost, but this fund, which obviously ought to be spent on road maintenance and improvement, is raided by the Minister to balance his Budget.  Nobody can deny that that burden of £150,000 is thrown back on to the people who are asked to come to the assistance of the country and step into the breach to save it.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is an opportunity, at the present time, for this country, and that if we do not rehabilitate our agricultural community, improve their position economically and financially, and provide for them against the time of adversity, that, I agree with Deputy Childers, is bound to come after any great eruption, what will be the state of this country?  Is everything being done that ought to be done to see that that great industry is at its best and that it will get every advantage to which it is entitled?  It certainly has met with sufficient adversity during the past nine or ten years.  Its interests have been long ignored.  It has been sacrificed in the interests of other industries, many of which are not worth a button to this country.  It is time that we wakened up to the necessity for giving this industry a chance of availing to the utmost of the opportunities that are there.  That has not been done.  I do not know whether it will be done or not.  The Minister for Agriculture is supposed to be looking after our interests and making a good trade deal with our neighbours. <Col N="299" /> Let us hope that his mission will prove successful.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of one matter referred to by Deputy Childers, namely, our live-stock numbers.  We are in the unfortunate position to-day that, although the Minister for Agriculture contends, after we have passed through an economic war, that our live-stock numbers have been maintained, in fact, when we examine the matter we find that they have not really been maintained, because we have in the country to-day mostly young, immature stock.  I suggest that Deputy Childers should compare the number of three-year old bullocks with the number of yearlings we have to-day, and the relevant position to-day with what it was ten years ago.  He will find that we have very young, immature stock, while there is a keen demand for aged, matured stock, forward condition stores, which can be finished in a very short time on the other side.  We are in the unfortunate position that we are not able to supply the demand there is for that stock.  I am sure Deputy Childers is very sincere and very anxious to help agriculture, but I advise him to beware of drawing wrong conclusions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take from the Minister any of the credit which he appears to have received in certain quarters for the Budget he has produced.  He has been described in some places as a wizard of finance, inasmuch as he has converted what most people thought was a deficit of something near £2,000,000 into an eventual <Col N="300" /> surplus of £4,000.  When one looks at the White Paper that the Minister issued it would appear that when you sum it all up the Minister's effort was palpably simple.  He solved the problem by a simpler method than any other Minister that preceded him thought of.  He found himself in this position, that from tax and non-tax revenue on the existing scale, including the extra 1/- on income-tax, he had £33,718,000, with an estimated expenditure of £35,584,000, leaving a deficit of £1,866,000, and he proceeded in the shortest possible way to get rid of the deficit.  He said he would borrow £1,194,000, lop off £600,000 for overestimation, and that that would leave him in the happy position of being only £72,000 short.  All the manipulation he had to do then was in regard to that £72,000.  I am rather surprised that the Minister did not take the easier way, by adding the £72,000 to the £1,194,000 he borrowed, but evidently he thought that something was due to the country, and that there should be a little by-play when producing the Budget, so he mentioned a few red herrings&mdash;if you like to put it that way &mdash;and said he was going to give the smoker something by taking a little off cheap leaf tobacco&mdash;which, incidentally, was put on last November&mdash;costing £120,000, which he proposed to find out of the Exchequer by deducting £125,000 from unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also stated that he was going to give £100,000 to the farmers for fertilisers, but he is going to find that out of the Road Fund, and to leave himself with £50,000.  The other £72,000 was to be got from wireless licences, a duty on cider, etc.  In effect that is the Budget we are asked to debate.  The whole transaction was simple.  I have often wondered what has become of the 66-1 formula.  It used to be said that our capacity for taxation in relation to people across the Channel was something in relation to 66-1.  We have a Budget for the Central Fund and Supply Services amounting to £35,500,000 and if we&mdash;as we reasonably might&mdash;add some of the concealed taxes that do not readily reveal themselves, for instance the taxes on bread and beet sugar, I am not overstating <Col N="301" /> the case when I say that we are taxed at least to the extent of £40,000,000, and that on the 66-1 basis, nobody could calculate what the British war taxes ought to be at present. They would not attempt to impose anything like that in the way of war taxes, so we can say R.I.P. to the 66-1 formula.</P>
    <P>We have a Budget now of nearly £40,000,000 and the National Debt has been added to.  We are passing on to posterity a great part of our expenditure. It might be a simple method of Governmental housekeeping to pass on some of the expenditure to those who come after us.  I think the Government has been reckless, and has had very little regard for those who will come after us.  In this generation we were lucky because we started with a clean sheet.  Whatever argument there may have been as to the portion, if any, of the British National Debt that we ought to have borne, the fact remains that through the wise efforts of our pioneer statesmen, some of whom, I am glad to say, are still with us, we escaped any such liability, and commenced our career as a nation with a clear financial sheet.  I suppose it is fair to say that the charge might be fairly laid, that we have so ill used our political and our financial freedom that it has become necessary to pass on an unfair portion of our expenditure to posterity.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested in one reference of Deputy Childers in which he said that there would be a mental revolution amongst the people if there was not a change.  I wish to say that there will be a mental revolution, such a revolution as would overtax the mental capacity of the people of this State, if there is not some change in the economic management of the affairs of the country.  What has been wrong with us latterly is that we have failed to cut our coats according to the cloth. In fact, the Government during their term of office have been building up a garment that is too big for the material at their disposal.  They have had to produce a many coloured garment, and have had to go away altogether from the ordinary rudiments of tailoring and the ordinary supply of material, in <Col N="302" /> other words, the taxation that the country can reasonably afford to borrow and to raise.</P>
    <P>Any individual citizen, if he proceeded on the lines on which the Government are proceeding, could live very happily for a number of years, but the reckoning would be sure.  In my younger days I thought that, as a happy-go-lucky young man, I could compete with my richer brethren on a very small income.  I proceeded on those lines, and I led a happy-go-lucky existence for four or five years.  I held my head as high and spent as much as they did.  But a crash came, and, like many another young fellow, I had to pull in my horns and start out for fresh fields.  I learned a lesson from that, and I should like the Minister for Finance and the Government to learn a similar lesson.</P>

      <P>They fluttered to such an extent that they squandered first and then borrowed as a country relatively more than I, as a happy-go-lucky young fellow, had spent when sowing my wild oats.  What is the cure for this?  There must be a drastic reduction in taxation, whatever the consequence, or we must increase the income of the majority of the people.  Alternatively, we shall have to borrow, and that alternative can only end in disaster and bankruptcy.  I do not say that we are bankrupt, or that we are anywhere near bankruptcy, but I do say we are drifting in that direction. We started with a clean sheet, and, whatever may be said against the previous Government, they managed, to a large extent, to live within their income.  Borrowings had to take place for certain matters which were beyond their control.  I do not wish to go into these matters, because by doing so I might create ill-feeling, but the circumstances are within the memory of every Deputy.  Exceptional circumstances made necessary expenditure which it was not unreasonable to pass on for payment by degrees.  In the main, that Government managed to carry on without borrowing.  We have had a departure from that practice in recent years. <Col N="303" /> There has scarcely been a Budget within the last six or seven years in which borrowing was not resorted to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers referred to imports and exports.  I do not want to go into the question of imports, but the creation of a greater volume of exports is one of the ordinary requirements of prosperity.  How is that to be done?  Analogies have been drawn between the line of agriculture pursued here and in other countries.  Such comparisons are false.  We cannot compare our agriculture with that of Denmark, or even with that of New Zealand.  We have different systems of agriculture.  Our market varies to a greater extent than their markets vary.  Deputy Childers may understand this question to a great extent, but he does not understand it as well as the ordinary farmer who is making his living out of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with results.  The question of increased production has been referred to.  I shall later come to the point whether you can increase production at all if production is not profitable.  At any rate, an attempt was made to increase both production and quality.  To the eternal credit of the late Minister for Agriculture, that was put in the forefront of his policy.  No Deputy will deny that the late Mr. Hogan made greater efforts to improve the quality of the produce of Irish farmers than have been made by any succeeding Minister for Agriculture.  I do not say that the present Minister for Agriculture has neglected his duty in that respect.  He has mainly followed in the footsteps of the late Mr. Hogan. Mr. Hogan planned to increase the production and improve the quality of our produce, and he succeeded.  The present Minister has been content to stand still at the point where Mr. Hogan left off.  Everybody knows what Mr. Hogan did in regard to milk products, and in regard to the marketing and selling of our agricultural goods, and the improvement of our live stock. We have continued that highly satisfactory system which he developed, but <Col N="304" /> we have not improved upon it, and the progress he was making has not been continued.</P>
      <P>One of the foremost points in Deputy Hogan's policy was increased production. He defined his policy in a few simple words which any ordinary man or woman, ignorant or otherwise, could understand.  He wanted the farmers to produce good stuff, and he made them do that by legislation.  &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough&rdquo;&mdash;that was his motto.  No Deputy has the right to say that an effort was never made to increase production, or to improve the quality of our agricultural goods.  To the eternal credit of the man whose picture adorns the precincts of this House, that effort was made.</P>
      <P>Perhaps our present circumstances have been brought about more by the unfortunate policy of the Government, political and otherwise, than in any other way.  In regard to the financial dispute with Britain, as Deputy Childers and other Deputies have often pointed out, that had an unfortunate effect on the majority of our people. That economic war took something like £60,000,000 or £70,000,000 out of the pool of agriculture in this State, and you cannot take such a vast sum out of the pool of agriculture without creating something like, I will not say eternal disaster, but certainly a disaster that will leave its mark for many years.  It will take the agricultural community many years to recoup the vast sum so ruthlessly taken out of the pool.  It certainly did not leave them in a position to bear any increased burdens of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been taunted from the Labour Benches that no references have been made to unemployment.  There was always unemployment in this country.  There were efforts made to lessen it, not by artificial means, such as have been largely used by the present Government, but by a sane, sound, political and economic policy that gave a fair measure of prosperity to the general body of the people and, giving them that fair measure of prosperity, it enabled them to employ a reasonable number of workers.  We did <Col N="305" /> have unemployed, but we left office with a smaller number of unemployed than there have been here since.  If one of the results of the heavy taxation that this country has had to bear since 1932&mdash;representing an increase from £25,000,000 to almost £40,000,000, apart from the added burden of the national debt, which will be passed on to posterity&mdash;had been to put the unemployed into profitable employment, then I, for one, would say that it was money well expended.  But we have not had anything like that.  Concurrently with this huge increase in taxation, and this huge increase in our national indebtedness, we have added, year by year, to the number of unemployed until it now reaches 120,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is largely due to the number of young unmarried men who have been knocked off in the summer months under the insurance system; that accounts for large numbers of them.  A lot of these men are not employed.  For reasons of expediency they have been simply knocked off the relief lists by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the grass is good. They have taken them off the list and they have not been merged into employment.  I say there are 120,000 and Deputy Childers says there are 87,000.  Perhaps we are both right, because we can account for the difference.  If it had not been for the great rush of work across the water at the moment, owing to the existing conditions, I could confidently say that our unemployed would to-day be in the region of 200,000, or perhaps 250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody to-day said that we sent 30,000 or 40,000 workers to England.  I am satisfied that in the last five years we have sent nearer to 200,000, and they are still going as fast as they can get boats and passports.  I do not know why they have selected me&mdash; perhaps they think I am a pro-Britisher or that I have some influence with the <Col N="306" /> people across the water&mdash;but I frequently receive letters from young people, asking me to get them passports and jobs over the Channel. They are all anxious to go.  That is one of the dire results of the Government's policy.  That is a matter that should seriously be considered by people who have some regard for the eventual prosperity of this country. As an old man I have some regard for the yet unborn citizens of this State, the people who will eventually run the State.  I have a desire to see this country passed on to them with something in the nature of the clean slate that was handed on to us after the settlement with Britain, when we had kicked Britain out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Having got them out, we made such financial arrangements that we were able to start from scratch.  We were not very good runners, most of us; we were not quick off the mark, but, inexperienced as we were, under the Cosgrave régime we managed to plod along fairly well without breaking records.  We did not attempt to break records, to create any phenomenal reforms, but, considering the circumstances of the time, we can say that we did succeed in managing the affairs of the State fairly well.  We were succeeded by gentlemen who were imbued with great ideas of reform and who possessed remarkable athletic prowess.  Their idea was to get quickly off the mark.  They got away before the gun, and landed us in the middle of the most disastrous conflict we ever had.  It was a bloodless conflict, if you like&mdash;there were not any shots fired&mdash;but it was a much more disastrous conflict than any we had hitherto endured or that we are likely to endure for some years.  It cost us relatively £60,000,000 or £70,000,000.  It <Col N="307" /> was necessary to increase our taxation for social services by some £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, and it was necessary to add to the unlimited millions of the national debt which will have to be paid by posterity.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us he was knocking off £600,000 for over-estimation.  I should have liked the Minister to knock off, as a start, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 for needless expenditure, and I think he could do that.  Desperate diseases require desperate remedies, and we have got a desperate disease. Every Deputy must accept that. I think even Deputy Childers will admit that we are in the early stages of a rather dangerous disease.  We all hope, having got the danger signals in the way of pimples, that it will not develop into a deadly malady.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and we have got to attack it boldly.  If we are going to save the country from this disease we have got to get a shears and lop off expenditure, no matter what the consequences. Else we have to create a bigger income for the people of the State.  One is possible, the other scarcely possible at the moment.  For various reasons I do not believe that it will be possible to create very much of an increase in the income of the agricultural community in the next four or five years.  The prospects are not rosy.  I am aware that in the Dublin markets the prices of live stock have gone up, but every effort is being made by our chief customers across the water to keep prices down to the minimum. I do not blame them.  That is their policy and their business.  They do not pretend to give us any more than they can and I see no reason why they should.  Some of our people over whom we have no control have not been very kind to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On certain occasions some of our people did not help them.  At all events, the fact remains that we are not going to get the best end of the deal.  They will give us what they are compelled but no more.  Apparently that is not <Col N="308" /> going to be an extravagant price, certainly not a price that is going to give prosperity to the farmer if we take into account the great increase in his outgoings. We will only get what they like to give us.  They set the price and we have to take it.  We will have to bear a greatly increased burden for all the things we have to purchase.  We will be more and more affected in this way as the war goes on.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have argued against the small increase in the wages paid to the agricultural workers during the last year or two.  I do not agree with them. It puzzles me tremendously to know how some of those unfortunate men and women, if they have families, exist on the miserable wage they get.  But it puzzles me much more to explain how some of the farmers who pay that miserable wage manage to pay it at all. I do not want now to enter into a debate on agricultural matters, nor into the various phases of agriculture, tillage, butter, milk and so on; there will be another time and place for that. I do think that every farmer ought to make the best effort possible to produce more these times and to produce a better article if he can.  There are, I know, limitations to the power of the farmer to achieve these things.  One limitation is through the want of capital.  I am aware there are advances in the price of cattle, but there are numerous farmers whose lands are not half stocked and these people are not able to take advantage of the upper trend in prices, mainly because the Government in the last eight years took £60,000,000 out of the agricultural pool.  That money has not been replaced.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, there is only one cure for this state of things at the moment.  I should like to see the Minister having the courage to lop off &mdash;not the £600,000 that he takes off by way of over-estimation; £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 could be lopped off.  Take the Department of Defence.  I would very willingly vote for a shears to the extent of cutting £3,000,000 off Defence expenditure.  I think that while the Army is desirable, it is not imperative for us to have it.  It is imperative that the people of this country should be <Col N="309" /> allowed to live in reasonable comfort with such taxation as they can comfortably afford.  We are going to fight nobody.  Nobody is going to attack us.  If we were collaborating with anybody in attacking somebody else, then we might have some reason for a huge expenditure on the Army; but in the present position with no will to attack anybody and no desire on the part of other nations to attack us, I do hold that increasing expenditure on the Army is not justified.  That is one of the items that can very well be lopped off.  The time has come when there must be drastic reductions in expenditure. Otherwise we will rapidly drift in the direction of the dangerous malady that was rather suggested by Deputy Childers and others.  That is into a financial breakdown.  The symptoms are already there, but I hope we will not reach that stage.  I hope that there will be sense enough on the part of this or some other Government not to tax the people beyond their capacity to bear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can claim for this Budget is that there are no new taxes imposed now.  I suppose it is because of that that the back-benchers of the Minister's Party applauded the financial statement. But this Budget had its forerunner in the Budget of last November, which imposed new taxation.  If the Minister's backbenchers would reflect a little, perhaps they would see there is not so much room for applause after all.  On going through the Minister's statement, I find that it was only through an accident that new taxes had not been imposed.  It was because the Customs had yielded more by the 31st March than was anticipated, that new taxation was avoided.  We have a little country like ours, in the midst of a war zone.  We are in the midst of the greatest war the world has ever witnessed. If a country like ours contemplates living on the proceeds of Customs duties, then all I have to say is that it is leaning on a broken reed. The Minister expresses himself generally satisfied with the financial position. He said that in the last year he floated a loan which was highly successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> I question that statement.  It was not successful at all.  It was successful because the banks were made to cough up.  It was not successful inasmuch as the subscribing public did not contribute to it to the extent one would expect, or to the extent that would warrant the Minister saying it was successful; I do not think half of that loan was subscribed by the public. About the same period in which that loan was floated two of the chief municipalities in this country, Dublin and Cork, put issues on the market neither of which was subscribed by the public.  Are these not sufficient warnings to the Minister and to the Government to ask himself what is wrong?</P>
    <P>A prominent official in a public financial position lately expressed surprise that Irish investors will not invest their money freely at home, but that they will invest it in foreign countries. I have yet to meet the man who has money to invest that will refuse to invest it in a certain place through prejudice, or who will invest it in a certain place through sentiment.  The investing public invest their money where they will find security and an adequate return for it.  Is that not a warning to the Minister and the Government, that there is something wrong with the financial stability of this country when Irish investors will invest their money abroad?  This country has always suffered from a malady which has driven capital out of the country.  It is time for a native Government to diagnose and cure that malady.  I think I would be right in saying that money running into millions, which the Government itself controls, was in the last 1½ years invested outside this country.  Why?  I do not know, but it was.  A state of affairs which leaves the country in such an uncertain financial position, and so unattractive for the investment of money, is worthy of, and calls for, examination by the Minister.  We may be suffering from the maladies imputed to us by Deputy Childers.  May I congratulate the Deputy on the courage he showed in making the statement he did.  He said it was not a political statement.  I welcome it, but I do not welcome it as a political statement, for I do not take it as such. <Col N="311" /> But, if the condition of affairs we have here is due to our own shortcomings, as Deputy Childers implied, then the sooner we set about finding out what those shortcomings are, and curing them, the better.  High taxation must be one of the evils that has driven capital out of this country and that is keeping it out.  The Minister knows that quite well.  We have high taxation and high rates.  In his Budget the Minister has shifted a burden, which properly belongs to the State, from his own door to the door of the local authorities.  Why did he do that? In order to balance his Budget.  In existing circumstances it is not good enough for the Minister to balance his Budget without new taxation.</P>
    <P>A reduction in taxation is obviously necessary if this country is to carry on. We see evidence of that in the case of public issues by the Government and the principal municipalities&mdash;in their failure to attract the Irish investing public.  But if we were, as all other free nations in the world are, standing on our own two legs, with the economic and trading resources of this country backing our note issue, that note issue would collapse, because the note issue in any country is the balance sheet of that country.  Our note issue is being kept at a certain parity by Great Britain and does not reflect our financial or economic position.  Deputy Childers touched lightly on that.  I was waiting to see if he would develop that point, but he did not.  I submit that the Minister has failed, when he has not reduced taxation, and I say that his Budget is a failure.  He cannot point to any measure of prosperity which would indicate that the country was in a better position to meet the bill this year than last.  If we were able to do that it would be equivalent to a reduction in taxation.  In other words, if he were in a better position to meet the bill this year than last, the demand would not fall so heavily on us, but no one in this country, not even the Minister, has attempted to demonstrate that we will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>The figures of unemployment are another danger signal.  They are <Col N="312" /> rising.  We all know that at a certain season of the year rural workers are knocked off the employment register. If the Minister wants to know what the position is with regard to employment, apart from the official figures that are produced to him, I would ask him to come out and see the mail boat leaving Dun Laoghaire.  If he does he will see the youth of this country leaving it, the youth who were to get employment at home, and not only the youth but the emigrants as well&mdash;those who were to be brought back to fill the jobs that Government policy was to make available for them.  We now find that the youth are flying from the country. There is not a village in my constituency that has not sent dozens of young people over to England in the last few months.  Some of them who were working with me a year ago are to-day in Narvik.  If we are going to make this country a place worth living in we must reduce the load of taxation or increase prosperity.  As the Minister has not done either, I submit that his Budget is a failure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has again raided the Road Fund.  When it was originally established it was to be for the purpose of improving the roads.  There was to be a relationship between the taxes imposed on motor-vehicles using the roads and the wear and tear of the roads by those motor-vehicles.  I am sorry that the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary is not in the House, because I remember listening to an address he delivered ten or 12 years ago.  His theme was that there was full justification for imposing taxes on motor-vehicles to the extent, and only to the extent, that they were wearing the roads, and that the taxes paid in respect of their use should go to the upkeep of the roads.</P>
    <P>I wonder what justification the Minister has for raiding the Road Fund to the extent of £150,000, and using that for general Government purposes. Whose loss is that, and at whose expense is it being done?  At the local authorities' expense, of course; they should get that £150,000 for the maintenance of roads.  In other words, he has helped to balance his Budget by pinching £150,000 out of the local <Col N="313" /> ratepayers' pockets.  That is really what it works out at.</P>
    <P>I wonder on what principle the Minister justifies his borrowing for employment schemes.  As a member of a local body, I have considerable knowledge of how those employment schemes work out, and I can quote at least one county surveyor.  I think what he said would be said by all county surveyors; it is this: He would much rather that the money given to him for employment schemes were given out to the un-employed without any scheme, that it were given out for doing nothing, than burden him with the trouble of administering a scheme.  The money put up by the local authority&mdash;that, and that alone&mdash;used with the ordinary county council staff, would give better results than that amount of money put into the pool with the Government grant to carry on an employment scheme under the conditions imposed by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The money spent on employment schemes is an annual outlay, and there is no justification whatsoever for borrowing for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers' contribution to the debate was interesting from the agricultural standpoint.  He gave figures which I accept, though I am not in a position to say whether they are right or not.  I know that he has a flair and ability for statistical research and investigation, and I am quite satisfied that, before he quoted those figures in this House, he took every reasonable precaution about their accuracy; and, therefore, I accept them.  Perhaps the Deputy would realise the significance of the statistics he gave about the use of artificial manures.  He points out the small quantity, comparatively, used in this country.  I would refer him to the time when the economic war was on, and when the fertility of this country&mdash;far from being renewed after or before crops, in order to provide a good yield&mdash;was destroyed.  Some of the best land was utilised, through necessity, by its owners to grow the only crop which could be turned into cash&mdash;namely, wheat.  Wheat, which extracts a lot of fertility out of the land, can only be grown in the best of times profitably on good land.  The <Col N="314" /> same land was called upon, for four or five years in succession, to grow crops of wheat, and in the end it was only fit for growing weeds.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for that kind of agriculture must be laid at the door of the present Government.  I think Deputy Childers supported that policy. It is a bit too late in the day for him to come and, wittingly or unwittingly, put the farmers of this country in the dock because they did not use as much artificial manure per acre as was used in other countries quoted by the Deputy.  He should bear in mind that those countries using artificial manures were counselled to use them, were helped to use them, and that money was placed at their disposal to finance them to use them.  Here the pockets of the farmers are being picked by the Government, which should be looking after their interests.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, during that period another tax was put on agriculture&mdash; one which, normally, I would stand for. That tax was to help to build up the industrial arm of this country, in other words, it was tariffs.  There was then a double tax&mdash;tariffs and the bearing of the brunt of the economic war.  In other words, the British collected all the annuities and other charges from the farmers and our Government collected them too.  There was a time during that period when they could not sell anything.  There was no market. They were told: &ldquo;That market is gone for ever, thank God.&rdquo;  It is refreshing to read the Minister on that now.  In his Budget statement he says: &ldquo;This brings me to another point&mdash;the character of our export trade.  The demand from our principal market may increase by direct war buying and by the withdrawal, in whole or in part, of other suppliers.&rdquo;  The market that was gone &ldquo;for ever, thank God,&rdquo; has now become our principal market.  We are all glad that that mentality has been reached, but it is not fair to accuse the farmers of not adopting up-to-date methods&mdash;particularly in the matter of fertilising their land&mdash;when they are being plundered in this way.</P>
    <P>Go a step further.  What is the position regarding fertilisers now?  £100,000 is given in this Budget to subsidise them.  Speaking as a bit of a farmer <Col N="315" /> myself, I would much rather see a bigger sum laid aside, £500,000, or £1,000,000 if you like&mdash;and it would be much more profitable to the nation&mdash;by way of an advance, that would be recouped to the Central Fund, for setting about even now to buy the raw phosphates, or whatever you may call them, in order to make superphosphates and to buy the ingredients and material for our fertilising factories so that we would be sure of a sufficient supply next year.  Whether I get fertilisers at 10/- a ton less than the commercial price is of very little moment to me or to my fellow farmers if we find ourselves in the position that we cannot get them at all.  It is much better to have the material at some price than to have it theoretically at a low price but, in fact, not to have it at all or not to have it in sufficient quantities.  It is very doubtful farming economy&mdash;and I think that every farmer in the House will agree with me on this&mdash;to apply fertilisers to your land if you cannot apply them in adequate quantities.  I would not go so far as to say that it is a waste, but it is next door to it.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from my general criticism of the Budget, I put it to the Minister as a suggestion that something should be done by way of providing funds for the purchase of the raw materials necessary for the production of fertilisers.  There is a very rich firm that is handling that business in this country, but I really think that, in a national emergency like the present, money could not be invested in a more productive enterprise.  As far as any benefits as a result of this £100,000 would accrue to me&mdash;and this year I purchased about 100 tons, and at 10/- that would be £50&mdash;I would willingly hand that £50 back to the Government in exchange for a guarantee that I would get my required quota next year, if I am alive.  I think that every farmer would willingly forfeit whatever benefit there would be to himself in this £100,000 in order to get that guarantee, and I am quite satisfied that if you guarantee the farmer and the farm labourer fair conditions, you need not be afraid of a food shortage unless the elements go against us, and you will <Col N="316" /> find that no political prejudice or otherwise will interfere in that because it becomes the interest of the farming community to produce when they get the materials of production.  I would strongly suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should make inquiries in this matter, and if he or the appropriate Minister is not satisfied, and satisfied beyond doubt, that sufficient raw materials for fertilisers are not in this country, and if they can be procured, the Minister for Finance should see to it that the question of money to purchase an adequate supply should not stand in the way, and I think I am speaking to a Minister who, in my experience, has always been sympathetic to a project of that kind, whether in connection with manures or anything else.</P>
    <P>Now, I am certainly not one of those who call a reasonable price for agricultural produce a tax on the community. I say, without apology or equivocation, that I stand four-square behind the Government's wheat policy. This country stands for a protectionist policy for industry, and if industry is going to be protected&mdash;and I believe it should be protected&mdash;as a burden, if you like, on agriculture, then agriculture is entitled to its <i>quid pro quo</i> for that protectionist policy.  In my view that protectionist policy&mdash;not of a tax, not of a tariff, but of requiring a certain percentage of home-grown wheat, the grist for making flour in this country, even though it renders it a bit dearer to the consumer&mdash;gives agriculture a chance to carry on.</P>
    <P>Further, I say that it is a decided national advantage for us to have hundreds of thousands of acres under wheat during this war so that the people of this country, especially the delicate, the sick, the infirm and the youngsters, will not have to eat the black, stinking bread that we had to eat during the last war.  I remember, during the latter years of the last war, that the only place that I got bread that was any good to eat was in jail; the bread that you got outside was not fit to eat.  The farmers of this country during this war are in the position, and are anxious and willing, to do their part to save the people of this country from having to eat black bread.  I <Col N="317" /> think that that is a decided national advantage, and it has my wholehearted support at any rate.</P>
    <P>I also support anything that promotes tillage.  My view on agriculture is, that if tillage is not a paying proposition then the problem is to make it pay.  I hold that we are not justified in scrapping tillage merely because it is not a paying proposition.  The problem is there: Why is it not a paying proposition? It is for our Government, and for the whole people of this country, to concentrate on that problem, and make tillage a paying proposition.  I should like to see more attention given to the practical side of agriculture by the Government.  In all I have had to say up to the present on the Budget I have condemned the expenditure&mdash; the extravagance, if you like&mdash;and I should like to see it reduced, but there is one item that I should like to see increased in the Estimates for this year, and that is the subsidy for the Faculty of Agriculture in the university. We shall never succeed&mdash;and I am speaking with both theoretical and practical knowledge&mdash;we shall never succeed as a farming community here until we first succeed in the laboratory. We shall never succeed as a wheat-growing country until we produce a wheat that is suitable to our soil and climate.  No country in the world has done it, and we cannot do what no other country could do.  In the case of the best wheatlands in the world at the present time, when they were first sown with wheat, the wheat was a failure&mdash; I point to Canada, California and Australia.  The first time that wheat was grown successfully in Canada, it was grown by David Fife, who bred wheat suitable to his farm, and to the climate of that farm.  He gave his name to that famous Canadian wheat, Red Fife, which in a few years covered 15,000,000 acres of Canada, and which exhausted all the soil of Canada that could grow wheat properly.  It took a long time to mature, as the climate was against it, and Canada wanted a quick-maturing wheat that could be put in the ground late in the Spring, and that would mature early in the harvest.</P>
    <P>That was bred and added another 20,000,000 acres to the wheat-growing <Col N="318" /> area of Canada.  We would want to do something like that.  I could give several examples in California, Siberia, and different provinces of Australia, but nobody who has studied the wheat problem will contradict what I am saying because they probably know it better than I do.  I was a member of an agricultural committee in University College when this faculty was set up. I was at the setting up of it.  I am a member of that committee still.  I am afraid I am not a good attendant but I did my best to get a professorship for the plant breeding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Quite, but it is a different matter to discuss different types of wheat and to detail their development.  Such details would arise more properly on an Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In saying that, I was just making a general statement to justify my advocacy of increased expenditure on that particular heading&mdash; the Faculty of Agriculture.  I pass away from it now.  Deputy Childers in speaking about our competitors, explained how their production had increased. He asked various questions &mdash;was it due to so-and-so, was it due to money policy?  I refer him to Denmark and New Zealand and I say without fear of contradiction that the prosperity of the Danish farmers and the New Zealand farmers and the advantage they held over the farmers of this country in the British market were entirely due to money policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, if he has studied the money history of the last 20 years, is aware that the first knock that agriculture received in this country, during our time, was the rapid deflation policy of Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, from October, 1919 to 1925, when we returned to the gold standard, but during that deflationary <Col N="319" /> period the Danish Government, though it deflated its currency, kept well behind the British deflation, which always gave the Danish farmer an advantage of 25 per cent. in the competitive market in England against the Irish farmer.  He is aware that about five or ten years ago New Zealand adopted its own currency but, though it linked the currency to sterling, it had not the same parity with sterling.  It was 25 per cent. less.  That gave the New Zealand farmer a 25 per cent. advantage over us in the British market.  I do not want to develop that any further, but the Deputy will find that those facts are correct as regards the money policy being different.  Whether I am justified in deducing from that the results that I claim is another matter.  I do not ask the Deputy to accept that, but he will accept, I am sure, that there was a difference in our standard of values the result of which was to give an advantage to those two countries.  That is all I ask him to accept.</P>
    <P>I suppose the question of the danger of a shortage of accessories for agricultural implements would be more appropriately directed to the Minister for Supplies.  I suppose the Minister for Finance would be open to provide the money if the Minister for Supplies has a case made.  I just want to say that there is a danger of these accessories becoming scarce.  I was looking for tractor implements quite recently and I was strongly advised to get in a stock.  I hope the Minister will not raid me and distribute them around if I have the money to get in the stock.</P>

      <P>I am glad I have got that from the Minister for Finance. There is no danger of falling short now. I am not competent to say, but I just wonder is it a sound policy nationally for us here to be shouting &ldquo;Keep down agricultural prices&rdquo;?  The Minister in his Budget statement said we should increase exports.  That, of course, means increase our agricultural production in order to have exports.  Is it not <Col N="320" /> a very foolish man who has anything to sell who will shout about keeping down the price of that article?  Why should we be shouting about keeping down the price of agricultural produce, cattle, sheep, pigs, potatoes, etc?  I sell a good deal of them and I would be the last man to say, &ldquo;Keep down the price.&rdquo;  Why should we not try to have those prices as high as possible?  Does not it mean more money coming in for the same amount of goods exported? I hope the Minister will not say that the higher a man goes up the tree the bigger the fall he will get when the crash comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am a bit heavier than when I got the last fall&mdash; in avoirdupois, not in pocket.  I might suffer more from it.  Is it not bad business for us, an agricultural country? We can adjust the home market if it is necessary to adjust it, but is it not very foolish for us to send our wares over to England and to say, &ldquo;We must keep down the price because we are afraid when the aftermath of the war comes the crash will be too big&rdquo;?  Can we not be wise in time?  Let us get as much as we can for our produce now and when the crash comes, the better we have our pockets lined, the sounder our banking account, the better we will be able to bear the crash.</P>

      <P>The fall will not be too hard if the banking account is sound. Nothing will save the fall but the banking <Col N="321" /> account and the big stocking.  I am afraid the Government is inclined to that policy of keeping down agricultural prices.  If you measure the price of agricultural produce at the present time against the wage that has Government or semi-Government sanction, that is paid to agricultural workers, and if it is correct that agriculture is not able to pay any higher wage, is not there something wrong in the whole national economy?  Agriculture is the one industry which is the pillar of the whole nation, and through taxing it the secondary industries are brought into existence and maintained. Yet every one of them pays a better wage than the main national agricultural industry.  Is not there something wrong?  How will you improve the capacity of that industry to pay a wage?  There is only one way: by increasing the price of the produce of these workers.  Why does such a howl go up against the price of agricultural produce, the price of food stuffs, and from people who have twice the wage of the farmer?  If he says: &ldquo;I will not work unless I get £3 or £4 a week,&rdquo; what will pay it?  Agricultural produce must go up, and I wonder if our Ministers, in their trade talks on the other side, are insisting on getting adequate prices for our agricultural produce?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the beginning that this Budget will not fall heavily, if the Minister could show that our income was going to increase, and the answer to the question as to whether this is a fair and just Budget depends entirely on our capacity to pay.  If our capacity is increased, this is a light Budget; if our capacity remains stationary&mdash;if it is worsened, of course the whole position is worse still&mdash;this Budget, in view of what similar taxation <Col N="322" /> has produced in the year just concluded, is too expensive, the burden of taxation is too great, and we should have had a reduction in taxation.</P>
      <P>Our entire income from external sources, apart from foreign investments, comes from agriculture, and if prices are arranged which are not remunerative and if we have to pay more for what we import&mdash;everything the farmer has to buy is gone up; some of the things he cannot get, but everything he can get has gone up in price &mdash;and if Britain is going to charge us increased prices for her manufactured goods which we get in here, it justifies an increase in price for agricultural produce.  I do not know if England is taking advantage of the position in which we are at present, namely, that we have nowhere else to sell.  Another factor which makes the position precarious for us is that our stuff is not bought here.  It must be landed across the water, and it is then bought, and we must take all the risks of the crossing. That is very unfair and I do not think we should agree to it.</P>
      <P>There is a very large item in the Estimates in respect of unemployment. Can nothing be done by way of giving employment to those who are unemployed? I saw a picture the other day of a number of young fellows going down to cut turf.  Would it not be better to cut turf than to do nothing? Would we not save a good deal in our coal bill?  I believe&mdash;and I have this from coal people&mdash;that not only has the price of coal gone up but coal merchants here have got a warning that there may be a shortage.  Why should we be paying people for doing nothing when we have thousands of acres of bog land where turf could be cut?  Even in this period of emergency, if it would not be a business proposition for them to cut turf, it would represent some return for the money they get to maintain them, and I think the matter should be developed during this emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never thought that a very profitable commercial industry would be made out of turf.  I know the business; I have worked at it and I know the whole job from beginning to end.  I know also that it pays nobody to cut <Col N="323" /> and rear turf, that its only advantage is that it comes at a time of the year when the men on the farm have nothing else to do, and would do nothing else, if they did not cut and save turf.  As a commercial proposition, however, it is a different matter. We have thousands of people idle and they must get, and are getting, maintenance.</P>
    <P>It represents a big item for which there is no return.  Why, during the summer months, can they not be put on to cutting and saving turf?  Why cannot men be put on land reclamation?  There are thousands of acres of rocky and swampy land that could be reclaimed. Normally, that would not pay a commercial rate, but when we are paying men for doing nothing, it is a different matter.  Whatever work they do is done for nothing because they are being paid in any case, and it would reduce the burden both on the taxpayer and on the ratepayer.</P>
    <P>I saw in the public Press some time ago that 60 per cent. of the munitions for the Japanese armed forces are imported from America.  Japan is at war, but nobody accuses the United States of being anti-Chinese&mdash;quite the opposite&mdash;but for sound commercial reasons, America made munitions of war and sold them to Japan.  Why should we not start munition factories here and sell munitions to whomever will buy them? It would not infringe our neutrality.  If England wants them, let her buy them; if Germany can send a boat over here, we will fill it for her, and our neutrality is preserved.  Would it not be better to do that than to have thousands of fellows polishing the corners?  I think we should get down to it because no man should get money without earning it.</P>
    <P>That would be about the most nonpolitical policy that any Government or any Party could adopt, and they would find it the one policy in which they would get the greatest volume of support throughout the country, because not only will it bring in a monetary or material return, but it will train young fellows, growing from boyhood to manhood, to work and there are thousands of them in this country who never worked and who, if they do <Col N="324" /> not get a chance of working soon, will never work.  If, in a small, thinly-populated country like this, we have a large proportion of work-shys there is no hope for the country, and I think it the duty of both the central and local administrations to see to it that for whatever money is paid out in the way of assistance through the labour exchanges by the Government and in home assistance by the local authorities, some service should be rendered.</P>
    <P>There is another serious aspect of this matter, and one to which in our young days we paid a good deal of lip service, that is emigration.  &ldquo;Our young people, the life-blood of the country, are emigrating&rdquo;&mdash;the Minister will remember what use we made of that phrase against the generation of politicians that preceded us, the use we made of the millions who had emigrated in the twenty or thirty years prior to that period.  Since then we have got a native Government here, and I do not think the position has been any better.  I see them every evening crowding the mail boat at Dun Laoghaire on their way to England&mdash; boys and girls.  You see them going from Amiens Street to Belfast on their way to work in Britain, and when they go there they have to join up for national service&mdash;and they are joining up.  I am not speaking either for or against their doing that, but they are leaving this country because they cannot get work here.</P>
    <P>I am certainly dissatisfied with the Budget.  Unless the Minister, when he is closing the debate, can hold out some prospect of better times in the future, unless he can assure us that he is ready to place money at the disposal of the people in order to build up reserves of raw materials to keep our industries, both primary and secondary, going during the general world war, then this Budget is something that this country cannot bear, and the expenditure which it proposes is on a scale that should not be countenanced because of the artificiality of depending so much on imports.  If our imports are cut down, where are we? Is there not a possibility of that? Look at the trend of the war.  This <Col N="325" /> State is neutral, and I am not going to talk about the war from any angle, but look at the turn it has taken. Could we imagine that, in our lifetime, a country without any fleet could invade another maritime country in spite of the British and French Navies, and clear these Navies away?  How do we know what is going to happen around these shores?  How do we know that our imports can be maintained? If there are no imports, £10,000,000 in revenue is going to disappear overnight. What is going to replace that? We have been talking glibly of social services, and of maintaining all sorts of high standards, but if commerce to and from this country is checked what have we left?  What will replace the £10,000,000 revenue which we now receive in customs?</P>
    <P>I think the position is very serious, and that the Minister should set about cutting the Estimates so as to reduce expenditure and provide for that contingency. He has admitted in his Budget statement that he underestimated the produce of his Supplementary Budget, and that what gave him the most pleasant surprise was the revenue derived from customs duties.  He got that pleasant surprise because he feared that the war would have taken a course that would have limited our imports.  That limitation may come at any time.  We do not know when general naval warfare may start.  We do not know when general aerial warfare may start, and if and when it does, it will seriously affect our commerce.  When our commerce is affected our revenue will be affected. A shortage of revenue means either a reduction in the obligations which the Government have undertaken, or an increase of taxation.  It will be for the Government to decide which course to follow, and whoever will be the unfortunate individual who will then have to look after the finances of this country, I am sure his lot will not be an enviable one.  I think he will need, and I am sure he will have, the support of all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the real Budget; the real Budget was introduced six months ago.  It was a rather adroit move on the part of the Minister <Col N="326" /> responsible for its introduction to have then imposed many elements of new taxation, together with the accumulated taxes which had accrued in previous Budgets introduced by the previous Minister.  I have no hesitation in saying that while the Budget introduced yesterday was a colourless one, at the same time it holds all the hidden poison that accumulated taxation of previous years had administered to a country ill-fitted to bear it. I remember when the Budget of six months ago was introduced, I rather cheerfully taunted a member of a minority in this country who had voted for placing the present Government in power with the fact that an increase in income tax had been imposed to an extent that he probably would have felt unbearable.  The answer he made was that the one thing he had feared was borrowing, and that while the imposition of a tax of 6/6 in the £ meant a severe strain on the resources of people in his position, borrowing would be a greater evil and one that this country could not afford to face.  Yet we find the Minister providing for additional borrowing to the extent of £2,000,000.  This may perhaps not hurt us immediately, but it is going to be a very harassing factor in the future life of this country.  I feel that is one of the aspects of the Budget which we are justified in opposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the control of the prices in England and the control in every way of agricultural exports from this country, we might have hoped that some relief would be afforded in this Budget for agriculture.  Bearing in mind that there has been an accumulation of hidden taxes imposed on agricultural requirements, requirements which are absolutely necessary if the policy of the Government in regard to tillage is to be carried out, we might justifiably have looked forward to some remission in taxation or some other form of relief for agriculture. Agriculture has not responded to the slight increase in prices because the taxes which the agricultural community have to meet, whether by way of local taxation or national taxation, are bearing very heavily upon them.  One of the speakers from these benches has commented on the fact that the burden <Col N="327" /> placed on the agricultural community has had its reactions upon the traders in the small towns in the country as well as upon the agricultural labourer. A member on the Labour Benches asked what was the cause.  I think I might answer that question by saying that it was caused by the fact that the Government Party were faithfully followed into the Government Lobbies by the Labour Party and that they were thus able to place all these impositions on the agricultural community during the economic war and the agricultural community went down before them.  The largest farmers in the country have been reduced to such a state that in many cases they are unable to pay their rates, their annuities or the instalments on the loans which they had received from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  These men are certainly not producing on their lands now half of what the land could produce.  They are unable to take advantage of the schemes for the purchase of manures and they are unable to get the necessary implements or the necessary seeds in many cases. In many places local bodies like the Cork County Council have had to give unlimited credit to these men who are in a state of absolute penury and who cannot get credit from shopkeepers. What must the Minister for Local Government think when he sees the huge number of farmers who are asking the local authorities, to whom they are supposed to pay ever-increasing rates, to safeguard their credit with the local shopkeepers who will not give any extra credit to these people? People who were always credit worthy are now unable to get credit from the shopkeepers who at one time trusted them.</P>
    <P>That is a matter which should have the serious consideration of the Minister for Finance.  He should seriously consider the impositions that he is placing on a community that at one time were a great source of wealth in this country but who to-day, in spite of legislation which has been passed, are unable to produce the necessary products on their lands to any appreciable extent.  Is there any greater <Col N="328" /> economic tragedy than the fact that so many sons and daughters of farmers are emigrating and leaving behind the aged parents and perhaps the most unsuitable member of the family to carry on the farms?  At one time agricultural education was a thing to be eagerly sought after, but agricultural education is useless unless you have the means to carry on the production which it is the policy of the Government to encourage, but which is retarded by the burden which the agricultural community have to bear.</P>
    <P>We should take into serious consideration the position in which the agricultural community are placed by the ever-increasing rates.  The Cork County Council this year struck a higher rate than was ever struck by a county authority.  The greatest burden imposed on the farmer is that imposed by the demand note.  It is a burden that he cannot bear.  He must be relieved of that by a policy of de-rating or else there will be an increasing amount of arrears of rates due to the local authorities.  In addition, the farmers have to bear extra taxation and higher costs of production.  These are all matters which should be considered and relief given to the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken very great credit to himself for the money which he is providing to help in the purchase of artificial manures.  The need for agricultural manures cannot be met by the amount given by the Minister.  That sum will not help the farmers, unless the Government are prepared to go the whole hog by reducing the costs of production. The demand for artificial manures at present is enormous and there is a great difficulty in getting them.  At the same time the farmer needs a large supply of feeding stuffs. Yet licences were refused to farmers who were in a position to purchase maize and who had their own mills to grind it.</P>
    <P>Under the last Budget the Minister increased the duty on spirits.  But, owing to the increased taxation, the revenue from spirits is down by £185,000.  That increased duty has hit very seriously a distillery at Midleton, in my constituency, which at one time was working full time, and employed <Col N="329" /> a large number of men.  That distillery now only works for a few weeks at a time.  The same thing applies to the breweries.  While the Minister has given some relief by way of rebate to our small breweries, they have already been taxed almost out of existence. These taxes again have seriously crippled the agricultural industry in the barley growing districts, such as the one in which I live.  While we welcome this relief given to the small breweries, there is no question that the position brought about by this taxation is a serious one for the tillage farmer.  Wheat growing, to a certain extent, has taken the place of barley growing in these tillage districts, but the wheat growing policy has raised the cost of living for the residents in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Some of our largest farmers have been compelled, owing to the lack of stock, to run out their lands completely by tillage production, and they have not the necessary means to restore them, as they have not the necessary stock to make the manure.  Agricultural education has been referred to, but we certainly are not in a position to avail ourselves of it if we have not the necessary capital to carry on agricultural economies.  I think I voice the opinion of the agricultural community when I say that their demand is to be left alone to carry on their work in the manner in which they were taught by their fathers, and to be provided with an open market for their produce, and an open market for the purchase of their requirements.  If the Government are prepared to do that, I venture to say that they will come off better in the end.  We have had milk boards set up, and we have the extraordinary position that contracts for the supply of milk are refused to farmers, who do not belong to these milk boards, whose tenders were the lowest. Farmers who have offered to supply milk at a much lower figure than others have been refused contracts because they were not members of these milk boards.  That is a striking blow at the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>There is one serious item that perhaps has been ignored, and that is the high shipping freights to this country. <Col N="330" /> In England shipping is subsidised, and the English farmer is able to get his requirements at a much lower figure than we are in this country.  We have this amazing state of affairs, that the freight on a ship coming to the City of Cork with a cargo is equal to the value of the cargo.  That is not a position that is going to help this country.  It is one that should claim the attention of those who have taken upon themselves the task of controlling its finances.  We have to bear in mind the position of the unemployed and the position on the home front.  The Minister rather glibly mentioned in his Budget statement that he has taken £150,000 from the Road Fund.  His words are:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One justification for this course is that a considerable portion of the provision in the employment schemes estimate is spent on road works.  Last year, for instance, approximately £800,000 was sanctioned for rural and urban road works, to be financed from the Employment Schemes Vote. It is only reasonable, therefore, that the Road Fund should not be entirely relieved of responsibility for this heavy outlay on road works, and £150,000 may be regarded as a somewhat inadequate contribution towards such outlay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Minister has taken that £150,000 when unemployment is greatest.  A sum of £100,000 is also taken from unemployment schemes.  It is rather a serious matter when the Minister, apparently, is balancing his Budget by such means.  I feel that if the Minister is going to depend on taxation, which is now the highest that has ever been imposed here, he will have to remove from those who are producing the greatest store of wealth, the agricultural community, the impositions which they are now bearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach consideration of this Budget from the point of view of a person entirely unversed in the technique of finance, and look at it from the point of view of the average citizen who hardly knows the effect of the phrase, &ldquo;balancing the Budget.&rdquo; I do not propose, therefore, to enter <Col N="331" /> into any detailed examination of the masses of figures put before the country in the speech made by the Minister when introducing the Budget.  I wish merely to refer to two or three topics, two of which are of paramount importance to the general community, and one of which is of particular importance to a section of the community. We have reached the stage now when the introduction of an unbalanced Budget is regarded as a commonplace. At least four out of five of the last Budgets that were introduced by the present Government have been unbalanced, and it is rather a striking commentary on the outlook of the people that the only thing they have been able to say as a result of the statement made by the Minister for Finance yesterday is that at least it is a good thing that there appears to be no additional taxation.  A sigh of relief has gone up because additional taxation has not to any great extent been put on.  The burdens have become so heavy and the people have really become so accustomed to bearing them, that they are relieved to find that they are not going to be heavier still.  One crumb of comfort can possibly be taken from the Minister's statement when he said that the Government recognised that there was a limit to the taxation that even a Fianna Fáil Government could put upon the people.  At last, after eight years, it is useful to know that the Government realises that there is a limit to the taxation which can be put upon the people.  It is a small matter for congratulation that these are the only crumbs that can be got out of the present Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words on behalf of the income-tax payers in this country.  They have for years past been the prey of the Minister for Finance in Budget after Budget, The number of income-tax payers here is comparatively small and, from the point of view of their voting capacity, they are negligible to a Government and a Party whose policy and whose existence depend on votes.  But I think it is time that the Minister for Finance and the Government should <Col N="332" /> seriously consider the intolerable burden placed upon income-tax payers by the imposition of an income-tax of 6/6 in the £.  We, while congratulating ourselves on being one of the few neutral countries that have escaped the really serious effects of the war have now an income-tax which falls very little short of the income-tax paid in Great Britain at a time when Great Britain is facing almost intolerable burdens in an effort to prosecute the most difficult and most perilous war in her history, when she is fighting for her existence and when, judging by the evidence before us, everybody is prepared to make any and every sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I think it has been the excuse of the Government that such a high rate of income-tax is occasioned by matters arising out of the present war.  When things are properly analysed it will really be seen that the present high rate of income-tax here is caused entirely by the policy that has been pursued by the present Government over seven years, prior to the commencement of the present conflagration in Europe.  The rate of income-tax we have to pay now has very little relation to the situation created by the present war and by the emergency in Europe, but is entirely traceable to the kind of policy pursued in the last eight years, a policy which has brought us at least four unbalanced Budgets, and which has brought us to the position that every member of the community, rich and poor, is taxed beyond his capacity. It has often been said that income-tax is the fairest tax.  Possibly that is an argument that might bear analysis in ordinary circumstances, but when you find income-tax payers for the last eight years having to pay far greater sums in proportion to their earnings than is justified by the results that have been obtained in the spending of the money extracted from them, the argument that income-tax is the fairest tax ceases to have any relevance.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, an easy matter to take out of the pockets of those people who earn their money a tax collectable in the way income tax is collected.  It is an easy matter for people to say: &ldquo;Tax the rich,&rdquo; but the effect of such <Col N="333" /> taxation, even on a matter of vital importance such as unemployment, has not been properly realised.  The burden of income-tax on people who have to earn their livelihood has become so intolerable that every class of the community who earn incomes on which tax is collectable have had to retrench, and will have to retrench still further.  I think it was the present Minister for Finance, or the Taoiseach, who said, on the introduction of the emergency Budget last year, that it was something in the nature of a patriotic duty for all citizens to spend as much as they could in the emergency, so that unemployment would not become a greater menace than it was.  It would be quite impossible, with the rate of income-tax as it is, for any person to spend money on anything except what is absolutely essential.  The idea of thrift will be banished from the minds of the people if the idea is that the more you earn the more is taken from you, that you have to retrench in order to pay taxes, the produce of which is to be thrown into the sea.  There will, in these circumstances, be no impetus to thrift, and there will be nothing to recompense a person for the payment to the State of money which he would have been prepared to spend in the exercise of the patriotic duty referred to in the debate on last year's Budget.  The only thing to do will be to get rid of the money in the easiest and most luxurious fashion possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, took pride that he was able, by the doing of a certain sum almost amounting to arithmetical gymnastics, to point to the fact that in the Budget proposals for the present year a sum of £8,383,000 represented the contribution of the Government to the solution of the problem of unemployment. I regard, as I think most people must regard, the problem of unemployment as one of the most pressing problems facing the country as a whole.  It is easy for people making speeches to say that it is the duty of the Government to spend more and more money on unemployment relief, unemployment schemes, and in giving employment, that it is the duty <Col N="334" /> of the Government to have some sort of ordered policy or plan for the solution of unemployment.  The days when any Government, in this country at all events, could produce in the manner the present Government said they could produce eight years ago, a readymade plan for ending unemployment have gone for ever.</P>
    <P>When I speak on the subject of unemployment, I speak with all sincerity. I do not speak in the mood of throwing at the Government their alleged plan for the solution of unemployment which appeared in their famous plan in 1932 and 1933.  I think that the last Minister for Finance had the courage to say on several occasions that there was no plan for the solution of unemployment. While there cannot be said to be any ready-made plan for the solution of unemployment, the paramount duty of every class of the community is to bend its energies and unite in order to solve the present terrible condition in which we find ourselves in the matter of unemployment at the end of eight years of the present Government.  The sum of £8,383,000 is supposed to represent the contribution of the Government to the solution of the unemployment problem.  It is a sorry story to tell that with that colossal sum which the Government proposes to spend in the relief of unemployment, we are facing this year greater unemployment than ever.  The menace of unemployment is more menacing than ever, and there is less chance of even palliating the evils of this very serious problem.  Presumably, a corresponding sum to this sum of £8,383,000 was spent during the last three or four years.  Notwithstanding that figures have been produced and proved showing that in the last five years of Deputy Cosgrave's Government, more people were put into gainful occupation than were so put during the corresponding five-year period of the present Government, despite this vast expenditure of money.</P>
    <P>The expenditure of these sums of money may, possibly, palliate the evil of unemployment.  They may give employment, direct or indirect, but no money spent on the relief of unemployment can give real or lasting results unless some tangible asset is produced <Col N="335" /> in return for it.  As I said, I speak with all sincerity on this subject.  I believe that in the conditions existing in the world, the impact of which must be, and is being, felt in our own country feelings of unrest must be produced amongst the unemployed that will cause many grave reactions on the stability of any State, including our own State.  The Taoiseach yesterday found himself in the position of making an appeal over the radio to the people to support him in the restoration of ordered conditions.  I believe that a great deal of the disorder in the country is due to the existence of unemployment.  From my own experience of people coming to me trying to get work, I believe that the vast majority of unemployed people are, in all sincerity, anxious to get any sort of employment.  The cancer that eats into them through idleness day after day creates in them such a feeling of revolutionary unrest&mdash;almost hatred of the existing order&mdash;that there is no knowing to what lengths they may ultimately be driven.  From the point of view of restoring ordered conditions it is the prime essential that every possible effort should be made to find some method of relieving unemployment in the course of the coming year.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that £8,000,000 can be extracted by arithmetical gymnastics from the Estimates and that this sum has been passed by the Dáil. No real results have been achieved or will be achieved from the expenditure of these vast sums.  The only effect will be a minor palliation of the evil.  The vast amount of money extracted from the pockets of private taxpayers might more properly be spent by these individuals in giving employment by private enterprise.  As it is, they are forced to retrench and cut down the employment formerly given by them. The high rate of income-tax has a very serious repercussion on this vital problem of unemployment.  An individual who has to give one-third of his income to the State for all sorts of extravagances and to bolster up schemes which have produced no real, tangible or lasting asset finds that he cannot maintain even the employment <Col N="336" /> previously given in his own private business or in his own household. The result is that each individual has to do without one particular workman or one particular servant or, perhaps, two more that they might keep on if the income-tax was not so high.</P>
    <P>The income-tax is collected and spent in a vast variety of ways that produce no result except in increasing taxation and increasing unemployment.  The expenditure that is to be made this year will have no other effect than to mortgage the future and to leave the position of the unemployed far worse at the end of it, notwithstanding all this vast expenditure, than it is even at the present time.  It had been hoped that from the experience gained in the last few months some retrenchments or economies might have been made.  It was dangled before the eyes of the taxpayers last year, when the emergency Budget was introduced, that an economy committee was sitting, in regard to which there were great expectations; if not great expectations, at least expectations of some real and lasting cutting down of extravagant expenditure.  Instead of that we find the position to be this, that the Minister, in his opening statement yesterday, says that he feels that it is not possible for any such economies to be achieved. He gives no reasons why, except one, which is a mere vote-catching reason.</P>
    <P>He gives us no explanation of the work of the economy committee or no indication of what their recommendations are.  He gives no opportunity to the House to say that this recommendation ought to have been carried out, that that recommendation could have been carried out, or possibly this other recommendation might eat into old age pensions or unemployment assistance and, therefore, should not be carried out in the present circumstances.  In two or three lines the Minister dismisses the work of this economy committee, merely stating that he had come to the conclusion that it would eat into the social services and for that reason was not necessary.  Every time economy is demanded, at every stage when extravagant expenditure is protested against, one answer is given by every member of the Government, and <Col N="337" /> there is the following chorus from the Fianna Fáil Party.  That answer is that if you reduce expenditure or effect economies you will be doing it at the expense of the social services.  That cry has been shown to be false so frequently that it is not necessary to repeat it.</P>
    <P>Social services include old age pensions and unemployment assistance. The poor want work rather than unemployment assistance.  I think economy in public administration would be far more beneficial than any social service you can possibly have.  It is a great sign in a country that social services are well looked after, a sign that all parties desire to look after the old and infirm and the workless.  But it would be a far better sign for the prosperity of the country and for the future of the country if the Minister for Finance could say: &ldquo;We require less money this year for unemployment assistance; we require less for employment schemes; we require less money to hand out for road work on this, that or the other scheme, because of the fact that there is more work being given; the wheels of industry are working more smoothly and, consequently, our social services, while we maintained them when we had to maintain them, can now be reduced; we are now in a position to reduce them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of the Minister for Finance trying to pretend that the Vote for the Stationery Office, for the Public Works Department, for the construction of national schools, for the Gárdaí, the Army, for A.R.P. shelters, and all the other Votes that he added to make the £8,300,000, that, he said, was a good contribution by the Government to the unemployment situation, it would be a more healthy sign if he could say to us: &ldquo;Our industry is such, our social scheme is such, under the policy pursued by this Government, that we require less for unemployment assistance and less for employment schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although I do not wish in any matters I have to say on this question of unemployment to leave myself open to the charge of merely playing politics, I cannot pass this question by without saying this, that much of the <Col N="338" /> £8,300,000 in so far as part of it is represented by money that went in assisting employment, was used indirectly for the purpose of bolstering up the political fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have had experience of the working of Fianna Fáil political clubs in the country getting employment for the political supporters of the Government in power.  I think that many of those schemes have been thought out and devised rather with a view to the effect that they will have upon a general election or a bye-election than what effect they will have upon a permanent solution of the general unemployment situation, and the proof of that lies in the fact that with all the money expended in the last eight years, the unemployment situation is worse now than ever it was, and the only prospect that is held out is that it will possibly get even much worse in the future.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where the principal officer of the Department of Finance, speaking to a gathering of civil servants and discussing with them the necessity for inflicting upon them a greater sacrifice than any other section of the community is called upon to bear in existing circumstances, stated that the financial position of the country is sufficiently disquieting, and that expenditure for the year ended on 31st March exceeded revenue by over £2,000,000.  That was a statement made, I am sure, carefully, a statement made with due deliberation.</P>
    <P>The officer in question was representing the Minister for Finance at this conference, and he was putting to them the decision of the Government, which has been conveyed to the country in the Minister's speech to-day, that the bonus of the civil servants was to be stabilised.  He took care to say that the disquieting financial situation of the country was not the primary reason for the Government's decision.  He did say, and I quote his words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You are aware that the position is sufficiently disquieting.  In spite of increased taxation, including that which was imposed in the Supplementary Budget last November, <Col N="339" /> expenditure for the year ended 31st March exceeded revenue by over £2,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That situation is possibly not revealed in all its crude and naked truth in the Minister's statement that he read here yesterday.  But it is well for the country to know that that is the position, that £8,300,000 are being claimed as the sum that is being spent as the contribution of the Government out of the taxpayers' pockets to unemployment relief, unemployment solution and to the employment position.  It is well that they should recognise that all that has been a failure so far as the unemployment position is concerned, and it is well, therefore, that something should be done to reverse the policy which has brought about that position.  There must be something wrong with expenditure here, or the means by which expenditure is being directed if that is the situation.</P>
    <P>I said that I wished to make some general comments on matters affecting the general community, and one particular section of the community.  The matters to which I have referred, the high rate of income-tax and its effects on the general community and on a particular section of the general community, the income-tax payers, are very much affected by the unemployment problem, as are, perhaps, all classes and sections of the community. But the stabilisation of the bonus adumbrated in the Minister's statement affects vitally one class, small it may appear, of the community.  And I find myself once again in the course of a few years protesting against an injustice to the Civil Service of this State.  In his Supplementary Budget statement last November the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government felt that it was incumbent upon it to set its face against the efforts of any class of the community to obtain compensation for the rise in prices at the expense of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement which is supposed to furnish justification for the stabilisation of the Civil Service bonus.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to set its face against the efforts of any class of <Col N="340" /> the community to obtain compensation for the rise in prices at the expense of the community.  Why select one class of the community?  Was that phrase of the Minister's, given in his last year's Supplementary Budget and repeated in this year's Budget statement, directed solely at one class of the community, or was it to be of general application to all workers as well as to State servants?</P>
    <P>There has been growing up for some little time past a notion that a number of industrial disputes, strikes, lock-outs and demands for increased payments, the dislocation of trade and the things that result from these disputes might possibly be alleviated if the principle of the cost-of-living bonus was applied in the matter of the workers' wages.  I understand that principle has been successfully applied in some industries here in this country. There has, I understand, been a growing tendency in industry and amongst the workers to apply the principle of the cost-of-living bonus to these industrial disputes.  It is felt that the principle of the cost-of-living bonus is a sound one.  It has been decided by one of our courts that the cost-of-living bonus is a mere device to relate the actual salary or wages to the cost of living as it exists from time to time. The very name, cost-of-living bonus, carries its own justification.</P>
    <P>I think at this time it is improper, however expedient it may be from the point of view of the Minister for Finance sorely pressed with an unbalanced Budget, to balance his unbalanced Budget by a raid on the pockets of State civil servants.  It is a bad time for him to come to this decision, at the time when there was some hope that the cost-of-living bonus principle might be applied in the adjustment of wages generally, and so alleviate the distress and dislocation caused by industrial disputes, strikes, lock-outs, and the dislocation caused by these disputes generally.  The Minister has, however, taken that decision, and he has taken that decision after having promised the civil servants that he would consult with them or their representatives before such a decision was <Col N="341" /> made.  He carried out that promise merely in a formal way, presenting the representatives of the civil servants with an accomplished fact, presenting them with that decision and asking for their approval.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living bonus of civil servants was based upon an agreement between the Civil Service organisation and the State.  It has been judicially decided that the relationship between the State servants and the State is one of contract or statutory obligation.  It is extraordinary at the very moment when that decision has been given in our courts, and not appealed from,&mdash; and until it is set aside by a superior court it is the law of this country&mdash; that the Minister should seek to set it aside.  We have therefore the position now that the relationship between the Civil Service and the State is a statutory one.  Civil servants who have entered the service of the State since the establishment of the State have done so under a contract and a statutory obligation founded on contract.</P>
    <P>When a person proposes to enter the Civil Service he does so as a result of an intimation conveyed to him either by document or advertisement.  It has been the invariable practice when the person is sitting for the examination to set forth the salary, cost-of-living bonus&mdash;indicating the precise amount of the cost-of-living bonus which would obtain.  When he is received into the Civil Service he is received on the basis of that offer made to him on behalf of the State.  He enters into agreement with the State that he will serve for a basic salary and the cost-of-living bonus.  That is a contract complete in law under statutory obligations. It is proposed now so far as the Civil Service is concerned in the case of those with Treaty rights and those who have not those rights to set aside that contract.</P>
    <P>I do not know what means the Minister proposes to adopt in order to carry that decision into full effect. There are two classes of State servants who would be affected by this decision. One class of servants have Treaty rights.  The other is a class who have entered into the State service since the <Col N="342" /> establishment of the State.  We had experience shortly after the present Government got into power of cuts in the salaries of the civil servants and we know, therefore, the large amount of money that that particular decision following the cutting of salaries has cost the taxpayers of this country in giving compensation under Article 10 of the Treaty.  Those civil servants who were entitled to retire by reason of the inroads by the Government on their rights, retired presumably under these Treaty rights which are now set aside unilaterally.  Does the Minister hope to have some further moneys extracted from the pockets of the taxpayers by the stabilisation of the bonus?  I warn the Minister that that proposal to stabilise the bonus will cost in the first year £150,000.</P>
    <P>Where is the economy going to come in when that is taken into account as well as the cost of those who retire under Article 10 of the Treaty?  I assume, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that Treaty rights will not be affected in any way.  The Minister must, of course, remember that it has been decided judicially that any cut in salary, including the cost-of-living bonus, is an infringement on Treaty rights.  It is, therefore, clear that the present proposal is an infringement on Treaty rights.  It is an infringement on constitutional rights as well as on Treaty rights, because those rights, which were originally based on Article 10 of the Treaty, have been put into the Constitution.  As a constitutional right, the State servant was entitled to Treaty rights before the enactment of the Constitution.  As regards the inroad that is proposed to be made on the statutory and contractual right of every State servant, we have had a sufficient example of the complete disregard by the Government of those contractual rights to have any hope that those rights will be in any way sanctified, or have any proper consideration from the present Government. At all events, we have left to us the right to protest in this House against those inroads upon contractual rights.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience of <Col N="343" /> having a general election fought nominally upon the defeat of the Government upon a matter affecting civil servants.  We remember the vilification of State servants that was indulged in by members of the present Government during the course of that campaign.  I do not wish to rake these things up again, but I think it is grossly unfair to try to get it over to the people that the servants of the State are in a peculiarly privileged position, and that the sacrifice which is being demanded of them is not what the chief officer in the Department of Finance told the representatives of civil servants when he entered into this co-called consultation with them&mdash;a demand to take special sacrifices or burdens upon themselves in the interests of the State in a moment of emergency.  That was put forward by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement as a mere step in equality of sacrifice for all.  The statement made by the chief officer of the Department of Finance was not put upon the basis of equality of sacrifice.  It was put upon this basis, that State servants were asked in the present emergency to make a special contribution in view of their special situation to the financial stability of the State.</P>
    <P>If State servants are to be asked to make special sacrifices in special circumstances, let a case be made for that, but it is false pretences, it is a blinding of the ordinary people of the country who have been sufficiently blinded over the past eight or ten years by the vile propaganda that went on in Fianna Fáil circles about salaries and pensions, to say that this proposal to stabilise the bonus is merely asking civil servants to make equal sacrifices with all other classes of the community.  They are asked to make special sacrifices.  It is on equality of sacrifice that the present Minister for Finance has put his case for the stabilisation of the bonus.  That in my view, and I think it is beyond controversy, is an untenable case.  The vast majority of civil servants are lowly-paid officials who have to bear the brunt of every tax that has been put upon the people in the last eight <Col N="344" /> years by the present Government.  Now a special section of the community is being asked to bear an additional tax in breach, first of all, of Treaty and Constitutional rights, and, secondly, in breach of contractual and statutory rights.  The case that is being made of equality of sacrifice is a false case.  If a case is to be made for special sacrifices on the part of a special section of the community, let that be justified, if it can be justified, on special grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his statement yesterday, made the case that State servants were in some way in a special position.  He rather hinted that they were trying to get away with something that the general taxpayer was not going to stand for.  The ordinary person in the country, and particularly the poor farmer and the small farmer, has been poisoned in his mind and outlook by the propaganda carried on by the Fianna Fáil Party for many years about the big salaries that civil servants and Ministers were getting.  That cry has since been admitted by the present Government to have been a wrong cry, a false cry, and an untenable cry.  Before they got into power we all remember how they decried the last Government for the salaries they were taking at the expense of the poor farmers and of how they were raking the pockets of the poor for their own advantage.  When this Government got into power they were put in this humiliating position, that they had to go to the country and confess that they were wrong in what they had said.</P>
    <P>I admire them for confessing that they were wrong, but now they are proposing to do something which can find its only justification and excuse in the country by an appeal to a similar kind of poisonous propaganda.  I think it is entirely regrettable that such a case should be made.  Civil servants are in the same position as any other class in the community. They enjoy no special privileges.  In the course of the debate on the 1933 proposals of alleged economy, in answer to the statement that the country could not afford to pay salaries on the scale that they were being paid, <Col N="345" /> I made the statement then, and I repeat it now, that the ordinary people of this country, so far from not being able to pay decent salaries to hardworking officials who have given loyal service to successive Governments in this country, must sooner or later wake up to the fact that they cannot afford to underpay servants of the State.</P>
    <P>I have stood repeatedly for the rights of civil servants.  I, at least, can make the case here that I have a mandate from my constituency to speak on behalf of civil servants.  Every effort was made in my constituency during the last election to vilify civil servants. Every effort was made to deprive me of my seat in that constituency because of the stand I took on behalf of civil servants.  But I was returned at the last general election and, therefore, I claim that I am entitled to stand up here and say that I, at least, have a mandate from my constituents to speak on behalf of civil servants, and I am doing so.  I want it, however, to be clearly understood that I am doing that, not in the interests of any section of the community and, above all, not in the interests of bureaucracy, but in the interests of the general good of the community, in the interests of the general good of the taxpayers who have to bear the cost of the Civil Service. I want to see develop here a State service which will be efficient, small and properly paid, a service that will not be run on bureaucratic lines, a service in which there will be less red tape and more loyal service and more hard work than will be got from the pursuit of the kind of policy insisted on since the present Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted&mdash;in fact it has been admitted&mdash;that civil servants have given good service to this State, service that no money could buy, during the last 20 years, in building up the State and in building up the institutions of the State.  I think it is unjust to single them out now on the cry of &ldquo;equality of sacrifice.&rdquo;  That is a false case to make.  The plea that a special contribution must be made in the present emergency is a false one. If any special contribution has to be <Col N="346" /> made by income-tax payers, if any special contribution has to be made by civil servants under the present conditions, those sacrifices are not demanded by the war; they are not demanded by our neutrality or by world conditions, but are the direct and inevitable result of the policy pursued over the last eight years by the Fianna Fáil Government.  In every single respect their policy proved in effect, in reality and in working to be an absolute failure.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer of this country has been made pay very dearly for the failures of the present Government. The income-tax payer is paying 6/6 in the £, not because of the war but because of Government policy.  The working man pays taxes upon his tobacco, bread and other foodstuffs not on account of the war, not on account of the restrictions upon imports but on account of the results of the failure of Government policy, on account of their efforts to try to justify at the expense of the taxpayer something which could not be justified.  When that is realised &mdash;as I think it has been pretty fully realised throughout the country&mdash;when it is realised that democracy rests upon efficiency and when we are able to educate our own democracy in this country to the position where they will vote, not to get pecuniary advantage from any Government at the expense of the taxpayer but to get efficient service, loyal work and a good return for their money, then there will be some hope of ending the unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>Efforts have been made to make this Budget appear to be a very good one.  It is, however, a very hopeless one from the point of view of every citizen.  Just before the Budget was introduced, there was a war scare that there would be a frightful rise, especially in the cost of the commodities the people were using, and it has been a great victory for the new Minister for Finance that there was not.  Any ordinary, sane, sensible man can understand that the Budget is as bad as it could possibly be, in the way it is affecting every citizen. We have had six or seven years of a <Col N="347" /> definitely consistent rise in taxation. That came immediately after we were told that the people previously in government were a pack of robbers and scoundrels, who had no respect for the ordinary people and who, with the help of the civil servants, were plundering the country.  One would imagine that, at least after one or two years, people would have got a little common sense.  They did not; two years&mdash;six years&mdash;went by, and now there is only a faint ray of hope on the horizon that the people on the opposite benches&mdash; and especially the Government&mdash;have come to some kind of sensibility, that they have come to realise the country cannot carry on as it has been carrying on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are trying to make all kinds of excuses.  Deputy Costello has referred to the outcry which arose, especially two years ago, that the civil servants were costing too much.  The Minister now suggests stabilising the Civil Service bonus at 85 points.  I wonder if he thinks this war is going to last for ever.  Does he think this is going to help the country financially?  What will happen when the war is over, when there may be a frightful depression? Then the cost of living bonus would not go down to 65.  The labourer in the country would be very badly off, but the civil servant would still be entitled to the bonus at 85, if it is kept stabilised for all future Governments. Is it intended to change it at some future date?  Deputy Costello has said he believes that civil servants are entitled to decent salaries, but outside of that we have £8,000,000 for social services and £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 for farmers.  Does the Minister himself for a moment believe that the poor people entitled to the £8,000,000 and the farmers entitled to the £10,000,000 are getting those sums? I cannot understand how people are so badly off in the country if they are getting that money.  The Government cannot deny that the agricultural community is badly off; they cannot deny that the ordinary labourer in rural Ireland&mdash;and the labourer in Dublin, too&mdash;is pretty badly off.  If all this money set out here is going to them, <Col N="348" /> nobody should be badly off&mdash;they should be doing well.</P>
    <P>We heard a speech from Deputy Childers this evening, which I very much admired and which I thought was a rather good and sensible speech; but it seemed to me that the Minister did not like it, and that the previous Minister for Finance did not like it either.  It would have been a better speech had he not gone too far to try to cover up the blunders and foolishness which occurred during the past six or seven years.  He was trying to get his speech over from 1922 to the present day.  I agree with a lot of what he said, as I agree with what he said on Sunday last&mdash;there should not be a lot of people in this country trying to disrupt this State under and behind salaries and pensions obtained from the Government.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for the high cost of the Army?  I wonder if the Minister himself has any idea?  Nine or ten years ago he was telling us that the cost of the Army was too high.  If that is so, why has he been building up an Army&mdash;especially one in which most of its members are unreliable, from the point of view of the Government&mdash;for the past year or two?  Why is an extra £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 being spent on building up that Army, without being definitely certain that that Army is going to be used in defence of the State?  We have been told that we are in a difficult position here.  Surely, with the impoverished state of the country, this should not be necessary at all.  The Minister and the Government should be dead certain that the Army is going to be a useful instrument so far as the State is concerned, internally, and especially internally because of the trouble at the moment. The trouble is internal, in the minds of the Ministers, just as it is internal in my mind, and as far as the mind of every Deputy on the Fianna Fáil side is concerned there is not a Deputy on that side of the House who is seriously concerned about the international situation or as to the question of who is going to invade this country, and I do not believe for a moment that there is anything in what we are told as to <Col N="349" /> the war developing on the western side to such an extent that there is a likelihood of invasion here, but of course this has been made a great excuse for expenditure on the Army.</P>
    <P>You have a very big number of men in the Army, and I believe that it is a complete waste of money When the raid was made on the Magazine Fort, for instance, all Gárda barracks all over the country, even as far as 100 miles and more away from Dublin, were notified of the raid and instructed to hold up cars and lorries and search them, while the military got no such notification.  That was a lovely thing to have happen&mdash;that a Gárdaí barracks should get notification and that the Gárdaí should be instructed to go out and hold up and search lorries, while a military station, with all its soldiers and equipment, got no notification whatever.</P>
    <P>Getting away from that matter, however, we have the boast being made by Ministers opposite that industries are being built up here&mdash;and, of course, they are&mdash;but still our export trade has been getting smaller, and we find that we have nothing to sell except agricultural produce.  With the exception of agricultural produce, we have nothing to export, except Guinness' stout and a few other small items. Yet, you are building up a number of other industries that are not giving any greater employment than was given before you came into power. There has been no rise in employment since then.  What is the position in regard to all our industries, including agriculture, which is the principal industry?  Take all the industries, including agriculture, combined, and what is the position?  The position is that you are mulcting agriculture in a terrible impost in order to keep these other industries going and you are having men, day after day, disemployed or put out of employment in agriculture. The Minister cannot get over the fact that dozens of his industries throughout the country are kept going in order to supply the wants of the household in the agricultural industry&mdash; in order to supply the machinery of the agricultural industry, from the brush <Col N="350" /> or the candle that is in use in the house, to the spade, shovel and fork that is in use in the yard, and the machine in the field.  These industries supply nobody else, and before you bolstered up these industries, the agricultural industry was buying the stuff at at least two-thirds of the price, or even less, and in many cases at less than half the price.</P>
    <P>Instead of fostering the one real industry that you have, agriculture&mdash; the one industry that is going to keep the country going&mdash;you are setting up a lot of these other industries and making that principal industry of agriculture pay for the others.</P>
    <P>Of course, I suppose it will be said that I am against the setting up of industries.  I certainly am not.  I should love to see dozens of industries of all kinds set up here, but let not an industry be set up here that is going to hurt and even kill our principal industry. Let us not set up industries in a haphazard fashion, here, there and the other place, and let us not make one blunder and then, in order to rectify that blunder, make another one. That is the position.  From the brush or the candle in the kitchen, to the fork or shovel in the yard, and the machine in the field, an extra price is being heaped on the back of agriculture. Every sensible man and every business man in the country knows that, and everybody who is not merely out to play politics will admit it.  The Minister himself knows it now, and I am glad that both he and his predecessor in the Ministry of Finance have admitted it.  They have admitted at different meetings and dinners that they have attended that agriculture is the principal industry of this country. Why, then, kill that industry by setting up a lot of other industries merely to placate their supporters and, thereby, place the whole burden on the back of agriculture?  That is really what has happened.  Mind you, even with the burden of taxation that is upon us, we could bear it, if there were an ordinary sane and sensible administration, and while, perhaps, you are getting back to sanity, God knows, there is one thing that you surely ought to be certain about, and that is that you cannot continue increasing our <Col N="351" /> dead-weight debt, year after year, and especially during the present years when there is some hope that we shall be able to make some money.  This is a time when we should be hoping to get out of debt, and you should not go on increasing that debt.  Why should we not be preparing to meet a leaner time later on?  I am afraid, however, that while you are satisfied and certain about the economic truth, you have not yet made up your minds to save this country from economic ruin.</P>
    <P>There is no Minister or Deputy on the other side, who has any contact with the Land Commission, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or the various Departments concerned, who does not know the position fairly well; and while, perhaps, 50 per cent. of the people in rural Ireland who are engaged in agriculture and in business are doing well at the moment, or rather beginning to do pretty well, there must be nearly 50 per cent. more who cannot do well because of the position in which they have found themselves after six years of maladministration. There is a hope now that, if you decrease, or at least do not increase, the overhead expenses of the agricultural industry, we may be able to survive, because, when this war is over, it is not 30 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the agricultural community that we are going to have almost bankrupt, but 75 per cent., and that in a very short time, unless something is done to safeguard the position. All these other little industries that you have set up will not save you from ruin.  There is not a hope of these industries saving you from ruin. I suppose that, in 25 per cent. of the industries that the Minister boasts <Col N="352" /> about as having been set up through the country, 50 per cent. of the people employed in them are little girls.</P>

      <P>At any rate, these industries are not going to save the country.  The Minister has made a few changes in import duties and these few changes are going to cost some householders something here and there. They are trifling changes, according to the Minister, but they are going to be more costly.  The one thing we must remember, however, is that agriculture is our principal industry in this country.  I do not want to press the matter too much, and I should like to see other industries going on here as well.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
