    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will set up a Parliamentary commission of inquiry into the circumstances relating to the raid on the Magazine Fort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to set up a Parliamentary commission of inquiry as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, does he not consider that, as a very grave condition of affairs appears to exist, the Parliament should be informed of the causes that have led up to it, and that the only manner in which information on that can be got is at a Parliamentary inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever information it will be possible, consistent with the public interest, to give can be given by the Minister when the main Estimate comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why cannot the opportunity be taken to give that information on the Supplementary Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, as the Deputy knows, the Court of Inquiry has presented its report.  It has been considered by the Government, and arising out of its findings certain disciplinary action has been decided upon, including perhaps courtmartial.  As long as the position is like that, I do not think <Col N="1990" /> it would be right that there should be a discussion here at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that punitive disciplinary action is likely to be taken against certain members of the Army without any opportunity being given to Parliament to assess whether punitive measures should not be taken against the Ministerial side of the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers are always at the disposal of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that Parliament should be made aware of the circumstances in which the administration of the Fort was such that one officer only was on duty.  That surely, in itself, shows that the Ministerial administration was at fault&mdash;to have only one officer on duty for the 24 hours.  I submit that the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance are involved in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy ought not to talk away from the facts. The position is that every Deputy in the House will have an opportunity of dealing with any Ministerial responsibility when the main Estimate comes before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When will that be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose at the usual time.  I cannot say exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say why the opportunity afforded by the Supplementary Estimate should not be taken to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, as I have already told the Deputy and the House very definitely, arising out of the findings of the court, disciplinary action is contemplated, including a courtmartial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that I consider the Taoiseach's reply unsatisfactory, I beg to give notice that I will raise the question on the motion for the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1991" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All that I can say to the Deputy is that, in the nature of things, he cannot get any more information from me than I have given him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into the question of the punitive action taken or courtsmartial or anything of that kind, I do not see why a Parliamentary inquiry should not be set up to consider the merits of this.  Therefore, I propose to raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in view of the abnormal costs to be met by beet growers this year over and above the costs taken into consideration in the fixing of the price of beet for the year, he will be prepared to give favourable consideration to a case presented on behalf of the beet growers for a revision of prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any abnormal costs to be met by beet growers over and above those taken into consideration in the fixing of the price of beet for this year.  The effect of war conditions on the growers' costs was fully taken into account in fixing that price. The second part of the question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was hoped that proposals which were under consideration for an amendment of the law relating to the grant of superannuation allowances could have been submitted early in the present year. <Col N="1992" /> Legislative proposals of a more pressing nature had to be dealt with first and I cannot at present state when a Superannuation Bill will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether any steps are being taken to ensure a constant and full supply of high-grade and tubercular tested milk for the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the milk referred to by the Deputy is the milk produced and sold under the designation &ldquo;highest grade milk&rdquo; and that the term &ldquo;constant and full supply&rdquo; is intended to mean a supply sufficient to meet the normal demand for such milk.  I have no function or power to ensure that such a supply will be available for the City of Dublin, but I have no reason to think that the necessary supply is not available.  The number of applications for licences for the production and sale of such milk in the Dublin district for the present year has already up to the present date practically reached the number of such licences granted up to the close of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to provide, in the Dublin district and in all other areas in the country, adequate supplies of effectively pasteurised milk where supplies of grade A milk are not available; and is he aware that, in several areas, milk powder is being furnished instead of milk because people are not able to get supplies of grade A milk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether, in view of the fact that the beet acreage applied for to date is approximately 66,000 acres, an increase of 26,000 acres on last year's acreage, and that merchants are allowed to supply farmers with only 75 per cent. of last year's requirements, he will make special arrangements to provide an adequate supply of artificial manures for this year's beet crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consultation between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, arrangements were made for the purchase of adequate supplies of the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of superphosphate, which is the main ingredient in all compound fertilisers.  Owing to difficulties in chartering the requisite shipping, it has not so far been possible to have these materials transported in quantities sufficient to meet demands. Efforts to overcome these difficulties continue to be made, though in present circumstances it is impossible to forecast the extent to which such efforts are likely to be successful.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, farmers should as already advised by the Minister for Agriculture, reserve all available supplies of superphosphate for their tillage crops generally&mdash;including the beet crop.  Reasonably adequate supplies of sulphate of ammonia and potassic manures are available, and I am informed by the Minister for Agriculture that to the extent to which farmers can get supplies of superphosphate they should be enabled to prepare the standard fertiliser mixture for beet, to supplement such supplies of prepared beet manures as will be available to them through normal channels.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, as a result of the refusal of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to pay the 10/- bounty on imported manufactured manure, substantial supplies of superphosphate of lime which were available for this country in Great Britain have not been availed of and will not be availed of, as they will not be eligible for the 10/- bounty which the Minister is paying on Irish manufactured manure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been drawn to the efforts made in Éire by certain interests to contract general war risk insurance, and whether in view of the financial risks attending such operations, he is prepared to take action either in the direction of arranging for State participation in some war risk insurance scheme or of discouraging efforts made through private channels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to efforts of the kind mentioned in the question.  While I do not suggest that the persons responsible for these efforts have any intention to defraud, their appeal to the public to subscribe premiums seems likely to mislead members of the public into the error of supposing that a substantial indemnity against the risk of war damage is afforded.  It is desirable that the public should be aware that responsible insurance bodies regard the risk of war damage to fixed property as uninsurable and have declined to undertake this class of insurance business.  I have under consideration the question of appropriate action to curtail the activities of the promoters of war risk insurance schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether any applications have recently been made in his Department for the renting or purchasing of Dublin Dockyard; and if he will state what inducements or protection, if <Col N="1998" /> any, he proposes to offer to investors who are prepared to open the dockyard and give reasonable employment.</P>

Earlier, some negotiations, I understand, did take place between a group considering the opening of the dockyard and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, but the outbreak of war, amongst other considerations, brought these to an end.

      <P>The Deputy will understand that as it is very unlikely that our nationals will be the principal customers of dockyards of this sort, it can only be opened upon a competitive and economic basis.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to be sufficiently attractive to induce people to take it up as a business proposition.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister if his attention has been brought to the statement of the First Lord of the Admiralty in Great Britain to the effect that the British Government has now undertaken responsibility not only for building warcraft but for the replacements of the merchant navy losses in Great Britain, and in those circumstances has he considered approaching any of the shipbuilding yards in Great Britain who have now been charged with the task of replacing merchant navy losses in Great Britain during this period, with a view to interesting the shipping yards in the added accommodation which is available for work in the port of Dublin?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will take immediate steps to have restrictions such as have been imposed at Dunworley Strand, Clonakilty, removed so as to permit the agricultural community to avail of the advantages which a supply of sand and seaweed mean to them in the cultivation of crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Dunworley Strand, Clonakilty, is assumed to be the foreshore adjacent to the townlands of Lehenagh, Lissycrimeen and Dunworley at Dunworley Bay, and the circumstances there are similar to those existing at other places on the coast where there is no danger of erosion rendering necessary special restrictions on the removal of beach material. Licences authorising the removal of sand and seaweed for use as fertiliser have already been granted and all applications for such licences will receive sympathetic consideration.  A reversion of the policy of requiring persons wanting beach material to apply for licences cannot be contemplated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, my information in <Col N="2000" /> regard to Dunworley Strand is that farmers were not allowed to cart sand from parts of it.  I had a similar question down last week, and as it is not a matter which I can discuss across the House I should be glad if the Minister would give me an opportunity of discussing it with him to-day?</P>

      <P>Particulars of employment and of salaries and wages paid are only available for the linen, cotton, jute and canvas industries combined. Many of the firms engaged in the production of linen goods are also engaged in the production of other textile goods and such firms are not required at the Census of Industrial Production to furnish separate particulars of employment or salaries and wages in respect of the different branches of the industry.  Accordingly, it is not possible to give the information which the Deputy requires.</P>

      <P>As the answer is in the form of a tabular statement I propose to circulate it with the Official Report.  The table shows the quantity and value of cotton yarn imported in each of the years 1937 and 1938 and in the first eight months of 1939.  The Deputy will have observed that for September, 1939, and subsequent months a summary only of imports and exports has been issued.  On grounds of public policy it has been decided not to publish for the present in any form more details than are given in this summary.</P>

It is not intended to undertake new inspection work or to open up new proceedings for acquisition.  As I explained to Deputy Norton on that occasion, the Land Commission have a considerable amount of acquisition and other work on hands which will occupy their attention for a considerable time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state whether before the making of the Emergency Powers (No. 22) Order, 1940, any representations were made in favour of making such order and, if so, whether he will state the nature of such representations; and if no such representations were made, whether he will state the grounds on which it has been decided to extend to the 25th February the operation of the Summer Time Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The order in question was made in the following circumstances:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When it was announced at the end of January that summer time was to come into operation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 25th of February, whilst it would not, in the ordinary way, come into operation in this State until the 21st of April, the Government had to consider whether it would not be advisable to introduce summer time here on the 25th of February also, as a special measure, in order to avoid the confusion which would be caused by a difference in time, for a period of eight weeks, between countries which normally operate on the same time system.  An immediate decision was essential so that interested parties, such as railway companies, might know where they stood in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Government were advised that the timing of our rail services is dependent to a large extent on the times of sailing of the cross-channel boats and that as these boats, which are timed to meet British trains, would follow summer time, it would be necessary for the railway companies to retime nearly all their trains for the eight weeks commencing on the 25th of February, if summer time were not introduced in this country on that date.  They were advised also that a serious disturbance would be caused in mail, telegraph and telephone communications with Great Britain and Northern Ireland if there were to be a temporary discrepancy in the official time systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> It was, of course, appreciated that from the point of view of purely internal administration there were both advantages and disadvantages in making summer time operative at so early a date.  On the whole, it seemed clear to the Government that the balance of advantage lay in adopting the earlier date and the order was made accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that no matter what alterations Britain, for the purposes of her economy, makes in her Greenwich time we are automatically bound to follow because the considerations to which the Minister refers would apply probably even in a more intensified form if the disparity were more than an hour?  Why cannot we think of this problem of time from our own standpoint rather than from the point of view of transport communications?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that the whole question of summer time is to be considered. The question as to whether summer time is to be continued here or not is under consideration.  In the meantime, for the reasons I have given, it was considered most advisable not to have such a difference in time for a short period.  The decision that will be made eventually as to whether summer time will be continued here or not will depend on the case that is made before this commission.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of control of Imports (Quota No. 37) (Amendment) Order, 1939.</P>
      <P>The amended quota order provides for certain exemptions from the terms of the original order.  According to the amendment which it is now sought to make, hats which are of a value of 12/9 each or more, hats made of straw and partly manufactured hats and caps made of material other than felt, will be removed from the scope of the original quota order and accordingly will be freely imported subject, of course, to the payment of such duty as they may carry.  In addition to that, opportunity is taken in this quota order to amend, in certain minor respects, the application of the original order so as to exclude from the prohibition, hats and caps which are imported in such circumstances that their importation does not conflict with the purpose for which the order was made.  For example, the following classes will be exempt hereafter from quota control:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  hats which are shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be intended solely for use for scientific or medical purposes;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  hats which are imported in such circumstances that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they <Col N="2017" /> are being sent as gifts from persons outside Ireland to persons resident in Ireland;</P>
    <P>(c)  hats which are imported as part of the personal effects of persons who have permanently transferred their residence to this country;</P>
    <P>(d)  hats or caps which are imported as wedding gifts for a person not ordinarily resident in this country and who intends to reside here permanently;</P>
    <P>(e)  hats which are imported as part of the personal estate of a person who has died outside Ireland by a person who has become entitled to them under the will or intestacy of the deceased person;</P>
    <P>(f)  hats which are imported in connection with the arrangement or maintenance of an Atlantic air service using or involving the use of an airport in Ireland;</P>
    <P>(g)  hats which are imported solely for the purpose of an exhibition or demonstration or any similar purpose and which are not intended to be sold or offered for sale in Ireland;</P>
    <P>(h)  hats which are imported for further manufacture and subsequent re-exportation;</P>
    <P>(i)  hats which are imported temporarily only.</P>
    <P>These minor exemptions will be made effective by this order and they will make the administration of the quota less irksome both to the revenue authorities and other parties interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that this poisonous instrument of the quota is now being used only to control the millinery supplies of the least prosperous sections of the community.  I know that this is a subject which does not engage the sympathy of many Deputies in this House, but I shall not cease from pointing out that this quota is a double-edged weapon which not only inconveniences women who purchase millinery but, what is very much more serious, has wrought great injury to a number of decent people who are making a living out of the sale of millinery in this country.  I have in my mind at the present moment a very gallant woman, a widow with young children, who took up her husband's work of dealing in millinery and managed to keep her family afloat as a result of her exertions.  The effect of these quotas has been gravely to imperil her livelihood, not only through the restrictions that were imposed upon supplies of merchandise which she could get, but because this rotten quota order, as every quota order is rotten, immediately gave rise to the establishment within this State of a ring, consisting of the protected manufacturer in Galway and a limited number of wholesale millinery dealers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking, Sir, that import be extended not only to the hats which cost 12/9 but also to the hats which cost ? at the moment of import, because I say the failure to widen the exemption provided for in this quota order is permitting the growth of rings in this country which are designed not only&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not entitled to make this case: that the millinery ring in this country will be required to make available supplies of millinery produced behind this quota to every bona-fide wholesale millinery dealer? At the present moment there are bona-fide wholesale dealers in millinery who are being refused supplies by the ring.  The ring says: &ldquo;We will not let you get in.  We know you have been in the habit of dealing in millinery in the past.  You have got squeezed out by the quota and we will not allow you get supplies of home-manufactured hats.  Therefore, we are going to push you exclusively into the millinery trade at 12s. 9d. and over that price, because you cannot, by paying any duty bring in supplies of the cheaper article.&rdquo;  I say that is the greatest injustice.  I do not believe this House ever meant the quota to be used for that purpose, and I am saying to the Minister that the only method he has for remedying that is to say to these people: &ldquo;Either you are going to give supplies freely and readily to any bona-fide wholesale milliners in this country or I am going to widen the exemption under this quota and make it possible to get supplies elsewhere.&rdquo;  God knows if we cannot produce for this country with a protection of 60 per cent. we ought to shut up shop and get out.  If a duty of 60 per cent. has to be reinforced by quotas, factories depending on such a system would be much better dispensed with.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is now going into the general questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he ought to insist on adequate supplies of millinery being made available to those dealing in it by firms protected by this disgusting order, or else inform these people that the quota system would be completely changed in future.  I object strongly to exemption designed to accommodate only those who are in a position to buy hats costing more than 12/9, while it is considered expedient to inform the common people when buying their hats that unless they pay this price they will not be allowed to get them in.  Why should those who can afford to pay a guinea for hats be allowed to get them from any part of the world, because they have the extra money, while those who can only pay 4/11 are restrained from getting a hat from anywhere but where the Minister thinks they should get it, whether they are prepared to pay the duty or not?  I do not believe the people realise the differentiation or, to my mind, the malignant and undesirable class distinction of that kind that is being made in orders of this sort.  Who would justify saying that the rich in our community were to be allowed the fullest liberty to get their supplies where they liked, and to turn to the poor in the community and say: &ldquo;You are to be the exploited persons, and you are to be compelled to deal with these people whether you like it or not&rdquo;?  That is not justice.  It does not matter whether supplies of hats are affected by the quotas or not, you have no right to say to the rich: &ldquo;We will give you a wide variety and permit you to have facilities and conveniences that we do not think it necessary to give to the poor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not just.  It is not fair, and it ought not to be done.  I sympathise with the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, because I think he has had thrust upon him the whole of this disgusting machinery, but he should not allow it to be used for whatever rotten purpose it is turned to.  It should not be used for the purpose of differentiation between rich and poor. <Col N="2021" /> Perhaps it is that he has not that in mind, and that he is simply travelling part of the way towards abolishing the quota system and substituting for it a flexible system of tariffs.  If that is true I have no desire to say more than this, that when there is a differentiation between the rich and the poor, he will agree with me that the effect of this type of regulation is to create misgivings and possible misunderstandings; to create resentment on the part of those whose supplies are controlled while their better-off neighbours are not controlled.  In the light of that I suggest that he should apply himself to the task not only of altering the quota orders by modification such as I suggest, but to abolish them, lock, stock and barrel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think when the Deputy considers the suggestion he has made to me he will appreciate that it would be quite impossible in existing circumstances to do what he suggests. Quite frankly, I am not in love with quotas.  There is a good deal to be said against them, but there is also something to be said for them.  At the moment, the main thing which has to be said for them is that there is a number of industries established in this country which, possibly, could not exist unless they had quota protection. Take the industry which we are considering. Experience has shown that no amount of tariff protection is likely to enable industries of that sort to exist and maintain themselves in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they ought to be run by the State or not run at all. They ought to be run for the benefit of the community and not individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if we were starting anew there might be something to be said for that.  But that is not the position.  People have been committed to that industry.  It has been established, and now affords a considerable amount of employment in a centre where employment is very desirable, and where this industry, if it were to cease to-morrow, would be very much missed.  There are no less that 250 people <Col N="2022" /> working for firm concerned, and of these 250 hands, 100 are men and boys. Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be serious to take a decision which might involve the shutting down of this industry, and the disemployment of these 250 hands.  The Deputy asked me what is the justification for the quota on hats of a certain price.  The answer is that it has been found&mdash;at least I am given to understand&mdash;that the situation is such, that most people agree that the factory in Galway is able, reasonably, to satisfy the demand which exists here for hats below a certain value, and that if any persons wish to import a hat over that value, then they have to pay a corresponding amount of duty which is not inconsiderable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who wishes to buy a hat of greater value than 12/9 does not get it in at 12/9.  If a person wishes to wear a hat of that sort she has to pay to the Exchequer 3/2¼d. for the privilege.  That is, to some extent, a deterrent which operates to prevent people bringing in hats not covered by the quota.  If class distinction exists, as the Deputy alleges, then those who want to get the better class article have to pay for the privilege, and when they pay, the amount does not go into the pockets of the hat manufacturers, or the employees of the hat factory, but goes to the Exchequer to be used for the general purposes of the State, so that there is some contribution to the general good to be derived out of the price which persons pay for the privilege of wearing a hat value for more than 12/9.  On the other side of the scale we have the employment that is given.  Looking at the situation I should say frankly that if I could make trade freer in regard to this matter, I should do so, but, against my own predeliction and desire, I have to remember that I might be jeopardising the employment of even one or two of some of these 250 people. I do not think in the present circumstances of the time I could afford to face up to that.  I am prepared to meet Deputy Dillon to this extent.  I say that these quota orders were never intended to foster or develop the <Col N="2023" /> growth of rings among wholesalers or to create any vested interests in this country.  Inside the quotas there should be the fairest and freest trade possible. It will be a matter for very serious consideration&mdash;if use is made of these quotas to build up rings and restrain trade&mdash;whether we should continue them at all or not.  If quota orders are utilised to build up vested interests of the kind that Deputy Dillon suggests, as far I am concerned I will set my face steadfastly against that, and I shall endeavour, within general limitations of the quotas, to ensure that every individual in the country has the right to engage in any occupation that may exist, and to exercise his right, so far as he can, to earn a living freely inside this country.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to secure that the provisions of the Bill basing the contribution of local authorities upon the gross valuation instead of the net assessable valuation, upon which alone the local authorities can raise a rate, shall not operate retrospectively.  If the Bill is to impose a greater liability upon the local authorities than that imposed by the original Act of 1933, this increase of liability should be confined to the future, and the local authorities should not be compelled to raise from the ratepayers in respect of past years the new increase which can only be made legal by the passing of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add that it is very undesirable that legislation should be retrospective.  The Minister, in speaking on this Bill previously, made great play with the fact that some of the corporations did not discover for a year or so what their rights were, and that they then appeared to have a double dose of original sin in exercising what they thought were their rights in the withholding of the payments except on effective valuation.  I suggest to the Minister that a corporation which is advised that it is paying more than it should would be in a very unenviable position if it failed to act on that advice, where the advice had been properly given, and I submit that that advice apparently was properly given because the Bill says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to remove doubts as to the true meaning and construction of Section 26 of the Principal Act, it is hereby enacted as follows....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If it is said that does not prove the case of the people who thought they need not pay, I leave it to the common sense of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which seems rather peculiar is why the Minister suggested <Col N="2025" /> a rate on the gross valuation when he knew perfectly well that these bodies would have to raise it on the effective valuation.  Was it done to make it appear all the smaller?  He says, in other words: &ldquo;Raise a ? rate on the gross valuation in order that it may look all the smaller,&rdquo; because what apparently these corporations will now have to do is to strike a rate of 2/- on the effective valuation in order to produce what a ? rate on the gross valuation would produce.  I suggest that that is another anomaly and that the Minister ought to accept this amendment.  He has now got it for all future time, as, of course, is his right, but I do not think it fair that when public bodies who are, or, at least, who believe themselves to be, the custodians of the ratepayers' interests, are advised that they have a certain legal remedy, the Minister should bring in a Bill and say: &ldquo;This is the law for I made it so.&rdquo;  I suggest he should accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this matter would apply more to the section rather than to the amendment, but I may as well make them on the amendment.  I think the proposal in this Bill is as outrageous a proposal as ever came from the opposite benches, and that is saying a lot.  We are amending now a Bill passed amongst the 1933 Acts.  We have now got to 1940, and the people who will be affected by this Bill are the ratepayers for 1940-41.  The Minister claims that a strict reading of the law of 1933 entitled him to get the moneys he now claims under this Bill.  What has the Minister and his legal cohorts, and the courts, been doing for the last five years about this matter?  Will the Minister say why a law passed by the Houses of Parliament here and according to his advice and, allegedly now, according to his then intention, meaning a particular thing, has been allowed to be flouted and ignored for the last five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had a shred of legal justification for what he is attempting to suggest now, he would not have allowed the law to be flouted by anybody for the last four or five years, so that we take it that so far from removing doubts, this Bill is intended as a definite changing of the Act of 1933 and a going back on the powers given to him under that Act to take money from certain rating bodies.  In 1941, and in respect of the ratepayers of 1940-41, he comes now not only to put an increased amount in the ordinary annual way in which this Bill is intended to put it, but to get back moneys extending over a number of years, and that out of the ratepayers of the present.  In itself, it is as vicious and outrageous a proposal as ever came from the far benches, but, in the present circumstances, and from what we can read of the present general employment situation in the country arising out of the effect of Government policy, it is proceeding vigorously in the direction in which the Government have proceeded in the past, that is, to take additional moneys out of the pockets of ratepayers and <Col N="2027" /> taxpayers and to spend them themselves to the detriment of the general employment in the country.</P>
    <P>Sufficient should be known, and is known from the circumstances of the present time, to suggest to Ministers that they ought to back pedal on a policy of this kind rather than proceed in the direction in which they are going.  Figures have been published showing the general trend of employment in the year 1939, and when related to the figures already published for 1938 and 1937 it is definitely manifest that the financial policy of the present Government has completely wiped out the annual average increment in employment throughout the country.</P>

The result has been that, in spite of huge sums of money, totalling about £9,000,000 per year in extra taxation, including the land annuities, apart from borrowed money, spent by the Government, during the last few years, not only is the annual additional employment in the country reduced to 75 per cent. of what it was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My point is that if the section is passed&mdash;I am dealing with the section as well as the amendment&mdash;it is going to take out of the pockets of the Dublin people substantial sums of money that will give less employment than if they were left in the hands of the Dublin people to be spent by them and that the situation in the city is crying out for the extension of employment.  If this money gets into the hands of the Government there will be less employment given with the result that there will be additional burdens falling on the ratepayers of the City of Dublin owing to the necessity for giving home assistance, and there will be less employment in the City of Dublin.  In the City of Dublin in January there were 1,900 persons more in receipt of unemployment assistance than there were a year ago; 4,300 more than there were two years ago; and 5,500 more than there were three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may argue that his case for taking money out of the pockets of the ratepayers is that it is to pay for additional unemployment assistance.  I say that the additional unemployment is a result of Government policy and not the policy of the Dublin Corporation. Part of the Government policy was to take large sums of money out of the pockets of the ratepayers and taxpayers and that is what is bringing about unemployment in the City of Dublin.  If this Bill is applied retrospectively in the City of Dublin and the money is to be used by the Government <Col N="2029" /> rather than by anybody else, it is going to give less employment here, which will mean that there will be more demands on the pockets of the ratepayers for unemployment assistance. We are entering on a dirtier and more vicious circle.  If the Minister has no better proposal to make than to proceed more viciously in this matter of financial policy than in the past, and if we are not to have additional unemployment, which will call for more money being taken out of the pockets of the people, then the Minister should not only drop the retrospective aspect of this section, but he should drop the whole idea itself.  The whole idea is simply carrying on a policy that has brought about the very situation that they are attempting now to piece and patch, and will not be able to piece or patch or do anything with until they change their financial policy.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment because I disagree entirely with retrospective legislation of this kind. This is, to my mind, a very bad year for a Government to try to collect moneys retrospectively from local councils.  It is known to the Minister, and I am sure it is known to the whole Executive Council, that at the moment public bodies are very hard pressed in consequence of the fact that certain materials which they require have been increased in price, and that they will be put to the pin of their collar this year to prevent themselves from having to increase the rates to a very large extent.  If the Minister insists on this Bill coming into force so far as the retrospective provisions are concerned, it will mean an increase of rates for a good many local authorities in this country.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, the Minister for Local Government has circularised local authorities asking for economies.  If this thing is persisted in it will not be easy for the local councils concerned to practise economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the Government themselves are responsible for the state of affairs which now exists in connection with this matter.  So far as I have been able to ascertain, some local <Col N="2030" /> authorities paid from the very beginning only on the effective valuation inside of their jurisdiction.  There was a doubt from the beginning as to what should be paid by the local authorities to the Exchequer in connection with unemployment assistance.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, I remember distinctly asking the then Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) whether it was on the effective or the gross valuation that these moneys should be paid and he said that, in his opinion, it was on the gross valuation.  That was only his opinion. I submit that, when it became apparent to the Minister and his Department in the last five or six years that certain local authorities were only paying on the effective valuation, action should have been taken at that time.  I cannot find any data to show that any action was taken against any particular local authority and those who were paying on the gross valuation, when they became aware that others were only paying on the effective valuation, were entitled to assume that it was only on the effective valuation that these moneys were to be paid.  If the Minister had taken action at that particular time to correct something which he considered to be wrong, there might not be any necessity for this retrospective legislation at all.  There must be some doubt, even in the Minister's mind, that he has not power to collect this money, for if the &ldquo;gross valuation&rdquo; was in his legislation as clear as he would have us believe it is, he would have had power to collect this money without having recourse to the introduction of a second Bill.  It certainly causes us that much doubt about it.  If the Minister had the strength of the law at his back he would not consider it necessary to bring in here another Bill in order to clarify the situation.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a reasonable amendment, that retrospective legislation is bad at any time, but that the position is worse when it involves payments by local authorities who at the moment are at their wits' ends to keep down the rates and carry out the instructions received from the Local Government Department.  This is the time to keep down the rates and <Col N="2031" /> it is not the time for the Minister to put into force retrospective clauses of this kind.  The Ministry themselves are as much to blame as, if not more to blame, than any of the local authorities.  The local authorities were doing their best in the interests of the ratepayers they represent in each of their areas.  The Minister made a statement here that certain local authorities had collected the moneys and that they did not hand these moneys to the Exchequer.  I do not think that is correct.</P>

      <P>I do not know about the Dublin Corporation, but I stated here a week ago that to my mind the proper thing for the Minister to have done would be to say to the Dublin Corporation and other authorities that they should increase the rate by 1d. or 2d. in the £ to enable them to collect the moneys required by the Minister. Take a local authority like the Wexford Corporation.  In order to get a 9d. rate it would be necessary for that corporation to levy an 11d. rate.  I would say that is the wrong kind of way to apply the law.  In consequence of Government legislation the local authority is not permitted to collect on the gross valuation.  There are certain remissions in the rates brought about by new houses and things of that kind. Though the councils are not permitted to collect on the gross valuation, yet they must make up the gross valuation. That is an unfair imposition, and it is certainly going to be hard on the local authorities who are doing their best to keep the rates on a level which they consider the people are able to pay. That is my submission.</P>

      <P>The issue which is now raised by these amendments was thrashed out by the House in 1933.  The House then decided the matter in a way that left no room for ambiguity or dispute.  The view of the Oireachtas was left beyond any question <Col N="2032" /> or doubt.  Deputy Dockrell has said that the main purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the poundage which is fixed in order to provide the corporation's contribution to the Employment Assistance Act will be levied on effective valuation.  Deputy Corish has admitted that he remembers asking the Minister in 1933 whether this poundage was going to be levied on the effective or gross valuation.  The Deputy did more.  The Deputy then took up an attitude on this matter with which his attitude here to-day is perfectly consistent.  When the original Bill was going through the House he put down an amendment to insert before the word &ldquo;rateable&rdquo; the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo;.  That amendment was withdrawn by the Deputy on the Committee Stage of the Bill in order to allow the Minister and the House to consider the case fully.  That amendment was introduced on the Report Stage of the Bill and it was then defeated by a vote of the House.  The matter was again raised in the Seanad. It was raised on three occasions during the progress of the Bill through the Seanad, and it was finally defeated by the Seanad.  That amendment, as I say, was defeated on the Final Stages of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we to deduce from that, except this: That the Oireachtas in settling the financial structure of the Employment Assistance Acts had decided that so far as words could be written into the Statute to express the clear intention of the Oireachtas, then the plain and unmistakable interpretation to be put upon these words was that the poundage to be struck for the purpose of these Acts was to be levied upon and applicable to the gross valuation of the communities concerned. That was the intention of the Oireachtas, and all we are asking the House to do to-day is, not to make legislation retrospective in effect, but to confirm beyond the possibility of doubt the decision which the House took upon this matter in 1933.  This is not a debating society, and the House cannot construct its business as if it were&mdash;doing one thing to-day and reversing it tomorrow&mdash;and it does not matter, as an argument in this issue, what hardships are to be imposed upon <Col N="2033" /> a corporate body by reason of the foolish action it took.  This House is not entitled to stultify itself by going back on the decision of 1933.  It is quite clear that the House itself decided that this poundage was to be levied on the gross valuation as defined in the Valuation Acts, and that upon the net issue being raised as to whether it was to be levied on the effective valuation or not, it was decided that the contribution to be made by the municipalities to the Exchequer was not to be diminished by reason of the fact that the effective valuation might be less than the gross valuation. That is the basis upon which I am going to ask the House to stand to-day &mdash;that we are maintaining the attitude we took up in 1933 and that if people have failed to honour their obligations under the Principal Act&mdash;that if they have chosen to put another interpretation upon the Statute than that which the House clearly intended by the decisions which it took upon the amendment by Deputy Corish, and later on upon Senator Staines' amendment in the Seanad, that we are not going to condone the attitude of the local authorities who have failed to meet their obligations to the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The records of this House are there for any member of the corporation who happened to be a member of this House; they are there to be consulted.  I think that, so far as there may be on some members a joint obligation in this matter to the local authority or to the Legislature of this country, the obligation of those members to the Legislature and the public Exchequer comes first.  When this matter was first mooted they should have pointed out that those who chose to levy the citizens upon the basis of the Act passed by the Oireachtas in 1933 would be found to be acting validly in law. At the same time, if having levied the citizens upon that basis, they refused to pay their contributions upon the same plane and on the same basis, if they withheld from the State and the public Exchequer the moneys that were collected on the supposition that the <Col N="2034" /> action which we took in 1933 would be found to stand good in law.  They were condoning injustice.  That is the position.  I say that those who had a dual obligation in this matter ought to have put their obligation to the country first.  We cannot operate in this matter as if it were a sort of private difference between one individual and another.  There are standards which ought to prevail in this country and the municipal council of the capital city ought to set a high standard.  It ought to have been consistent in this matter.  If it thought the interpretation which it now seeks to put upon Section 26 of the original Act of 1933 was the correct one, then it ought not to have gone and mulcted the citizens in an additional 2d. or 3d. in the rates, which it did.</P>

      <P>The corporation of the city struck a rate in 1938-9, of 1/10 in the £ for the purpose of contributing a sum to the Unemployment Assistance Fund which was assessed at the rate of ? in the £ upon the gross valuation. They did not hand over to us the proceeds of that levy.  On the contrary, instead of handing that money over, they withheld from the Exchequer no less a sum than £53,000, covering the amounts which, they alleged, had been wrongfully paid in 1934-5, 1935-6, 1936-7, 1937-8, and 1938-9, They ought to have been honest in this matter.  There are standards which Dublin Corporation and those who are members both of Dublin Corporation and of this House ought to be careful to preserve in this country&mdash;that every man should meet his obligations under the law.  Let them remember the Parable of the Unjust Steward.  If they are going to arrogate to themselves supposititious rights under an Act of the Oireachtas, they ought to concede to their citizens the same rights.</P>

That has to be done.  If it is not done and if it is not defended, then what is going to be the position?  Every man will have the right to proceed upon two conflicting bases.  When he is collecting a levy from the citizens, he will go on one interpretation and, when he comes to discharge his obligations, he will go on a diametrically opposite interpretation.  That cannot be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two ways of dealing with that doubt.  We can either go to law with the Dublin Corporation or we can settle it as we are settling it now.  Deputies should not forget that it is we, the Oireachtas, and not the Government, who make the law.  The only privilege that the Government has in a matter of this sort is the privilege of carefully considering it and coming to the Oireachtas and taking upon itself the responsibility of advising the Oireachtas as to what is the best thing to be done. We have come to the Oireachtas and we have said this: The Minister for Local Government and Public Health, according to Deputy Corish, has enjoined upon the local authorities the necessity for practising the most parsimonious economy in these rigorous times; we have two choices in the matter&mdash;either to settle this matter, as I said on the Second Stage of the Bill, by legislation, which will save a great deal of money, or to settle it by <Col N="2038" /> litigation, which is going to cost a great deal of money; and whether we were to succeed or to lose such litigation the result is going to be the same, because the financial basis of these Acts was definitely laid down by the Oireachtas, and it does not matter what decision may be given in regard to the law, the Oireachtas, in discharge of its general duties to the citizens, and in order to fulfil its obligation to see that equal justice is meted out, will have to come here and change and modify the law so that the <i>status quo ante</i> will be restored.</P>
      <P>That is going to be the final situation, no matter what litigation may be undertaken.  What we have got to consider now is whether we are going to allow ourselves to be involved in this useless litigation, wasting the money of the taxpayers in doing so&mdash; because, as you all know, litigation costs money, and this sort of suit might cost a great deal of money to one of the interested parties&mdash;whether, as I say, we are going to waste not only the money of the general taxpayers in this fruitless litigation, but whether also we are going to give the corporations of the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and the borough of Dun Laoghaire, the excuse and opportunity to waste the ratepayers' money in an equally futile way.</P>

      <P>Section 4 provides for payment by the local authorities to the Minister of what the marginal note describes as &ldquo;deficiencies in payments for past years&rdquo;.  Sub-section (3) gives him power to direct that the payment shall be made in one or more instalments.

      <P>I do not wish to make the same speech that I made on the former amendments, yet some of the Minister's remarks call for some reply. He mentioned the &ldquo;unjust steward&rdquo;; I think he should not really have referred to that gentleman, as he had trouble with an amending Bill.  It seems to me that that is the position the Minister is in.</P>
      <P>There is another matter with which the Minister made great play: he said that this House had decided certain things.  Apparently, they did not get into the Act.  I do not know whether my recollection is as strong as the Minister's about that period when it was going through, but I would like to refer again to Section 2&mdash;&ldquo;in order to remove doubts as to the true construction and meaning of Section 26.&rdquo;  That really makes the whole of our case. There is, undoubtedly, a flaw in the Act.  To repeat what I said before, when the townships and other corporations found that they need not pay this money, they did not strike a rate for it; and the fact that they had collected money one year and returned it to the ratepayers the next year does not improve the Minister's argument.</P>

It seems that the Minister is engaged in special pleading.  They would not have got out of this, no matter what they did.  I would suggest that for some years past the Minister thought that these sums were not so serious, that <Col N="2045" /> they really could be forgotten about; then, as the unemployment contributions increased, the Minister and the Government thought they were serious. That, I suppose, is a bad omen of what we may have to face.  I ask the Minister to exercise his clemency and to consider the position of the ratepayers who will have to fool the Bill.</P>

The corporation, having collected the rate, did not meet its obligations to the Exchequer; not only that, it withheld from the Government money collected in 1934-35, 1935-36, 1936-37, and 1937-38.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>To impress that fact! So the Government is taking up the position we heard of in our young days, when Coercion Acts were being passed in the House of Commons and the British Government was manufacturing crime.  The Government is now going to manufacture crime, and what was not a crime yesterday is going to be made a crime, if the Government does not like it.  If the Dublin Corporation misinterpreted the Act for a few years <Col N="2046" /> and paid over the money wrongly, and then discovered, after having levied in 1938-39 the rate at 1/10 in the £, that a mistake had been made, were they not only within their rights, but was not the City Manager in duty bound, in carrying out his office, to withhold that money?  The proof that they are right is this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister, having put an Act through this House, was not able to interpret that Act.  An independent lawyer came along and read a meaning into that Act which the Minister has accepted; he has accepted it by virtue of the fact that he has had to introduce a Bill to circumvent that legal opinion, or, in other words, to put on the Act the interpretation which he said should have been put on the Act six or seven years ago.  Because of the Government's bungling&mdash;I suppose they had not grown up; they had not got full powers of speech; they were not able to express in words what they meant&mdash; in this year of stress the ratepayers of Dublin will be called upon to pay not only the full amount for 1939-40, but they will have to pay for the discrepancies over the last six or seven years.  I wonder how the ratepayers of Dublin will be able to face that when this year of stress is manifesting itself in another way, and the ratepayers of Dublin are confronted with a strike to-morrow or with paying £60,000 to meet another demand.  I wonder how the ratepayers will be able to do that, when their home assistance contribution is more than it ever was. When the original Bill was being put through here the principal dope used in putting it over was that the extra amount which would be paid in unemployment assistance by the ratepayers of Dublin would be saved to them in home assistance.  The chairman of the Dublin Board of Assistance is here, and he has explained how that has gone up.  The whole thing is an indictment of the Government's policy and administration, and its inability even to say what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Minister says is a fact&mdash;and it is a question of fact&mdash;then there is no case whatever for this amendment.  But it is contended <Col N="2047" /> that it is not a fact, that the corporation is not getting this money, and in a situation such as we are facing at the moment there is a more than usual claim for consideration on the part of the corporation.  I would not go so far as to recommend spreading this in equal instalments over a period of ten years.  It is too long a period.  But I strongly urge that it should be spread over a period of three years.  Three years of very exceptional difficulties, perhaps, are facing us at the moment, and there is a considerable sum of money involved here. £67,000 is a very considerable sum; it is over 9d. in the £.  The Minister should consult his colleague in the Ministry who has had some experience of corporation business.  It is the bounden duty of the legal advisers to the corporation to ensure that every demand which is put before the corporation is in accordance with law.  In this particular case my information is that the corporation, having had that report from the law agent, went further and got other legal opinion on it.  The legal opinion was to the effect that the corporation was right in doing what it has done.  We have allowed a couple of years to elapse in the meantime, and now we suddenly come down upon them for a sum of £67,000.  It is not reasonable. Surely, at a time when the demand for home assistance is up, and the demand in respect of mental hospitals is up, to ask them for this sum is unreasonable.  I think there is a manifest case for spreading it over three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that the Cork Corporation postponed the striking of a rate until next Tuesday evening with a view to getting the Minister to spread this amount over three years.  I would not support any suggestion that it be extended over eight years or even over five years, but the Cork Corporation decided that the striking of the rate should be postponed with a view to getting the Minister to agree to spreading the amount over a period of three years.  I think there is no reason for all the things the Minister has said about something shady on the part of <Col N="2048" /> the different corporations.  When we are faced with 26/- in the £, it is no time to be asked for a payment of £6,000.  All the corporation ask is that this payment should be spread over a period of three years, and I do not see any difficulty in the Minister accepting that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has put this matter on a very reasonable basis.  He has put it on a rather different basis to that on which it has been put hitherto during the course of this debate. I should certainly like to defer to his views, but after all it does not rest with me.  It rests finally with the Minister for Finance.  By reason of the fact that the ordinary contributions, or the contributions which the Exchequer anticipated, were not paid to the Unemployment Assistance Fund in the ordinary course, the Exchequer has had to make good the amount at the expense of the general taxpayer.  When the Budget for the year was before the House, I pointed out that we took a very strong view in regard to this matter, and that in due course a Bill would be brought in to recover for the Exchequer the moneys which we believed were wrongfully withheld.  A question was put to me as to whether they were, in fact, wrongfully withheld.  Deputy Cosgrave has said that it is a question of fact. I will put the facts as I know them before the Deputy.  Under the Act of 1933, the contributions in question were to be the equivalent of the proceeds of poundage levied upon the rateable value, as set out in the relevant section.  I have already pointed out in the discussion on Section 2 of this Bill that when the Principal Act was before the House, an amendment was put down which would have limited the incidence of that levy to the effective valuation of the municipalities concerned.  That amendment was defeated here in the Dáil, and an amendment in even more precise terms, but with a similar effect, was defeated in the Seanad.  In consequence of that, I think it must be generally accepted that the Oireachtas intended that the provisions of the Principal Act should be interpreted as <Col N="2049" /> they have been interpreted by the Government from the start, and as they were interpreted up to some time in the year 1938-39 by the principal municipalities concerned, including the Corporation of the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>What are the facts in regard to Dublin? As I have pointed out, the original Act prescribed that a poundage at the rate of ? in the £ upon the gross valuation should be levied, and that the proceeds of that rate should be paid into the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  That was the position until the year 1938.  In the year 1938 the contribution to be paid by the Dublin Corporation was increased from ? in the £ upon the gross valuation to ? in the £ upon the gross valuation.  That, at any rate, was what we thought the Acts of the Oireachtas prescribed, and my attitude in regard to the whole of this matter is that we have no reason to think we were wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the earlier years, at any rate, the Dublin Corporation's view coincided with ours.  Though the Act prescribed ? in the £ on the effective valuation, nevertheless, the corporation were aware of the fact, and it was mentioned here in the course of the debates upon the Principal Act, that in order to make good that contribution, the poundage to be levied upon the effective valuation would be higher than ?.  In the year 1934-35 the demand note issued by the corporation specified ? for unemployment assistance.  That was the position in 1935-36.  In 1936-37 the rate actually levied was reduced from 1/8 to 1/7½.  In 1937-38 it was, similarly, 1/7¾, and in the year 1938-39, when the corporation's contribution was increased by reason of the fact that the rate at which unemployment assistance became payable had been increased by the Amending Act of 1938-39, the corporation levied its rate at 1/10 in the £ on the effective valuation. Not merely did the corporation levy that rate, but it collected the sum from the citizens.  In the years 1934-35, 1935-36, 1936-37 and 1937-38, it not merely collected these moneys at the rates which I have mentioned, but it paid them over to the Exchequer.  What happened in 1938-39?  It imposed a rate of 1/10, <Col N="2050" /> and in so far as that rate could be made effective, it collected that rate of 1/10 from those who could pay or were bound to pay, but when it came to meeting its obligations to the Exchequer it failed to pay over that 1/10.  Not merely did it withhold from the Exchequer the difference between what it collected and what it might have paid if its obligations were limited to ? in the £ on the effective valuation, but it withheld from the Exchequer the amounts which it alleged it had paid in excess over the preceding four years.</P>
    <P>The argument has been used here in the course of this debate, that the corporation was bound to act upon the advice which it received from its legal adviser, but when I was speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill I put this question to those who were speaking for the Dublin Corporation and I asked them whether their legal adviser had advised them that whatever might be the position in regard to the year 1938-39, that whether they were entitled or not to interpret the Act as limiting the contribution to a levy of ? in the £ upon the effective valuation, that whatever might be the position in regard to that net issue, whether their adviser had gone further and had advised them that they were entitled to withhold from the Exchequer the sums which they held had been paid in excess in respect of the preceding four years?  That is a very important issue because the Exchequer, so far as the Corporation of Dublin was concerned, had to go short of £53,000 in the year 1938-39. If it is true that in respect of the contributions to be paid in the year 1938-39 there was some element of doubt as to whether £14,000 more or less should be paid over, nevertheless I am given to understand that the corporation was not entitled to go back on the preceding four years, and that if they withheld moneys in respect of each of those years, or if they withheld a sum of perhaps £39,000 in respect of the contributions of the preceding four years, they were not entitled to do so and acted without being advised that they were legally entitled to do so.  In that event-though the Leader of the Opposition has put this matter <Col N="2051" /> upon quite a different plane from what has been argued here before-I do not think in regard to this £39,000 the Exchequer has any choice except to insist that the corporation will meet its obligations.</P>
    <P>That is a very important matter because, as I have said already, I think the corporation in these matters ought to set a very high standard.  If the corporation is not going to meet its obligations, and if it acts in a matter of this sort without being fortified by legal advice, it has no grounds whatever to stand on.  I concede, if you like, that in respect of the year 1938-39, having been advised in a certain way, it had to consider for itself the advice which it received and, perhaps, to act accordingly, but at the same time we have also to consider this: having collected money, and any doubt that there might be in the matter now being cleared up by the Oireachtas, whether it ought not to fulfil the purpose for which the money was collected, and to pay it over to the Exchequer in order to meet the corporation's liabilities under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  That is another matter.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to all I have said, we have got to bear in mind that it is more a matter for the Minister for Finance than for me.  I am not anxious to press the corporation unduly, but I must say that if a concession were given to the corporation in regard to this matter it cannot be given, in my view, at the expense of the general body of the taxpayers.  If the corporation wishes to have accommodation in a matter of this sort I think it would have to be by way of an interest-bearing advance by the Exchequer to the corporation, to enable it to meet its difficulties.  The corporation would have to indemnify the general body of the taxpayers and the Exchequer, and the Government which acts on their behalf and is agent for them, for any loss that the Exchequer might sustain.  Upon that basis, perhaps, the Minister for Finance might see his way to accommodate the corporation in regard to this matter, but if it does so I would like to make it clear that it would be only an <i>ex <Col N="2052" /> gratia</i> concession, that so far as the justice of the case is concerned I do not think the corporation has a strong claim.  I leave it at that.  Under the section of the Act as it is drafted the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, acting perhaps as the agent for the Minister for Finance in this matter, may be able to meet the corporation but, so far as I am concerned at any rate, it is not going to be an easy bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has met us fairly in regard to this matter.  I would like to put this to him.  There is a difference between municipal finance and national finance. In municipal finance the ratepayer is supposed to have a life of but a single year, and pays all his obligations for that year in the 12 months starting on 1st April, and winding up on 31st March.  If and when, or if at all, there is a surplus over and above any moneys collected, that surplus has to be devoted towards a remission in the following year, so that if the corporation or if the municipalities collected money in excess of what they paid out in the year 1938-39, they had not any authority and they were not able to keep that money in any suspense account or in reserve.  It simply had to be merged and come in in relief of the rate for the year 1939-40.  Therefore, their position is different from that of the Ministry with regard to that.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make is a small one.  It is true that if this concession were granted the Corporation or the municipalities would get an advantage but it is unlikely that the unemployment assistance funds will spend the last £20,000 in each of these two or three years that are to come.  There is nearly always a little balance in these funds and it would not even be a very great expense upon the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Corporation considering what our intentions were, they are not entitled to do that.  They must take the Act as it is drawn and whatever <Col N="2053" /> imperfections there are in it every person, no matter who, a corporation or an individual, if he has a legal right must have a legal remedy.  The corporation were informed that they had this legal right and they took it.  It now appears that it is a very expensive right.  The Minister should bear in mind that during the last 25 or 30 years on various occasions the rates that had been struck by particular local authorities came under review in the courts and on one occasion a very celebrated jurist laid it down that in view of the complicated state of the law in connection with the striking of rates he found it likely, from what he had seen of the cases that had been brought before him, that almost any rate could be broken.</P>
    <P>Naturally people do not go in for breaking rates.  Occasionally it has been done but a more expensive experiment could scarcely be tried with regard to a local authority, because breaking a rate does not mean that another rate is not going to be struck and the second rate that is struck will have to bear all the expenses attached to breaking the first rate.  I make these observations because it is the duty of the law agent of a local authority to advise his council as to what its obligations are.  If he did not, it might happen that any ratepayer might come in and smash the rate, which would be a very expensive proceeding. That is a thing that happened in the City of Dublin sometime before I entered public life.  A ratepayer successfully exercised his right to call the rate in question.  The corporation had not that easy approach to Parliament that the Minister now has and it cost them a very considerable sum of money.  It is therefore not fair to blame these local authorities for looking after their rights or privileges. Their business is to pay out only the smallest amount they are obliged to pay and if they are legally entitled to get out of any payment, they would be very foolish if they did not take advantage of that.  We shall withdraw the amendment on the Minister's undertaking to look into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on Second Reading that to my mind this Bill was unjust and inequitable, and I still think so.  As a matter of fact, I am more convinced, after listening to the Minister arguing for the Bill, of its injustice.  I am amazed at some of the arguments which the Minister used. His reply to some of the arguments advanced from this side was lamentable in many respects.  The Minister talked of the high standards of decency that should be observed by corporations such as those of Dublin and Cork and other similar bodies.  What does the Minister mean by that?  Does the Minister allege that these local authorities deliberately and of malice aforethought refused to comply with <Col N="2055" /> the Act knowing that they were acting wrongfully?  The Minister knows perfectly well that was not so.  He knows very well that the members of the Dublin Corporation and their advisers were as well aware, as this House was, of the machinery at the Minister's disposal to compel them to do what he wanted them to do.  We had evidence of that before.  After all, when the Dublin Corporation and other corporations felt in the year 1938-39 that a wrong construction had been put on the Act which compelled the assessment, they were obliged, in my opinion, as far as conscience and right were concerned, to withhold the amount overpaid in previous years.  The Minister endeavoured to make great play out of that by saying that if in the year 1938-39 a doubt had existed in the minds of the local authorities as to the legality of this payment, there might be some justification for withholding that year's contribution.  What right, the Minister asked, was there for withholding the amounts which they paid in the previous years and which to their minds were overpayments?  I say that if any man in 1938-39 felt he would be wronging those whom he represented in imposing a rate upon them which the law did not demand, he was equally right in deducting from the rate overpayments made for the previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister will throw his mind back he will remember that he and the Government withheld from county councils grants in respect of unpaid annuities which they were not entitled to withhold, until they brought in an Act removing certain doubts-not alone to remove certain doubts but to make the position legal.  I am sure that the Minister was at that time quite clear in his mind that he was obliged in justice to do what he was doing.  He should at least pay the same compliment to the local authorities who in 1938-39, on advice tendered to them, felt that they were not obliged to pay this unjust burden.  They felt equally obliged to deduct certain moneys which they felt they had overpaid to the Government.  If one was reasonable, it follows, as night the day, that the other was reasonable.  The Minister referred to the unjust steward.  As a <Col N="2056" /> matter of fact, my feeling about the matter is that the injustice is entirely on the Government side.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer a question like this.  We have at the present time considerable reductions in railway valuations due to a certain court decision.  Let the Minister imagine one of these corporations faced with a big reduction of that nature, say in the middle of the year.  Would the Minister compel that authority to make a contribution on the gross rating, including the railway rating, which was reduced possibly by £10,000, £12,000 or £15,000?  What would the Minister think of that?  I think it would be manifestly unfair.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on the Second Reading, the principle involved in this Bill is unjust and inequitable.  No man could stand over the injustice of compelling another to pay on an asset that did not exist.  If a valuation is not effective for the purposes of a local authority, that local authority should not be compelled to make it effective for anybody else.  I am against the Bill as it stands.  I think the Minister ought to withdraw whatever imputations he made against local authorities about withholding payment for some ulterior motive when, in reality, that was done from the highest motives, and on behalf of those they represent.  The Minister made a good deal of play about the fact that the House had put a certain interpretation upon the wording of the original Bill.  When the Minister was speaking, one would imagine that that meant that the House did so on a free vote, and that there was no Party Whip.  He might have said: &ldquo;I brought my Party in here, and I saw that this thing was done.  That was our decision.&rdquo;  But other Deputies voted against the Bill.  They voted against it in order to have the position clarified. There was a combined House against the Minister on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The clarification wanted was to ensure that the poundage should be levied on the effective valuation.  The Minister would not agree to insert the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo; then, and would not have the position clarified.  He wanted his own interpretation of the gross <Col N="2057" /> valuation, and that is what has caused the present position.  I think the Minister's insinuations were unworthy. Apart from that, it was hard to understand exactly what the Minister meant, except that he was endeavouring to hide the real issue.  The position reminded me of the man with the three thimbles, where one had to find out under which thimble the pea was.  We had a long dissertation from the Minister about the amount of unemployment assistance being paid in the cities. That has nothing to do with this matter. We also had a long dissertation on the reasons why the payments were withheld, and the injustice that was thereby being done to the Government. There was really only one question at issue, whether local authorities should pay on a basis that was not the effective basis.  As I think that basis is unjust and inequitable, I am opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could understand the Minister, on finding that he wanted money, looking for it, and I could understand, when he discovered a flaw in the Act, remedying that flaw, presuming, of course, that he wanted the larger amount; but I cannot understand him coming in and abusing local authorities for not raising a sum that he considered they should raise, having regard to the fact that these authorities were fortified with legal opinion, that the Minister and his advisers could not controvert.  I wonder what sort of administration we would have if any authority struck a rate contrary to law, as interpeted by specialists, in the shape of senior counsel?  What right would a rate-making authority have to strike a rate after being advised that it was contrary to the law?  What right would that administration have to spend the money?  The Minister accused the Dublin Corporation of having levied one year a rate which he said was the proper rate, but not paying it all over to the appropriate Minister.  The rate-making authority in the Dublin Corporation consists of a body of men elected by adult suffrage.  Every man and woman, 21 years of age and upwards, is entitled to be on the register, and it was by those that the 35 members of the <Col N="2058" /> Dublin Corporation were elected. While that is the rate-making authority it is not the spending authority.  That body really provides the money for the city manager.  He alone has the power to spend the entire amount or any portion of that money.</P>
      <P>Would the City Manager, who is an official, have the hardihood to challenge the Government, his ultimate bosses, by saying &ldquo;I will not pay you this money; I will not do so because I am fortified in my opinion by law&rdquo;? In his opinion the advice that he got not to pay it was first-class advice. I am not in agreement with the managerial system, but I am in agreement with it when it comes to handling a big concern like the City of Dublin, because the 35 members forming the city council have not the time at their disposal adequately to administer the affairs of a city like Dublin, where the administration runs to about £2,000,000.  I must pay this tribute to the strength of character of the City Manager, that when the law was interpreted for him he stood by it, even though the Government was opposed to his view.  It is not fair to be casting about such epithets as &ldquo;perverse action&rdquo;, or the statements with which the Minister stigmatised the Dublin Corporation, for not handing over this money.  The individual concerned is an official and has not an opportunity of defending himself here.  If the Minister and the City Manager were on an equal footing in a hall, and if there was a discussion about the matter, I know whom I would back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The iniquity and the want of consideration about this whole matter, especially on the part of a Government that has been preaching economy and warning the people about the hard times ahead, make strange reading.  The added burden of Dublin's share represents £67,000 in the coming year's Budget, and in all about £350,000 more than last year will have to be found.  That will be the position in a city where unemployment is increasing, notwithstanding the fact that we are told we have had an efficient people's Government in power for the last eight years.  I <Col N="2059" /> wonder if we could find a much worse Government, judging by that record? The home assistance demand has gone up by £105,000 over last year's estimate.</P>
    <P>This further burden is being put on the ratepayers of Dublin, on ratepayers who are not doing anything like the business they were doing last year, and on ratepayers who are groaning under the burden of last year's Supplementary Budget to such an extent that there is not the least doubt that the returns from that Supplementary Budget will be very disappointing and will mean a very rude awakening for the Minister for Finance when he strikes his balance. The yield from these taxes&mdash;the extra taxes imposed on commodities, together with those already operating&mdash; will be less&mdash;and I say this without fear of contradiction&mdash;than the yield from the smaller tax last year.  That shows the decline in business, and, with a declining business, in a city where nothing is increasing but unemployment, the Minister comes along, not only with increased current expenditure, but with demands for arrears which are due not to the rate-making or rate-spending authorities of the City of Dublin, but to the incompetence of the Minister who did not express, in plain language, what he meant.  The people asked for this and they are getting it with a vengeance this year.  The day of reckoning will come and I suppose the Government <Col N="2060" /> will postpone it as long as they can, but the longer it is postponed, the more fierce it will be when it comes.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything because the matter has been fully thrashed out on the other stages of the Bill.  There is only one thing I would say.  Deputy Belton has said that the corporation were advised that it was improper for them to pay over to the Exchequer the full proceeds of the rate of 1/10 in the £ which they struck and which, on their demand notes, they said had been struck for the purpose of making this contribution.  If it was illegal for the corporation to pay the money over, it was equally illegal for the corporation to strike the rate of 1/10 at all.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Tourist Board (No. 24 of 1939).</P>
      <P>Perhaps in introducing this Estimate it would be advisable that I should detail to the House how the position stands at the moment in regard to the operation of the Tourist Traffic Act and the activities and functions of the Irish Tourist Board.  The House will recall that the Tourist Traffic Act was enacted at the end of July, 1939.  That Act provides for the payment of grants and advances out of public funds to the Irish Tourist Board which is constituted by the Act.  Section 15 of the Act provides for the payment out of voted moneys of sums not exceeding £45,000 in any one financial year to the board in the form of non-repayable grants.  Section 16 provides for the making of advances to the board out of the Central Fund to an amount not exceeding in the aggregate £600,000, which sum is to be expended by the board solely on works, investments, or loans of a profit-earning character.  It was estimated that of the free grant at the rate of £45,000 per annum to which I have referred, £20,000 would be required for administrative expenses and £25,000 for advertising and publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Board having been duly constituted, it was necessary during the Summer Recess to provide funds to pay the remuneration of <Col N="2063" /> the members of the board and the preliminary administrative expenses. Accordingly, an advance of £2,000 was made to the board from the Contingency Fund, the intention being to introduce an Additional Estimate for the new service when the Dáil would have reassembled last October.  The war intervened, however, and naturally the question arose as to whether or not the Tourist Traffic Act should be suspended for so long as the Emergency Powers Act remained in force.  After mature consideration it was decided that while in present circumstances it was, for financial reasons, perhaps undesirable and, for other reasons, perhaps impracticable for the board to proceed with its original programme, involving the Exchequer, as I have said, in an annual Grant-in-Aid of about £45,000 and imposing on the Exchequer the obligation of making repayable advances up to a maximum of £600,000; nevertheless, it was felt it would be a grave mistake to suspend the operation of the Act altogether and to put it in cold-storage for the duration of the war.  I think in the present circumstances it would be folly to undertake that widespread publicity campaign and other activities which were contemplated when the Act was passed.  But it would be equally foolish now when the competitive attractions of other countries have greatly diminished, while at the same time, the regular volume of traffic from external resources has been automatically reduced not to utilise this period to survey thoroughly the situation as a whole; to prepare plans for the future of the industry and to try out those plans on an experimental scale, so that when the time becomes more propitious the board may be able to go ahead with its estimates for the fulfilling of the work allotted to it under the Act.</P>
    <P>That is the decision at which we have arrived, The original estimate of £45,000 will not be required.  Only a sum of £9,000 will be wanted now. In order to enable certain experimental projects to be undertaken, it may be necessary later on to provide sums aggregating from £60,000 to £70,000. <Col N="2064" /> How much will be required for the repayable advances will naturally depend upon the duration of the war and upon the success or otherwise of the experimental projects.  If these justify themselves it may be assumed that they will be enlarged and the expenditure upon them naturally will increase.  During the period of the survey, planning and experimentation to which I have referred, it is the intention of the members of the board to give the closest personal attention to the work and to share a large part of the administrative burdens between them. Consequently the staff required will be the minimum possible; and such as will be recruited will be required to have certain technical experience.  The chairman of the board will act as secretary, and chief executive officer, and in this way no salary will be payable for these offices.  In this way it is hoped to get a great deal of valuable public work done at a minimum of expense.</P>
    <P>The question may naturally arise, why under present circumstances are we spending £9,000 per annum upon work of this kind?  There are some considerations in that regard which it may be well to put before the public eye.  First of all, we have to remember that expenditure on public holidays in this country runs into millions of pounds per annum.  This money finds its way to all parts of the country and to all classes of our people.  Hotels and boarding-houses on which depends the livelihood of more than 20,000 souls along the seaboards are almost entirely dependent upon this traffic for their existence.  In many Gaeltacht areas the tourist traffic provides the income for hundreds if not for thousands of non-economic landholders.  The receipts from this industry are of vital importance, too, to public transport and other contributory services.  The industry itself is a decentralised industry, requiring no imported raw materials or factories or the congregating of the population into abnormally large communities.  The industry contributes substantially to general and local taxation; directly through fishing and shooting licences, visa fees, driving <Col N="2065" /> licences, and so on, and indirectly through increases in fees and incomes from fishery rights, and so on.  The guaranteeing of its maintenance by the State during the present war emergency is almost as essential in counties like Kerry, Donegal and Galway as is the guaranteeing of minimum prices for beet and wheat in many of the inland counties.</P>
    <P>The holiday habit, I may say, is now regarded not so much a luxury as a necessity.  The fostering of its further growth is a matter of great social importance to the State and to the community as a whole.  There are still thousands of Dublin workers who, instead of spending their savings at the week-ends with nothing more to show at the end of the summer than a number of Sunday trips to neighbouring seaside resorts, ought to be educated for the sake of their own and their children's health to save up for holidays which would give them a chance of having enjoyable holidays amidst extremely healthy surroundings.  The war has limited us to a virtual monopoly of our own home traffic as against the loss of the American and the greater portion of the British tourist traffic.  Because of these facts we can assume that practically all our own people will spend their holidays in Ireland during the present year.  If they get satisfactory treatment, that alone will induce many of them to continue to take Irish holidays. The passage of the Tourist Traffic Act in itself was an admission of the Government's interest and responsibility in this matter.  The suspension of the Act and the dissolution of the Board would now virtually black-out the holiday industry, and the Irish Tourist Association could not hope to continue the work that it has been doing up to the present.</P>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Association obtains its money mainly from public bodies. It is doubtful whether these would continue to vote funds to continue its activities if the Government itself, by its suspension of the Tourist Traffic Act, indicated that the continuance of such activities was a matter of no concern to the State or to the community for whom the Government <Col N="2066" /> would be presumed to act.  There is little doubt in my mind that if the existing machinery for the maintenance and development of the holiday industry were to be put out of action we would at the end of the war be back to the unorganised and comparatively impoverished position in which that industry found itself in 1925.  I think there is no justification for taking a course which would be tantamount to suggesting that our holiday industry is at the moment of no value or that at the moment it is not of great potential value to the country.  But the fact is that out of our total normal traffic over 70 per cent. of the volume and over 60 per cent. of the revenue may be said to come from our own people.  The increase in that traffic arising from the fact that our people cannot go abroad will, if carefully conserved, ensure the survival and comparative prosperity of all engaged in the industry even during the war.  The central organisation which here, as in all other countries, it has been found desirable to establish for the control and development of this industry is necessary, in my view, for the maintenance of the industry during the war and I am sure there will be few to question this in relation to the effective revival of our traffic from other countries on the return of international peace.</P>
    <P>Of the activities in which the board proposes to engage during the period which must intervene between now and the days of peace, I shall endeavour to give a broad outline to the House. When the House hears it, I think it will agree with me that there a great deal of valuable work can be done even in the somewhat circumscribed circumstances in which the board finds itself. There is, in the first place, the question of our existing holiday resorts.  As the main bulk of our holiday traffic is handled by these resorts, whether seaside or inland, they may be taken to rank as first in importance in the mind of the board.  Most of those resorts are lacking in one or more of the services or general amenities recognised as essential for the holiday-maker of to-day. Every one of them requires planned reorganisation over a period of years, and <Col N="2067" /> their enlargement and improvement would normally absorb the greater portion of the £600,000 provided in the Act under the head of &ldquo;Repayable Advances.&rdquo;  Though it is not proposed, during the war-period, to go ahead with any schemes involving big expenditure, it is necessary in the first instance, to prepare a plan for the reorganisation and development of every resort of importance, keeping in mind the requirements of health and sanitation, enlarged traffic in future years, the safety and convenience of existing roads, the provision of adequate facilities for recreation and amusement for all classes in all weathers, the application of the Town and Regional Planning Act in co-operation with the local authorities and the increase of existing accommodation to suit the requirements of those classes of traffic which each resort is considered to be most capable of attracting and satisfying.</P>
    <P>This will all take time.  Provided money can be made available for the administrative expenses of the board, the importance and urgency of this work is in no way lessened by the existence of an international war.  In every resort of that type I think I may say that the people concerned recognise the need for improvement.  It is hoped that they will readily co-operate in this preliminary work, knowing that, after the war, the Tourist Board will be enabled to give effect to its plans. It is possible, therefore, to proceed at once with the correction of many abuses and to proceed with many minor but important improvement works at comparatively little expense by way of loan or investment.  Many of the resorts to which I have referred are qualified for attention under the heading &ldquo;Unemployment Relief Schemes&rdquo;.  The Tourist Board is satisfied, from a preliminary survey, that in such cases it should be in a position to suggest works which will be, on the one hand, attractive from the point of view of such relief schemes and which, on the other hand, can be readily assimilated as part of its ultimate development plans.  The Board in this connection has mentioned the excavation of sites for swimming <Col N="2068" /> pools, the clearing of ground and ruins as a first step towards the provision of handball alleys or other recreational facilities, the making or improving of paths, minor works of drainage and so on.  Naturally, the future development of each resort must be planned before works of this kind are undertaken, and, during the war, it is proposed to incur expenditure by way of loan or investment only in those cases in which the expenditure of small sums, complementary to the money to be provided under the relief schemes, would render possible the immediate provision of essential amenities.  We may envisage, perhaps, an expenditure of £10,000 during the experimental stage under this head.</P>
    <P>In connection with the programme for developing holiday resorts, it will be necessary for the board to set up at every resort a council, committee or company of a representative nature. At many of the resorts in question there is no urban authority to ensure local goodwill and co-operation.  Contact with such bodies is of vital importance to the work of the Tourist Board.  It cannot be deferred until after the war.  The development of these resorts may cost considerable sums spread over a long period, but, even under normal conditions, the board could not provide more than a fraction of the finance which would be required.  The purpose and effect of the Board's efforts in this matter would be to encourage further expenditure of much greater magnitude by local authorities and by private enterprise. It is necessary now, and it would be part of the board's immediate duty, to convince those who may be concerned that such expenditure will be worth undertaking.</P>
    <P>Next in line of the Tourist Board's activities will be the question of our hotels, their management and improvement.  We need increased hotel accommodation in practically all parts of the country. Such hotels as we have are lacking even in matters of major importance. Many others require a complete overhaul. It is proposed to avail of the war period to examine, in the first place, the hotel resources of the country in relation to the types of traffic which <Col N="2069" /> it is considered desirable and possible to attract; secondly, to estimate on a five or ten year basis the conditions necessary for dealing with such traffic and to relate these to our existing resources, and thirdly, to decide on the best methods of securing these necessary conditions at the least expense to the board and with the least cost or inconvenience to those at present engaged in the hotel business.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed, during the war period, to go ahead with any large-scale schemes by way of loan or investment. We must wait until the prospects of stimulating private enterprise are brighter than they are now before proceeding with such work.  In the meantime, however, the board hopes, as I have said, to undertake the preparatory work and to consider in advance the cases in which loans or investments may be necessary or desirable and the conditions which should be attached to their provision.  The shortcomings of our smaller hotels and guest-houses, catering for what might be called second-class traffic, represent probably our greatest source of complaint at the present time.  In normal times a large volume of traffic goes from this country to the Isle of Man and to the British West Coast, because of the higher standard of accommodation which resorts there offer at competitive prices.  A very large number of people who previously went abroad will take Irish holidays in 1940, and these people cannot be persuaded to continue &ldquo;seeing Ireland first&rdquo; unless we are able to bring about an improvement in the general standard of such establishments here.  To that end we feel that the board should be enabled, in the year 1940-41, to provide, by way of loan, for improvements in a number of such houses in various parts of the country&mdash;not as even a partial solution of the main problem, but as examples which will encourage the adoption of a higher standard by others, and which will demonstrate the type of accommodation which it is hoped eventually to standardise and publicise as guest-houses. This category, it will be remembered, was specially defined in the Tourist Traffic Act with that end in view.  It is anticipated that, perhaps, <Col N="2070" /> in the course of this preliminary campaign, the board may have to find, <i>via</i> the Exchequer, the sums necessary to finance repayable advances, totalling more than £25,000.</P>
    <P>The next large division of this holiday industry, to which the Tourist Board will require to devote its attention and to which it intends to give a great deal of consideration during this emergency period, is that of hostels and holiday camps. We have not been able to have any extensive investigation of that matter yet, and of the problems which it may present.  It is a new type of business in this country, and presents difficulties which require to be very carefully examined.  With a holiday camp in the Isle of Man, capable of accommodating 4,000, and with another recently built in North Wales, at a cost of £500,000, it is obvious that group accommodation has attractions which we cannot ignore. The two establishments referred to are examples of the accommodation which we may anticipate will exist on the west coast of Britain after the war, and of the types of accommodation which, accordingly, in that period, our own resorts will have to face in competition. If we are to retain in Ireland the money spent by our industrial workers during the holidays, we must be able to compete with such places, and if we do not take steps during the war period we shall be late in the race when the war is over, and shall have no ground for complaint if the workers of Dublin and our other cities choose more attractive and less expensive fare offered elsewhere than in this country.  It is the view of the board that it will be possible, within the coming financial year, to formulate a scheme for an experimental development under this head.  If the board's expectations in this regard be fulfilled, we may require, during the year I have mentioned, 1940-41, a repayable advance of about £20,000.  Naturally, in regard to this too, as with other activities of the board, the Minister for Finance, as well as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will have to be satisfied that the advance can be justifiably and profitably made.</P>
    <P>One of the principal functions of the Board, under the provisions of the Act, <Col N="2071" /> is to set up and to maintain a register of hotels and guest-houses.  It is hoped that it may be possible to give effect to the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Act in this respect during the year 1940-41, and the board may find it necessary to engage a limited but technically competent staff for that purpose.  On the other hand, it is not intended to operate the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Act for the scheduling of tourist resorts as special areas during the war period unless, of course, there is an overwhelming local demand in any resort for such action, but it will be necessary to study carefully the implications of the procedure and to work out, in relation to a few resorts, full and detailed schemes to ensure the practical and successful application of the provisions of the Act in this regard. This work, of course, will require the close and careful consideration of the board.  Apart from the requirements of an enlarged catering industry, there is immediate need for additional competent hotel staffs in all parts of the country.  The difficulties of hotelkeepers, and so on, will be rendered more acute in Gaeltacht areas if the board requires, as a condition of registration, that within a limited period hotels and guest-houses in the Gaeltacht shall employ none but Irish staffs. The Board has been assured of the co-operation of the Department of Education in connection with training schemes, but proper training in most departments will require a number of years.  This work can be undertaken during the war period, and it is the intention of the Board to give the matter its most urgent attention in the hope that the necessary personnel may be available at an early date.</P>
    <P>In relation to everything I have said, it may be desirable to stress that the Tourist Board is to give special consideration to Gaeltacht areas in connection with the development of the holiday industry.  Its policy in that regard is to do everything that it is possible to do in order to develop the industry in those districts&mdash;to do everything that can be done, that is to say, without detriment to the survival and revival of the Irish language.  If the <Col N="2072" /> Gaeltacht is the backbone of language survival, and if for that reason its people must be given every encouragement to remain there, the board feels that it can help substantially to this end by improving the economic position of the Gaeltacht population through honourable, gainful employment, and not through grants or doles.  There has been, in recent years, a welcome increase in the demand for holiday accommodation in Gaeltacht areas for both adults and children.  We cannot, however, remain blind to the fact that the conditions under which many such visitors are housed leave much to be desired.  At the best, they impose an unnecessary strain on patriotism, and they may be full of more acute physical dangers.</P>
    <P>The board's programme for developing the holiday industry in the Gaeltacht will proceed upon certain assumptions.  First, those in the Gaeltacht who are employed in registered hotels and guest houses must have a competent knowledge of Irish.  The best, easiest and quickest method of learning Irish is by staying with Irish-speaking families.  Suitable accommodation must be provided for people who appreciate that fact, and the number of visitors to the Gaeltacht for that purpose can and must be increased by the use of judicious publicity.  Accordingly, but naturally subject to such modification as a fuller examination of the problem on which the board is now engaged requires, it is proposed to proceed in this matter on the following lines: First, the concentration of a large number of visitors in any one area is to be avoided so as to ensure that the local Gaeltacht influence will predominate.  Accordingly, a few houses in each of a number of parishes are to be selected in consultation with local committees.  Each such house is to be provided with one or, if possible, two spare rooms, and in practically all cases these will have to be specially built.  The houses are to be equipped with suitable sanitary arrangements, and to be furnished with good beds and bedding and simple furniture, and, where practicable, a turf-burning stove and sundry other minor equipment.  The owners of the houses selected will have to arrange <Col N="2073" /> for all the construction work, but loans will be given to cover the cost of materials and equipment.  Such advances will be made on presentation of the certificate of completion of the work, and will be repayable over a reasonably long period.</P>
    <P>In the case of houses fitted and equipped as I have described, through the instrumentality of the board, it will be an essential condition that visitors can only be accepted through the Board or an approved agent thereof, to whom an initial payment by way of deposit shall be made.  Such deposits will be retained by the board towards repayment of the principal and interest on the loan, the balance of the visitor's bill being paid to the owners of the house at the end of the holiday.  In the case of visitors coming without notice, the secretary of the local committee will act as the booking agent for the board. The board, in co-operation with the Government Departments, and with the help of the county vocational committees and agricultural committees, will endeavour to see that the owners of houses operating under its aegis will be induced to cultivate a wider range of vegetables and fruits than is customary with them, and provision will also be made to enable female members of the households to receive the necessary training in cookery and domestic economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, the board will utilise its resources in Dublin and elsewhere to secure for the owners of houses in the Gaeltacht, who possess the necessary accommodation, clients who are either Irish-speaking or who are genuine, would-be learners of the language, and care will be taken to ensure that none but those are booked through the agency of the board.  It is hoped that the new standard which will be set by the improved houses envisaged by the board will attract visitors to them.  If these hopes are fulfilled, the success will have the double effect of encouraging neighbouring houses to come into line, and it will make language enthusiasts feel that they can book accommodation with Irish-speaking families for themselves <Col N="2074" /> and their children with every assurance of comfort and convenience.  The board has indicated to me that it may require repayable advances up to £20,000 to enable it to try out a number of experimental schemes upon the plan which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>In normal conditions the development of the sport of angling would be one of the major features of the Tourist Board's programme.  The intervention of the war naturally limits its opportunities in this regard, but certain considerations make it highly desirable that a programme of work adjusted to war conditions should be proceeded with. Angling, in fact, has distinct claims upon the attention of the board.  The angling resources of this country, relative to those of other countries in Europe are, I understand, unique in their extent and in their capacity for further development.  It is possible to increase enormously the number of people who patronise our rivers and lakes, particularly from amongst our own people, of whom the proportion interested in angling is amazingly small.  Anglers as a class are a desirable type of tourist.  Their requirements do not involve a big expenditure in the way of amusements and amenities at the various resorts.</P>
    <P>Angling visitors from Great Britain have been a source of big revenue in the Gaeltacht areas, and the reduction and possible total loss of such traffic during the war will inflict severe hardship on those who profited from it during previous years.  I understand that in a good year in Galway alone, apart from the main expenditure of the visitors in hotels and guest houses, up to 500 men, most of them uneconomic land owners, earned at least £30 per head each year by acting as boatmen for the anglers and bailiffs for the board of conservators.  These occupations left them naturally plenty of time to look after their own holdings and in many cases represented their main source of money income.  In peace time the development of our angling resources, which could by no means be described as over-ambitious, would enable us to increase substantially that already important income of £15,000 <Col N="2075" /> per annum to probably the most deserving section of the people of Galway, the majority of whom are native Irish speakers; and that applies likewise, I am sure, to other parts of the country.  During this war we must at least try to minimise the losses which these districts suffer and that can be done by developing an increased interest in angling amongst our own people and planning for a greater patronage of our lakes and rivers when peace returns.</P>
    <P>Bearing all this in mind, the Tourist Board proposes, in conjunction with, and through the publicity activities of, the Irish Tourist Association, to endeavour to promote increased interest in angling among our own people, most of whom wrongly regard the sport as a rich man's recreation, and in that connection to endeavour to direct new traffic to fishing districts in the Gaeltacht and secure any changes in and additions to the hotel and guest-house accommodation there that may be necessary.  The board is also negotiating an option to purchase by lease a large series of lakes in Connemara with the object of their being developed, either under the direct operation of the board, or through a company to be formed for that purpose. Naturally, no commitments in this regard will be made by the board without the prior agreement of the Minister for Finance and myself.  The board believes, and I share the belief, that success in the carrying out of a scheme of this nature would be of very great value from the purely commercial point of view on the one hand, and as an example of what can be done with similar stretches of water all over the country.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the steps which the board propose to take to improve accommodation in Gaeltacht houses for language enthusiasts.  This, to some extent, is linked up with the board's plan for improving angling attractions.  They hold that it is possible to make many a language enthusiast a keen angler, to house him comfortably within the reach of good water, and, proceeding on the reasonable assumption <Col N="2076" /> that the man of the house can fish as well as talk Irish, it is likely that the language enthusiast will become not only an Irish speaker but an angler and visitor to the Gaeltacht for the rest of his active life.  The possibilities of angling are illustrated from another aspect by an experience of so recent a date as last year.  Nobody in this country bothers about coarse fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, few people, I am speaking perhaps relatively, but few people bother about coarse fish except to exterminate them as a menace to the salmon and trout population. Last year, as an experiment, over 200 men from Lancashire and Yorkshire came to Irish midland centres for the pleasure of angling such fish.  I understand they went back feeling that they had the time of their lives here and the best of sport, hoping that they will be able to come back themselves, and that thousands of others will come this year.  These were ordinary British workmen who had saved up during the past year perhaps the £5 or £10 which gave them that holiday.  The board feel that our people can be persuaded to take up this sport in the same way, and that it will be one of its endeavours to persuade them to do so.  In doing that they will be developing our angling attractions not merely for our own people but also for those visitors who perhaps in happier times will come back to us again.</P>
      <P>Generally, that is an outline of the programme which the Tourist Board has set before me.  I think it is worth trying, and, as a consequence, I have come here to the Dáil to propose this Supplementary Estimate which it is hoped will meet the expenses of the board during what remains of the current year.  It is part, as I have said, of the amount, not exceeding £9,000, which will represent the normal grants-in-aid which we may make to the board for the purpose of carrying out the programme which I have outlined during the war period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the comprehensive statement <Col N="2077" /> he has made.  I think the House will appreciate the fullness with which he has gone into the programme wherewith he justifies the Additional Estimate he has brought before us.  I think he is quite mistaken if he imagines that the humble worm and grub are unknown to anglers of this country.  There are many of us who, in addition to our more stylish performances with the dry fly, are to be found on discreet occasions playing the worm and other humble baits as well.  I do not think there can be any doubt that, while there is room for the entertainment of visitors, very welcome visitors such as those to whom the Minister referred from England, our primary concern must be, of course, for the development and protection of the trout and salmon fishing, and that where the interests of these and their due preservation conflict with the continued existence of pike or perch in the rivers, then the coarse fish must give way before proper preservation methods designed to maintain and increase the trout and salmon population of our rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone over this ground very carefully.  He spoke of the new departure in the Gaeltacht. I understand the outlook that inspires the Minister in this matter, but I do put it to the House that we ought to take a deliberate decision in regard to this matter with our eyes fully open as to what we are about to do.  Do we want to instal a Blackpool in the Gaeltacht?  I put this to Deputy Hickey, that Blackpool 40 years ago was about as barren and abandoned a stretch of sand as there was in the world with that great industrial population that lay behind it.  It has to-day been built into one of the greatest amusement centres in the world.  I do not expect that we are going to be able to put up an amusement centre of that kind in the Gaeltacht, but do those of us who are familiar with West Donegal, Connemara, West Cork and Kerry, deliberately intend to turn these areas into centres for trippers? I use that word in no disrespectful or disparaging sense.  I mean the short-holiday maker from Great Britain, Dublin, Belfast and Cork. <Col N="2078" /> Now, we ought to make up our minds about that.  I do not think that we are wise if we do that.  There is no use pretending that, for that class of trade, we can ever compete in the Gaeltacht with the attractions of the Isle of Man, Blackpool, Southend or places of that kind, and I do not think that we ought to try.</P>
    <P>I think there is a trade for the amenities that the Gaeltacht has to offer to a very limited, a very restricted body of persons who, in the words of Emily Lawless, seek the &ldquo;Still Shore&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where wearied men may from their burdens cease&rdquo;.  The Minister, who is a poet, will remember Emily Lawless's poem, &ldquo;A Retort,&rdquo; in which she describes very beautifully all that the Gaeltacht has to offer to us, and, speaking for herself and all those with whom she thought, she rejects very definitely the modernity and amenities of the modern world and chooses, with all its poverty, the &ldquo;still shore&rdquo;.  I think that our object should be to emphasise that quality of the Gaeltacht.  I would prefer that the lot of the uneconomic holder in the Gaeltacht should be relieved by other methods than those designed to draw down into that part of Ireland a miscellaneous collection of trippers who would find much greater amusement and much more congenial surroundings in the Isle of Man and such centres of amusement as we know exist.  That does not mean at all that I am suggesting we should not seek to cater for that kind of visitor in other parts of the country; but I would be sorry if I thought the Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to sponsor plans designed to hand over the Gaeltacht to them.  I would quote for the Minister those beautiful words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I see an envied haunt of peace,</P>
    <P>Calm and untouched; remote from roar.</P>
    <P>Where wearied men may from their burdens cease</P>
    <P>On a still shore.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I invite him to inscribe those words upon a card and set them upon his desk, so that, when proposals are made to him for the development of tourist traffic in the Gaeltacht, he may read them again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2079" /> In saying this much, I do not wish to be taken as underestimating the importance of the tourist traffic.  I think it is very important and that it is well all of us should contribute all we know to the common pool of information.  I know nothing of this business from the angle of such distinguished authorities as Deputy Mongan or others who approach it from the point of view of hosts.  I know it only from my experience of travelling in the world, and I suggest to the Minister that the average tourist wants the following things. He wants good motor roads with plenty of signposts on them.  Why is it that nobody ever will put up enough signposts? The reason seems to be that the county surveyor, when you suggest that a signpost should be put up at the corner of the road, meets you with the reply: &ldquo;Sure, does not everybody know that Inchigeela is only half a mile down that road?&rdquo; But the trouble is that the lady who comes from Pennsylvania and who is struggling miserably to Inchigeela, has not the faintest notion whether it is a half a mile or 50 miles down the road, or what road.  That is the experience that I have had in countries all over the world.  I remember finding myself out on one occasion in the middle of the Australian bush, and I think there were five roads which lay before me.  There did not seem to be any living creature within 250 miles, and there was no signpost.  Eventually I did establish contact with a woodman in the bush; he laughed at my ignorance, saying: &ldquo;Does not everyone know that Bateman's Bay is half a mile down the road?&rdquo; It might have been 250 miles down it, but it turned out that, when you did go down one of the roads and turned the corner, you came to a comparatively large town.  But I did not come from Bateman's Bay; I came from Ballaghaderreen, which is 17,250 miles away.  When a visitor comes to us from Bateman's Bay, I hope he will find on the roads of this country not only comfortable accommodation for his car but adequate guidance to the place to which he desires to go.  I have never yet come across a road with too many signposts, but I have found <Col N="2080" /> roads in every country in the world which have had too few.  Let us bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would suggest that the Minister should bear another fact in mind.  Some enthusiasts, when they are erecting signposts, seem to think that it is a case of &ldquo;per ardua ad astra&rdquo;.  The signpost is elevated to a level which makes it impossible to read it after dusk.  If you have keen sight and are travelling in broad daylight, you can; but the moment artificial light becomes requisite, all you can see is a straight stick, and unless you are an agile man and climb up the thing it might just as well not be there at all.  That is a matter which should be examined.  They have found that same difficulty in England and in other countries and have taken steps to remedy it.  A signpost is intended to be read: it is seldom decorative, and certainly it is not intended to adorn the landscape.</P>
    <P>Another thing the tourist wants is good trains.  Has the Minister travelled recently in a train in this country?  I suppose since he got the Dodge car he has not bothered about trains any more.  The trains in this country have become laughable.  I clambered into a first-class carriage on the Dublin-Sligo line last Friday night, and the carriage was illuminated with one gas mantle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat in the corner of that carriage and asked myself this question: Is there any country in the world&mdash;civilised or uncivilised&mdash;which has as bad a railway carriage in it as this?  I do not think there is; honestly, I do not think there is.  I do not believe that in the darkest recesses of Nicaragua you would find a railway carriage such as the one in which I sat on the Great Southern Railway the other night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is absolutely true.  In many of the primitive South African countries, they are served by international railway companies, the rolling stock of which is excellent.  The kind of rolling stock their resources might permit them to supply is never produced: you travel in wagons-lit or something of that <Col N="2081" /> kind.  There is no country in the world where the railway carriages are as bad as ours.  Now, there are a few good ones; but the majority are absolutely appalling.  Not only is the equipment scandalous, but they have reached a degree of dirt in which they breathe dirt out upon you.  It is not that you find gross dirt on the floor of the carriage; that is not true, you do not find cigarette butts and rubbish on the floor; apparently that is all swept away.  But you cannot touch any part of the railway carriage without getting black&mdash;is not that true?&mdash;the carriages positively exude dirt, which seems to be so ground into them that it is past the ability of the railway authorities to clean them at all.  I do not say it is past their capacity to clean them if they try.  I do not know whether any vacuum cleaning is done on our railway rolling stock at all, but can you imagine the feeling of an American woman who gets into a first class carriage in a white piqué dress and emerges at the end of the journey, plastered from stem to stern with dirt?  Can you imagine the impression which it creates?  She can only get the idea that she is living amongst barbarians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The democratic Labour Party are championing the poor and down-trodden, and making the case that there is nothing whatever wrong with the condition in which those carriages are kept.  I say that there is. I say that there is a litter problem in the third class carriages which imposes a strain upon the railway company, but not beyond what should be their capacity to keep them clean.  I say that, even without that additional difficulty in the third class carriages, the carriages are filthy, and I say it is a scandal that the railway company is not compelled to take some steps to remedy that situation, and that no tourist is going to avail of their services so long as that situation is allowed to continue.  I am not complaining so much of the archaic nature <Col N="2083" /> of the rolling stock, because they can plead that they have not the capital sum to replace it, but at least they can keep the carriages clean.  I do not care whether the seats are covered with American cloth, or with moquette as at present; whatever covers they have ought to be kept clean.  The woodwork, the fixtures and lavatories ought to be kept clean, and they are not.  The latest reform which has been introduced is that, instead of having decent towels, they have disgusting paper towels, which is about the lowest depth to which inconvenience and discomfort can be reduced.  Let that matter be attended to.  It is a simple matter.  It is purely a matter of soap and water and a vacuum cleaner. If the Tourist Board can prevail upon the railway company to put that matter right, it will be a contribution towards improving the amenities for tourists in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one reaches the end of one's journey, one requires a decent hotel room, hot and cold water, sanitary arrangements, and convenience to take a bath.  Those seem to me to be the essentials with which a tourist should be provided in an hotel.  I trust that the Tourist Board will do whatever they can to secure that they will be everywhere available in an hotel holding itself out as a tourist hotel.  Mind you, we can get an inferiority complex on this problem which would do us grave injustice.  There are hotels in the tourist centres of this country as good as or better than any tourist hotel in the world, and I know, because I have been in them.  I have seen ostentatious establishments in tourist centres abroad, the amenities of which could not compare with the amenities available in a well-run tourist hotel in parts of the West of Ireland; but in addition to that there are some hotels in rural Ireland so loathsome that words fail me to describe them: and the same is true of the United States of America, and every other country in which I have travelled.  Let us try then to model all our tourist hotels on the best ones we have got.  There is no necessity to go outside this country to find <Col N="2084" /> models of what a tourist hotel in this country should be.  I beg of the Minister to ensure that when the model is being taken it will be the model of a good Irish hotel with some character about it, and not a horrible pill box such as one infrequently encounters in the middle West of America.  I will say a word about that later.</P>
    <P>After those essentials have been provided, I suggest that one of the great difficulties of the Irish rural resort is the lack of amusement in the evening.  Most people can amuse themselves during the day.  They are bathing, or lying on the strand, or walking or fishing or doing one of the things that they went to that particular resort to do, but it is in the evening that humanity in our day and generation finds the greatest difficulty in amusing itself.  Conversation is dead; those who play cards can so amuse themselves, but there are many who must have some amusements provided for them to occupy their leisure hours, and those amusements are dancing, cinemas and fancy fairs&mdash;things with hobby horses, such as one finds on the piers in the big amusement resorts on the coast of England; boats, and competent persons to operate them, persons capable of showing the uninitiated how to indulge in sea fishing. That kind of thing is badly wanted in our tourist resorts.  In fact, if we are catering for tourists we have got to provide artificial fun for them, because most tourists of our day and age are quite incapable of making fun for themselves, particularly in the evening.</P>
    <P>I want to turn for a moment to the improvement of hotels.  If we are going to deal comprehensively with hotels and add to their number in certain areas, I do beg of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that some regard be had to architecture, that is to say that we should avoid the erection of hopelessly incongruous structures in the rural parts of Ireland. You will find them in striking numbers in America, dreadful square blocks of concrete, which are so unhygienic that one feels one is living in a bath house. They are hideous beyond words to describe, and they are identical over thousands of miles of country.  We <Col N="2085" /> ought to try to avoid that here, and have some regard to the general appearance of the countryside.  We should insist that when new buildings are being put up they will not be incongruous looking or grotesque.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the holiday camp business.  That is a very difficult business, and if a group of civil servants or quasi civil servants imagine they can embark successfully on the holiday camp business in this country they have another guess coming.  It cannot be done.  It is an extremely complex and difficult business which has grown up over the last 15 years in Great Britain, largely under the direction of a man called Butlin, I think, who evolved the idea.  It is now an immense organisation, and there is no use trying to get into a business of that kind&mdash;which is well established, high geared, and extremely efficient&mdash; with something that is only a kind of half-imitation.  It simply means that we will throw a whole lot of money away, and the whole thing will be a fiasco.  The only way you can get into the holiday camp business efficiently is to get one of the British holiday camp organisations to run it for us.  Give them a chance in this country.  They are extremely astute fellows.  They do not give a fiddle-dee-dee whether they are running a camp on the west coast of England or in Zanzibar, if they can make a profit on it.  They are not going to run a camp here with English people, because they know they will run more efficiently if they train an Irish crowd.  They will do it effectively and efficiently if there is a prospect of profit in it.  It has this immense advantage: if you get this big organisation operating here you will get increased traffic between the two countries.</P>
    <P>They will deliberately urge certain of their guests who have familiarised themselves with the camp in North Wales and who are tired with the camp in the east coast of England to try the camp in Ireland next time, just in order to keep them on their visiting list and to keep them circulating. We will get a great influx of English travellers accustomed to the holiday camp life, accustomed to the general régime obtaining in the Butlin <Col N="2086" /> camps and other camps in England that we all know of, and we will have undoubtedly a considerable efflux of our people who have become acquainted with the holiday camps here to the holiday camps in Great Britain. That is all to the good.  We will get far more from Great Britain in the way of visitors than Great Britain will ever get from us.  Of course, if the camp idea takes on it will spread here, and if the camp is a success in Bray there may be one started in Tramore; there may be one started in Cork and, possibly, one somewhere in the West of Ireland.  I think you will find that most of them are located near large towns in order to ensure an adequate supply of cinema entertainment and outside entertainment of that kind which the camp does not attempt to encompass within its own organisation. That is the kind of wrinkle that experienced organisers in England have learned from experience.  I put it to the Minister most strongly, for these and other reasons into which it may not be expedient to go here in the House, that enterprises of that kind must be run by experienced people who have learned, sometimes from bitter experience, of the dangers and difficulties of such an organisation. Of course, I know that there will be a howl that we ought to have self-sufficiency in this matter, in which case we will have dilapidated camps, a poor imitation of something that is going on in Great Britain, not because we are any less capable of organising the thing but because we have not got the experience of organising them, and we cannot possibly get the volume of business that they get in England on which to learn the difficulties of this trade. Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister to avail of the existing organisation, seeing that our principal purpose is to bring visitors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to-day to fishing.  That seems to me to call for comment on the lack of co-ordination between the Ministries of the Government.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants to facilitate fishing and encourage everybody to engage in it, and the Minister for Agriculture wants to put a tax on <Col N="2087" /> everybody's trout rod.  One horse is not as good as two horses provided the two horses are pulling in the same direction, but one horse is much better than two horses if the two horses are pulling in opposite directions.  There is no use in the Minister for Industry and Commerce trying to make fishing popular when the Minister for Agriculture is putting a tax on the trout rods.  I quite agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have here an asset, an invaluable asset, which compares most favourably with anything Great Britain has to offer or anything that Scotland has to offer.  We have in this country that astonishing survival of free fishing.  I know towns in this country in which you can pick up your rod, walk out and fish three good trout rivers without leave from anybody.  I do not believe such a thing exists in the whole of Great Britain at the present time.  That is the line we ought to follow.  These rivers ought to be restocked and their stock improved. Steps ought to be taken to encourage those who live along their banks to erect keshes and stiles so that passing anglers will not be knocking down their fences or blocking their drains by throwing stones into them in order to provide dry footway across them.  The local anglers' associations might be availed of to help in the restocking of rivers and I think they would be very pleased to co-operate. There are dozens of good lakes in this country on which there is no boat at all.  I think the Minister might very profitably exert himself to ensure that on any lake where there is fishing to be had, coarse or trout, boats would be available and fellows would be encouraged to have boats there and earn whatever was going, and to notify persons who were prepared to put boats on such lakes that the Tourist Board would advertise the amenities they had to offer.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I think we have in this country another asset unrivalled in any country in the world&mdash;free shooting. There are hundreds of thousands of acres in this country on which any man can go if he has a £2 licence, shoot grouse, woodcock, partridge, and <Col N="2088" /> snipe.  I am certain that no such amenity is available in Great Britain and I have seen what an immense influx of tourists similar amenities have produced in the United States of America.  I think that whatever measures can be taken&mdash;and I believe effective measures can be taken&mdash;should be taken to increase the numbers of grouse, partridge and woodcock.  I do not think snipe require much stimulation because there is an immense snipe population already.  Plans should be devised, if such be practicable, to increase the wild duck population of the country.  I know that immense work has been done in that direction in the United States of America by the preservation of duck in certain areas.  I do not know on what lines such measures could be most profitably pursued in this country, but emphasis should be thrown on the freedom of our fishing, on the freedom of our shooting and our resolve to improve them.  Albeit we are going to get no direct return by way of licence fees for the amenities we provide, we should be none the less resolved, in order to create that special tourist asset in this country, to improve the fishing, the stock of our rivers, the stock of our moors and mountains, so that those who pass by may enjoy that free amenity which is regarded as justifying the payment of such immense fees as are paid in Scotland and the east of England.  There are grouse moors in this country which, I am sure, would be let for £1,000 per annum if they were in Scotland or Yorkshire. Here they are perfectly free.  Let us improve, develop, and expand them so that they may be enjoyed by all those who come to visit us and so that in time we may build up two entirely different types of tourist traffic to Ireland, one type that is provided for by the holiday camp and the pseudo Blackpool, on our east coast, and the other those disciples of Emily Lawless and those placid sportsmen who are not looking so much for luxury as peace and the still shore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister undoubtedly furnished the House with a very interesting review of the proposed programme <Col N="2089" /> of the new Tourist Board during what he called the emergency period.  The Government having decided, and rightly so, to set up a Tourist Board for the purpose of developing what the Minister now calls the holiday industry are, in my opinion, quite right in not completely suspending the activities of that body during the emergency period.  The Minister, in his lengthy and interesting statement, indicated that the annual cost for the carrying out of this programme during the emergency period would come to something like £9,000 but, as far as I can recollect, he did not indicate what portion of the £9,000 per annum would be set aside for publicity purposes.  I am not quite sure whether he has any information to give the House on that very important aspect of the work of the Tourist Board during the period covered by his statement.  The reason I ask for that information is that I believe that no matter what the nature of the programme may be the success of the proposed programme will depend to a great extent upon the publicity side of the work of the Tourist Board.  A considerable sum was mentioned originally to be used for publicity purposes out of the total annual amount voted to the Tourist Board under the Act already passed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister informed us that the works to be carried out during the emergency period would be works of a minor nature, something like the works carried out at very small cost and known to Deputies and others as minor relief schemes.  I suggest that during the emergency period the Tourist Board should engage in the making of tourist roads.  If they decide to go ahead with the making or remaking of tourist roads, that work cannot be carried out by means of the small grants that are generally allocated from year to year for the carrying out of minor relief schemes.  I have a fairly good knowledge of most tourist roads, that is, coast roads in this country. I have endeavoured to travel over most of the coast roads of this country. There is in the making or remaking of coast roads, commonly called tourist roads, very valuable work for some of <Col N="2090" /> our unemployed.  If the Minister sees anything in that suggestion, I think he will agree that the work cannot be undertaken in bits and scraps and carried out on the same lines as works normally carried out as minor relief schemes.  I would suggest that the Minister might have a word with the chairman, the secretary and other members of the Tourist Board on that matter.  We are constantly reminded of the fact that there is plenty of money available to carry out any useful or reproductive work that may be mentioned in this House.  If the money is available, then I think there is work there to be done, and the sooner that work is taken in hands the better it will be.  These roads will be there at the end of the European War to accommodate the increased number of tourists which I am sure will come to this country at the conclusion of hostilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his remarks referred to the judicious publicity of the scheme so far as it referred to the Gaeltacht areas.  I wonder what amount of money he had in mind when he talked of judicious publicity, or was he under the impression that the Gaeltacht scheme could be carried out for nothing?  I should like to know if any portion of the £20,000 which he mentioned in connection with the Gaeltacht portion of the scheme, is to be set aside for publicity purposes.  Even if the proposed scheme for tourist development during the emergency period is to be confined to attracting our own citizens, publicity is desirable in the same way though, I agree, not to the same extent, as it would be if we were advertising the tourist development scheme to people in America, Great Britain or Continental countries.  I am definitely of opinion&mdash;I am not sure whether the Minister is&mdash;that many tourists can be brought to this country even during the emergency period.  We have, I should say, at least 250,000 people working and living in Great Britain who have Irish ties.  A great many Irish-born citizens now working in Britain, and also the sons of those who in former days went to Great Britain, have their families and their wives living here at present.  Apart <Col N="2091" /> from that, there is this fact staring the Tourist Board in the face.  The average British citizen, with or without Irish ties, will be glad to get away from the dangers of possible air raids while the war goes on.  He will be glad to get away from the black-out conditions so far as these conditions have any bearing on his holiday period.  He will be glad to get away from the food-rationing scheme at present in existence in Britain, and to come over to a country where he will get plenty of good, wholesome food.</P>
    <P>I am definitely of opinion that, with a little bit of publicity and organisation by the Tourist Board, the increase shown during the past few years in the number of tourists coming here will be maintained, if encouragement, by way of facilities provided here, is given to them.  They will be glad to get away from the warlike conditions that prevail in the country where they have to live and work, and to come over here, where there is much more freedom than in Britain at present.  I venture to express that view, having come in contact with people who had something to do with the development of the tourist business, and who have made some contribution in that direction during the past few years.  If the Minister and the Tourist Board share that point of view, some money is necessary to carry out publicity work.  A very high percentage of the tourists who have been coming to this country from Britain during the past few years in increasing numbers are workers, both male and female, from the highly-industrialised centres.  On the average these people spend at least £5 a week during the period they remain here.  It is not well-to-do British citizens that have been coming to this country in increasing numbers. The well-to-do people have been going to Continental countries.  Whether they will come here during the emergency period for the reasons I have given, is another matter.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as the Minister has stated, that quite a number of well-to-do British citizens, and even a number of people from the Continent, have <Col N="2092" /> been coming over here and going to the West of Ireland, spending money on fishing and other forms of sport in that part of the country.  If they were to be furnished with a verbatim report of the speech just delivered by Deputy Dillon, I doubt when they come over here if they would travel in railway carriages, or even if they would come here at all. Portion of the speech he has delivered is not very helpful to the activities of the Tourist Board, and is a reflection on a considerable section of those who make use of the railway carriages in this country.  He suggested that he did not know whether the railway carriages were cleaned or not.  I am personally aware of the fact that Deputy Dillon travels from Westland Row to Ballaghaderreen, or to Timbuctoo, or wherever he goes, and, if he opened his eyes before he went into the railway carriages, he would find out whether there was any vacuum cleaning done at railway termini such as Westland Row. At any rate, if the Minister believes half of what Deputy Dillon said about the condition of the railways, upon which Deputy Dillon himself has been travelling, the only cure is to send for the whole Board of the Great Southern Railway Company, and the General Manager, put Deputy Dillon up against them, and let him prove whether his statements are well-founded or not.</P>
    <P>If the statements are half true, they are a reflection on the Minister's Department, because that Department is responsible for seeing that the railways are kept in a proper state of repair; that the railway coaches are kept clean, and in a condition of safety as far as the travelling public is concerned. I may tell the Minister, in case he does not know it, that Deputy Dillon has the reputation in railway circles of making unfounded complaints against the railway management as well as against railwaymen.  I will leave it at that.  As far as I am concerned I took a note of the time taken by the Minister in making his very interesting and informative statement on behalf of the Tourist Board.  It took him 25 minutes, while it took Deputy Dillon 35 minutes to talk a lot of tripe.  The Deputy did not make <Col N="2093" /> any valuable suggestion, or say anything that could be said to be in the nature of constructive criticism of the proposals outlined by the Minister.  I hope the Deputy will not take as long on another occasion in this House to say so much about something of which he admitted he knew nothing.</P>
    <P>Portion of his statement was an undeserved reflection on poorer people who travel in third-class railway carriages. I wonder would he find out from the traffic manager of the Great Southern Railways the next time he is talking to him, what percentage of the gross receipts of the railway is derived from first-class travellers, who pay their fares on the railway, as against the receipts derived from those who travel in third-class carriages?  It is quite true, undoubtedly, that the railway rolling stock is in a very bad state but the Minister knows better than I do why that is so.  Certainly there are railway coaches at present being used on the trunk lines, and on the midland section as well as the southern section, which are as good as the railway carriages in any continental country, or even on the trunk lines in England. The pity of it is, as far as I am informed, that sufficient capital is not available to provide the railway company with the same class of rolling stock on other sections of the system. I certainly support the Minister, as far as his request for this small sum is concerned.  It is, as Deputies can see, to be devoted mainly to administrative and other expenditure.  If we are going to go ahead with the work which is there to be done by the Tourist Board, I suggest to the Minister that a good deal of publicity will be required, whether that work will be confined to providing better facilities here for our own citizens during the emergency period, or whether it will be extended to other places, from which considerable revenue has been derived in the past, from tourists to this country.</P>

      <P>I am very glad this Supplementary Estimate has been brought in, because when this House, some time ago, realised the importance of tourism, it was felt, at the same time, that with the stringency brought about by the war and all that comes with it, it might not be possible to go ahead with any of the work of the Irish Tourist Board.  It is satisfying, in the midst of the unrest and uncertainty, that a beginning is about to be made. It is time it was done, because this country has lagged behind for a long time in this matter.  Other countries have developed tourism, and have made quite a lot of money out of it. What I should like to impress on the <Col N="2096" /> board, if I can impress anything, is that whatever development to attract tourists there is in this country, it will be an Irish development, and that if people come to Ireland they will not come with the idea of finding Continental hotels or European ideas.  We ought to cater for them in an Irish way, and that is a big matter.  Those who travel to France or Germany find themselves in a French atmosphere in France, and are served with French dishes; they are quite satisfied with them, and positively relish them.</P>
      <P>I hope that in any development, with regard to hotels particularly, and any educational programme devised for this country, we will keep an eye to that right through, and see to it that the development will be upon Irish lines. I am sure it will be, but there is just that danger that we might possibly try to develop on Continental or American lines, instead of Irish lines.  This country offers very great attractions indeed to tourists, and I have no doubt that development upon Irish lines, so far as food is concerned, can be made quite a success.  So far as hotels are concerned, I believe an effort has been made in the past to bring them up to date.  A great deal lies ahead in that respect still, and a great deal lies ahead with regard to transport; but my purpose in speaking at all is to impress, so far as I can, on the people who will be undertaking the organisation of this great work, that it ought to be organised upon lines which are distinctly Irish, so that visitors to this country will know that they are in Ireland, and that they will be treated in such a way that they will like to come back to Ireland to enjoy the Irish dishes and other comforts provided.</P>

      <P>I am sure the debate on this Estimate will be read with much interest and given a great deal of consideration by the members of the Irish Tourist Board, but I think I ought to correct the misapprehension which, apparently, Deputy Dillon was under as to the personnel of the board.  The board is not composed of civil servants, or semi-civil servants.  There is, so far as I know, no civil servant and no person who might be described as a quasi-civil servant on the board.  It is constituted <Col N="2097" /> of men who, because of their own practical interests, it was thought would be the most suitable council to administer the general functions of the board and to carry through the great project of, as I prefer to call it, holiday development in the country. The chairman of the board is a gentleman who was the very able and efficient secretary of the Irish Tourist Association.  I do not suppose there is any person&mdash;at least, there is no person in the Government, and I do not know of any person in the Government service&mdash;who would be at all as competent to deal with that problem as he is.  Another member is a gentleman who has an intimate knowledge of the Gaeltacht; another is a gentleman who has a great deal of practical experience as an engineer; and another was chosen because of his knowledge of country pursuits like fishing and shooting, to which Deputy Dillon has referred, and which we believe can be made a very valuable asset to the holiday industry in the country.  Another member is a gentleman with a great deal of experience of local boards and as the chairman of a county council, and who, I think, was also president of the Irish Tourist Association.  It will be seen that the board has been very carefully chosen, so that it will bring to its work that assortment of special experience and knowledge which is essential.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about the powers of this board.  They are laid down by the Bill, and the Government cannot exercise any detailed control over the board, except to the extent that the board may have to come to us for a Grant-in-Aid during the period.  Once that grant is given, however, while it would be subject to audit in the same way as other Grants-in-Aid, we have no control over the management or administration of the board.  All we can do is to look at the results of the board's activities and, if we are satisfied with them, to renew the grant, or to increase it, and if we are dissatisfied, to reduce the grant, or to discontinue it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is necessary to say that because a number of matters have been raised here over which the board has <Col N="2098" /> no control, and over which I have no control.  For instance, the board cannot control the manner in which the Irish railways choose to run.  I am not either criticising or commending the railways; I am merely putting the fact to the House.  If the carriages are unclean, the board, I presume, can make representations, but it cannot compel the railway company to keep clean carriages.  Similarly, the board has absolutely nothing to do with the construction of tourist roads and it has no power to construct them.  The board's powers are laid down in the Act.  It can recommend the construction of tourist roads to the Government Department or local authorities which are charged with such works, but so far as the board itself actually undertaking the execution of these works is concerned, it has no power and will not endeavour to do so.  It is not designed to do that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>In regard to advertising, which has been mentioned by Deputy Davin, a limited amount of money is made available to the board under this Grant-in-Aid and it is the maximum which the board and I have agreed, in existing circumstances, it can profitably and suitably dispose of and the maximum which the Minister for Finance can afford.  It is quite true that this apparently small sum does not make any great provision for advertising. It does provide for a certain limited amount, and that particularly associated with the board's work in the Gaeltacht; but over and above that, over and above the work of the board, it is anticipated that the Irish Tourist Association will continue its normal activities in relation to advertising and the other matters with which is was concerned before the establishment of the board.  The principal concern of the board at the present time will be to survey the ground and to make plans for future development.  It is for the purpose of providing it with the rather specialised staff to enable it to do that; to keep the board itself together and to allow the men who have been set up as a great council in this matter to make a survey for themselves, in some cases; to consider the results of their surveys and of those made by their <Col N="2099" /> officers; and to formulate definite plans for future development on the basis of those surveys, that we are making the grant this evening.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything that I said that could have been responsible for the very strange misapprehension under which Deputy Dillon seemed to labour when he got up to speak.  I did not say that we proposed to turn our Gaeltacht areas into Blackpools.  I said nothing of the sort; on the contrary, I said that while the board was prepared to do everything it possibly could to develop the industry in the Gaeltacht areas, it would only do what could be done without detriment to the survival and revival of the Irish language.  I went further and said that one of the things which the board was concerned to avoid, in relation to the Gaeltacht areas, was a concentration of a large number of visitors in the area, that we wished that the native influence should be predominant and accordingly, so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, we hoped that the visitors there would reside in the houses of the people; that we wished to put the people in a position to keep such visitors in reasonable comfort, and that, in regard to these houses which were operating under the ægis of the board, the board would be concerned to see that only genuine Irish speakers or persons who were genuinely desirous of acquiring a knowledge of the language would be sent to these houses.  That is the policy which the board has in mind.  I myself think it is the only policy which we can try out if we are going to utilise the Gaeltacht as a holiday resort.</P>
    <P>I am not an Irish speaker by any means, but I do go year after year to a part of the Gaeltacht, and I have seen the beneficial effects on the condition of the people which have resulted from the fact that Irish speakers, in the first instance, and people who are genuinely desirous of learning the language have gone for holidays to that area.  There is very limited hotel accommodation in that area, but there are a large number of houses the owners of which have laid themselves out to attract Irish-speaking students, and I can say for myself that <Col N="2100" /> the influx of these students there has had a revolutionary effect upon the appearance and, so far as I can see, upon the economic conditions of the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The influx of people who, with the advantage of a liberal education which many people in the Gaeltacht have been denied, go there to learn the Irish language, has given the people of that area a pride in their language, I will not say which they never had before, because they were always proud of it; but it has intensified their pride in the language and it has broadened their outlook and, strange as it may appear, I believe it has expanded the use of the language in that district.  I know one kitchen where native speakers come in and discuss all sorts of world and scientific affairs through the medium of the language, and, so far as I can follow it, they utilise the language as flexibly and as fluently as Deputy Dillon uses the English language in this House&mdash;and that, I may say, is saying a great deal.  I, therefore, agree with the members of the Tourist Board that if we can find the right sort of way to develop this industry in the Gaeltacht we can do good not only to the Gaeltacht, but also do a great deal of good to the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say except that I hope that the Bill will be a success.  My fears about the Bill are founded on the fact that I am afraid there is no real co-ordinating influence to run a machine of this kind. It is very hard to feel that local authorities will be able to provide on the system laid down here the necessary fire-fighting appliances, but, particularly, the necessary personnel to man the appliances.  I had thought <Col N="2101" /> that some attempt might be made to compel local authorities, if you like, to make a contribution towards some kind of central fire-fighting authority through the Civic Guards.  They are the only people I know who can conduct a matter of this kind, the only people who will be always waiting and ready.  I have very little faith in this Bill operating successfully, but I hope it does.  So far as the Bill is a necessity, everybody in the House welcomes it, because some measure of this kind is necessary.  I am not opposing it, but I am afraid that after all our trouble we have not provided an efficient machine for dealing with outbreaks of fire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill will validate the schemes adopted by county councils for the supply of seeds and fertilisers last year, and authorise the adoption of schemes in the present year.  Early last year representations reached the Department that unless special facilities were provided a number of cultivators requiring seeds would not be able to purchase them. It was stated that a proportion of the potato crop had been damaged by heavy frosts or floods and that in some counties there was a shortage of oats suitable for sowing.  In these circumstances the Department communicated with the county councils and asked them to submit suitable schemes. Eleven county councils submitted schemes which had been adopted for the supply of seeds and fertilisers.  In nine counties the schemes were of the usual type, that is, the council made arrangements with seed merchants to supply seeds to approved applicants who undertook to repay the cost after the harvest.  In two counties the councils gave guarantees to approved suppliers.  These guarantees would only become operative when the suppliers found it impossible to collect the cost of the seed.  The number of cultivators supplied by the nine county <Col N="2102" /> councils was 2,563.  The other two councils gave 67 guarantees.  In the counties of Cavan, Leitrim and Mayo the facilities were largely availed of, but elsewhere only to a limited extent. The cost of seeds and fertilisers sold by county councils last year was £6,512.</P>
      <P>In view of the necessity for promoting increased tillage in the present year instructions were issued to all county councils a month ago to consider schemes similar to those of last year and to submit them.  A great many of the councils have adopted them this year.  Some of them, I think, have not met yet; at any rate, we have not heard from them definitely whether they are going to adopt them or not.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the same as the Bill which was introduced in 1932 and it is for the same purpose, that is, where people are not able to provide or get seeds or fertilisers, the county council will make arrangements with the merchants by which they can get seeds from the merchants and, at the end of the year, the county council can collect these amounts.  If there is difficulty in collecting them, they can make a special rate applicable to the people concerned.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if that is all the Minister has to say about this Bill.  If that is so, there will be a very disappointing anti-climax to the expectations of the people of the county.  It shows the hollowness of all the talk we have heard from the Government about helping agriculture and filling the national larder in this present period of emergency.  I think the figure that was involved last year in providing seeds and manures for the whole county was about £6,000.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>See the wide difference between the conception in Governmental circles on this matter compared with the conception of at least one county council of which I know.  The Dublin County Council has made arrangements, as a first instalment this year, to make available £50,000 for loans to provide seeds and fertilisers in this period of emergency for the <Col N="2103" /> farmers in County Dublin.  That is only a first instalment and we are prepared to lend that money at 5 per cent. If we are to measure the Bill with the speech that the Minister delivered on its introduction, we can only regard it as a toy measure.  It is an insult to the national industry of agriculture at the present time.  The Minister for Agriculture is conspicuous by his absence from the House this evening. With all respect I submit that it was the Minister for Agriculture who should be introducing this measure and not the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The ex-Minister for Justice is a distinguished member of his profession.  We cannot amend this Bill.  Its conception is too small and it is too narrow in its scope.  It is a Bill that cannot possibly be amended. It is a pigmy Bill.  I do not mean a Bill for producing pigs.  No matter what you do you cannot make an adult out of it.  This £6,000 for seeds and manures would not provide seeds and fertilisers for the cottagers.  This is a period of emergency.  The Minister for Agriculture has made an Order which if carried out fully will have the effect of practically doubling the tillage area of the country.  With agriculture poor, short of liquid capital and short of credit, I ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health how does he propose to have this worked and, of course, though he is specially distinguished in other fields I believe his natural reply will be that he does not know how he is to carry out the double tillage this year with the agricultural industry impoverished, an industry without working capital and without credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for my own constituency and for my own county council of County Dublin I wish to tell the Minister that we are prepared to provide credits.  That has been the position that has been carried unanimously at a full meeting of the Dublin County Council.  I wish the Government would meet us on that.  At all events our council is going ahead with its scheme. It will only be stopped by Government interference.  We want certain things from the Government.  We have bombing 'planes, torpedo boats, and we have <Col N="2104" /> A.R.P. But what real line of defence have we only the food line?  Why does not the Government provide the food line?  We can only provide the food line by having capital to provide it. Our farmers have no capital.</P>
    <P>There is not a very distinct relation between the Minister's short cryptic speech introducing this measure and the circular that has been sent by the Department to the county councils.  I am sorry I have not a copy of that circular, but in it the county councils were asked to provide seeds and manures or loans for them, for those farmers who were not in a position to finance their agricultural pursuits out of their own resources.  Not more than 10 per cent. of the farmers of this country are able to finance intensive agriculture out of their own resources. I do not speak of agriculture from a distance.  I speak from the sod.  Does the Minister realise that the cost of seeds this year and the difficulty of getting manures so as to enable the farmer to carry out his operations this year, will be twice as much as last year?  Mixed farming will require twice as much capital, and it is far more difficult to get capital this year than it was last year.</P>
    <P>There is little that the farmer has to buy by way of accessories to the growing of crops, that he will not have to buy and pay for in cash.  The merchant from whom he buys has himself to pay cash.  In all their stages these are cash transactions.  But the Minister seems sublimely ignorant of this or at least he betrays no knowledge of the circumstances.  I am giving him the facts and I am giving them as a practical farmer, and as one associated with farmers all over the country.  The farmers of the country are watching this Bill.  I hope that before it finally leaves this House it will be fashioned into something that will be of some use not to the toy farmer or the farmer who farms for a hobby but to the farmer who is waiting to be put into a position to plant the spring wheat which can still be sown.  The sowing season for potatoes, if the weather were right, is now upon us.  The farmers want to be at work. Will the Minister help them to start <Col N="2105" /> that work?  I put the proposition to the Minister and I ask him to help them.  I will guarantee to him that behind the scheme I will put up, stands the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there are thousands of acres of land in this country that cannot be touched.  Why? It is because that land owes too much money.  The Minister and his colleagues cannot dissociate themselves from some responsibility for the heavy debts that are on agriculture.  I do not want to go into that matter now.  Let us take things as they are and let us have no recriminations in regard to the past.  Things happened yesterday and the day before which piled up debts on agriculture.  Two banking commissions have reported at length on frozen debts.</P>
    <P>Those frozen debts are still there. There are annuities and rates due on land.  Thousands of acres of the best land are idle, because there is too much money owing on it, and, if anything is done to cultivate or stock the lands, the sheriff is waiting to seize.  This is a period of emergency.  Why do we not get down to business and put that land into cultivation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That question would be more relevantly addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, under, for instance, sub-head G (3) of Vote 52, which will come up to-morrow.  On the Second Stage of a Bill, Deputies are, of course, entitled to make suggestions as to what the Bill should contain. This is a Bill to authorise local councils to grant loans.  The proposal that certain lands should be relieved of debt in some way, with a view to their being safely tilled, should be made to the Minister for Agriculture or to the Minister for Lands, rather than to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the point as to the provision of adequate loans to work the land.  I am a member and, I hope, a responsible member of a county council which is backing a scheme to give large credits or loans relying on the security of the county rates.  We are, <Col N="2106" /> thereby, mortgaging the county for these loans, and we must see that they are secured.  To be of any use it is necessary that these loans should be given in a simple way while, at the same time, being adequately secured. This is a Bill to help people who cannot help themselves.  It is the people who own these lands who are mainly in need of help, and, according to the circular sent out by the Minister, this is the type of people proposed to be helped.  That is my view as a farmer and as a citizen who wants to increase food production.  As a member of the county council and as a lender, I want to see these loans properly secured.  If we lend on such land, the sheriff may go in and seize what is produced on account of decrees for land annuities and rates, whereas, if we do not put any money into that land, it will lie idle and there will be nothing for anybody to seize.  I own some land and, though I am not a Communist or a Socialist, I recognise that the State has an overriding authority and control which it should exercise in times of emergency for the good of the whole community. That time of emergency is here, and I advocate interference with lands in this period of emergency which I would not advocate in normal times.</P>
      <P>We are prepared to lend on such land in County Dublin.  Will the Minister go some of the way to meet us? If the owner of that land gets sureties, we can lend.  That will take a long time.  I have a little experience of getting things done by legal men, and my experience is that life is almost too short to get anything done.  We have a scheme from which we can exclude the legal profession.  I am not now referring to the Minister.  Did the Minister consider putting the type of land of which I have spoken into production? If he has not, and if he sets his back against any credits or loans under this Bill that would help to get such land into production, I think we have taken an exaggerated view of what can be done under this Bill.  I hope the Minister will see the desirability of getting something done along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister for Agriculture is not here, because I should like to know how the Tillage <Col N="2107" /> Order can be carried out on such lands. It can be carried out, as it was carried out in some instances during the Great War, by putting in a team of horses, breaking up the requisite amount of the land and leaving it there with a shake of oats.  That is tillage, but it is not food production.  If the county councils, recognising their responsibilities in this time of emergency, are prepared to mortgage the rates to give loans for the purposes stated in this Bill on the guarantee of the applicants, the Minister should either seal up the debts on these lands or give priority to the money the councils are prepared to lend in order to get the lands worked. If the Minister cannot consider that proposal favourably, then he is only helping agriculture in pennyworths. This Bill will really apply only to cottage tenants.  It will not affect food production in the slightest.  Loans were given in previous years by guarantee.  There is no need for a guarantee beyond that of the borrower himself if those frozen debts are sealed up during the period of emergency, or if we give priority to the charges of the county council.  We are ready to proceed in County Dublin, but I suppose our scheme would require the approval of the Minister.  If the Minister would do as I suggest, we should be ready to start operations in the morning and lend freely to any <i>bona fide</i> farmer in County Dublin.  From soundings made, I do not think that any conception of this magnitude has entered the mind of the Minister or that of the Ministry. Consider what that would mean in relieving unemployment.  It would be no charge whatever on the rates, and it would produce what would repay the seasonal loan&mdash;repay it by, say, the 1st January at the latest, and perhaps earlier.  It would repay the interest and leave a margin of about 1 per cent. for working expenses, and would increase the entire food supply of the country.  It would give employment to many people who are now on the dole or on home assistance, and it would be a genuine attempt to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The whole problem is a question of finance.  I do not want to go deeply into the financial side of the matter, as <Col N="2108" /> there will be ample opportunity on the Estimates to go into that, but the key to the success of this scheme is to make loans available in a simple way.  A loan that would be a first charge on a farm, a loan that would be required for seeds and manures, would be amply secured without any guarantor, and it would put that land into the production of food&mdash;land that is not now producing and that will not be producing unless capital is put into it.  It is a terribly serious state of affairs that all food supplies, both for men and animals, are getting scarcer every day.  I shall give the Minister one instance.  Cotton meal that could have been bought for £8 5s. a ton a year ago is now £15 a ton, and scarce at that.  Apart from that, it could have been got at ordinary trade terms a year ago, but now it is a matter of cash with the order.  See the difference of working under the two sets of circumstances.  The war is only on since September last.  What will the state of affairs be next year, if the war is still on?  And there is every sign that it will be on.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying, in a few months' time, that we should have put this country under production and have allowed no obstacle to stand in the way of doing so.  If you do not do it now, there will not be another opportunity for 12 months, and even if you do it now you will not have an increased food supply until next August, September or October; but if you do not get going now you will not have an increased food supply until August, September or October of 1941.  This too, comes back to the question of credit facilities and loans for farmers, which this Bill proposes to make available, but in too small a way.</P>
    <P>Now, we had experience of small loans for those seeds and fertilisers. That does not affect the agricultural position at all.  These, perhaps, had some justification when you had no Compulsory Tillage Order operating. I submit to the Minister&mdash;and I am sure he sees it himself&mdash;that there is an absolute necessity for something bigger, on the lines of this Bill, from that which obtained last year or at any time since 1932.  You want something bigger, and if the Minister takes <Col N="2109" /> a wider view of loans for this purpose, it will not cost the national finance anything.  We have got in touch with our treasurers, our bank, and we will get the money.  We can lend it at 5 per cent., and we will have a sufficient margin left to pay for administration expenses.  We are quite satisfied that that will be repaid and that it will have produced food for men and animals before it is paid back, and that some profit will be left to make lands that are now useless able to pay some of the old debt, or some interest on the old debt, that otherwise they would not be able to pay.</P>
    <P>From every angle that this matter can be examined, one can see the necessity for a chance to be given to land that is now overburdened, from causes that happened yesterday or the day before and with which we need not now concern ourselves; but we cannot put that land working unless we have Government or statutory assurance that our money will not be interfered with and seized upon to pay debts that accrued before the present emergency.  We do not approve of the working of this proposed scheme.  We do not agree with getting sureties, because what good is getting sureties? If I am not able to buy the seeds and manures that I want myself, and if Deputy George Bennett is not able to buy them either&mdash;if I go as security for Deputy George Bennett and if Deputy George Bennett secures me, in such circumstances might you not as well give Deputy George Bennett his whack and give mine to me?  What good is getting sureties?  We want to fix the land, and we have every right to ask for the land to be fixed so as to produce, in the first line of defence, the food that is necessary for men and animals, and I say that it would be much better for us to do that instead of spending £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 on an Army that is either too cowardly or too inefficient to defend its own ammunition.</P>

      <P>If we have not a farming Napoleon, at least we have to do the best we can with the ordinary farmers in this country, and it is with the very ordinary farmers that we have to deal and to appeal to them to produce the food for the nation that is required at the moment.  We spend millions on our Army, and I do not say that we should not do so, but an Army is no good if its stomach is empty, and if the submarine campaign that is going on at the moment deprives us of concentrated foods for our live stock, and if we do not grow food for our live stock in this country, what will our live stock trade be worth and what will our land carry?  Worse still, if we have not the food for the human population of this country, what good is the Army, what good is the money spent on planes and torpedo boats or any of the other engines of war?  The first and most important engine of individual or collective defence is food, the food of the people and the food of the live stock that we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you are not comparing me with Mr. Lloyd George.  Now is the time to get working and, properly conceived and extended, this is the Bill that will help to start the necessary production.  I ask the Minister to put out of his mind £5,000 or £6,000 and think in terms of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000.  England in defending herself is spending £6,000,000 a day. Are we not prepared to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in a year in order to defend ourselves?  I submit that this is the proper line of defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the frozen debts in agriculture. I have heard them variously <Col N="2111" /> estimated at £15,000,000 to £20,000,000. Those people who have that money out are watching the land to see if any stock will go on it or if any crops will be raised.  Then they will have the sheriffs ready to seize the stock or the crops.  In such circumstances it follows that nobody is going to grow crops or stock the land and the country is so much the poorer for not having the land stocked or under production. Some of us able to stock or cultivate our land might be inclined to take a narrow, selfish view of the situation; might be glad from the selfish point of view to see the land idle.  On the other hand, if we produce food and others do not, there will be less food available when the day of sale comes and we who have it will get a better price.</P>
    <P>In the period lying ahead of us there will be ample room in the market for double or treble or even quadruple our present production.  There will still be a market for it.  Should we not at once get down to work?  Should we not try to produce all the food that will be necessary, to put into the land all the capital that is necessary in order to start the wheels of industry on the land?  Our slogan should be &ldquo;Speed the plough&rdquo;.  That should be written across this Bill.  It was I who raised that cry first and they copied it. I think that I speed the plough as much as the whole lot of Deputies on the opposite benches put together.  I hope we will all speed the plough.  I did not intend to wander from the subject or to make any political references. I am sorry I have done so, because in this matter we want the co-operation of all.</P>
    <P>This is not a Party measure.  Every farmer and every labourer in this country wants to see the land worked, Fianna Fáil just as much as Fine Gael. They want to put agriculture on its feet.  That is not the ambition of one Party or one individual; it is the ambition of all.  This Bill gives us an opportunity of getting the land into production and making crops available. I suggest that the Minister should get a census taken.  I am sure figures <Col N="2112" /> are already available.  I think I could get substantially correct figures, from papers that I have, relating to the amount of frozen debts in every county.  He could ask county councils the amount of land covered by those frozen debts.  That would be an indication of the amount that would have to be lent&mdash;and this is absolutely essential&mdash;to put those lands into production. One of two things should be done, either seal up those debts or give priority to the money that would be lent by the county councils.  That is the way to get the rates.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin we are owed something like £100,000.  We are not afraid of that.  As a matter of fact, we are prepared to put £100,000 down under the provisions of this Bill in order to have every acre of land in County Dublin under production.  The Minister, who can speak for Ireland with as much and perhaps more authority than I can speak for County Dublin, can say the same of the whole country.  I am sure he will get the co-operation of all the county councils in this matter. Is it not better to work the land, even if we run the risk of losing a few thousand?  I see no risk, and I have as much experience in practical matters of this sort as most people.  I see no risk at all.  I would not want security from any applicant.  The only thing I would ask for is that when the day of repayment came around there should be no option left with county councils in the matter of giving time because otherwise it would make the lives of county councils a hell.  When the time would come for repayment it should be mandatory.  That would discipline the people and train them to keep their bonds honestly.</P>
    <P>If that could be worked successfully for a year or two it would restore the credit of agriculture.  After all, credit depends on confidence and confidence is the child of honesty.  If we can demonstrate that the farmers of this country can get seasonal loans to work their land and will repay them at the appointed time, provided that no Government will start a freak movement that will deprive them of their market when they have the produce ready for that market&mdash;provided they <Col N="2113" /> get a fair chance, I am quite satisfied that they will honour their bonds and, having done so, credit will creep once more into agriculture and after a couple of years you will have agriculture such an asset that a man can produce his land certificate in the bank and get his own accommodation, a thing he cannot do to-day.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion which appears on the Order Paper in the names of Deputy Nally and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil deplores the migration of the people from the land, and, being of opinion that one of the causes of this migration is the policy in operation over a number of years which finds expression in various statutes providing for differentiation in the treatment of similar classes of the population according as to whether they are resident in rural or non-rural areas, it hereby records its conviction that it is necessary, if the exodus from the land is to be slowed down, that every such statute, that so differentiates either directly or indirectly against the rural population, be amended at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the first part of this motion, at least, will meet with unanimous approval in the House and in the country.  Everybody deplores the migration of the people from the land.  They also deplore the overcrowding of the cities, and the slum problems and unemployment created in the cities by this migration.  Everybody, however, may not agree with what is suggested in the motion as the cause of that.  Therefore I propose to give, in as brief a manner as possible, my reasons for coming to the conclusion that the cause is due to legislation passed by this House.  This is not a Party motion in any sense.  Deputy Nally and myself did not put it before <Col N="2114" /> our Party.  We do not know what the attitude of the Party to it will be.  We recognise that the motion, by its very nature, cuts more or less across all Parties.  It is not a motion that any Party could very well take up, but we are of opinion that it would be much better if all Parties agreed to have a free vote on it.  Every member of the House should be free to vote on it as he thinks fit.  After all, the people in the country would like, once in a while on a motion of this kind, to have their will expressed through their elected representatives without any undue interference by the Party Whips.  In saying that, I am not speaking against the Party system.  I know the advantage of the Party system to the country, but at the same time a too rigid adherence to it is not a good thing, and hence people sometimes turn against Parliamentary representation altogether. It would be a good thing if, in a case like this, the members of all Parties were left free to vote as they think best.</P>
    <P>It is in a non-Party spirit that we, in this motion, are trying to find out some of the difficulties under which this country is labouring.  We are anxious that some good should come out of it. Everybody knows that there is something radically wrong in the economic structure of this State.  We maintain that is a real obstacle to any economic progress or any social progress in this State.  We hold that we cannot have the sort of country that we desire to have so long as there is differentiation, especially in favour of the people in the cities.  We all know how the welkin would ring in any discussion if it was some question of a minority in some part of Europe that was suffering persecution. We are not making an appeal here on behalf of any persecuted minority.  I am appealing on behalf of a persecuted majority, the great majority of the people of this country: on behalf of the flower of this State who are being driven from their homes by persecution, not by a foreign Government, but by their own Government of Dáil Eireann.  I am not attributing the blame to one Party or to another, but I maintain that Dáil Eireann is persecuting the majority of this State.  I say that if persecution <Col N="2115" /> equal to it was being carried out in any part of Europe, we would hear a great deal of criticism of it in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, I think a matter of such great importance should receive the attention that it deserves from the members of this House.  I know that statistics are very dry, and will give as little of them as I can help.  I must, however, refer to the population of the four county boroughs.  The figures that I propose to give are taken from the latest official publication.  In 1926 the population of the four county boroughs was 583,790, and in 1936, 657,682, an increase in the ten years of 12½ per cent. If we include the few urban towns that have a population of over 7,000&mdash;they are really very few&mdash;the figures are: for 1926, 706, 564, and for 1936, 792, 303, an increase of 12 per cent., practically the same as the figures for the county boroughs taken alone.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remainder of the country, that is, the rural districts, in 1926 there were 2,265,428 people there; in 1936 the population was 2,176,117. That is to say, while the four county boroughs increased in population by 12½ per cent. over the ten years, the population of the rest of the country decreased by 5¼ per cent.  That is the most deplorable part of the change. In 1926 about 31 per cent. of the population lived in the cities and towns of over 7,000 population, and 69 per cent. lived in the rural districts; in 1936 the percentage had changed to 36.5 for the cities and towns of over 7,000 population, and 63.5 for the rural areas. Since 1936 that trend has gone on&mdash;as everybody is too well aware&mdash;if not at an increasing rate, certainly at the same rate; and we may take it now as a rough estimate&mdash;I do not pretend to be accurate&mdash;at the present time that, in 1940, 40 per cent. of the people are living in cities and towns of over 7,000 population and 60 per cent. in the rural areas.  Taking the figures on the last ten or 14 years and estimating a continuation of that change, it is alarming to think of the position we will be in 14 or 20 years hence.  If the population of the cities increased while that of the rural areas decreased, <Col N="2116" /> it would not matter so much if the people in the cities were self-supporting, if we had not such a growing list of unemployed, if we had not the slums, if we had not the lately-started industries that are a burden on the rest of the community.  Unfortunately, all these things have to be considered.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote now some statistics to show the trend of employment and unemployment.  This is also an official publication giving the trend of employment and unemployment for the years 1937 and 1938.  It is a pity, of course, that we have not got them over a longer period, but we may take the period given as fairly typical of any other period&mdash;say, 1938-39 or 1939-40. These are for 1937-38, and the trend is briefly this: on the last Monday of November, 1937, the number of people on the live register for the four county boroughs was 24,920; in November, 1938, the number was 29,441 for the same four county boroughs&mdash;an increase of 18.1 per cent.  For the remainder of the country, the number on the live register had decreased within the same 12 months from 69,494 to 63,792&mdash;a decrease of 8.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Is it not remarkable to see people moving away from that part of the country where there was least unemployment to where unemployment is increasing at a rapid rate?  That is a most unhealthy condition to exist in any country&mdash;moving away from places where there might be no unemployment, where there is plenty of work to be done, where the land is overflowing with water, whin and briar, into the cities where the unemployment list is increasing, where the slum trouble, despite all that has been done for a number of years to relieve it by building&mdash;is growing worse from day to day and creating new problems for everybody who has the interest of the cities and of the country at heart.  Is it not evident that there is something very wrong, that there is something behind this that is inducing the people to leave the land and come to the cities?  Mind you, it is not for the grand, glaring lights, or the pictures, or anything of the sort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> The people are not fools: they are coming from the country to the cities to take advantage of the higher standard of living provided by Act of Parliament for the people in the cities.  They are entitled to do it, and this Dáil has no moral right to pass legislation to prevent their coming into the cities.  I do know, however, that there are organisations in the cities designed for no other purpose than to keep people from coming in from the country.  I say that this country is one country&mdash;Dublin and the rest of the country&mdash;and unless people wish to have another partition, or a new Pale, the people have the right to move to any part of their own country.  You cannot continue to keep this country partitioned as it is, in the way some of the organisations in the city are trying to keep it partitioned.  That cannot be done except by cutting it off altogether, which would mean that the source from which the taxation comes would be cut off also.  That would not do, that would not suit the city.</P>
    <P>Something must be done, and I suggest that the thing to do is to make equal laws for equal people and let everybody find his or her proper place in the economic structure in the city or in the country.  There is no other way. I know it is difficult for the Minister or anybody else with responsibility to face up to this, but it must be faced up to sooner or later, or the country is going to decay.  There is hardly any responsible Minister or responsible Deputy in this House who does not know that this thing is wrong and that it cannot continue.  We cannot have two standards of living in one small State for people of similar classes, on the sole test of whether they belong to the cities or to the rural parts of the country.  We are building an economic Tower of Pisa, something that cannot stand.  In the history of the world there never was a leaning tower built by the art of man: the leaning Tower of Pisa got a tilt after it was built.  It got a tilt by Nature: I suppose Nature just wanted to show that she could deviate from her own laws and yet defy human architects to follow her example.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I cannot think of anything <Col N="2118" /> else to which I might compare the economic structure which we are building here because we are building it with a lean, one side high and the other low, and the trend is such that more and more is going to the high side from the lower side.  The question is: how long will it stand?  We know but one thing: sooner or later a fall is due and the longer it stands the greater will be the fall.  The remedy is to get to work at once, to recognise the position, to get the foundation laid correctly, and to build soundly in this State.  I will come to the particular statutes that are the offending statutes, in my opinion.  There is quite a number of them, and they are divided into four categories.  In the first category are the statutes that provide benefits; in the second are those that fix scales of prices&mdash;those that fix the prices for different classes of commodities; in the third are those dealing with the incidence of taxation, and in the fourth are those which show a general lack of sympathy with people in rural districts.  It is easy to find scores of businesses where this is noticeable.  I will deal first with those providing benefits, although I do not think they are the most important. Take, for instance, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  Part III of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act deals with the payment of non-contributory pensions to widows and orphans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to the city, too, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to Sections 16, 17 and 20, and the First Schedule.  I would call particular attention to the provision of those sections. Those sections are so worded that it would take somebody like the Minister to get any meaning out of them.  The average man, the ordinary Deputy. would hardly get any meaning out of them, and it would take a trained lawyer to get very much sense out of them. However, there is one way by which one may get to the bottom even of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act. and that is by working out what two widows, having exactly equal means, <Col N="2119" /> would get, taking it that one lives in the city and one in the country.  I worked this out in seven cases.  They may or may not be typical, but I will just give the particular cases I took. In the case of a widow with no child, and with an income of 5/-, if she lived in a county borough she would get 7/6. If she lived in a rural district she would get 3/-.  That is under the operation of Sections 16 and 20, and the third rule of the First Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is under the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is under the application of the allowance for each set of widows.  Then we will take the case of a widow with one child, with an estimated income of 7/6.  If she lived in a county borough she would get 11/-, and if she lived in a rural district she would get 4/6.  A widow with two children, with an estimated income of 10/-, gets 12/6, if she lives in a county borough, and she gets 5/- if she lives in a rural district.  A widow with three children, with an estimated income of 12/6, would get 14/- if she lived in a county borough.  She would get 5/6 if she lived in a rural district.  To get back again to the widow with two children and an income of 12/6, if she lived in a county borough she would get 10/-, and if she lived in a rural district she would get 2/6.  A widow with one child, and with an income of 12/6, would get 6/- if she lived in the city, and if she lived in a rural district she would get nothing.  A widow with one child and an income of 10/- would get 8/6 if she lived in a county borough, and if she lived in a rural district she would get 2/-.  On summing up the seven cases, I found that those seven widows would draw 69/6 if they happened to be living in the city, while the seven widows in the rural districts would draw 22/6, or less than one-third.  It would be very interesting to see what justification there is for that.  That may or may not be typical.  There may be other statutes concerned with the payment of benefits that are worse than this one. Personally, I did not believe there was, but I can quote a very good authority, the <i>Irish Press</i>, which says there is a <Col N="2120" /> worse one.  The Unemployment Assistance Act is a worse one according to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I do not want to enter into an argument.  I quite accept the opinion of the <i>Irish Press</i>; if it says so, it must be so.</P>
      <P>I will not waste time by giving more than one statute from the category dealing with the payment of benefits. Before I pass from it, I should like to mention that I was speaking to a very able man, an eminent lawyer, and I asked his opinion about that particular statute.  He looked into it and he said: &ldquo;Well, it reminds me of a case I had in court very lately.  I was defending a trader down the country who was taken up by the Guards for having a measure with two bottoms.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I asked: &ldquo;What sort of defence had you then?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Our defence was that the measure was made by the same tradesman that made every other measure he had, and they were all correct, and that he did not order two bottoms for this measure any more than for the others.&rdquo;  He told me that the judge got a brain-wave and sent for the man who made the measure.  When he came into court the judge asked him did he make this measure.  He said: &ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;&ldquo;And were you ordered to put two bottoms in this measure?&rdquo;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&ldquo;Then, why did you do it?  Be careful about your answer.  It depends on your answer whether you will go into the dock.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well, I was told to make a half-gallon measure that would hold one and a-half quarts, and if your lordship can show me a better way to do it than the way I have done it, then you are a better technician than I am, and I will exchange my budget for your wig.&rdquo; He was not put into the dock.  The lawyer turned round and said to me: &ldquo;My advice to you is to take this measure back to the people that made it, that is, Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  Here I am. I would like to know what they have to say to that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the measure, but just before I get away from it I would like to know who ordered it.  I have here the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Widows' and Orphans' Pensions. It seems that there was a careful investigation <Col N="2121" /> into the whole question before this measure was passed.  I find that there were on that Committee 14 persons.  Twelve of them issued a Majority Report and they favoured a flat rate.  Two of them issued a First Minority Report, and one issued a Second Minority Report.  Strange to say, the report of the 12 was turned down, the report of the two was turned down, and there was only one man out of the 14 whose recommendations were accepted.  That, I believe, too, might require some explanation. I want to be brief.  We cannot lose too much time, but this is very important. He gave some reasons here why the widows in the city should get about three times as much as those in the rural districts.  He says: &ldquo;To attempt to measure the farm widow's advantage over the Dublin widow, if each gets a pension of 21/- per week, I attempt a weekly budget for each as follows:&mdash; Milk, butter, potatoes, eggs and other Irish farm produce, 6/- for the Dublin widow and 2/6 for the farm widow.&rdquo;  I would ask the House to take in the significance of this&mdash;2/6 for producing 2/6 worth of farm produce, and 3/6 added to that for selling it in Dublin, making 6/-.</P>
    <P>That is the way the dice is loaded against the people on the land.  That is the Dublin mentality for you every time, and that is the city against the country; why the people are flying from the land because they are persecuted and driven off.  Dáil Eireann sanctioned that.  I would like to know what Dáil Eireann has to say to it.  Bread is another item.  Bread is given at 4/- for the Dublin widow and 2/- for the woman on the land.  No woman on the land can get a sack of flour at half the price obtaining here in Dublin.  It is manufactured here in Dublin.  We all know that the unfortunate woman on the land has to buy her flour at a dearer price and yet she is supposed to produce bread at half the price.  This is here in print.  This is the report of one man against 14. This is the report the Act was based upon.  Other food including tea and sugar is given at 5/- for each. There is no difference.  I am quoting from page 53 of the Report of the <Col N="2122" /> Committee of Inquiry into Widows' and Orphans' Pensions, 1933.  Rent, fuel, light, clothes, boots and other requirements are included in the estimate. Rent is given at 5/- in the city and 1/- in the rural district.  It seems they can live in a hole in the ditch in the rural district.  What is rent for?  I would ask the House why is rent imposed upon anybody who goes into a house?  Of course, one of the things is to pay for the workmanship that goes into that house, to pay for the capital over a number of years that has gone into it.  Can anyone believe that a house can be built in the country at one-fifth of what it costs here in the city and if it can, why should it be so?  It would be a very interesting thing to get a reply. It is very important that these items should be answered.  So long as this Act was based upon the recommendation of that individual&mdash;his name is Mr. Herlihy&mdash;these things must be answered.  Five shillings for rent in the city and 1/- in the country.  I do not know how it can be done.  Fuel and light&mdash;2/6 in the city and 1/- in the country, yet coal passes through the city and goes to the country, and coal is burnt in a good many parts of the country.  I do not see how in the country they can get everything at one-half, one-third, or one-fifth of the Dublin price.  Clothes and boots are given at 2/6 in each case.  Other requirements, 2/-.  Balance in favour of farm widow&mdash;11/-.  That is the calculation.</P>
    <P>I have cuttings here dealing with the costs in Dublin which perhaps would be interesting.  They might go some part of the way to explain why bread should be twice as dear here as in the rural districts.  This is a cutting from a paper.  The writer signs himself &ldquo;Puzzled&rdquo;.  It is just an item which shows the different output of bread here and in other cities.  There is a lower output in Dublin, and higher wages of bakers' operatives.  The Dublin baker works 13 sacks per man per week as against 32 in Glasgow and 36 in London.  The man that wrote this said that the whole blame should not be put on the millers for the increased price of bread.  So far as the <Col N="2123" /> figures are concerned, that explains why things are so dear here.  The other cutting is dated December 3, 1938.  It is signed by &ldquo;A. McCabe&rdquo;. It is a cutting from the <i>Irish Independent.</i> It deals with housing costs in the city.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Comparative figures of rents charged for certain similar types of houses here and in Belfast show the crushing nature of the handicap under which this class of people have to carry on in this dear city of ours. Here they are as taken from representative lists supplied by house agents in the two cities with the rents demanded in each case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There follows a table showing that in Dublin a house with five apartments was let at £90, while a similar house in Belfast was let at £52.  A house of six apartments was let at £104 in Dublin and £65 in Belfast.  Another house of six apartments, let at £108 in Dublin, was let at £60 in Belfast, and a house with seven apartments, £80 and taxes in Dublin against £36 and taxes in Belfast.  Detached villas would be £110 and taxes in Dublin, and £60 and taxes in Belfast.  On the average the rent is 80 per cent. dearer in Dublin than in Belfast.  What explanation is to be given for that?  If people have made things dearer for themselves here in Dublin they should bear the consequences themselves, and that should not be approved by legislation in this House.  If Dublin people have made the cost of living so dear for themselves, there is no reason why that should be taken as the normal condition of affairs or why it should have the sanction of this House.  Dáil Eireann should not sanction it.  If the Dáil were held in Athlone or in Galway, I do not suppose that the things which are being sanctioned now in Dublin would be sanctioned in either of these towns.  The Dáil is too much influenced by Dublin.</P>
    <P>With regard to bread, that is one of the items referred to by the gentleman who recommended this Bill for Widows and Orphans.  That is one of the items upon which the financial provisions of the Bill are based.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> I know that bread used to be brought up from Belfast and sold in my neighbourhood, bread of first-class quality, at a price cheaper than that at which it could be baked at home Yet we are told by this gentleman that it costs twice as much in Dublin.  Bread baked in Belfast could be sent to my neighbourhood, carriage and all delivery expenses met, and sold at a lower price than home baked bread would cost.  That was the state of affairs in that district until the Border intervened.  Why should that bread be twice as dear in Dublin?  Yet this House sanctions that and passed a Bill based on that report.</P>
    <P>I pass on to the next category.  The next category refers to the prices for different classes of goods, according as to whether they are produced in the city or the country.  The general classes are agricultural produce and manufactured commodities.  We all know the position.  Agricultural produce is sold at the world price minus certain reductions, minus, for instance, the cost of transporting it to the world market, minus 3/6 per cwt. in the case of cattle&mdash;I think that is the figure&mdash;and other deductions, such as insurance costs, middlemen's costs and all these other costs.  Against that, manufactured goods are sold here in many cases at 75 per cent. over world prices, plus the cost of shipping them from other manufacturing countries to be sold in this country because our manufacturers or at least any of those who have to be propped up with tariffs are not able to send anything out of the country to compete on foreign markets against outside competitors.  They are competing in the home market against foreign competitors who have to bear not alone the burden of shipping their goods to this country but have to face, in addition, a tariff of 75 per cent. in a number of cases.  The average tariff, I think, would be about 50 per cent.  That is the way prices are fixed in regard to one class of goods as against another.  If the relative position of the two classes were worked out, it would be seen that the industrial producer receives a number of other advantages. The farmer has to sell some of his produce at 20 per cent. less than the <Col N="2125" /> world price, that is after allowing say 20 per cent. freight and other charges for exporting his goods to the world market in Britain.  For every £100 worth of goods, based on world prices, which the farmer sends there, he receives here only £80.  The manufacturer, on the other hand, receives here at home £200 for a quantity of goods that would be worth only £100 according to world market prices.  As against the farmer's £80 the manufacturer receives £200&mdash;that is 50 per cent. of an advantage in the fixing of prices.  I may not be putting the case very well but the figures will stand investigation. The position, as I say, is that one gets 250 per cent. of the value of his goods while the other gets only 80 per cent. That is the broad rule.</P>
    <P>I know we shall be told that the farmers have got certain advantages, that, for instance, the annuities have been halved.  I give credit for that, but since the annuities were halved, the rates have been increased to such an extent as to offset that concession. Their position, therefore, is exactly the same as it was before the annuities were halved.  There are hardly any changes in that respect, so far as overhead charges are concerned.  I shall take another case which explains itself. Let us take the average farmer and compare his position with that of the civil servant.  Let us assume that before the last Great War each of them had an income of £100.  The farmer's position at present is this: there has been an increase of 15 to 20 points in the price of farm goods as compared with 1914.  On the other hand, the farmer has had to face an increase in the cost of production of more than 100 per cent.  If there had been only the same increase in the cost of production as occurred in the price of agricultural goods, then the farmer would find himself enjoying about the same net income as he had in 1913 or 1914, but as matters stand, his net income is reduced by about 80 or 90 per cent. by the increased production costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And he does not get a corresponding return when he sells his produce.</P>

    <Col N="2126" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I make it out that the net income of a farmer who had £100 pre-war would be about £45 now.  Take the case of a civil servant who had the same income of £100 in 1914.  He would be getting about £170 now, the addition representing bonus to cover the increased cost of living, which has gone up about 70 per cent. The position of the farmer is that if he had £100 of an income pre-war, he is only drawing £45 now, while the other man is drawing £170.  The figures are not an exaggeration, and any Minister or Deputy who troubles to make a calculation will find that that is the position. In some cases the variation is even greater.  There are people, other than civil servants, who are much better off now than they were in pre-war days.  It is all very well for certain classes of the community to say: &ldquo;We want this or we want that, or we want more generous expenditure on different schemes.&rdquo;  When it comes to paying, the burden is shifted to other shoulders.  Unfortunately, people who live on the land cannot shift the burden.  When there is extravagant expenditure it is the people on the land who suffer.  No attempt is made to deal with their position in a sympathetic spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister for Agriculture is in the House, because it is his duty, above that of any other Minister, to consider the position of people on the land.  I hope that he will pay attention to their plight, because the people on the land are suffering severely, and are being driven from the land because of legislation passed in this House.  It is about time that the situation was faced seriously.  To do that requires more than the talks that are given occasionally by eminent lecturers.  While it is a good thing that these lecturers call attention to the position, the Minister should not let what they say in one ear and out the other.  The Minister will recall that a year ago the bishops called attention to this problem, and in the meantime we know that it has not improved.  If anything, it has continued to worsen.  Unless conditions are changed and not allowed to drift undoubtedly they will tend to worsen-Something <Col N="2127" /> must be done or else present conditions will lead to a complete economic collapse as well as social collapse.</P>
    <P>The third category deals with the incidence of rates, a question which has been very much debated from time to time.  There are two classes of taxation, that might be termed indirect and direct taxation.  With regard to indirect taxation, the bigger the family the heavier is the tax, because as a general rule the bulk of the indirect taxation is collected on the necessaries of life and accordingly the larger families pay more.  While it may not be so in all cases, broadly speaking the largest families are in the rural districts.  There are two classes of direct taxation, income-tax and another tax that goes under the name of rates on land.  Rates on land are nothing less than a special sort of income-tax designed to fleece farmers, inasmuch as they are levied upon the estimated income arising out of land.  No equivalent tax is imposed upon any other class in this State or upon farmers in any other country.  In Northern Ireland and Great Britain the farmers are relieved of this heavy burden and anxiety, yet we have to compete with them in the same market.  Of course they pay their rates the same as everyone else upon the valuation of their dwellings.  The position there is certainly much fairer than it is here, where a tax is imposed upon a man's estimated income out of land.  The farmer also pays the income-tax if his income warrants it.  In the case of this tax a living allowance is exempted from taxation, but in the case of rates of a farmer no allowance is made.  If a widow with a family of ten children has a valuation of 30/- on land she will have to pay on that valuation or on the estimated income from it no matter how high the rates are. There is no equity in that form of taxation.</P>
    <P>Here again, as in every other item to which I referred, it is against the people on the land that taxation is directed.  Because of that they are flying from the land.  They do not come to the city to walk about and see <Col N="2128" /> the beautiful buildings.  They come expecting to improve their position and to avail of the higher standard of living that is provided for everyone as compared with the position in the country, and they will continue to come until the position is changed.  The last category that I wish to refer to concerns the general lack of sympathy with the position of people in the country.  We have summer time in February.  Why?  Does anybody in the country want this new time now?  Not at all.  Of course it does not matter what people in the country want.  It is people in the city who have too much time on their hands, and too much money to spend, who want this new time in order to have longer evenings and more leisure.  They cannot take these evenings without having everything convenient, and every clock in the country must be moved on in order that they may get long evenings, and in order that they may deceive themselves that they are getting up a little earlier. They never do get up early.  They do not open the shops so very early here, and there would be a day's work done in Derry and Belfast by the time they open the shops in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Why do they want summer time at all?  They want it so that they may get away to spend their easily earned money, the money which is being collected from the unfortunate workers down the country, and which is spent here and spent badly.  That is the position, and that is why the children have to be put to bed against the laws of nature, and packed out without being able to take their breakfasts in the morning.  Everything being done on the farm is against nature, and all for the accommodation of a couple of cities.  If that is the position while the people still have a majority in the country, what is going to happen when, after a few years, the cities get the majority?  We would all wish to see the cities growing and thriving, if they were living upon themselves, if they were self-supporting, but suppose Dublin were lifted and planted in Great Britain, in Belgium, in the United States or in Germany, what would happen?  Every portion of it except <Col N="2129" /> those portions which stood through thick and thin and which were able to produce and carry on at all times without any aid, would melt like a snowball, and those portions which have sprung up lately and which have begun to have a little false life would fall back to their old position.</P>
    <P>They would not have the Twenty-Six Counties as a potato garden to sustain them.  No, they would completely fall away, and I ask the House to consider whether this country should give the cities this privileged position which they have enjoyed for the last few years and which is leading the country as fast as it can to ruin and disorder of every kind.</P>
    <P>In the national schools, you will find the same lack of sympathy.  There is no agricultural outlook there, and it is all a matter of educating the people for something else and trying to divert their minds from the land.  Everything is done with complete disregard for the interests of agriculture and of the people who live by the land, and it is about time it was all changed.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a statement by a representative of these new industries in <i>Irish Industry</i>, a paper which represents Irish industry.  There is an article which wants to reduce even what the farmers are getting now, and I do not know whether the Minister will listen to it.  I know that Ministers have listened to too much advice from this and similar sources.  I will read one paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We notice a disposition on the part of some meetings of farmers to agitate for what they call a free market for agricultural produce.  We do not know the exact meaning they may attribute to the phrase, but in the context in which it is used it carries an implication of a desire to export as much as possible, even the whole of the agricultural produce of this country.  The reason for this is that in many, if not all, cases they can get a higher price now on the foreign market than on the home market.  In our view, that is a position which must not be allowed to develop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2130" /> The farmer is to be deprived now, if these industries can do it, of even the reduced value of the world market price, minus the cost of shipping to Great Britain, although they are to get 75 per cent. over the world market price, plus the cost of their competitors' shipping costs to sell against them; in other words, they are to get £250 where the Irish farmer gets £80, and he is not to get even that, if they can have their way.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister will be too much inclined to listen to that, but it is time the tide was turned and that the people who are the real producers got a chance to live in their own country and got fair play.  They do not deserve fair play if they are not able to insist on getting it, and I appeal to all Deputies, no matter what Party they belong to, if they come from the rural districts, to stand for justice for those rural districts irrespective of Party.  It is their duty and they should not vote against a motion like this which is designed to save the unfortunate people who are the flower of this country, who are the backbone of this country and who are sustaining the country and keeping the cities going.  They are the backbone of the country nationally, economically and in every other way, and they deserve to get fair play.  All I ask is that fair play be given to them and that the Minister and every Deputy will give fair consideration to the matters dealt with in the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion, I must say that I do not entirely agree with the wording of it. I think it is not entirely legislation passed here but also the failure of this House to legislate with regard to agricultural matters which has led to the serious position of agriculture at present.  I do not think Deputy McGovern strengthened the case for the motion by relying so much on the difference between the allowances paid to widows in the city and in the <Col N="2131" /> country.  If it were only the widows who were migrating from rural Ireland to the cities, we would not have so much to complain about.  The unfortunate thing is that it is the young, the boys and girls leaving the national schools, who are crowding into the cities and it is the loss of those young people to rural Ireland which is turning this nation into a nation of tombs and desolation at present.  I happened to be in the national school where I was educated, or supposed to be educated, a short time ago, and I could not help noticing the number of children on the roll.  When I first started to go to school the number on the roll was 166. The number on the roll to-day in that rural parish is 38.  That is a remarkable decline.  There may not be as great a decline in every country parish, but there is no doubt that there is a very serious decline in population and in the number of children attending schools in the rural areas.  Unless something is done and done quickly to remedy that state of affairs there is absolutely no future before this country because, of course, as every Deputy realises, the entire strength and life of the nation depends on its rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be asked, what would this House do to remedy the situation, what is really wrong with the economic position of this country?  If we compare the conditions which prevailed in 1914 with those of the present day, we find that the condition of the rural population has deteriorated to an enormous extent.  We know that for every £100 that a farmer got for his produce in 1914 he was getting less than £100 in the average year since 1931&mdash;the price of his produce was less than in 1914.  At the same time, we know that the cost of production in rural Ireland, in common with the cost of living everywhere in Ireland, has increased at least 100 per cent.  What, therefore, is the position?  The farmer has to exist on the margin between what he gets for his produce and what it costs to produce it.  The cost of production has increased by 100 per cent.  The price <Col N="2132" /> of agricultural produce during the past ten years has been practically the same as in 1914, if we take the average year. Therefore, it means that the farmer is working definitely at a loss.  Farmers' sons and daughters after leaving the national school, realising the position that lies before them if they take up work on the land and the hopeless position in which their parents are trying to exist, realising the impossibility of making ends meet, see no prospect before them but to crowd into the cities and towns or to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the average standard of living in the towns or in the cities is very much higher than in rural Ireland.  But I do hold that a boy or a girl coming from a rural district into a city or town can always earn a much higher income than in rural Ireland.  That is, of course, due to the fact that boys and girls reared in the country are usually physically strong and healthy and active in mind and, therefore, are able to compete with the workers in the city, and as a result very often crowd these workers out of employment, so that many of the city-born workers are left on the dole enduring a low standard of living.  That position can only be remedied by removing the threat of poverty which hangs over the entire rural population.</P>
    <P>The wages of agricultural workers have been fixed at a fairly reasonable standard.  But the position at present is that the average farmer is unable to pay that wage, with the result that an increasing number of agricultural workers are finding themselves unemployed. They are finding themselves on the unemployed register, drawing the dole, or performing the menial tasks offered to them by the labour exchanges. That is a hopeless prospect both for the sons and daughters of the farmers and for the agricultural workers.  As long as there is no other prospect, we cannot hope that there will be any stay put to the migration of the rural populations to the cities.</P>
    <P>It may be asked, how is the position to be remedied?  First of all, we must seek to improve the position of the <Col N="2133" /> agricultural industry by ensuring those engaged in the industry a reasonable price for their produce, and by reducing the overhead charges upon the industry. The overhead charges include direct and indirect taxation and the prices which the agricultural producer has to pay for the manufactured goods which he requires.  The cost of these requirements must be reduced.  In one way it has been clearly demonstrated that there is a certain hostility among the ruling classes of this country to agriculture and that is in regard to the attitude taken up on the question of the abolition of rates on agricultural land.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be speaking to a motion such as he would desire.  He must, however, address himself to the motion before the House, and he must keep within the terms of that motion.  The effective portion of that motion is that any statute &ldquo;that differentiates either directly or indirectly against the rural population&rdquo; should be amended.  A debate on derating would be quite out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply pointing out that there is a certain hostility to any viewpoint put up by the rural population and that that hostility amongst the ruling classes has resulted in a failure to meet the reasonable demands of the agricultural community.  It has been suggested, and it may be a wise suggestion, that the Parliament should be moved out into the heart of the country with the result that all the civil servants would be living there.  To a certain extent that might lead to a stay in the migration of the rural population to the city.  It might lead to a position in which there would not be such an enormous expenditure of public money within the city and a correspondingly greater expenditure of public money in rural areas My chief objection to the legislation that has been passed is not so much the difference between the allowances and payments to people in the cities as compared with the country, but to the ever-increasing burden of taxation which is being raised mainly from the rural <Col N="2134" /> population and spent mainly in the cities and large towns.  Take any particular statute that has been passed since the establishment of this State, and we find that while its intention may be to develop the tourist industry or to develop the agricultural industry or any other branch of industry, its main feature is found in the fact that it costs a considerable amount of money and necessitates a considerable number of civil servants to administer it.  As these civil servants have their headquarters here in the City of Dublin, the expenditure incurred is mainly spent within this city.  The result is that the rural community is being drained of a certain amount of money&mdash;indeed of an ever-increasing amount of money to maintain the ever-increasing army of civil servants within the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is the first question that will have to be tackled&mdash;the question of amending legislation in such a way as will reduce the expenses of implementing and administering such legislation.  Then, having improved the condition of the agricultural industry so as to provide a proper living for those engaged in that industry and to provide also increased employment for the workers in rural Ireland, it would also be necessary to amend the various statutes with regard to education so as to provide that the rural population shall receive an education which will qualify them to live in the country.  A few years ago we had legislation setting up vocational schools throughout the length and breadth of this country. Now we find that the result of these vocational educational schools has been to draw the young people more than ever from the land.  We find the country girls, the daughters of farmers and the daughters of agricultural labourers learning shorthand and typewriting at the expense of the taxpayers. This is going on in the rural towns and villages.  What will be the result of such education?  The plain result will be to force these girls to seek employment in Government offices or in commercial firms in the cities. That is not the kind of education that is needed for rural Ireland.  If we are to have public money spent on vocational <Col N="2135" /> education in rural Ireland it should be spent upon such vocational education as will encourage and enable the young boys and girls to become efficient workers on the land.</P>
    <P>It may be asked how can this be done in vocational schools?  I believe there is only a limited scope in the ordinary educational school for the carrying out of this work.  I believe another type of school will be necessary in order to provide the sort of agricultural education necessary&mdash;and that is residential agricultural schools which will be nothing more or less than model farms where boys would be taught the most modern and efficient methods of farming.  Such schools should not cost an enormous amount of money to the taxpayers.  The first aim of the promoters of such education should be to make the schools, as far as possible, self-supporting, and to insure that the boys educated in them are trained in the art of farming.  It should be possible to make these schools to a great extent almost completely economic.  That can be done.  Unfortunately it is not being done.</P>
    <P>We have the same position with regard to the girls.  There should be a greater effort made to teach domestic economy and subjects suitable for people who are going to live in rural Ireland rather than teaching those purely commercial subjects which will only have the effect of giving the young people a bias towards leaving the land. These are just a few of the ways in which legislation can be amended to stop, or at least to curb to some extent the migration of our young people from the land.  If we had taxation reduced, <Col N="2136" /> the terrible drain upon the population in the rural areas would be lessened. Remember that the farmer and the agricultural workers are just the one section of the community who cannot pass on the burden of taxation to any other section.  If a business man in a city or town is heavily taxed, he can always pass the burden on to his customers.  If the farmer were free to pay whatever wages he liked, he might be able to pass some of his burden on to the agricultural labourer. But that would hardly be a fair attitude to take up.  However, his position at present is that there is absolutely no one to whom he can pass on this burden.  He has to bear that burden completely himself.  He is unable to pass it on to his customers, because the price which he obtains for his produce is controlled by world prices in the fixing of which the farmer has no voice whatever.  It should, therefore, be our duty to see that the burden of direct and indirect taxation is reduced so that the strain on the agricultural community may be lightened.  Incidentally, it is also our duty to see that legislation is amended in such a way as to ensure that the burden of taxation will be distributed fairly over all sections of the community and not piled up crushingly on the weaker and poorer sections of the people&mdash;that is the rural population. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
