    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will make available to the Monaghan County Council the terms of his inspector's report on the administration of the Monaghan Board of Health and Public Assistance, and if he will state on what grounds he justifies the abolition of that body and the handing over of its functions to a commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make the inspector's report available to the Monaghan County Council.  As regards the latter part of the question, I was satisfied that the duties of the board of health and public assistance were not being duly and effectively discharged by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, Sir, is it not reasonable, in view of the evidence published in the papers, which disclosed no cause whatever for the dissolution of this body, that if the Minister has any confidential information which the public were not given with regard to this matter, some steps should be taken to communicate that information to the members of the county council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's interpretation, or rather his reading, of the evidence that was produced. I think that sufficient evidence was produced there to disclose a condition of affairs that made it quite clear to anybody that the duties of the Monaghan Board of Health and <Col N="504" /> Public Assistance were not being effectively discharged.  As regards inspectors' reports of these inquiries, these are privileged documents and the practice is that they are not disclosed, and have not been disclosed at any time, except to the Minister for his information so as to enable him to take any action that may be considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister point out any single portion or item of the evidence wherein he could justify the wiping out of an elected body which, in the normal course of events, would have ceased to function when the elections take place?  What has the Minister to say to justify that action, and can he point to any single item of evidence that would justify it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to specify any particular piece of evidence, but if the Deputy saw the auditor's report and the report of the county medical officer or health, and if he had been reading&mdash;as I say, I do not want to specify any particular item now&mdash;of the conduct of business by the board of health over a long period, I think he would find sufficient evidence to justify the action that has been taken.  I would remind the Deputy also that a member of his own Party and a member of the Seanad, on the 1st of May last, referred to it as being an outstanding example of maladministration in public affairs.  I do not know whether the Deputy disputes that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Most emphatically.  Does the Minister know that in the County Monaghan and surrounding districts the popular belief held by the vast majority of the people supporting both his own Party and ours is that the Monaghan Board of Health and Public assistance was wiped out because it would not fall in with the improper requirements of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, and that the Parliamentary Secretary sought to use that body as a political instrument in the county and, when the members would not bow to his will, it was wiped out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="505" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation whatever for that, none whatever. I have not discussed these matters with the Parliamentary Secretary, nor have I even discussed this case with him. The mutters have come to me directly with regard to the board&mdash;that they repeatedly refused to carry out the lawful orders of the Department.  I do not want to specify particular items, but the Deputy must be aware that very serious matters have arisen there from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny it absolutely.  I have asked the Minister to point out any single item of evidence on which he could justly found a reason for the abolition of that body, and the Minister has failed to do so.  I ask leave, Sir, to raise this matter on the adjournment so that the evidence in this case can be examined by the House with a view to finding out whether this action was taken for a proper motive or for an improper motive because of a single individual who sought to use that body for his own political ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health why the grant of £2,500 allotted to Fermoy Urban District Council was transferred to Cork County Council, and if, in view of the large amount of anemploymenfc in that town, he will have his grant transferred to the original grantee or another grant allotted in its stead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of road works submitted by the Fermoy Urban District Courcil as not regarded as essential, and as there were other suitable road works in the vicinity of the town of a more useful character the allocation was accordingly transferred to the Cork County Council for road works in or adjacent to thr urban district. The transfer of the allocation <Col N="506" /> is subject to the condition that labour will be recruited from the urban panel, and does not, therefore, affect the unemployed resident in the urban district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that on poor holdings the tenants are not able to carry out repairs of this sort?  On many farmsteads the dwelling houses and out-offices are in a bad condition.  It would be a gieat benefit if the scheme could be extended to cover such holdings, and besides being a profitable source of employment, it would be of great benefit to agriculturists generally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that there are 800 children being deprived of education in North Crumlin, due to the fact that there is insufficient school accommodation in their district; and if he will state the cause of the failure to sanction the proposals of the manager, who has provided and paid for a suitable site in the district; if further, pending the building of the new schools, which will take two years to complete, he will sanction the resumption of the special bus service to the city schools, which have ample accommodation, thus providing much-needed employment for a number of teachers who are at present unemployed.</P>

      <P>As Indicated in my reply to a question on this subject by Deputy Doyle yesterday the information before my Department shows that there is available accommodation in schools in the neighbourhood for children between six and 14 years of age who are not attending school at present.  I am not prepared to arrange for bus transport in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>My Department has acted in cooperation with the manager in the matter of the provision of new schools. Their construction is being undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works, who have invited tenders for the work.</P>

I wish to point out that in Inchicore, which is convenient to the North Crumlin area, where the complaints arise, all the schools are overcrowded, and there are hundreds of children running about the streets day after day, doing things that are of no advantage to themselves or to the citizens.  As it is a source of serious complaint the matter should receive sympathetic consideration from the Department.</P>

      <P>The Programme of Instruction (1926, page 21) and the Rules and Regulations for National Schools (Rules 95 and 125) lay special emphasis on the fact that the character training of the pupils is the primary duty of a teacher.  Character training is not a subject of instruction on a time basis, but is to be treated in the manner which experience shows is productive of the best results, that is, by the inculcation of the moral and civic virtues in connection with all the work of the school.  Rule 125 (2) summarises what is expected in this connection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In forming an estimate of the value of the professional work of a teacher, the inspector should keep constantly before his mind the extent to which the education given has contributed to the formation of character, the training in good habits, the development of the pupils' intelligence, the strengthening of the sense of personal and national self-respect and generally the preparation of the pupils to take their place as good and useful citizens of their country.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In case the Taoiseach should contemplate moving from his place, I should like to raise a matter on which it appears to me I have ground for complaint, before he leaves the House.  The question of this resolution was raised last night at the Taoiseach's instance, as he desired to be informed of the probable ambit of the debate.  That was a courtesy that we were very glad to extend to the Taoiseach, through his messenger, and we held ourselves at his disposal if he wished to have any further information; and we were informed that he did not.  I must say that he expressed his willing readiness to see us if we desired to discuss the matter with him.  The Taoiseach questioned on that occasion the expediency of raising matters relating to international politics in connection with the terms of the motion here set down.  On those representations we accepted that view and further informed him that, if anything transpired between then and 3 o'clock to-day which would lead us to change our view with regard to the matter, we <Col N="519" /> would inform him without delay so that he might take such steps as he thought fit.  At ten minutes past three to-day I was informed that the Taoiseach had handed out notice to the Press that he would make an important statement to-day.  I communicated at once with his Party and was informed that they knew nothing about it.</P>
      <P>I was subsequently informed by the courtesy of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that the Taoiseach did propose to intervene in the debate at 6 o'clock, and to deal with the very important matters which he requested us not to deal with last night.  Now, I fully understand that the Taoiseach may have had to change his mind between last night and to-day, but I think ordinary courtesy would have suggested, in that event, that he would have informed us at the earliest possible moment instead of requesting us to abstain from touching on such matters, and then informing the Press that he intended to deal with them exhaustively, without even bothering to acquaint the Leader of the Opposition or any one on this side of the House of the change in his intentions.  I do not wish to misrepresent the Taoiseach in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would have been another way of dealing with this particular matter.  However, as it has been raised in this particular way, I have to inform the House that I did last night, in view of the situation as I saw it, ask that members of the Opposition should be asked whether it was in the public interest that this debate should go on in as much as from its very nature it was bound to raise certain questions, and raise them perhaps in a way in which it might not be in the public interest at the moment that they should be raised.  The request that ths debate from that point of view should be considered and, possibly, put off was met by the view that on the whole it was better that the debate should go on.  I accepted that view, and, if I am to intervene in this debate, I think it is in the public interest that I should speak.  I cannot, as head of the Government, keep silent at <Col N="520" /> a time like this.  If this debate did not occur at all, and was not proposed at all, I would have to seek an early occasion to speak on the matter.  I think there is no discourtesy to any one.  Certainly, none was intended. If, in a debate of this character, I intervene, it is obvious that I will have to deal with the question fairly fully. Now, this is not a time for petty questions of courtesy or discourtesy.  It is a question for this House to realise that we may be facing a very serious crisis, and that it is right that I, as head of the Government, should take the first occasion to inform the public of the position as I see it.  I think the matter should have been considered sufficiently seriously by the Deputies on the opposite benches, and if they wished to raise this matter they could have made representations privately to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At five minutes past 3 o'clock the Taoiseach was sitting in the front bench.  Perhaps the Taoiseach is not aware of the fact that I was asked whether we here to-day would act on the honourable understanding with the Taoiseach that certain matters would not be raised.  I was informed half way through Question Time, when the Taoiseach was sitting opposite to me, that the Chief Government Whip wanted to see me behind the Speaker's Chair.  I went out and saw him and was informed ten minutes after I came into the House that the situation was changed.  No one here challenges the right of the Taoiseach to speak on any matter that he thinks it right to speak on.  But, surely to God, we are entitled to say: If you specifically ask us not to touch on certain matters for reasons of high policy, and we say &ldquo;very well,&rdquo; and if you change your mind as you have a perfect right to do&mdash;something may have turned up to make you change your mind&mdash;then, at least you ought not to let us embark upon a debate without saying: &ldquo;I am sorry that in the altered circumstances I must touch on those matters, and I give you back your freedom to speak freely&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There must have been a misunderstanding, because I was not aware that the Deputies were <Col N="521" /> asked definitely to refrain from touching on international affairs.  My anxiety was that the debate should not go on, inasmuch as it might lead to a considerable misunderstanding and possibly do harm.  But, when the debate was to go on, then the members on the opposite side would have to use their own discretion as to how they should deal with it.  I certainly did not undertake directly or indirectly&mdash;as far as I know there was no undertaking&mdash;that we on this side should not deal with a matter which is of such importance to the public at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that if economic collapse is to be avoided, effective steps to dispose of our agricultural surplus production must be taken forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down for grave reasons.  It is perfectly true, as the Taoiseach says, that there rests upon every public man in this country a very special responsibility to measure his language and to approach matters of vital national interest not from the Party view but from the point of view of the nation as a whole, to utter his criticisms not for the purpose of securing Party advantage, but rather for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of mistakes, and of strengthening the hands of the Executive to do what may be necessary in the national interest.  To date, looking back on the months that have passed since the Taoiseach first appealed for forbear ance and support in a time of unexampled crisis, I cannot charge myself or any of my colleagues with an act or a word that has been designed to embarrass the Taoiseach or his Government in carrying on the delicate affairs of State that he has to deal with.  On the contrary, it seems to me as it seems, I think, to many of our friends, that we have sacrificed a substantial part of the political vitality of our movement in the endeavour to allay, for this period, political recrimination in the country.  I think we have. If we have spent that vitality or lost it, I think it has been well lost.  What <Col N="522" /> ever political advantage we might have gained by refusing to agree to the co-operation which the Taoiseach sought, the nation would have lost far more.  But when we attempt, as parliamentarians on all sides of the House, to give effect to the spirit of such an understanding, let us bear in our minds the fate of great democratic nations which sought to impose upon their people a silence which appeared desirable to the Executive, but which ultimately proved more than the people themselves were prepared to bear.  Let them remember the fate of the great Republic of France, which suffered its people to be lulled into a sense of absolute security until the very eve of the disaster that overwhelmed them, and let them ask themselves if this was not largely due to the excessive desire, albeit understandable, on the part of the Executive to silence criticism and to secure that everybody in the State should become an unquestioning &ldquo;yes man&rdquo;.  We recognise the necessity for that measure of co-operation vital to the safety of the State, but we also recognise the essential and vital necessity of reasoned criticism, and a reassurance of the public mind at reasonably frequent intervals if the safety of the State is not to perish before internal menaces that can be as great as any external threat.</P>
    <P>When I was preparing what I had to say on the subject matter of this resolution, I could not help asking myself the question: If I were in the place of the Minister for Agriculture and if Deputy James Ryan was standing where I stand now, what sort of speech would be made: would there be forbearance and would there be an understanding of the difficulties with which I was confronted: would there be a desire to hold up my hand when it might be politically advantageous to strike it down?  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>Whatever kind of speech he might have made on that occasion, my purpose here to-day is to do nothing beyond pointing out to the Government where they have clearly gone wrong, to urge them to repair thess errors and to offer them our co-operation in any trade negotiations upon which they may be called upon to enter in the future to secure for our <Col N="523" /> people the most advantageous arrangements the circumstances will permit.</P>
    <P>I am not going to depart from the understanding which the Taoiseach invited last night and which, we understand now, he thinks it better to alter.  So far as I am concerned, I am going to pursue the line I communicated to the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures last night.  I have half an hour to reply, and many of my colleagues will have an opportunity of intervening in the debate after the Taoiseach has spoken. If the Taoiaeach chooses to lead this debate along certain lines, he mast be the judge of the expediency of that course.  But if the debate is to follow along those lines, by the Taoiseach's own choosing, at this moment, the Taoiseach must not complain if every Deputy of this House speaks as honestly and as freely as he himself feels constrained to speak.  I, for my part, will deal with the economic aspect of the problems that confront us and I shall deal with what the Taoiseach has to say, or thinks it expedient to say, when called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>My first charge against this Government is that the Minister for Agriculture has abdicated his trusteeship for agriculture by betraying the interests of the people who live upon the land, at the instance of the Minister for Supplies, whenever he was called upon to do so.  Again and again and again, the interests of restricted groups of industrialists have demanded that the farmer should be sacrificed ruthlessly and, in each case, the Minister for Supplies, representing the manufacturers, has overborne the Minister for Agriculture, the farmers have been robbed and the industrialists have prospered.  Nor do I propose to mention that in a general way without coming down to particular cases of which I propose to give details, and to challenge the Minister for Supplies to deny one syllable of the case I make.  Let me firstly deal with the case of wool.  Last autumn, there was a very considerable wool clip in this country.  That wool clip could have been sold in the Dutch and Spanish markets for 2/6 per lb.  There <Col N="524" /> were merchants anxious to buy it. There were exporters willing to ship it.</P>
    <P>Nothing stood between the farmers of this country and 2/8 per lb. for their wool except the prohibition of the Minister for Supplies on the export of the wool.  Was that wool being kept here for the purpose of protecting our people against cold?  Not at all.  It was being kept here in pursuance of an agreement entered into by the woollea manufacturers here who were bartering it.  They were to get botany yarns from England in exchange for the cross-bred wool which was to be shipped to England at England's price and turned into blankets and khaki uniforms in Great Britain.  I should be glad to send Great Britain the wool.  I should be glad to see Great Britain win the war. I should be glad to do anything to help her to win the war.  I do not want to take up the position of casting odium on the Minister for Supplies for sending wool to England to make uniforms.  It could not be used for a better purpose in the world at present.  But if the Minister for Supplies wants to be patriotic, let him do so at the expense of the Exchequer and not at the expense of the unfortunate farmer who shears the sheep.  Suppose Deputy Briscoe's company had found gold in Wicklow, what would he have thought if he were ordered to sell that gold at 30/- an ounce to Great Britain when the Dutch would give him 90/- per ounce?  I bet he would not do it.  He would claim the world price, and we would all sympathise with his claim. We would all be anxious to see this asset sold at the highest bid.  What difference is there between gold from Wicklow and wool from Wicklow?  Is it any more noble to dig gold than to shear wool?  And if you are entitled to recover the world price for gold, why should the farmers of Wicklow be denied the world price for wool?  They were denied that price because the woollen manufacturers wanted to get botany wool yarns from England.  The wool control in England stipulated that if these supplies were to be granted, the manufacturers of this country who wanted the supplies would have to give them a lien on the cross-bred wool of Ireland, but they were prepared to <Col N="525" /> offer only a price substantially lower than that forthcoming in Holland and Spain.  In pursuance of this agreement, the export of cross-bred wool was prohibited in this country at the instance of the Minister for Supplies.  Then, negotiations were opened as to price with Great Britain.  When negotiations as to price for this cross-bred wool weie proceeding, Holland was overrun and Spain ceased to be a customer for wool, whereupon we found ourselves with an immense accumulation of cross-bred wool for which there was no market but the British wool control. The British wool control would not give us an economic price, with the result that a large proportion of that wool is left on our hands to-day.  The only substantial sales we have made are in respect of the wool we have shipped to the U.S.A., and the price of wool has fallen proportionately in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to manure.  Time and again we have represented that the land of this country was starved for manure.  I told the Minister for Supplies on one occasion that I had outside the port of Sligo 25,000 tons of superphosphate of lime and that nothing prevented it coming in for distribution amongst the farmers of County Sligo and Roscommon but his prohibition&mdash;his refusal to remove the tariff or grant the subsidy available at that period to the manures manufactured in Irish plants.  The Irish manure ring absolutely refused to allow our farmers to get one ounce of manure from outside this country because, if it came in, it would break thpir price ring, break their strangle-hold on the manure market, and break their power to exploit the farmers.  Did the Minister for Agriculture say then: &ldquo;I insist on this manure coming in&rdquo;?  Did he say that wherever manures could be got for relief of the Irish farmer he would get them and give them to him? Not a bit of it He said: &ldquo;So long as the manure ring does not want this manure, the faimeis must do without it&rdquo; and, by God, they did.  This House, supposed to represent the agricultural community, is to stand silently by while the Minister for Aguculture derclares that so long as the manure ring does not want to let in manure he <Col N="526" /> will not let it in&mdash;and that at a time when not half the farmers have sufficient manure to do their normal tillage operations, not to mention the extra tillage forced upon them by the Minister's Tillage Order.  And the members of the Fianna Fáil Party claim to represent the agricultural community in this country!</P>
    <P>Now we come to onions.  At the urgent instance of the Minister for Agriculture, the farmers of Kerry and other parts of this country went into the onion crop.  Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan raised the question a month or six weeks ago as to why these people would not be allowed to export these onions.  At that time, the fanners in the Castiegregory area and the congested districts of Kerry could have got £60 a ton for onions on the English market.  The land in certain areas in Kerry was yielding six tons to the statute acre, which meant that the farmer in Kerry could have got £360 per acre for his onions, and he was forbidden to take that price because the Minister for Supplies would not permit him to export them.</P>
    <P>The British people, a wealthy nation, are prepared to do without motor cars, without silk stockings, without butter, without bacon, without a variety of other commodities which we would regard as essentials, in order to secure for the community foreign exchange to add to the national wealth by the advantageous realisation of their products on the markets of, the world, but we, according to the Minister for Supplies, cannot do without onions, and we must purchase that luxury of onions, not at the expense of the community as a whole, but at the expense of a few congest farmers in County Kerry who, by their industry and skill, have produced a crop which would confer comparative wealth upon them.  That we deny them, that we withheld from them because, forsooth, we cannot live without onions.  Half Europe is starving, but the poor Irish cannot live without onions, and to ensure their supplies they must retain in serfdom and poverty congest farmers in County Kerry instead of purchasing those supplies at the current world price and paying for their luxuries, if <Col N="527" /> they want them, or, else, let the Kerry farmers get the price available in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Now, that is not the whole story, because if these onions could have been kept and sold here, well and good, but these silly men who know as much about agriculture as my foot&mdash;I refer to the Minister for Supplies&mdash;have the idea that an onion is an onion.  The Minister, who was born and bred in the city, is familiar with the Spanish onion, and he thinks that all onions partake of the qualities of the Spanish onion&mdash;a thing that looks like a handball and has the appearance of the setting sun&mdash;but that is not the kind of onions we grow in this country.  I have here a letter describing the state in which one of the largest onion dealers in this city finds himself to-day.  The quality of Irish onions is excellent, but their keeping capacity does not compare with that of continental onions. Spanish onions or Egyptian onions can readily be kept, under normal conditions, until March, April, or even May.  Irish onions, because we have probably not yet developed as highly efficient a system of drying and saving them as is practised in countries where onions have been grown for generations, will not keep.  While they are new, they are excellent, but after Christmas they begin to grow, they begin to rot in the middle and deteriorate very rapidly.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter from a man who has 110 tons of Irish onions on his hands.  For these 110 tons he could have got £6,000 before the British controlled the price in England.  He now has these 110 tons of Irish onions on his hands and they are growing out through the bags.  He is a man with a small capital who threw himself into this onion business.  I am sure, for profit.  He was not in it for philanthropy, but he as buying onions in Castlegregory and other parts of Kerry which he intended to ship to England as fast as he could and bidding the top price in Kerry in order to get the largest supply and to do the largest business.  He now has 110 tons of onions growing thiough the bags and he asks the Department to send down <Col N="528" /> an inspector to look at the onions and to agree with him that something must be done to dispose of them, because no matter what price he sells them at on the Irish market, the Irish market will not consume them in time to prevent them going rotten.  Surely it is a crime, when we have an excellent product which will favourably compare with the product of any country in the world, if it is allowed to go on the market at the proper time, to have the good name of that product destroyed, to have the price of it ruined and the producers of it made bankrupt, simply because the Minister for Supplies has made up his mind that, whatever about the farmers in Kerry, he will not allow them to export onions.</P>
    <P>That seems to amuse the Minister for Supplies.  He has never known what it means to live in a congested area.  He has spent all his life in comparative affluence in this city and he does not know what it means to go out to work in mud and dirt and raise a crop and, when you have the crop saved, to see the price snatched from you by a group of incompetent politicians in this city, and I do not suppose he will ever need to know; but those who are supposed to represent the small farmers of the country ought to know and they ought to ask the Minister for Agriculture, who is supposed to be their trustee, why he permitted the Minister for Supplies to rob these people of the price they were entitled to get and have not got solely and only because the Government prevented them from getting it.</P>
    <P>I mention these things because I think it time we made up our mind now as to how far this Government intends to go in holding back the produce of our agricultural industry from the markets of the world at the expense of the farmers who grow that produce.  I do not challenge the right of the Government to hold supplies for the benefit of the community, if the Government are prepared to finance that transaction out of the community's Exchequer, but I say that the Government has no right to withhold for the benefit of the community goods which could be profitably sold oii the markets of the world, if that <Col N="529" /> Government arc not prepared to pay the fanners who produce them the price the farmers could pet if they were allowed to sell the goods.</P>
    <P>That is the issue which has pot to be faced, and Fianna Fáil Deputies ought to get up and tell the people if they think it fair that goods should he held back from profitable markets for the benefit of the community, while the community is not prepared to compensate the farmers for the resulting loss.  I say that that is not fair, and I say that ths Government has been consistently doing that, and that it ought to stop, because as certain as we are in this House, if it does not stop the farmers who have heretofore being producing stuff will stop producing, and then the situation in this country will be grave in the extreme.</P>
    <P>We come now to the future.  So far as the live stock industry is concerned, if we could get the price of Irish beef equalised with that of British beef, I do not believe the cattle industry is in a very bad way.  I do not believe it is going to serve any useful purpose to represent that the farming community in every department of their life is in difficulties, when in fact it is not.  So far as the big strong beast is concerned&mdash;I am talking now of store cattle&mdash;they are not selling too badly at all.  So far as younger cattle are concerned, I believe that in the spring we may reasonably expect to get an economic price for them.  So far as my word carries, I would advise those who have cattle at the present time&mdash;where they can afford it, and the cattle are young store cattle, that is to say from 20 to 26 months old&mdash;to carry them into the spring, when they will yield a better price than they can hope to get now.  So far as the bigger store cattle are concerned, they are probably getting as good a price now as we can reasonably expect they will reach for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to the question of pigs, and it is a very queer story.  We have a situation here in which we are informed by our Minister that he has done his best to increase the quota for pigs and pig products, and that he has <Col N="530" /> failed, and the following morning we read in the paper that the British Government deem it expedient to reduce the bacon quota in England, and not only that but to apply the rationing system to gammons and hocks, which had not been affected by the bacon rationing up to that.  Then this motion is put upon the Order Paper, and within a week of its being put there, an announcement is made by the Government that our quota for the export of live pigs to Great Britain has been increased by, I think, 60 per cent. Now we have travelled a full circle.  I can remember saying in this House that the day we destroyed the pig fair in rural Ireland we would do the pig producer irreparable injury.  That day came to pass when the pig fairs of Ireland were finally destroyed, and we have travelled a full circle, because the representatives of the Pigs and Bacon Commission have now to go out and do this job which the pig buyers used to do before the fairs were destroyed. Having first wiped the fairs out, with an immense loss to our people, we now re-institute them with civil servants instead of pig buyers.</P>
    <P>What are we to do for the future? If our Minister goes to London to discuss supplies with the corresponding Minister in Great Britain, I do not believe that there is any insuperable difficulty in the way of securing from Great Britain orders for our pigs and bacon sufficient to consume the present available supplies, and I believe that that journey must be made, and made quickly, because if the reply of the Ministry of Food is adverse then vigorous measures must be taken to adapt ourselves to the situation which will arise from the disappearance of our pig and pork market.  Those adjustments cannot be made overnight; they take time and they take care.  Personally, I do not believe that any such adjustment will have to be made.  I am convinced that prudence and reasonableness&mdash;and the British are a reasonable people on the whole. in trade matters especially&mdash;can work out an agreement in respect of pork, pigs and pig products, which will make it unnecessary for us to reduce our output in that regard at all.  Mind you. I want to say this, and I want to give <Col N="531" /> the Government credit for this: a very critical situation arose a fortnight or three weeks ago, and that situation is being admirably met by the circulation of the Pig Marketing inspectors, who are purchasing all the pigs from the people at the statutory prices fixed. But we ought to face this fact, that you cannot produce pigs on purchased feeding stuffs at 88/- a cwt., considering the present price of those feeding stuffs.  It simply cannot be done.  No matter how economical or careful you are, you lose about 5/- a pig.  But it is true&mdash;some people may think it impolitic of me to say so, but I do say it, because I know it to be true; I know it from my own experience&mdash;that the small fanners, who are feeding their pigs on waste potatoes, cabbage leaf and the offal of the house, can produce pigs at a profit if they get 92/- a cwt. I do not believe the man who has to purchase feeding stuffs can profitably produce pigs at much under 100/- a cwt. considering the current price of feeding stuffs.  The small man who has two or four pigs, and is feeding them on the refuse of his farm, can make a profit at 92/- a cwt., and the sooner we can get back to the 92/- price for pigs the better it will be for the poorest sections of this community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Now we come to eggs.  I asked the Minister last September 12 months if he would take vigorous measures then to stimulate the day-old chick scheme, so that we would bring into laying production last autumn the maximum number of hens.  Since the beginning of autumn this year eggs are worth their weight in gold, but we have not got them to sell.  Now, eggs are things that are often regarded as insignificant and trivial in our economy.  Any one who comes from the west or south of Ireland, or indeed from Monaghan or Donegal, knows that eggs are the poor person's stand-by.  They are the things that, to the average woman of the country house, make all the difference between a low standard of living and a good standard of living.  If she can make money out of eggs she has pocket money.  If she has no money out of eggs she has no pocket money <Col N="532" /> at all, and, after all, for the country woman going to the market it is pocket money that makes the difference between a reasonably happy life and a life of unchanging drudgery.  It was the egg money that, very largely, illuminated the lives of the country women of this country.  There was an immense opportunity to take a constructive and profitable step 18 months ago, about which nothing whatever was done.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is making any effective effort now to increase egg production in this country.  I know that circulars are sent out and half-hearted letters are addressed to the inspectors of the Department, but there is no advertising campaign, there is no pressure at all put on to crsata the demand for day-old chicks which must be created now if the day-old chicks are to be available when they are wanted.  There is a means not only of producing an immensely profitable export for our community, but also of contributing to the solution of the problem to which I will come shortly, that is, the problem of disposing of the oat crop.  No one in this country realised how much oats the hens consumed until we killed the hens.  It was then, and only then, that the farmers of this country discovered to what an extent their wives had been raiding the oat bin, and they discovered to their cost that their wives were the best economists, and that those daily raids on the oat bins paid a golden harvest in the sale of eggs for the benefit of the family as a whole.  I, therefore, strongly urge on the Minister to press forward at once in the distribution of fowl, which is one of the easiest methods that he has for repairing the ravages of his past policy in this country.</P>
    <P>Now we come to sheep.  I recognise the Minister's difficulties in regard to sheep.  He has not put a quota on sheep.  He has not imposed the licensing system on sheep.  He has got to meet the requirements imposed upon him by the British Government in that regard, but he had similar difficulties to meet in regard to the fat cattle trade, and he has met them, and met them very much more successfully than he has met them in regard to the sheep <Col N="533" /> trade.  I know a man in this country at the present time who has 400 or 500 lambs and cannot sell them.  What happened is this: Last year some friend or somebody else came along and induced those people to sell their lambs to a neighbour or members of the local co-operative society, and they did so. When they apply this year the co-operative or the friend is not willing to buy their lambs.  They go to the Minister and ask for a licence to ship them to England, and he says: &ldquo;How many did you ship last year?&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;We did not ship any last year. We sold all our lambs to a neighbour or to the local co-operative.&rdquo;  Then they are told that they are entitled to no licence at all.  The man says: &ldquo;The co-operative will not buy the lambs; the neighbour will not buy them, and you will not let me ship them; what are we to do with them?  The Minister says he does not know.  That is not sense.  Let us understand the Minister's difficulty.  The Minister says &ldquo;I have got a certain number of licences. How else can I distribute them except in proportion to the way I distributed them last year?&rdquo;  I admit, as a general rule, that is a fairly reasonable foot-rule to go by, but it ought to be administered in consultation with persons who understand the special difficulties of individuals, so that where you have a complete impasse of the kind to which I refer, some relaxation of the-general rule is permissible to meet the peculiar case which the Minister knows as well as I do will arise no matter what general scheme of licence distribution you work out.  I think&mdash;and I think it is right to say&mdash;that in regard, to this distribution of cattle licences he has got as near a reasonably practical scheme of the kind I had in mind as in all the circumstances it is possible to get.</P>
    <P>Now we come to oats and barley, and that is a matter that is inextricably interwoven with the question of the compulsory tillage order.  Let us realise the magnitude of this problem.  I remember being jeered at in this House last June when I told the Minister that he was going to have a very critical situation in regard to the, oat crop if he did not take steps to dispose of the <Col N="534" /> surplus of last year's production.  He said that was all nonsense; there would not be any trouble at all.  Now, of course, he is in hot water up to his ears and flapping about like a bewildered duck and we will, as usual, have to pull him out and help him.  We are glad to do that, on one condition, that he will not get into the same kind of idiotic mess again because you cannot be pulling him out year after year in that way.  Let us examine the increase in the acreage under these crops in order to realise the magnitude of the problem that confronts us.  There has been an increase as between 1939 and 1940 of 139,500 acres in respect of oats. There has been an increase of 64,300 acres in respect of barley.  I may get my head in a halter for some of the things I am saying.  I do not believe there is going to be any trouble in disposing of barley before the end of this year.  When I speak of the year I mean the year ending on the 1st September next.  I believe by the 1st of next September we will be glad of all the barley in the country at the present time, but that does not alter the fact that there are thousands of individuals in this country who cannot carry the barley until the 1st of next September. The community wants that barley. Every one of those could sell that barley profitably if they were allowed to export to Great Britain and Northern Ireland now.  They could call in the threshing men, thresh the barley and ship it to Northern Ireland and get paid for it within a week.  The Minister says, and I think rightly so: &ldquo;We will not let the barley go because if we let it go now we will find ourselves next April or May without any animal feeding stuffs at all and we will not be ble to get any.&rdquo;  That is an understandable position, but that is no consolation to the farmer who has no storage for grain and who, if he is to keep this barley until March or April when the market begins to open up for barley, must leave it in the stack.  I tell the Minister&mdash;and any farmer in this House can confirm what I say&mdash;that if you leave barley in the stack on an ordinary Irish farm from September until April, half the barley will be eaten by rats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> The Minister says: &ldquo;If you ask me to store this barley it will mean putting an added cost on the barley produced, the cost of storage.&rdquo;  I admit that.  Of course it will, but is it not better to pay something to get your barley safely stored than to let the rats eat it?  I suggest that the Minister should prepare a scheme and say to the people who have barley: &ldquo;Anyone who wants to avail of this scheme, here are the terms; anyone who does not want to avail of it let him keep his barley over until April or May and he will get a better, price then than if he sold it now.&rdquo;  Let the man who finds he cannot keep it, the man who finds it more economical to pay whatever the cost of storing it may be rather than leave it to the rats, avail of the Minister's scheme, and let those who say they do not want to be paying for storage do their own storing.  Then no one has any reason to complain.  They are going to get a better price by keeping the barley if they hold it.  If they cannot hold it then the Minister will take it off their hands at the present time at whatever is the ruling price and pay them forthwith.  Now you are reaching somewhere near equity.  But when you come to fix the price I ask the Government to bear in mind this fact, that you are not entitled to ask &mdash;you are not entitled to compel&mdash;the grain growers of this country to produce animal feeding stuffs at a price lower than the world price, for the benefit of their neighbour.  I talk in cwts. because I come from the West of Ireland.  A man from the Midlands will talk in barrels.  If you are going to ask the farmers of this country to produce barley at 10/- a cwt. when they can get 14/- a cwt. in Great Britain then I think you are asking them to do something that is not fair. If you want to keep the barley here at home, and if you say the community must have the barley, if it is to survive then you ought to buy the barley from the farmers at the price which the farmers could get if you permitted them to export it.  If that is not worth doing then you ought to allow them to export it but you have no right to ask an individual citizen to subsidise the community, more especially when <Col N="536" /> you force the individual citizen to use his land for tillage whether he thinks it advisable to do so or not.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say&mdash;mind you, the price is rising for barley&mdash;if the Minister will say he will give a price which is a fair average between what we can reasonably anticipate will be the ruling price for barley next May and the ruling price to-day, and that he will take all the barley that anybody wants to sell him now at that price, and if he makes a profit on it next May the Treasury will keep the profit or that he will advise anybody who has barley in the stack or who has a barn to store it in to keep his, own, barley until April or May when they will get a much better price than he can aflord to give them now, then he has met every legitimate complaint of the barley grower save one&mdash;and that has to be remembered. Many farmers grew excellent mailing barley in this country, but they were not quite as quick off their mark as their neighbours.  The neighbours got their barley sold to Guinness at 30/- a cwt.  The fellows who were not quite so quick off the mark or who were not able to get threshing men to come and thresh the barley found themselves selling barley as good or better than the barley for which Guinness paid 30/-, at 20/- or less.  That is a very great hardship. I am not at all sure it is a hardship about which the Minister for Agriculture can be reasonably expected to do very much.  There is this danger inherent in it, that if it becomes a race to get your barley ripe and threshed you may have people planting barley in January and February when in fact it should not be set until March or April.  That is a thing that has to be guarded against, and if that spreads it will be something that must be carefully watched.</P>
    <P>I think, as compared with oats, barley is a comparatively simple problem, but oats, as I foresaw and as everybody realises now, when it is too late, is a very big problem.  We carried over to this year a very large unknown quantity of oats to which the Minister contributed substantially by importing thousands of tons of Canadian oats last year, a great part of which he still has <Col N="537" /> on his hands.  We have increased the oats acreage by 26 per cent.&mdash;139,500 acres.  The oats are stacked.  The rats are eating it and there is no prospect whatever of our being able to consume it in Ireland this year.  The maddening part of it is, particularly to farmers in North Monaghan and East Donegal, that the people in Morthern Ireland and Great Britain aie clamouring for it at about 4/- to 6/- a cwt. more than we are paying for it.</P>
    <P>I think it is time the Minister faced this problem and asked himself what the is going to do about it.  Bear this in mind, that if the Government think that they can simply screw the lid down and say: &ldquo;We are damned if we let you sell it; we will ride the storm, whatever it is; political agitation is off for the time being and we will come through all right&rdquo;, they are wrong, because if there is a disastrous collapse in respect to oats this year, we will not get any oats sown next year. There is not a seed merchant or farmer in the country who will not tell you that.  If you get one year in which there is a collapse, in which talk at every fireside is: What did you do with your oats?&rdquo;&ldquo;What did anyone do or what could anyone do?  We could not get rid of them; we could not sell them; we were persecuted with the rats, because the oats brought the rats about the place,&rdquo;&mdash;if that is the general talk one year the following year there will be an immense reduction in the sowing of oats no matter what tillage order you may have.</P>
    <P>I can visualise the Minister for Agriculture saying &ldquo;Let them all grow wheat.&rdquo;  That is the kind of comment that one would expect from the Minister for Supplies or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, gentlemen who would not know the difference between wheat, barley or oats if they saw them growing in a field.  There are thousands of acres of land in this country that will not grow wheat, and there are thousands of acres more that will not grow wheat without very generous manurial treatment, and in this coming year we will not be able to give that land generous manurial treatment.</P>
    <P>Remember, that oats are largely <Col N="538" /> grown on land where wheat will not grow&mdash;in Donegal, in the Province of Connaught and in West Cork&mdash;and if you drive the bulk of the oat-growers into growing wheat in order to get some cash for the crop, what will happen will be that in the case of half of them the crop will fail and they will have nothing.  With those who manage to get a crop off the land, it is not productive farming they will have been doing but mining.  They will have teen living on their capital, because they will take out of the land, with the wheat crop, substance and nourishment far in excess of what the wheat crop will realise.  You will have a general tendency to impoverish the land.  You will be thrusting a part of the community on to a system based on living on capital and.  God knows, they have done enough of that for the last seven years.  We cannot afford to let them continue to do that unless we want to reduce them to the standard of middle-European peasants.  I often wonder if we are not in grave danger of doing that by one or other of the policies that we are pursuing.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he must make a computation of the quantity of oats available in the country and he must make the best guess he can of our consumption between now and the next harvest.  He has then got to aim at retaining that quantity of oats, plus 10 per cent., reconciling himself clearly to the necessity of purchasing any small surplus that that policy may leave on the hands of the community, at the expense of the State, and then allow the community to export the balance at the most advantageous price they can get.  That is the prudent course to pursue.  Storage of oats beyond the end of the present cereal year would be madness and will tend to destroy the oat productivity of our land.  We can get out of our land in a cereal year far more oats than we can consume. What we want to keep alive and vigorous is the will to grow, and the only way to do that is to preserve in the minds of the people the idea that if they produce good oats there will be a ready market for them, let it be through the medium of fowl, eggs or direct purchase, or through the rearing <Col N="539" /> of calves; but, once you convince the people that the oats may be allowed to remain until the rats will turn the stack into a stack of chaff, you will never get oats grown here again.</P>
    <P>With regard to compulsory tillage, I should like to ask is it fair to go down to a man with a farm and say: &ldquo;You will have to plough that field whether you think it right or wrong And, when that is done, we do not care what happens to you&rdquo;?  Would you think it reasonable if one of the Ministers was authorised to go into a factory aad say: &ldquo;You have to work that machine there night and day for the next three weeks&rdquo; and, if the factory manager says that the result of attempting to do that would be that the machine would run itself to pieces in tour days and then they would have no machine at all, the Minister declares: &ldquo;You have to do it and we do not care what the results are, because we claim the right to force you to do it&rdquo;?  Would that not be very unreasonable?</P>
    <P>Is that not the very thing the Minister is asking farmers to do?  He is claiming the right to do a similarly unreasonable thing with the farmers. I should add that the manufacturer might plead that if he ran the machine continuously the amount he would produce would be far in excess of the possible markets.  If the Minister says: &ldquo;We do not give a damn; you have to produce that stuff and we do not eave what you do with it&rdquo;, every reasonable man would say that that was a ridiculous request to make of any industrial concern.  You go to the farmer and you say: &ldquo;You have to work the field in a particular way and, having done that, we do not care what happens to you; it is your funeral what you do with the products.&rdquo;  No civilised country has ever done that.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain there is a compulsory tillage scheme.  The Ministry say: &ldquo;We will give you £2 an acre to help you to till that field and, if there is any loss, we will contribute to it so that it may be shared between the community and the owner of the land.&rdquo;  There is an alternative.  The Minister might <Col N="540" /> say: &ldquo;There is the land and, if you grow barley on it, you will get such and such a price; if you grow oats, you will get such and such a price; or, if you grow potatoes, you will get such and such a price.&rdquo;  That is reasonable, but it is not reasonable to ask or to compel farmers to produce crops when these farmers have not the faintest notion whether they will be able to sell at a profit or not.  So far as the production of oats is concerned, it will be impossible to sell them if the Minister for Supplies maintains his attitude that not one grain will be exported to the markets of the world.</P>
    <P>The last matter is, perhaps, the most difficult of all.  I am informed it is a matter that seems to have consumed an undue proportion of the Minister's time.  I do not deny for a second the urgent importance of the dairying industry to this country, but we ought to get the dairying industry into its true perspective.  The total available exportable surplus of butter in this country is approximately 400,000 cwts., taking one year with another.  That represents about two and a half week's supply of the British market.  We send to Great Britain in 12 months enough butter to keep her going for two and a half weeks and she has to get from the rest of the world the butter she requires for the remaining 50 weeks.  If she can get the balance of that butter at a price substantially less than that at which it is economically possible for our farmers to produce butter, why in the name of goodness do we go on walloping, walloping, day after day, trying to make a trade agreement with Great Britain to secure a higher price for two weeks of supply of butter, when she knows that she will have to pay the same price for the other 50 weeks' supply taken from other parts of the world?  What is the use of battering our heads against a stone wall in that fashion?</P>
    <P>I think it is time that we came to reconsider our position in regard to this whole question.  I know that we have got to maintain our dairy herds in the south west of Ireland, because they are an essential pan of the general economy of this country.  They <Col N="541" /> are the foundation of the store cattle industry, and the skim milk that comes from these dairy herds contributes substantially to the pig industry.  If we are going to keep them going, we have got to provide a market for their milk and their butter.  I suggest, that we approach a solution of the problem along both these lines.  So far as increasing the consumption of butter in this country is concerned, we are not going to get very far, because, at present, we consume more butter per head of the population than any other country in the world.  It is calculated by statisticians that we consume 26 lbs. per head of the population in the urban areas, and 30 lbs. per head of the farming population.  That is infinitely in excess of the consumption in New Zealand, and certainly of any other country in the world.  However, it is possible that we may be able to increase the consumption at home to some extent.  We all know that there are people in the Cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick who do not use butter as often as they might use it. We ought to try to devise plans, therefore, to increase the consumption of this commodity as much as possible at home.  Remember we are now paying annually £350,000 of a subsidy on butter going to Britain.  I should like to see that £350,000 spent in making butter and milk products more readily available to those sections of the community who are at present unable to get them.  Assuming that we are not going to get very far along that road, we have got to face the problem of increasing the consumption of milk.  I think if you secure for every child in this country under 14 years of age three pints of milk per day&mdash;although that may be regarded by some people as an excessive consumption&mdash;you would thereby absorb the entire milk output of this country&mdash;that is to say, the entire milk output at present devoted to the manufacture of butter. That is an interesting figure, because, mind you, if you could keep that goal in front of us, it is not an impossible achievement.  There is no dietary reform more essential than an increased milk consumption by the poor, but you have got to bear in mind that the <Col N="542" /> moment you embark upon that, you are going to come up against a formidable vested interest, the legitimate vested interest, of the people who we at present making their living by supplying milk to the urban population of the country.  If we could combine the social reform of increasing the consumption of milk by the poor with the attempt to secure a more ready disposal of our dairy products, I think it would be well worth while compensating the vested interests.  We could compensate them for whatever losses would arise from a more liberal consumption of milk arising from its free distribution amongst the necessitous people of the country.</P>
    <P>A further means of disposing of our dairy products is provided by a new industry which is growing up and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce might very well examine in the time to come.  That is the production of casein for the manufacture of plastics in this country.  I can see that developed to such a point, if we deal with this matter intelligently, that we might in the long run, come to regard butter as a by-product of casein instead of looking upon casein as a by-product of butter.  Remember you can afford to sell butter, if you treat it as a by-product of casein, at a price which is far more economic to producer and purchaser than if you sell casein as a by-product of butter.  Casein and plastics undoubtedly have an immense future before them.  We have a huge industrial country beside us which, if it ever comes to use plastics on the same scale as they are used in the United States at present, would consume far more casein than we could ever produce.  Why, therefore, do we not, try to develop a market for casein instead of storming the British market with butter which they will not take and on which we pay nearly £500,000 a year in order to induce them to take-it?</P>
    <P>I admit the whole dairying problem is one that abounds in difficulties.  Probably my remains in regard to it will be distorted, but I do not give a hoot. I have no doubt that it will be said that I suggested we ought to abolish <Col N="543" /> all the co-operative creameries and slaughter all the dairy herds.  I would, of course, rather see the dairying industry kept as near normalcy as possible but I do not believe it is any use pretending to the dairying industry that we can go ahead on the same lines as we have proceeded for the last ten years.  I remember that when the present Minister for Agriculture came into office it was said he was going to do the world and all for the industry. Every dairy farmer was to be put in a position to buy a Ford car to chase the cows round the meadows.  Millions have been sent down the drain since but we have got just precisely nowhere. We have got to face the fact also, and it is well to emphasise it, that if the farmers want the dairying industry to be revived, they have got to do their part, too.  Let the farmer who imagines that he can make dairying pay on the basis of a 400 or a 500 gallon cow&mdash;and I think there is a very large number of our dairy cows which do not exceed that yield&mdash;know now that he never will succeed except, perhaps, during short periods of European famine.  It is just impossible to make dairying pay on any basis below that of the 800 gallon cow and God knows we ought to be able to aim at the 1,000 gallon cow.  If we want to go, into the dairying business, we have got to make up our mind to that effect.  We have closed our eyes to it over the years but the ever-increasing and keener competition from the ends of the world forces us to face it now and it might be well that everybody should tell the farmers that bluntly and plainly.</P>
    <P>I think the points I have made provide the Minister with ample ground to cover when he comes to reply.  The problems outlined by me if courageously tackled can be overcome, but if left to look after themselves they might bring us within measurable distance of the economic collapse to which the motion refers.  I am an optimist in these matters.  I believe that by combined effort we can avert economic collapse and can save our people from the very real danger to our independence that such a collapse would involve.  As far as I am aware, all <Col N="544" /> sections of the community are prepared to lend a hand if a constructive, courageous proposal is put before them, but if we are to be told when we communicate a problem to the Government in these circumstances, that it is merely political badinage, I suggest that this country will go to blazes.  The Government has been approached in a reasonable manner the Opposition in the past.  These matters have been dealt with by myself with a moderation which astonishes me to-day.  However, I have deliberately preserved that care ful understatement of every problem which I have envisaged in the knowledge that there are 30 minutes in hand which I shall use more drastically if the situation requires it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture proposes to make a statement concerning the agricultural position and the Government policy in relation to it following the lines of Deputy Dillon's speech. But I have asked him to allow me to intervene at this stage for the purpose of dealing with statements made by Deputy Dillon on matters relating to the work of the Department of Supplies in order, I hope, to get these matters out of the way so that they. need not obtrude on the subsequent debate on the motion.  Deputy Dillon, when he speaks on matters about which he knows something, is frequently reasonable and sometimes intelligent; but when he speaks on matters about which he knows nothing, he is frequently wild.  He made a statement to-day concerning negotiations for the disposal of wool surplus which he would not have made if he had taken the very simple precaution, a precaution which would have occurred to any other Deputy, and that was to get an essential fact right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole of Deputy Dillon's statement was based on an assumption that an order was made prohibiting the <Col N="545" /> export of wool from this country at a time when it was not made.  Between the time of his entering the precincts of Leinster House to-day and his appearance in the Chamber he could have walked into the Library and seen there the order which prohibited for a period the export of wool from this country and noted, not so much the date of the order, as the date upon which that order became effective in prohibiting the export of wool from this country.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable, however, that the history of our wool trade since the outbreak of the war should be briefly stated, so that Deputy Dillon, as well as other Deputies, will know the facts. When the war broke out last September, the British Government immediately purchased the entire wool output of the most important wool-producing countries in the world and transported that huge quantity of wool to Great Britain.  The effect of that action of the British Government in purchasing a large part of the wool crop of the world was twofold.  In the first place, Great Britain became immediately over-stocked with wool and the possibility of disposing of wool there privately became almost nil. Secondly, there was created temporarily in other markets a scarcity which resulted in an immediate increase in the price prevailing in those markets and activity on behalf of the merchants in those countries to obtain wool elsewhere, including this country. Let it be stated that our total wool pimiuction is almost negligible in relation to the quantities of wool that coinp on the markets of the world. Nevertheless, for a period following the outbreak of the war the price of wool, rose sharply in the various countries into which wool was , notably in Helland and the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated that last autumn, when we had a considerable wool clip in thih country, our exporters rould have sold it at 2/6 per lb. in Dutch and Spanish markets only they were prevented by an order prohibiting the export of wool.  There was no order prohibiting the export of wool in force last autumn.  It is true that wool, with <Col N="546" /> a number of other commodities, was on a general list of goods the export of which was prohibited except under licence, but so far as wool was concerned a licence to export it was given to anybody who applied for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall mention that later.  The point is that so far as the export of wool was concerned last autumn there was no restriction upon export.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even then the Deputy would be wrong.  Our merchants could have exported all the wool they could have got&mdash;not to Spain, because we never exported wool to Spain in any quantity&mdash;but to the Netherlands and the United States of America.  So far as Spain is concerned.  I do not know how the Deputy got the idea into his head that there was a market for wool in Spain.  We never did export wool to Spain.  Our wool since October last was exported as to 46 per cent. to the United States of America, as to 40 per cent. to the Netherlands and Belgium, as to 8 per cent. to the United Kingdom, and as to 6 per cent. to the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that rise in price in the Dutch and United States markets was due to the purely temporary scarcity created by the British Government's purchases and was obviously only going to last for a time.  But, while it lasted, our wool merchants took every advantage of it and, as I said, 86 per cent. of the total wool exports went to the Dutch and United States markets, which in a normal year took only about 25 per cent. of our total wool surplus.  That situation ended, as it was bound to end, when Germany imaded Holland. When Germany invaded Holland there was still no restriction on the export of wool from this country.  Deputy Dillon stated that we made that prohibition on the export of wool effective in February.  We did not.  The German invasion of Holland took place on <Col N="547" /> 10th May, and with the German invasion of Holland the Dutch and Belgian markets closed at once, and they were taking almost 50 per cent. of our total exports.  Not merely had that invasion the effect of robbing us of a market tor 50 per cent. of our wool, but it also threw on the American mar-Let huge quantities of wool produced in South-American countries destined tor the continent of Europe which no longer could be sent to the continent ot Europe and was consequently sent to the United States.</P>

I want to deal briefly with the circumstances which gave rise to the publication of that notice.  Deputy Dillon stated that we have sacrificed our farmers to our industrialists.  He said that our industrialists were trying to barter our wool in England for the wool yams which they require for their production.  The industrialists never entered into this picture.  It is quite true that, during the course of the trade negotiations with the British, in April last, the British Government did say to us that if they were going to supply us with wool yarns and wool tops, then we would have to discuss with them the question of selling to them all our raw wool if they required it.  It is easy enough to represent that suggestion&mdash;which was not one of our making&mdash;as a conflict between the interests of farmers and the interests of industrialists, and when the Irish Government undertook to consider the suggestion it is possible to say that they were preparing to sacrifice the interests of our farmers to the interests of the industrialists; but there was a lot more than the interests of the industrialists involved in this question of obtaining supplies of wool yarns and wool tops.</P>
      <P>On supplies of wool yarns and wool tops depended the whole output of the clothing industry in this country&mdash;of the hosiery industry and of all the woollen cloth manufacturing industry here.  We were prepared, perhaps, to sacrifice the interests of the owners of these mills and to allow them to be closed down for want of supplies, but we had to recognise that the result would be that there would be no supplies of articles of woollen clothing for the people of this country.  Furthermore, there was the consideration that we were expanding our Army substantially and required uniforms for our Army, and in fact, since then, the clothing output of these mills has been confined almost entirely to providing uniforms tor our own soldiers.</P>

      <P>Practically all.  Deputy Dillon talked about the iniquity of what had or had not been done in this matter.  So far as the clothing manufacturers are concerned we did precisely what Deputy Dillon said we would not do; we sent our experts to every mill in the country, and every mill and every machine that was capable of producing Army cloth was turned over to the manufacture of that cloth.</P>

      <P>When I say that we considered the British proposal to exchange our raw wool for prepared wool yarns and wool tops, we were not sacrificing the interests of the farmers to the interests of industrialists, but apart altogether from the consideration that our supply of wool yarns and wool tops was involved there was the further consideration that by that time the possibility of selling our wool elsewhere had almost entirely disappeared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the British Government stipulated that, if they agreed to purchase the whole of our output of wool, it would have to be done through a central selling organisation here and that we must set up some central organisation here which would deal with them and ensure that no other individual merchant or firm in the country could, sell wool in Great Britain.  Accordingly, we made an order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to the question of price in a moment.  We took steps to set up the central selling organisation here that was required for that purpose, and then we proceeded to negotiate with the British Government on the question of price. They, however, offered us a price which we considered unfair to the producers <Col N="550" /> of wool in this country, and because we considered that pries unfair we declined to accept it and resumed the issue of licences for the export of wool. At the time we resumed the issuing of licences for the export of wool, market conditions, of course, had changed considerably. There was no longer a market in Europe, and the market in the United States of America was at that time being flooded by wool from South America, Central America and other countries which, normally, exported their wool to Europe.  The American market, however, has revived to some extent since then, and although the wool merchants came to us and urged us to resume, negotiations with the British Government to secure an arrangement which would permit of their taking the whole of our surplus wool at some price which would be regarded as possible at all, and we Undertook these negotiations, we had nevertheless to take into account the fact that there was some revival of the demand in America, which our wool merchants are availing of at present. However, at the request of the wool merchants we did resume negotiations, which negotiations are now coming to a conclusion.  In fact, it was only this morning that we received from the British Wool Control their proposal concerning the prices they are prepared to pay.  These proposals will be submitted to the wool merchants and others concerned for their consideration, and they will also have to be considered, of course, by the Department of Agriculturs because the Department of Agriculture will have to examine how these proposals will affect the interests of the primary producers of wool as well as the interests of the merchants.  Now that that is all over, perhaps I might be permitted to point out that the matter of formulating proposals relating to Government policy, as affecting the marketing of our wool surplus, is the primary duty of the Minister for Agriculture, and not of the Minister for Supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon never had 25,000 tons of superphosphates outside the port of Sligo.  There never were 25,000 tons of superphosphates outside the port of Sligo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Last autumn allegations were made in this House on more than one occasion that it was possible to secure supplies of manufactured superphosphate on the continent and that we would not let it in.  These allegations arose, I am satisfied, out of a circular issued by one firm, which alleged that they had superphosphate to offer for sale.  They sent that circular to every possible purchaser of superphosphate in the country, and every possible purchaser got the idea that the offer was intended for him personally, and thus the rumour grew that there was a huge quantity of superphosphate which could be purchased in Europe&mdash;and that at a time when every country in Europe had prohibited the export of artificial manure! The country that was the chief exporter of it was Belgium, and they prohibited its export as soon as the war began and continued that prohibition until they secured their own supplies. Only then did they lift the ban, and as soon as they lifted that ban we removed all restrictions on the import of that commodity and some came in, but certainly not 25,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And refused a bounty on all foreign superphosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And before that, the Minister assured this House that there <Col N="552" /> was not a hope of getting in foreign manufactured superphosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  What I said about superphosphate was that the export of that commodity was prohibited by European countries, but at the time Deputy Dillon is speaking of, the export of superphosphate had been prohibited by the Belgian Government and they afterwards lifted that ban to some extent, and as soon as they lifted the ban we removed the restrictions on import, and some came in&mdash;a matter of a few thousand tons, that is all.  Perhaps we are not now dealing with the general question of future supplies, but it is inevitable that there are going to be immense difficulties, not merely arising out of the fact that the sources of supplies have been cut off from us by belligerent action, but also from the fact that the hiring of shipping is becoming increasingly difficult and, for that purpose, may be impossible in a few weeks.</P>
      <P>There is another question with which I want to deal and that is the question of onions.  In that connection &mdash;and merely for the purpose of assuring the House that my Department is not responsible for all the iniquities that Deputy Dillon poured upon it&mdash;I might say that licences for the export of onions are issued at the discretion of the Minister for Agriculture, and if there are any bricks to be thrown on that account, please throw them at the Minister for Agriculture.  Now, what was said about onions could be said about a whole list of commodities, the export of which is prohibited.  It is true of timber; it is true of sugar; it is true of wheat; it is true of scrap iron; it is true of wool; it is true of a whole lot of commodities for which, if we allowed them to be exported, we could get a high price and, probably, a much higher price abroad than we can get at home.  The sole reason that the licensing provision in connection with the export of such commodities is not remover is because we are short of them ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a question of policy which any intelligent man can decide, whether we should get the immediate benefit of <Col N="553" /> famine prices in other countries by exporting our available supplies of these commodities, even though the net result might be that we will have none for ourselves; or whether we should hold these goods against our own requirements and sacrifice the prospects of immediate profit.  That was the problem in relation to onions. It is quite true that for a limited period there was an amazing price obtainable for onions in Belfast.  If the ban had been lifted every business man worth his salt would try to take advantage of that situation to cash in on it, but the net result would be that we would have to do without them. It was the same with regard to supplies of timber.  For the export surplus we could get sale at a much higher price than was permitted here. Even sugar we could sell, and at the present time we have to take extraordinary precautions to prevent the smuggling of it over the Northern frontier.  There are train loads of excursionists coming from Belfast and every Border town and buying sugar, a commodity of which they have a short supply in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Should we send out sugar, even when getting a better and a higher price there, and do without it ourselves?  No one would agree that that is good policy.  If Deputies will consider the measures taken by the Government to control the export of all these commodities, it will be found that behind them was one reason only, and that was that we must ensure that our own people's needs are met before we can permit the export of goods that are essential to the maintenance of the standard of living that we want to see here in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration of this motion in the names of Depute Dillon and Deputy Hughes, forecasting a possible economic collapse if our agricultural surplus is not disposed of, seems to me to raise at once this question: What really is an agricultural surplus? The Minister for Supplies put the question <Col N="554" /> in one form when he asked: &ldquo;Have we really a surplus for export?&rdquo; Have we, in fact, in the situation we are in, a surplus to the cunsumption requirements of our own people?  I want to say that I am heartily in agreement with the views expressed by the Minister, that it is a highly dangerous policy to pursue, to permit the export of goods so that we might get temporarily an advantageous price for these goods, when, at a later stage, we will probably have to pay a very much higher price for them if, in our circumstances, they are going to be purchasable at all.  An examination of the circumstances surrounding the famine of 1847 and 1848 shows that then we had an exportable surplus of agricultural goods, but we had not the vision to keep that surplus.  Instead, we allowed it to be exported to other countries, while our own people were dying of starvation.  We are living now in circumstances that are even more difficult and more trying than prevailed at that period.  It would be sheer economic lunacy for any Government to permit the export of surplus commodities, which we need for our own people, or which we may need at some later date.  We know that in our circumstances we are not capable of guaranteeing even continued production on the present scale of commodities which are misnamed &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not mentioned but Deputies are perfectly well aware of the philosophy behind the motion. The Deputy is well aware that there has been a screech to permit people to export onions because they could get an artificially higher price elsewhere at present.  He is aware that to-day the price of barley and oats on the British market and in the Six Counties is quoted as a reason why this country should export barley and oats irrespective of the national well being.  I think this motion and the whole atmosphere burrounding the discussion so <Col N="555" /> far, merely indicate that we have a false sense of values and a false outlook as to what really is surplus in the circumstances here.  In so far as Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughcs desire to deal with a problem, which I know to be an acute problem, that of disposing of produce which is surplus to the individual farmer, that ought to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the problem has to, be met of disposing of the surplus crop of an individual farmer in respect of oats or barley, that has to be met.  It is quite impossible to expect a small farmer to provide adequate storage accommodation of the type that will render the commodity which he stores impervious to destruction by vermin.  It is impossible also to expect that be could store that surplus over a sufficiently long period to enable him to cash it at an advantageous price. Good national economy should suggest to the Government the desirability of taking the individual surplus off the farmers' hands, whether it be large or sxnaH, storing it and ultimately releasing it in accordance with the community's needs.  The real remedy is to proceed along such lines, and not to permit the export of produce so long as there is a possibility that we will need it for our own requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that we will need alt agricultural produce for our own requirements.  Bear in mind also that while there are exports of fat cattle from the North Wall to-day, these same <Col N="556" /> cattle pass by the homes of people who can only consume meat once a week, and then in very insignificant quantities. Deputy Hughes might ponder over statistics to see if we could not induce our people to eat per head of the population the same quantity of meat that is eaten in New Zealand and Australia, as then we would not have one head of fat cattle for export.  We have an agricultural surplus and a livestock surplus to-day, because of the fact that our people are not able through economic necessity to consume the produce of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>After all, what is our agricultural produce, but food, butter, milk, beef, mutton, bacon, oats, potatoes and other crops in that category?  Such surplus as is available is only the surplus which our own people do not require.  Clearly, our own people are not in a position to purchase what they require; they are able to purchase only what their economic position permits them to purchase and, so far as what is I described as an agricultural surplus or any other type of surplus is concerned, it represents only that quantity of goods which through impoverishment our people are unable to purchase for their own requirements.</P>
    <P>Let us see, in fact, whether a statement of that kind is not borne out by statistics.  In the year 1938-39, our agricultural production, according to official statistics, was shown to be £53,500,000 which included £5,500,000 of goods which might be described under the heading of wool, hides, turf, hay, horses and food that was fed to animals.  In the same year we exported agricultural goods to the gross value of £19,000,000, so that there was left for home consumption in that year agricultural produce to the extent of £28,000,000.</P>
    <P>If you divide the £28,000,000 by the population of this country for that year, you will find that it works out that we were only spending on the purchase of agricultural goods 6½d. per day per head of the population. Last year, in fact, we consumed at home 62 per cent. of our agricultural output and we exported 38 per <Col N="557" /> cent., but in the previous year we consumed 65 per cent. and exported 35 per cent.  Official statistics clearly indicate that we are consuming less and exporting more under the head of agricultural produce.  We are doing that because our people are not in the economic position to buy what ih now falsely described as an agricultural surplus.</P>
    <P>A comparison of this country with any other small country&mdash;with Sweden, for instance&mdash;discloses an entirely different condition of affairs.  For the last year for which statistics are available for agricultural production and export in Sweden, it is shown that Sweden consumed at home 85 per cent. of her agricultural produce and exported only 15 per cent. compared with our position where we consumed at home 65 per cent. and exported 35 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison, obviously; and there is no comparison between the poverty that our people endure and the infinitely better conditions which is the lot of the mass of the people in Sweden.  You do not see in Sweden the poverty that you see here, you do not see at all the-depressed wage standards, you do not see the emigrant ship taking from Sweden people of the kind that leave this country, you do not see the Swede being the hewer of wood and the drawer of water in every country that is prepared to take English or Irish-speaking emigrants.  That is the vast difference between the conditions in this country and those in Sweden.  The basic fact of the whole situation is that we can export at present only because our people are denied the opportunity to purchase for home consumption a good deal of the commodities which are at present exported. If we could increase the expenditure on the home consumption of Irish agricultural produce from 6½d. per day to 11d. per day, there would be no agricultural produce available tor export.  Does it not seem in be sound economics&mdash;and sounder <Col N="558" /> to-day than ever&mdash;to endeavour to put our people in the position that they can consume here the commodities which at present we are compelled to export to a market which we cannot control, which we cannot regulate, and in which we cannot shield our good from the financial deterioration that goes with dumping and that goes with the production of goods in the sweated markets of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that we ought to concentrate, not on trying to fill ships with exportable agricultural produce but on evolving at home a system of life in which, instead of having to think of our nation as one that exports bullocks and produces those bullocks for export, we can look on the nation as one which produces goods for its people in the certainty that the people can be put in the economic position to purchase thoae goods, instead of being prepared to take any price they can get in any market in the world to which they can export those goods for sale. There should not be an insurmountable difficulty in doing that.  At present we have 120,000 people idle, as if all the work that this nation ever required to do was finished now and we could sit down in leisure and ease to contemplate a spectacle of 120,000 people living in a condition of enforced idleness.  We are being compelled to tolerate, under a Christian Constitution in a country that flaunts its Christianity, the horrible condition of life which is measured by the miserable pittances which these people receive under the Unemployment Assistance Acts or various social salves which do nothing to heal the social sores from which they suffer.  In my opinion, there is no greater form of waste than the economic waste that goes hand in hand with permitting 120,000 people to remain idle.  Every idle man and woman draws from the pool of national productivity.  If we had an economic position which showed that that pool of national productivity was always full, that it was capable of sustaining a miniature unemployed State of that kind on the produce of the pool, it might be possible for us to contemplate that situation with reasonable equanimity; but is it possible to do <Col N="559" /> that when the national production is appallingly low?  I do not think there is any other country in Europe where the standard of national production is as low as it is here.  When we keep 120,000 idle, we can only do it by allowing them to dip into the distressingly low pool of national productivity, taking out such miserable pittances as they can get to sustain them in living, as they must live, a low standard of life, and depressing the standard of life of every other citizen who has got to live on what he can get out of that pool.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that it might well concentrate on one effort to solve our agricultural problems by organising our own home market.  We can do that if we organise the energies of our 120,000 unemployed people, and of the legion of partly-employed and underpaid people, and harness their efforts to the national need in such a manner as to make available a new market. After all, a market is not just a fair green; it is not a pound; it is not just a place to which you take cattle or agricultural produce for sale.  A real market is one composed of human beings and, perhaps, live stock, to which you can sell such commodities as you have for sale.  The best market has always been recognised to be the demand of human beings for a decent standard of life, and the urge within them for a still higher and still better standard of life.  That is the best market to which we can sell our agricultural produce, and we could afford to sell a very substantial amount of that produce to our unemployed people if only we did not disarm them of the wherewithal to buy it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be a much better proposition for us to organise our own unemployed and give them decent rates of wages, than to be sending agricultural produce to Britain and selling it there at such prices as are available, while doing nothing whatever to stimulate the still more valuable market at home.  I think, though perhaps in this country you may not find general acceptance of the assertion that in our circumstances particularly, <Col N="560" /> and in any circumstances normally, the home market is the beet market for our producers.  You can control your own market, because you own it, and you can regulate prices in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the very point which answers the Deputy.  I say that our own market is the best market because we can control it.  We can regulate prices in it so as to ensure that our producers will get a fair return for their labour.  With a nationally intelligent Department of Agriculture we could ensure that our farmers did not concentrate on the production of goods for which there was no effective home market, and we could at all times shield that market from interference by dumping from outside or by production under low standards elsewhere.  It is because I believe that our home market offers these advantages, advantages that no other world market offers to us, that I urge that policy on the Government.  We have a taste now&mdash; it is quite a different taste from the one we got during the last war&mdash;that the markets we have been urged to look upon with longing eyes do not glitter as long as some people seemed to imagine.  They certainly are not glitter ing to-day.</P>

      <P>What about onions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone knows there is only a small quantity of onions produced. I suppose, so far as the Deputy is concerned, if it were not onions It would be something else.  I suggest that the movers of the motion, instead of longing for opportunities to export to Britain the goods which we need for our own people, should approach this problem in another way.  The best way in which they could secure a market for what is now described as our surplus agricultural produce would be by stimulating the home market by work and by wages.  Low wages and idleness do not make a good market anywhere. <Col N="561" /> You can sell prime beef to-day in Merrion Square because the people there have wages and salaries, but you cannot sell it at the Labour Exchange in Gardiner Street because the people who attend there have no money with which to buy it.  The really effective way to provide a market for that produce is to enable our people to purchase it by organising their present wasted energies and by giving them incomes that will enable them to buy the produce of their own country.  If our producers are suffering any difficulty in the matter of being able to market their goods, I suggest the basis of that difficulty is their inability to get consumers.  They can never have a satisfactory market outside this country yielding them decent prices for their goods so long as there is permitted at home an economic condition of affairs which indicates a low standard of life for the masses of the people of the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, in the course of his speech, made no reference to these very obvious facts in connection with this situation.  I think the Government ought to recognise that one of the best ways of dealing with the problem arising out of the sale, at reasonable prices, of all the commodities which we produce is to deal firstly, effectively with the unemployment problem, and, secondly with the problem which shows itself in tens of thousands of our people living on incomes which do not enable them to purchase the commodities which our producers make available for sale.  But in order to deal with unemployment on the one hand, or low wages on the other, it seems to me that the Government will at the same time have to deal with the monetary policy which anchors this country to another, and which is responsible for many of the basic evils from which this country suffers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We used, of course, be told another country was the greatest market for our producers.  It used to be said that it was the greatest market in the world: that its commercial greatness was built, up by a faithful adherence to gold as a method of backing its currency.  But then we saw the time <Col N="562" /> arrive in which the note issue of that particular country was partly uncovered by gold.  Since then we have had a further dilution in its gold backing for note issues.  Now we have arrived at a condition of affairs in which the only backing for that note issue is bombing planes and guns.</P>
    <P>Here in this country we suffer from grievous evils because of our inability to shake ourselves clear of that method of stimulating our activity.  At the present time, if an Irish bank wants to issue money it must buy for covey British securities, but British securities only mean what Britain owes.  The British backing for our note issue represents only the payments which. Britain promises to make at some future time.  Her ability to make these payments to-day may be questioned, and her ability to redeem those payments later may be still more doubtful. Therefore, we are anchoring our financial policy to-day to a system of purchasing securities of doubtful value, and we are restricting by that policy an industrial and agricultural activity which could provide a vast amount of employment for our people. I suggest to the Government that never, more than now, was there a necessity for thinking of our own monetary policy and of our whole financial policy in connection with the question of stimulating employment and economic activity in the country.  Very prominent British papers which have always been regarded as orthodox in the realms of finance have had recently to admit that countries in the world had shown during the past 20 years that you can back note issue by energy, by labour content and by work, and that the countries which had done that had not been shown to be wrong in the light of their achievements.  Here we are insisting on backing our note issue only by the debts of another country, and only by a system of financial jugglery that has for too long a period deceived our people.  We can, of course, issue the necessary credits to our people for such work as they perform and, so long as they perform work, it seems to me, as it seems to many other people, that the issue of currency against that labour content <Col N="563" /> and against the creation of that national wealth is never likely to impair the economic or financial structure of this State.</P>
    <P>We can provide a solution for the problem referred to in Deputy Dillon's motion by putting all our people to work, as we can put them to work by a sane monetary policy that will enable all the goods our people require to be produced.  They can put an end, at the same time, to that horrible misery add destitution which is such a terrible blot on large parts of our country to-day.  But if we do not grapple with the problem of unemployment and the still greater problem of financial control which governs it, this State, ten or 20 years hence, will be dealing with superficial motions of this kind and our people will be suffering all the misery and economic despair which is their lot to-day.  I urge the Government to regard this motion as something which should stimulate in them a determination to organise the home market better than it has been organised in the past.  That can only be done effectively by creating at home a larger body of consumers with the wherewithal to purchase these necessaries. That can be done by the provision of work at decent rates of wages for the idle people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One can say one thing about this debate&mdash;that there is no simple remedy, that no single recommendation can possibly be of any use, that an ideal solution of the problem is impossible and that this country is faced by a series of problems in connection with supply and export which ban be dealt with only with the greatest care.  One can be certain of one thing&mdash;that anything we do to stimulate activity too much in one direction is perfectly certain to create danger in another direction.  The only solution lies in adopting a sane, balanced point of view.  I think it is well that the House should recall the principal facts in connection with our trade because they are of vital interest with regard to thh whole question of how far we should conserve supplies within the country and how far we <Col N="564" /> should attempt to obtain sale of them abroad.  I believe I can show that the Government are adopting a balanced and extremely careful point of view and that they are doing their best to satisfy all sections of the nation and, at the same time, to prepare for what may be unimaginable dangers to come. We, in this country, sell £21,000,000 worth of goods to Great Britain&mdash;I speak of the pre-war period&mdash;and we import goods from her to the same value.  We obtain goods from countries other than Britain to the value of about £20,000,000 and we sell goods to those countries to the value of about £2,000,000.  The whole of the adverse trade balance created in that regard is met by dividends on English securities, the receipts which, formerly came to the Hospitals Trust, emigrants' remittances and other invisible exports. That is our position.</P>
      <P>One of the first difficulties we have to face arises from the fact that our industries absorb at least £20,000,000 worth of raw materials every year which cannot be procured here&mdash; certainly not during the war&mdash;and which can be substituted only by inferior commodities or commodities at greatly increased prices.  The cessation of these supplies would cause rapidly increasing unemployment.  The first point that obviously arises is that as long as we can maintain a satisfactory surplus export, without endangering the rest of our economic life, the more we shall be able to obtain such raw materials as are available for industry from abroad&mdash;materials which we cannot ourselves produce.  That answer one of the points made by Deputy Norton about being able to sell to our own people the whole of our agricultural produce.  If we look at the vast amount of raw materials which are required for our industries, we will see that, if we are to keep our people employed and our industries operating, we must export in order to obtain those raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of that £20,000,000 worth of goods which we import from countries other than Great Britain, about £8,000,000 worth have been cut off as a result of the European blockade.  We have to make every effort, under great difficulty, <Col N="565" /> to purchase that £8,000,000 worth of goods from America or from some other continent and also, as far as possible, to replace these poods by home-produced commodities such as home-grown feeding stuffs.  A very large proportion of the huge amount of snoods for which we pay by means of English dividends consists of foreign feeding stuffs which the Government are doing their best to have grown here.  It is surely a very wise step to conserve the maximum possible quantity of home-grown feeding stuffs in this country, even if it means a certain amount of suffering and a certain amount of difficulty to the farmers, since we have to pay for these feeding stuffs with English dividends on securities and assets abroad, all of which are at least hazardous items in our present circumstances.  Therefore, nothing could be more reasonable than the policy of the Government in conserving our feeding staffs.  No country with an economy so seriously dependent as ours is could desire in any way to reduce the stocks of goods which we are at present paying for with our invisible exports.  The Government will have to bear that in mind in considering the whole question of how far they are going to allow feeding stuffs to leave this country or to be released as a result of higher prices or any other circumstance.</P>
    <P>In the next place, we have taken powers to discriminate between imports and exports of one kind or another in order to meet a situation which might arise in which it would be difficult for us to purchase goods from countries other thaq England.  If the choice is between buying parts of motor cars and whatever quantity of wheat we cannot produce for ourselves, the Government have power to discriminate between articles of various kinds, and take into consideration every circumstance in connection with them.  So far as finance is concerned, members of the House are aware that the Government have absolute and complete dictatorial control of our entire financial airangements and our currency during the emergency.  They can alter our currency.  They can take any steps to control currency.  They can <Col N="566" /> purchase or sell gold or bullion, and they have even the right to take over whatever foreign securities are held by citizens of this country, at whatever price they declare to be reasonable, for the purpose of conserving supplies.  The Government have all the powers of a dictatorial State so far as our assets and finances are concfined, and I feel confident that, if they need to exercise these powers, they will do so in the interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Government have to try to strike a balance between a series of very difficult operations.  They have to prepare to allow for a decrease in our invisible exports.  All these assets from which we receive dividends from other countries every year may, as a result of the war, decline.  They have to try to accumulate such a supply of foodstuffs and commodities as would allow for that position.  They have to go on maintaining, as long as they can, the normal economic life of the country in order that we may purchase the goods we cannot produce for ourselves, and thus keep our industries going.  They have, at the same time, to ensure for farmers who have grown foodstuffs and produced live stock, an adequate return for their produce; and, at the same time, they have to prepare for the very serious situation that may arise in this country if a blockade entirely cut us off from all contact with the outer world.  Mercifully, we are an the position that, if we had to suffer a complete blockade, we could continue for a very considerable time on a very reduced standard of living to exist without starvation, or without serious impoverishment amounting to starvation. We are, luckily, in that position.  It would mean very serious unemployment; it would mean an iron ration in respect of many commodities; and it would mean the whole of the community having to make vast sacrifices for the sake of the poorer sections; but there is no doubt that, for a great number of months, we could survive in a condition of absolute blockade.</P>
    <P>I come now to one last point.  The Government have also to take into account what the situation may be should the war end in the near future <Col N="567" /> and, if the war ends under any circumstances, what the economic conditions of the other countries in the world are likely to be.  I can say this, that the more reserves of foodstuffs, commodities and raw materials we can maintain in this country, no matter how difficult the circumstances are, the better position we shall be in at the end of the war, because all those reserve commodities, all those reserve supplies, will be equivalent to currency which, by that time, may well have disappeared, or may well have lost its value, no matter what the result of the war be.  Many people who are in the wool trade know, for example, that one of the reasons for the accumulation by the British Government of the wool crop of practically the entire globe is that they regard wool in itself, apart from its use as a commodity for war purposes, as a very valuable currency should their own currency system break down. It is not a question of adopting any novel or particular form of currency, or of believing in any particular theory of currency, but simply that it was found to be a wise step to accumulate reserves of commodities in this country, even though it means limiting the wealth of the people of the country, and even though it means actually reducing the prosperity of certain sections.</P>
    <P>The House must realise that the Government have to bear all these factors, some of which are contradictory of each other, in mind.  If you keep too many food supplies in the country and hold back your food supplies too much from England or any other country, you reduce the amount of raw materials which you can purchase for industry, and thus create disemployment; on the other hand, if you allow food to go out too much and think too much in terms of export, you reduce the country's fundamental reserves.  I must believe that the Government, in face of enormous difficulties, are making a very fair effort at striking a balance between all these different factors, and I say again that it is an extremely complicated question, bound up with the economy we have inherited for generations and which it <Col N="568" /> is impossible to alter in a short period, with all sorts of circumstances attendant upon our very dependent economy, and that, having regard to all these facts, we are making a pretty good job of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to support the motion unequivocably because, in my opinion, it is one which ought per se to commend itself to all members, whether they sit on this side or on that side and whether the constituency they represent happens to be an urban or a rural constituency.  In July, 1939, I voiced the opinion that Great Britain, our great island neighbour, with her teeming millions of people, stood at the crossfoada of her history, that war was a question of, only a few weeks or a few months at the outside, and I argued along the line that once the campaign opened, it would become increasingly difficult for Britain to keep open her long and short sea trade-routes and to keep on tap her normally inexhaustible and conveniently priced sources of supply. I pointed out then that, in these circumstances, it might be that Britain's hour of danger would be Ireland's economic opportunity, and I, therefore, urged that it was the duty of the Government to develop our export trade in live stock and in foodstuffs generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a year and a half has passed since then and what has happened in that short period?  Experts have been proved very inexpert; theorists have been proved mere idealists; and old notions have been replaced by new notions.  A titanic struggle is now in progress on three continents and seven seas, and, in that struggle, our neutrality has been accepted and respected by all the belligerents.  We have been allowed to go our way in peace.  Nothing has occurred in our internal situation which could have prevented this country from developing in the field of agriculture.  Yet, in spite of this, here we are muddling along in the usual way, while the country is in a hopeless state from the economic point of view.  I cannot for the life of me see why, during the past <Col N="569" /> 12 months, agriculture has not developed to a much greater extent than it actually has, nor can I understand why our export trade in relation to our surplus agricultural produce has not reached a level unprecedented in the history of the country.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that Irish farmers cannot expect to reap the same rich harvest for their produce as they reaped during the last great European war.  That, I understand, is due to the fact that the price control system, in England is a rigid one, but, at the same time, small profits on increasingly large turnovers should satisfy everybody.</P>
    <P>Only last night I learned on the wireless that a prohibition had been imposed on the export of butter, and I understand that a similar prohibition was imposed this time last year. Surely there could be no need for the imposition of such a prohibition if production had improved to any appreciable extent, and I believe that the argument which applies to butter applies with equal force or could be made to apply to bacon and beef or any other agricultural product.  Practically all the items of food produced here are either on the list of rationed goods in England or have acquired a very high scarcity value since the difficulty arose in England of obtaining supplies of those goods as a result of the curtailment of supplies from Denmark and Holland.</P>
    <P>I can readily understand how it could be argued with a fair amount of reason that the failure of our people to develop agriculture to a much better extent is due to the fact that the British price controlling, system is not sufficiently elastic to encourage us to develop our production and export of agricultural goods, but I should rather think we ought to accept the line of argument that, when people want anything, and want it badly, they will pay not only a fair price, hut a good price, and in many eascc a high price.  I do not want for one moment to create the impression that we in this country should exploit the trials and troubles <Col N="570" /> of our neighbours, but, in a matter like this, by helping their supply problem, by increasing our agricultural activity, we are helping ourselves. Apart from whatever may be the position with regard to price controlling in England, I think it is well for us to bear in mind that English politicians have always been good business men, with a genius for compromise when compromise suited.  I would urge the Government to approach this problem realistically and materialistically, in so far as is consistent with our neutrality, and to take steps to improve the very bad economic position which has been allowed to persist in the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton's speech was the most blatant exposure of his ignorance of elementary economics that this House has ever witnessed.  He talked about consuming all our surplus agricultural production in this country. Now, if you got a ramrod, and packed every stomach in this country with the food we produce, we would still have a big surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we carried on our business here according to Deputy Norton's idea of economics, how would we pay for our imports of manures, seeds, agricultural machinery, industrial machinery, raw material for industry, coal, petrol, oil, concentrated foods, chemicals, motor cars, everything that we want, everything that a civilised country requires?  How does Deputy Norton propose to import those articles, or does he think that our neighbours would be so generous as to make us a present of them?  It was certainly the greatest lot of tripe I ever listened to in my life&mdash;that the food which we produce here in this country could be consumed at home.  We have to import certain commodities, and we must export in order to pay for them.  The unfortunate position actually is that we are not able to export sufficient to pay for our imports, and that, on balance, we have to make <Col N="571" /> that good by our investments abroad, emigrants' remittances, and the various kinds of invisible income which normally come to us.</P>
      <P>Some months ago when the extension of the war brought this country well within the war zone, all parties in the House lined up with the Government in a common defence policy. With such great danger imminent, no matter how much we differed from the Government on other matters we felt it was our duty to give full help and co-operation to those who were charged with the responsibility of preserving the lives and property of our people. We did this, and at the same time we reserved the right to differ from the Government on vital economic matters. No one can deny the fact that that unity and co-operation produced splendid results.  While I do not want to minimise the danger that is still there, I think the danger to some extent at all events has receded, but even if we cannot agree on that I think no observant Deputy in the House wili dispute the fact that the economic position sof our agricultural industry at the present time is a very difficult one, and that it is in the national interests to have this whole matter discussed here with a view to finding effective methods of dealing with the situation.</P>
      <P>The question of the disposal of our agricultural products has been agitating people's minds in recent months, and I view the present position with great concern.  Even at the time this House set up an Agricultural Commission, I telt that very little purpose would be served by the expansion of our agricultural production if we were limited, by the operation of quotas, in the disposal of our surplus in the only market available.  It appeared to me that no real effort was being made by the Government towards the removal or reduction of the operation of that restrictive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where our policy differs fundamentally from that of the Government is that we think that agriculture, being our primary industry and the mainstay of the State, should have a precedence <Col N="572" /> over all others; that its interest should not be subordinated to the interests of any secondary industry; that no secondary industry should be bolstered up at the expense of agriculture and that effective production can only be preserved and encouraged by the closest possible attention to the marketing of our surplus produce in order to secure the best possible advantages for our people.  With world competition so keen this work ought to be the paramount duty of the Minister for Agriculture and his Department.</P>
    <P>In seeking the fullest possible advantage for this country from the British market the late Kevin O'Higgins on one occasion assured our neighbours that our policy here was to produce articles that were consistently good rather than those that were occasionally excellent.  On amiother occasion, in order to focus public attention on the development of our exports, he said that we devoted almost all our attention to production and not nearly sufficient attention to marketing.</P>
    <P>The late Paddy Hogan, who believed in pig production for this country had one ambition in that respect, which was, tilat Irish bacon should become a quotable quantity on the British market.  What he meant by rtiat was: In normal times when the big bacon factors sit down in London on Monday morning to fix the price of bacon for the coming week they look to countries that could supply huge quantities of bacon and give regular landings.  Those countries are recognised as regular suppliers of the British market and hence those countries were the only importers that were quoted by those factors.  His ambition was to make this country a country recognised by those factors as a big supplier and a regular one.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we can see that during the period of office of the Government of which these men were members, no opportunity was missed in digging ourselves into that market and securing preference for our produce there whenever possible.  Notwithstanding the terrible economic blizzard that <Col N="573" /> swept all over the world towards the end of that period, this country weathered the storm in a remarkable way.  So much so that in a report on world conditions published by the League of Nations in 1931 our economic position was most favourably commented upon.  During that period, a period, as I pointed out before, of world depression, we did at times suffer from bad prices and from difficult periods, but we had unfettered access to that market for the full scope of our production and we had a right to buy any manufactured goods that we required in any country in the world.</P>
    <P>One of the penalties of the economic war was the quota, the greatest curse and the greatest barrier, to my mind, to the expansion of agricultural production that this country has ever experienced. We always believed there was only one market open to us, and our policy was to get a preference for our goods there.  The policy of the present Government was to charge a higher price to our own people in order to subsidise the export of cheap bacon to the British.</P>
    <P>Last September 12 months the war began.  During that time, on several occasions, from these benches the Minister for Agriculture was advised to go over personally and make a trade deal, a long-term one, if possible, with the British.  He showed no inclination whatever to do so.  He left our bacon trade to the risk of a month to month arrangement made by civil servants over the telephone.  What happened? The Canadians in the meantime chipped in, and they made a deal to supply the British with 1,000,000 lbs. of bacon weekly.  Realising that owing to the operations of the war in Europe their market for surplus wheat would be cut away, they took the precaution of intensifying their pig production on their surplus wheat and cheap maize from the Argentine, and selling that bacon in the British market.  We simply sat down.  The Minister for Agriculture sat down and made no attempt whatever to secure our portion of the market.  He simply sat here in his office and let the market slip between his <Col N="574" /> fingers.  He did not listen to our advice, as usual, and the country lost by it.</P>
    <P>Two of our Ministers eventually went ovur last May, after the fall of Denmark and Holland, and while the battle of France was still on.  The time, obviously, was inopportune.  The British people were concerned with military operations, and the situation was so involved that they were not disposed to have a discussion on the matter. Our Ministers came back empty-handed. Our quota for the export of fat cattle to the British market was reduced to 2,000 a week, one might say, on the very same day that the British placed a contract in the Argentine for £25,000,000 worth of meat. This contract consisted of 150,000 tons of fresh meat, 70,000 tons of corned beef, 330,000 tons of frozen meat, 50,000 tons of mutton, 25,000 tons of offal, 10,000 tons of pork.</P>
    <P>To a question put down by me on the 16th October, the Minister could not give any information as to when the period of the reduction of the fat stock quota would expire.  He indicated to the House that the arrangement was voluntary.  In that case one would expect that the Minister would be in a position to give information as to when the period would expire.  If the Minister were doing his job properly, obviously, if the British asked his Department to agree to a voluntary reduction, the obvious question for the Irish to put would be: &ldquo;For what period?&rdquo; But the Minister made no inquiry whatever.  He agreed to a voluntary reduction, and could not give our people any information as to how long that restriction on the exportation of our live stock was going to operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a great advocate of tillage and we can only carry on tillage operations in this or any other country by the intensive feeding of live stock, and fat stock especially, during the winter period.  If the Minister has the interest in the tillage farmer that he professes to have&mdash;I give him credit that he has&mdash;at least he should appreciate the necessity of informing the farmer before he ties up his bullocks <Col N="575" /> what is the quota position likely to be. When I put down that simple question he was not able to answer it.</P>
    <P>Those are the difficulties that our agricultural people are labouring under.  From a report of his speech to his constituents in County Wexford, published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 22nd October, it was obvious that the Minister feared a reduction in the quota for bacon next year. He concluded by saying that the Government will use every effort to negotiate the most favourable trade agreement possible for next year.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the chaotic condition of the pig market. The pigs commission are being pressed from all over the country to send their representatives to purchase pigs because the normal channels of trade have broken down and because the farmer was not receiving the fixed price through those normal channels. The Minister is responsible for that position because he encouraged people to go in for pig production 12 months ago and he made no effort to secure a market for them.</P>

      <P>It is true that the situation has been relieved to some extent by the announcement of an increase in the quota of live pigs from 1,000 a week to 1,500.  But, when you compare the 1,500 a week, which we now enjoy, with the total of 476,399 that were exported in 1931&mdash;an average of 9,160 pigs a week&mdash;then the picture is a pitiable one.  Notwithstanding that increase to 1,500, the Minister tells us that he did not encourage our people to go into pig production.  During all that time our exportable surplus of bacon has been round, about 800,000 cwts. a year. You had normal fluctuations up and down, but in 1931 and prior to that year, we were exporting 500,000 cwts. As a matter of fact, from 1924 to 1931 our exports increased from 327,353 live pigs, plus the 600,000 cwts., to 476,399. In the year 1938, the last year for which we have a full return, we exported approximately 500,000 cwts. of bacon, but our live pig export had fallen from almost 500,000 to 45,000. In other words, our live pig export in 1938 had practically vanished.  That is the position.</P>

      <P>What the Minister wants to concern himself about is, are we going to be restricted to the present output, or will he make an effort to have it extended?  One thing that evolved from the economic war was the accursed quota system.  A lot has been said about the extension of the industry.  We have heard a good deal from Deputy Childers about it.  If the Deputy would only go down and do some little job in rural Ireland and not come in here to lecture practical farmers, he might have some opportunity of talking with personal experience. The New Zealand production, he says, is a red lamp of warning to our agriculturists, the inference being that our people are no good or are too lazy to expand production. What is the good of expanding production if we have no market for our <Col N="577" /> produce?  That is the situation and you people are responsible for it.</P>
      <P>The system that operates&mdash;a temporary system, I hope&mdash;of sending in pigs to the pig commission's representative in the factories is better, I admit, than leaving the pips on the people's hands, but there are tremendous discrepancies occurring.  I have letters, which I will hand to the Minister later, showing very substantial discrepancies in the weight of pigs sent to the factories hy certain individuals. In the case of one progressive farmer who weighed his pigs on each occasion, the loss was at first only 7 lbs. per pig, but it went up to 16 lbs.  That represented the difference between his live-weight register before the pigs were sent to the factory and the factory weight a little later.  That is a matter with which I would like the Minister to deal.</P>
      <P>Speaking to his constituents in Wexford, he promised a favourable trade agreement.  One is tempted to ask the Minister if this is going to be another arrangement made by civil servants over the telephone, or will be pluck up courage and go across in order to get a decent deal for our people?  If the present position continues, and if there is no extension in the quota, the next thing the Minister will be advocating is the slaughter of young pigs, just the same as he slaughtered the calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have undoubtedly some useful bargaining weapons when we are dealing with the British.  We have our proximity to Great Britain, reducing risk from submarine activity practically to a minimum.  None of our boats was struck yet except one, the &ldquo;Lady Meath&rdquo;, which by accident struck a mine.  There is our willingness to produce any agricultural commodity they require at a reasonable profit. There is the fact that we are one of Britain's best customers and there is the necessity, from a financial point of view, for Great Britain to maintain her trade here.  Notwithstanding that we have all these points definitely in our favour as a medium of negotiation, the Government have made no effort to secure the market for our agricultural produce, not to talk of a market for <Col N="578" /> our expanding production.  In view of the Government's failure to make that effort, one can clearly understand why the Minister dismissed the Agricultural Commission set up with the approval of the House to find ways and means of expanding agricultural production. He was logical enough to realise that there was no damn use in expanding agricultural production if you had no market for it.</P>
    <P>Any man who has an elementary idea of our economic position knows that our interests can best be protected during this period and during the postwar period by making a long-term trade agreement&mdash;if that is at all possible. If the Minister fails, no one can blame him, but we do blame him for not making an effort, and he has not made an effort in that direction.  There was an opportunity at the beginning of the war to go over and make an offer to our neighbour and say: &ldquo;We are willing and anxious to produce any food you require, at a reasonable price.&rdquo; That opportunity was missed but let us hope it is not yet too late.</P>
    <P>How has the Minister looked after prices for us?  This is a point on which representations were made to the Minister before and about which we feel rather strongly.  When the fixation of prices and the basis on which the British Controller would accept our live stock were being arranged between the two countries, we sent over a civil servant, a man who had spent all his life-time in a Government office and who had no real contact with the agricultural community at all.  He was sent across to settle all these questions on his own responsibility.  We absolutely disapprove of methods such as that.  We have said over and over again to the Minister that it is his job to go over personally and arrange these matters.  If he wants assistance let him bring the experts of the Department with him or, if he has not got these experts within the Department, let him go outside and get people in the cattle trade who have a definite interest and a first-hand knowledge of all these questions to advise him.</P>
    <P>Take the price of fat rattle for <Col N="579" /> instance.  The British and the North of Ireland price for fat cattle is 61/- per cwt.  Our price there is 50/6&mdash;a difference of 10/6 per cwt.  The difference, therefore, in the price of a 12-cwt. fat bullock is £6 6s.  On the 18th November the British and Northern Ireland price will go up by a further 6d. per cwt.  That, of course, is only 6/- on the price of a 12-cwt fat bullock but it is something.  Our price will not alter; it will remain static.  So on the 18th November, the British and North of Ireland fat bullock will be worth £6 12s. more than ours.  What has the Minister done about that?  What does he intend to do about it?  As I put it to him before, he is encouraging tillage in this country and, in the interests of tillage, it is absolutely essential that our farmers should feed live stock and especially fat cattle if they are to have good farmyard manure.  The feeding of fat cattle is the best means the farmer can adopt to produce rich farmyard manure.</P>
    <P>I know big tillage farmers in South Kildare, probably some of the best farmers in the British Isles, farming on a very large scale, men feeding over 300 bullocks each.  They have to go out and buy in competition with men who are buying stores for the British farmers. They have to sell their fat cattle afterwards in competition with British farmers who have a pull of £6 12s. in the price of a 12 cwt. bullock. As I have explained, there is that discrepancy in the relative prices. How can that be done?  Has the picture been properly put up to the British Controller?  Has he been told that our people cannot be expected to produce beef under these conditions? We are all aware of the fact that fat sheep are worth from 10/- to 15/- more in Northern Ireland than they are here.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of wool, Deputy Dillon gave the House his views on that question. I am not going into the details beyond referring to the fact that the Minister for Supplies to-night stated that no one was prevented from selling and that we could sell wool in Holland at a good price.  I know two men who were in terested in this question.  I can vouch for one in particular who came to me last February complaining very bitterly that our Government would not give him a licence to export wool when he could get a good price for it.  The Minister says that is wrong.  Would the Minister tell me what motive that man could have in telling me a deliberate lie&mdash;a decent merchant who wanted to export wool and who was refused a licence?  That started a very disturbing thought in my mind.</P>
      <P>What was the motive behind the refusal to allow our people to avail of a market that was there for our surplus wool?  I am in agreement with Deputy Dillon on that matter.  I believe there was some motive behind the Minister's action, that representations were made to him by other interests in the matter and again, to be consistent in his attitude against Irish agriculture, he was prepared to sink Irish agricultural interests for industrial interests.  A market has been developed in America I believe and, no thanks to the Minister for Supplies, we are disposing of some of our wool there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of eggs, we stressed to the Minister for Agriculture over 12 <Col N="581" /> months ago the necessity of developing our egg industry.  Deputy Dillon talked at great length to-day about the necessity of encouraging day-old chicks.  There was a valuable trade in this country in eggs before the present Government came into office.  We exported in 1930 £3,750,000 worth.  The export dwindled in 1937 to £750,000, that is the export dropped by £3,000,000 in seven years.  For the last couple of years, the export value of eggs has been on the upward grade again.  The people who were squeezing us out of the British market were Denmark and Holland.  Holland in 1932 exported 1,000,000 great hundreds of eggs and, in the period immediately before the war, their exports had increased by eight times that figure. They had increased from 1,000,000 to 8,000,000 great hundreds.  Both Denmark and Holland have disappeared from the market for the duration of the war and this is the only country to which Britain can now look for supplies of fresh eggs, apart from home-produced eggs.  Surely to goodness, there is now an opportunity to encourage our people to go in for extensive egg production, to go much further even than to recover the ground we lost because we can multiply our present trade by six and have a market for it.  What is the position?  The Minister is absolutely silent.  There is no appeal or drive whatever from his Department.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of egg production I make one suggestion to the Minister.  I do not know whether it is possible to adopt it or not.  The county instructresses are in charge of our egg production.  They have all the technical knowledge and skill necessary to promote it.  We have some very excellent girls, but whether a girl does her best, or merely does as much as she is bound to do, she gets the same payment.  I think that that system is absolutely wrong.  There should be some incentive to make these girls work.  I suggest that they should be paid a nominal salary and that, in addition, they should get some bonus on production.</P>
    <P>If they are able to work up the production in their icspective counties <Col N="582" /> they should get a bonus for increasing that production.  There should be definitely some attraction held out to these county instructresses to increase production. A girl who starts with all the enthusiasm that she possibly can display, and works for four or five years, may see a girl in a neighbouring county gallivanting round the country doing very little, with the result that she simply cases off, and that is the end of it.  If the position were as I suggest, these instructresses should be paid a fixed nominal salary and a percentage on the increased output in their county.  Things would then be much more attractive from their point of view.  I suggest that the Minister should consider that proposal.  Where an instructress can work up production, she is entitled to be paid for the energy she puts into it.</P>
    <P>Dealing with grain, last year, because of the emergency, an appeal was made to the farmers to till more land and produce more food.  Later, the Compulsory Tillage Order was made, and I think our people responded to the call remarkably well.  We had a 21.4 per cent. increase in wheat over the previous year, a 27 per cent. increase in oats, an 84.2 per cent. increase in barley, a 15.5 per cent. increase in potatoes, a 5.8 per cent. increase in turnips, and an 11.9 per cent. increase in mangolds.</P>

      <P>I do not think I would have great difficulty in making what I propose to say relevant to the debate which has just been interrupted, but, in deference to the views expressed this afternoon, and to prevent anv possibility of misunderstanding, I think it is perhaps better that I should deal with the matter as a completely separate and unconnected affair.  I think that every Deputy, when he read <Col N="583" /> the statement of the British Prime Minister with reference to our ports, must have wondered somewhat.  I do not know whether everybody was prepared to take that statement in the way that I was prepared to take it, as a simple, perhaps natural, expression of regret, or whether it portended something more.  I would have refrained from making any comment upon it were it not that it has been followed by an extensive Press campaign dn Britain itself, and re-echoed an the United States of America, the purport of the campaign being that we should surrender or lease our ports to Britain for the conduct of the war.</P>
      <P>Now, the aim of our Government uniformly has been to try to bring about good relations between the people of this island and the people of the adjoining island.  It has been the prime, the fundamental motive of most of the things which we did.  We realised that these good relations could only be based on the recognition by Britain of our fundamental rights by removing causes which, over the centuries, have made the history of the relations of our two countries such tragic reading. In pursuit of that object we strove with the British Government to get a complete agreement with regard to all the outstanding issues between us.  We succeeded to the extent that with the exception of one outstanding matter, fundamental no doubt, we had settled those outstanding differences in such a way that, if that could only be settled, we could say that the quarrel of the centuries had been ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, that outstanding matter, the matter of Partition, which affects so deeply every man and every woman of Irish blood throughout the world, was left unsettled, and it remained unsettled at the outset of this war.  But we had settled the points of difference so far as the immediate territory under the jurisdiction of this Government was concerned, and we had hoped that these matters were settled for ever and that never again was there going to be any question of the right of the people of this <Col N="584" /> part of Ireland to exercise complete sovereignty over this territory and to be able to choose the policy which would best seem to serve the interests of the community that lived in the territory.</P>
    <P>No doubt, giving us back what was our own may appear to many to have put a burden upon those who gave it back.  To restore that which has been taken does, I suppose, always imply a sacrifice for those who restore it.  But, if justice is to be done, that sacrifice has to be faced and we fully expected that, not merely on the part of the British Government but on the part of the British people, that was completely and fully understood.  I want to say before I say much more that, up to the present certainly, it has been understood and that there has not been since the beginning of this war a single suggestion that this community of ours was not entitled to act as we have acted and to remain out of this war.</P>
    <P>It is because I am anxious that that should continue that I am choosing this opportunity to address the House and to speak to our people and to the people of the adjoining island.  We have chosen the policy of neutrality in this war because we believed that it was the right policy for our people. It is the policy which has been accepted, not merely by this House, but by our people as a whole, and nobody who realises what modern war means, and what it means particularly for those who have not sufficient air defences, will have the slightest doubt that that policy was the right one, apart altogether from any questions of sympathy on one side or the other.</P>
    <P>Now, as I have said, we want friendly relations with the people of Britain, as we want friendly relations with all other peoples, but we naturally want them with Britain because Britain is the nearest country to us on the globe. We have many relations of various kinds which make it desirable that the two peoples should live in friendship. It was partly for that reason, and partly because I knew perfectly that it was a condition of neutrality, that, years before we came into office and several times since we came into office, I announced that it would be our policy <Col N="585" /> to use our strength to the utmost to sec that this island was not going to be used as a basis of attack upon Britain.  We have never swerved in the slightest from that declaration. Everything that we could do has been done to make sure that that policy would be made as effective as it was within our power to make it.</P>
    <P>Before the war, in order to increase our strength and so put us in a better position to make sure that, in the event of a war and in the event of our declaring our neutrality, as I expected we would, we should be in a position to see that that neutrality would be respected by all belligerents, we tried to get arms.  We sought them in America; we sought them in Britain; we sought them on the Continent even, and it is no fault of the Government if our armaments are not even several times stronger than they are.  We did not ask to be given a present of these arms, we were prepared to buy them, and to the extent to which they were on offer either here or in the United States of America, we have purchased them.  There has been no want of faith, good faith, as far as we are concerned. We have abided by our public as well as by our private promises.  It is a lie to say that German submarines or any other submarines are being supplied with fuel or provisions on our coasts.  A most extensive system of coast observation has been established here since the war.  I say it is a lie, and I say further that it is known to be a falsehood by the British Government itself.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I now come to the question of our ports.  There can be no question of the handing over of these ports so long as this State remains neutral.  There can be no question of leasing these ports.  They are ours.  They are within our sovereignty, and there can be no question, as long as we remain neutral, of handing them over on any condition whatsoever. Any attempt to bring pressure to bear on us by any side&mdash;by any of the belligerents&mdash;by Britain&mdash;could only lead to bloodshed.</P>
    <P>Certainly, as long, as this Government loinains in office, we shall defend our rights in regard to these ports <Col N="586" /> against whoever shall attack them, as we shall defend our rights in regard to every other part ot our territory.  It would be a strange thing, indeed, if the reason for an attack upon our ports should be that they would be useful. If that is a good reason, then I suppose it is universally a good reason, and it is not necessary for me to point the moral by saying where or for whom.</P>
    <P>I want to say to our people that we may be&mdash;I hope not&mdash;facing a grave crisis.  If we are to face it, then we shall do it, anyhow, knowing that our cause is right and just and that, if we have to die for it, we shall be dying in that good cause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking, Sir, of the grain situation, and I pointed out the various increases that have been effected last year as a result of the Compulsory Tillage Order.  One thing I should like to say to the Minister is that if farmers aie compelled to till they should at least he provided with a market.  I would go further than that and say that they should be guaranteed a price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Replying to a supplementary question yesterday regarding the surplus barley available, over and above brewing and distilling requirements, the Minister stated that it was not their policy to encourage the growing of oats and barley, that they had advised the people to grow wheat, and if they departed from that advice it was their own responsibility, and that in any case, it was a speculative crop.  If it is a speculative crop why did the Minister interfere by doming these people the right to sell it at a speculative price? That is their grouse.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is unwise in his policy in preventing the exportation of barley as from the information at his disposal he is, probably, in a better position to decide that question, but it is grossly unfair to individual fanners to ask them to finance a policy of reserving food supplies.  I suggest that <Col N="587" /> if it is in the national interest to reserve food supplies for live stock, then the grain ought to be pooled and a fair and reasonable price paid to the owners.  I know several men who cannot sell their barley.  They are hawking it around from merchant to merchant trying to sell it even at 18/- or 19/- a barrel.  I know men with 200 barrels, and others with 300 barrels, who have been able to sell only 50 or 60 barrels where merchants tried to meet them.</P>
    <P>What is the position now?  Side by side with these men are neighbours who, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, threshed early.  In some cases they were big farmers who had more than one day's threshing and they were able to get a thresher.  They got their barley on the market in time to be covered by the Guinness quota, while small farmers who were not able to secure a machine in time, but had barley of as good malting quality as that, for which some of their neighbours sold at 30/- a barrel, are now in the position that they cannot cash it. That happened through no fault on their part.  There is a good export market for that crop in England where some barley is fetching 54/- a barrel. I admit that the quality of some English barley may be superior, and more suitable for the manufacture of light ales than Irish barley, but there is a market in England at 30/- a barrel for our barley.  I am not suggesting that all the barley available should be exported.  The Minister's Department could determine what quantities of barley and oats are required here and the surplus could be exported.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar problem faced the Minister last summer when there was a surplus of oats.  The Minister, however, imported a quantity of Canadian oats in the spring and some of it is still at the North Wall.  No attempt appears to have been made by the Department to deal with the situation. There was a huge crop of oats here this year.  The increased acreage represented 27 per cent.  It is obvious that the Minister should have cleared off the surplus in order to make way <Col N="588" /> for the new crop coming on the market, Merchants cannot handle this season's crop because their stores are already full of oats.  The Minister asked why the people did not take his advice and sow wheat.  Does he not know that there are large areas of poor land unable to grow wheat but on which it is easy to grow oats and barley?  Such land cannot grow economic wheat crops.  Last year 1,329,900 acres of cereals were grown, and if to that is added the increased acreage that will come under the new tillage order, there will be considerably increased crops next season.  Eight hundred thousand acres would represent our requirements in wheat.</P>
    <P>In order to continue growing wheat a rotation policy is necessary as the land requires good dressings of farm-yard manure.  As a matter of fact a good crop of wheat can only be grown following a root crop when the land is well dressed with farm-yard manure. In addition, as there is a serious shortage of artificial manures this year, it would not be advisable to ask farmers to grow wheat on poor land.  Even if they took that advice, would there be sufficient seed available?  It is inconceivable that we should put all the land under wheat as the produce would be more than our requirements. The majority of people who are forced to sow oats and barley have poor land that is unsuitable for wheat.  They have no choice in the matter.  They grow oats and barley because their land is able to produce these crops. These people are not in a position to have consumed on the farms the grain they grow.  It is a surplus crop and must be sold as a cash crop.</P>
    <P>There is an exportable market for barley at present at a decent price, but the Minister denies that market to people who have barley because he considers that it is not good policy to export food that might be required later for the feeding of live stock.  I am not disputing that decision of the Minister.  It may be sound policy, but I disagree with him in asking individual farmers to finance that policy.  If it ih good national policy let the nation finance it, but do not ask <Col N="589" /> individual farmers to foot the bill by selling their grain at unremunerative prices.  The Minister should pool that grain and fix a fair price for it. Licences were given to merchants to buy wheat and similarly licences could be given to merchants to handle barley and oats.  That is the way the matter should he dealt with.  It is an unfortunate situation when one man with a parcel of barley as good as his neighbour's finds that he is offered 12/- a barrel less than the other man got.</P>
    <P>There are farmers in South Kildare to-day with 500 and 600 barrels on their farms and if they had to sell at 10/- a barrel less than their neighbours got, it would represent over a couple of hundred pounds.  That would be a very substantial sum for any farmer to contemplate losing.  The Minister can see what injustice it would be, especially when there is a market available if he permitted the grain to be exported.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the whole position.  Messrs. Guinness promised last year to buy 400,000 barrels of barley but later on they increased their purchases, of their own accord, to 450,000 and then they bought a final quota of 50,000, making 500,000.  What struck me as rather peculiar as that, of the 50,000 final lot of barley that Messrs.  Guinness bought, 25,000 was ear-marked for County Wexford.  Whether it was mere coincidence or not, it looked strange that it went to the Minister's own constituency, and the rest of the unfortunate farmers of the country had to do without.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister do his own job and our farmers will be able to save their crops.  Let him get the price and the market and they can do the rest.  We put down this motion because we feel there is urgent need for stocktaking in our agricultural affairs.  I suggest that the Minister must pay more personal attention to our interests and our export market. If he compels farmers under a Compulsory Tillage Order to till more land, he should, at least, subsidise the production of that crop, as is done in Northern Ireland or in England, or fix a guaranteed price.  I would prefer that he should fix a guaranteed price as, in so far as subsidising in Northern Ireland is concerned, £2 per acre where new land is broken is rather unfair to the old tillage farmer.</P>
      <P>If it is in the national interest to reserve such grain, it should be reserved at the national cost, and not at the cost of the individual farmer.  If the farmer has to pay higher taxes, higher rates, higher wages, and cope with a higher cost of living, and meet the sheriff for his annuities; if he is to weather this present very difficult period, his interests must be looked after better by the Minister, and the burdens that he has to shoulder at the present time in the way of taxation must be reduced to the minimum.</P>

      <P>I think it would be as well to give the Dáil my estimate of the normal production under various headings, and of the home consumption, and of our surplus for export, so that we may get a picture of how the marketing of our various products stands at the moment.  I do not know whether Deputies might get an impression from the speeches made here by some members of the Opposition that we found it impossible to market our produce. When we come down to examine the figures, we find that our big trouble is not so much to market the produce: our big trouble really is that of price.  On looking through the figures for some years past, we estimate that the average number of fat cattle produced yearly is about 300,000 head, taking grass-fed cattle and stall-fed <Col N="591" /> cattle.  Our home consumption of beef would account for 170,000 of them.</P>

There was no such thing as a quota on fat cattle up to quite recently, but five or six weeks ago a quota was put on of 2,000 per week.  Unfortunately, it was put on at a time when, in the normal way, we would have our biggest exports.  We have, however, been able to deal with that question in a fairly satisfactory way.  The exporters and the shipping companies and so on have co-operated as far as possible.  By taking only the very fat cattle for export as beef, I think the exporters have succeeded, in co-operation with the shipping companies and the Department, in relieving any real hardship amongst producers.  After another few weeks it will be found that the number of fat cattle for export will hardly exceed the 2,000, and, of course, when we come as far as March, there certainly will be no difficulty whatever, as we would not, in the normal way, have as many as 2,000 to export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was put to me as to how long these restrictions are going to continue.  I must say I do not know. Deputy Hughes blames me for not being able to give the information that is in the mind of the Minister of Food in England.  I cannot get the information from him.  I do not know whether Deputy Hughes would be able to get it by some magic method or other, if he were over here.  Naturally, we have asked the British Government for that information, but we have not got it and we cannot get it unless we use other means, and we are not going to use other means in the way of physical pressure or anything like that. In the beginning we had hoped that it was a temporary arrangement that would not last for all time.  It was due <Col N="592" /> to a surplus of fresh beef on the market in Great Britain.  It was a time of the year when a lot came on from their own producers and here, and they were not able to deal with the amount of fresh beef that came on.  When this season of very big production is over, that restriction relating to fat cattle in all probability will be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The next item is store cattle, of which we export about 500,000.  To speak of the consumption of store cattle at home is impossible, as we have no idea at all of the number which change from one farm to another, and which would really be home consumption.  In the case of store cattle, all we can do is to estimate according to the proportion exported.  We are exporting about 500,000.  There ts no restriction on the export of store cattle and, therefore, we conclude that that is the output, as far as the country, taken as one farm, would be concerned.</P>
    <P>We produce about 850,000 sheep and lambs in the year for slaughter.  We consume at home about 500,000 and that leaves 350,000 for export.  There, again, there was no restriction up to some weeks ago.  It was put on at the same time and for the same reason as in the case of fat cattle.  The quota in the case of sheep and lambs was not proportionately as favourable as that in the case of cattle and that is why there is more dissatisfaction under the heading of sheep than cattle.  The system of export is similar for the two.  Figures are given by the shipping companies of the proportion of cattle exports shipped by each individual over a certain period last year and also during the month preceding the introduction of these restrictions this year.  That was to cover any person who might possibly come into the trade in the meantime; he would get some share, at least, of the trade now.  These two months&mdash; this time last year and the month preceding the restriction this year&mdash;were taken and that proportion runs through every exporter's licence or permit.  That is what every exporter's licence or permit is based on.  I think it is a perfectly fair system and that it would not be possible to depart from it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> I remember that, when we were dealing with the export of cattle before, I had a consultative council set up consisting of various people&mdash;some exporters, some butchers, some farmers&mdash; and I made an attempt on that occasion to keep back a certain number of the licences and consult these people about hard cases to whom they might be given; but the number of hard cases was so great that one would really need to keep all the licences in order to deal with them.  I am afraid we will have to let things go on as they are.  Let the shipping companies supply the figures; there is a committee there consisting of representatives of the shipping companies and the producers and they go through figures supplied and really their only job is to multiply&mdash;a small job in mathematics&mdash; and give out the licences.  I am afraid we cannot depart from that.  For the last few years our export of pigs was about 66,000.  The figure may have been what Deputy Hughes says ten or 12 years ago, but that is not the position now.  There was no restriction on the export of pigs for the last four or five years until quite recently, except those intended for bacon.  Evidently, in the course of trade, the number of live pigs exported dwindled to about 66,000.  What happened was that the only live pig which an exporter could export economically was the heavy type of pig.  He could not compete against the factories here with pigs under 16 stone live weight.  This year we will export about 52,000.  There is a slight restriction, but it is not of any great importance as compared to bacon which I will come to later.  Our bacon factories produce about 1,200,000 cwts. of bacon.</P>

      <P>It is the Pigs and Bacon <Col N="594" /> Export Committee.  It has the same personnel as the Pigs and Bacon Commission. The bacon factories, as I have said, have produced about 1,200,000 cwts. of bacon.  Our home consumption is about 560,000 cwts.  That leaves a surplus of 640,000 cwts.  Our quota this year is 560,000 cwts.  We had therefore, a surplus of about 80,000 cwts.  Deputy Hughes talked about going over to the British and making a bargain with them.  We have got 133/6d. per cwt. for 500,000 cwts., and we can export over and above that at the Canadian price.  The Deputy talked about the bargain that Canada had made and asked why we did not do the same.  We did better than Canada.  We got a special price for 500,000 cwts. of bacon. We may not get it again.  We got 133/6d.  We could export another 500,000 cwts., if we had them, at the Canadian price.  We have exported 60,000 cwts. at the Canadian price, but it is not a paying price.  We could not possibly sell bacon to Great Britain at about 100/- per cwt. considering the price of feeding stuffs here.  In that regard Canada may be in a different position from us.  For maize and other things, Canada may not have to meet the increased prices that we have. They have not to meet the greatly increased freights that we have for our feeding stuffs, and, therefore, they can produce bacon at practically prewar costs.  We cannot do that, and, therefore, we cannot sell our bacon at Canadian price.</P>

      <P>I understand it does. With regard to pork, the amount exported is very small and has been for some few years.  Our exports of pig offals amount to about 40,000 cwts. per year.  I am not sure what the total output is, but that is the figure for exports.  These exports are going out without restriction at present.  Taking <Col N="595" /> dressed beef and veal and canned meat, I think we can say their production is about normal, and that the exports are about normal.  Only odd lots of mutton and lamb are being exported.  Of our total production of potatoes, 98 per cent. is consumed at home.  Of the remainder, we exported about 45,000 tons, of which 28,000 tons were seed.  We produce 1,800 tons of flax.  The entire output of flax has been taken by the British Ministry of Supply.  Our total output of wool is about 16,000,000 lbs., and of that about 4,000,000 lbs. is consumed at home. The rest is available for export.  I do not know how much has gone out.  The Minister for Supplies has already dealt with the question of wool.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of creamery butter, the output is about 720,000 cwts.  We consume about 460,000 cwts., and we have about 240,000 cwts. for export.  There is no restriction on the quantity of creamery butter that we can send to Britain, but we are getting a very poor price.  In the case of non-creamery butter, it is estimated that we produce about 500,000 cwts., that we consume about 450,000 cwts. and prewar had for export about 50,000 cwts. About, half the exports went to the United Kingdom and the other half to various countries, some being sold as ships' stores and in various other ways. Some part of that trade has been maintained to countries outside Great Britain.  Great Britain is very reluctant to take any of this non-creamery butter.  They have taken some this year.  The output of cheese is about 40,000 cwts.  We consume at home something over 50 per cent.  The remainder is taken by Great Britain. There is no restriction on that.  We produce about 136,000 cwts. of condensed skim milk.  We consume at home about 27,000 cwts., and therefore we have about 110,000 cwts. for export. This is also taken by Great Britain. In the rase of condensed full-cream milk, we produce over 50,000 cwts.  We consume over 20,000 cwts., and we have practically 30,000 cwts. for export, <Col N="596" /> which is taken by Great Britain.  We produce about 5,500 cwts. of dried skim milk.  That is all used at home.  As regards dried full cream milk, we produce about 11,000 cwts., we consume at home about 3,000 cwts. and export about 8,000 cwts.  The export of creamy has been stopped since 1st October.</P>
      <P>In the case of poultry, we produce almost 1,000,000 turkeys in the year. About half of these are consumed at home, and the other half exported.  We produce 780,000 geese and only export about 100,000.  We produce 680,000 ducks and consume about 660,000. We export only 20,000.  We produce 7,000,000 fowls.  We consume over 5,000,000, and we export less than, 2,000,000.  In the ease of eggs, we produce about 8,200,000 great hundred; of hen eggs; we consume about 5,700,000 great hundreds, and we export abouts 2,500,000 great hundreds.  We produce about 830,000 great hundreds of duck eggs; we consume about 662,000 great hundreds, and export 168,000 great hundreds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a rather tedious summary of figures, but it is no harm perhaps to have it on the records for Deputies to study later if they wish to.  I think they will see that our position is this: that we are not restricted in regard to quantity except in the case of bacon&mdash;I mean restricted unduly except in the, case of bacon and temporarily, I hope, in the case of fat cattle, sheep and pigs.  If that is only temporary, then the restriction that we have to deal with applies to bacon only.  Deputy Dillon appears to think that some of our prices are satisfactory, particularly in the case of eggs.  As regards eggs it may be all right at the moment, but I personally think that all prices are a bit too low&mdash;some of them much too low and others a bit too low.  I need not go into them in detail. Taking the year round, the price offered for eggs is not sufficient to encourage producers to go into greater production.  It may be sufficient to keep them where they are.  Certainly, the price for fat cattle is not sufficient, taking the year round.  It may be satisfactory at this season when there is usually a slump in prices.  It may <Col N="597" /> not be too bad, comparatively speaking, during the months of October and November but, for the rest of the year, it is not satisfactory.  The price of dairy products is entirely unsatisfactory and it would he impossible to get the farmer to continue in dairying were it not for the system of subsidy and so forth which we have adopted.</P>
    <P>Points were raised by Deputy Dillon with regard to wool, manure and onions.  His contention was that we had sacrificed the interest of the agricultural community in favour of some industrial group or other.  That is not true.  The Minister for Supplies dealt very fully with wool.  I do not think that it is necessary to go into that matter again.  He also dealt fairly fully with manures and I do not think I could add anything to what he said in that connection.  With regard to onions, I should like to support what the Minister for Supplies said before he left the House&mdash;that if any blame attached, it was to be placed entirely on my shoulders, as Minister for Agriculture. I think the Minister for Supplies did ask me what the idea was in prohibiting the export of onions.  He, evidently, did not appreciate what reason there could be.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture got certain people going on the growing of onions four or five years ago and they could never have got a decent return for those people if onions were permitted to come in.  We had to keep out foreign onions.  We had to keep the price of the home-grown onions up to such a figure as would give the growers a fair return.  If they got up to 10/- or 12/- a cwt., they might continue in the business.  The yield averages from six to ten tons.  Ten tons would be a very good yield.  The big majority would get six tons and 10/- or 12/- a cwt. would, probably, be sufficient to induce these people to go on growing onions.</P>
    <P>For the past three or four years, we had to compel the merchants in the cities of Cork, Dublin and elsewhere to pay higher prices for their onions in order to get onions grown in this country.  This war will not last for <Col N="598" /> ever and, when it is over, the growers of Castlegregory and elsewhere will come back to the City of Dublin for their market.  They will net go to Liverpool or Manchester.  They will come back to Dublin or Cork.  It is very short-sighted policy for Deputy Dillon and Deputy Miiglies to urge that we should allow all these unions out this year to Liverpool or Belfast, let the merchants get £60 a ton. for them &mdash;I do not know what the growers would get&mdash;and leave no onions in Dublin, Cork or the other Irish cities from that time on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would they get £60 a ton?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have got £60 in Belfast some time ago. What would be the result if we permitted that?  The consumers here would, naturally, resent it.  They would say: &ldquo;We have supported these people for the past four or five years by paying an enhanced price for onions and now, during this emergency, they have let us down and provided no onions for us.&rdquo;  I have, I think, the advantage of Deputy Dillon in one respect in connection with this matter.  Before I came over to this side of the House, I had to go to workmen's houses in Dublin quite a lot.  I had to go there when the men would be in and that meant that I had to go during the dinner or tea hour.  I can say, from my experience, that about 90 per cent. of the workmen's households in the City of Dublin are consumers of onions. There is no vegetable so common as onions with them.  If we break that habit, if we leave them without onions for a year, they may go on to a cheaper vegetable.  They may use turnips or other vegetables and they may not go back to onions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Castlegregory growers might therefore have to give up the game when the war was over.  It is very short-sighted for Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes to try to get these onions out. It is unfair to these growers in Castlegregory who have not the same knowledge of war conditions that they have and who cannot be expected to take the same long view.  It is unfair to tell <Col N="599" /> them that but for the Minister for Agriculture and the Government they would be getting £60 a ton for their onions.  It is very unfair to be putting bad thoughts into these people's heads and it is not worth what Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes are going to gain by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been brought down. Deputy Dillon said he knew a merchant who bought 110 tons of onions.  A man who goes into a business like that should know his business and a merchant should not have bought onions unless he was going to get rid of them before they would go bad.  He should have been able to calculate how long he would have these onions on hands.  If he miscalculated and they went bad, then he should not be in the business.  I do not know if these onions went bad but, if they did, he should not be in the business.</P>

The oats are held, and come on the market about February, March or April, like last year.  There was practically none on the market last year until February or March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  They always market their barley.  The position, so far as we are concerned, is that we know now that the maltsters are finished buying barley.  Whatever oats and barley are there for sale will go into feeding.  It must go through some miller and pass back through the merchant to the farmer who is feeding it.  Why should we come in as another intermediary and make the thing more difficult still?  Why should we interfere between farmer and farmer in a case like that?  If the farmers are in difficulties, it would be a great thing if they were organised. Take two districts, one in my own constituency, Campile, and the other Dungarvan.  Let Deputies inquire if there is any farmer around Campile or Dungarvan who has barley or oats on hands.  They have not because there is a co-operative society in those places to deal with it, and the only cure for those farmers who seek a market for oats and barley is to co-operate and to do their own marketing in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and the Deputies opposite are, I am sure, logical in many cases.  What is the difference between coming in in this case, taking oats and barley from these people and helping them to market it, and then giving it back to the farmers to feed and the potato men coming to us? There is not a farmer who does not <Col N="603" /> hold potatoes till next May or June and then puts them on the market. Why should they not be allowed to say to me: &ldquo;Take them off my hands because you will want them next May or June&rdquo;?  Take the case of the farmer who supplies the Dublin market with hay.  He brings the hay in out of ricks and he might say: &ldquo;Take over these ricks.  You want hay in the country.  The Government want hay as they want oats, barley and potatoes, and could you not take it over now?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is true, but not since then.  Deputy Dillon said there were thousands and thousands of acres in this country that could not grow wheat. That is quite true.  There are thousands and thousands of acres that could not grow wheat, but is it not a pity that Deputies did not come so far a few years ago, when our combined efforts might have been sufficient to get farmers to grow wheat as far as possible as a cash crop, because they were sure of their money, sure of their market, and on that land on which they did not grow wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure of that.  There is no doubt about it.  There are these thousands and thousands of acres, and, in the first place, I admit that on what is regarded as good barley-growing land, you will get a better crop of barley than you will of wheat, but you can grow wheat on some of that land, and grow it successfully.  In the second place, there is some oats grown for sale <Col N="605" /> in the poorer areas where wheat could not be grown successfully for sale, but there are hundreds of thousands of acres at present under oats on which wheat could be equally well grown. That applies to some of the counties, at any rate, where this big agitation arose about a surplus, including the County Meath, for instance, where there was a very big agitation early in the year about a surplus of oats, and surely to goodness the land of Meath would grow wheat.</P>

Deputy Dillon referred to those eastern countries of Europe where they can grow grain continuously, but cannot in some cases have animals at all.

If we get in half as much maize as we got in last year we may not have an acute shortage.  If we get in less than half, we will have a very acute shortage, and it looks like coming in at less than half at the moment.  I cannot say, nor can anybody else say, if we will have too much foodstuffs or too little.  All I can say is that, taking all the factors into consideration, it would be a great mistake to allow barley or oats out.  If the course of the war changes, if shipping becomes easier, and if we get in our 100 per cent. supplies of maize as we did before, we will have no shortage, but I am afraid we are not going to get it.</P>

      <P>For some of them. Deputy Hughes started off by saying that one of the effects of the economic war was quotas.  That is absolutely wrong.  It had nothing whatever to do with the economic war.  I was over in Ottawa when the economic war started, and in Ottawa the quota system started for all the countries that were sending stuff into Great Britain as well as for here.  The economic war led to tariffs on our produce going into Great Britain, but it certainly had nothing whatever to do with quotas.  The economic war has been charged with a lot of offences, but that is not one of them.  Deputy Hughes also said that our policy was to charge a high price <Col N="609" /> for bacon to the home consumer in order to give cheap bacon to Great Britain.  That is an argument I cannot understand.  If, let us say before the war, Great Britain is buying bacon from Denmark at 88/- a cwt., and they say that they think Irish bacon just as good and will give 88/- a cwt for it, and if we say, &ldquo;88/- a cwt. is not enough; we will give a subsidy of 7/- or 8/-&rdquo;, how is that giving cheap bacon to Great Britain?</P>
      <P>That is an argument I can never understand, but evidently it is an argument that Deputy Hughes believes in.  We are giving butter to Great Britain at the same price as New Zealand butter.  We cannot get Great Britain to give us more than the 126/- which they are giving for New Zealand butter.  If we give our producers more, does that mean that we are giving cheap butter to Great Britain?  We are giving them cheap butter, but we are not making it any cheaper by giving our producers a bit more.  That is the most silly argument I have ever heard, and that is saying a lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all giving them subsidies.  That is true.  Deputy Hughes wants to know why we do not go over, and so on.  We did go over, and we were not very much the better for it.  First of all, he wants to know why we did not go over at the beginning of the war.  At the beginning of the war the Minister for Food in Great Britain sent his principal live-stock man and some of his other principal men across here, and it was settled that until further notice at any rate we would get the ruling price, whatever that might be.  We got the same <Col N="610" /> price as the British farmer for sheep; we got the same price for bacon, the same price for pigs.  Eggs were not controlled at that time.  We got whatever was going for eggs.  We got the New Zealand price for butter and we got the same arrangement for fat cattle that had been in operation before the war started.  That was, if you like, an interim arrangement to go on until there was time for the British Government to meet us to discuss arrangements.  We could not do any better at that stage.  There was no use in going across to the British Ministry at that stage and saying: &ldquo;We want to discuss this thing for the future&rdquo;, because they had given us as good a price, in most things anyway, I do not say in all, as they were giving to their own farmers.  We could not expect more.  That was to carry on until we would have discussions.  The discussions took place, I think it was, in April or May.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes said that they were too busy to see us when we went over. Where did he get his information, I wonder?  It is extraordinary the information he has about it.  We were over there about three days.  We met three Ministers at least during that time for about eight hours a day.  You could not expect anybody to do more in conference because it is rather tough work.  You have to be very careful about everything that falls from your lips.  You could not work more than about eight hours a day.  The whole time we were there we saw British Ministers.  There was no question of their being too busy or too preoccupied to see us.  There was this question, that we could not agree, and if we stayed for another three months we could not agree.  The reason why we could not agree was: I met the Minister for Food on a couple of occasions&mdash;Mr. Lemass and I met him on other occasions&mdash;but every time I met the Minister for Food he said: &ldquo;There is no sentiment in this.  If I get butter in New Zealand at 126/- I will give you 126/-; if I get bacon from Canada at such a price I will give you that for your surplus bacon, over and above what was already arranged.&rdquo;  We could not shift him.</P>

      <P>The price was for goods landed in Great Britain, you must remember.  From his own point of view, he said, he was a business man. He wanted to buy stuff and to get the same value from one country as another. He was not going to pay us a bit more for our butter than he was paying New Zealand, or more for our bacon than he was paying Canada, and so on.  We could not get beyond that, and we have been negotiating, if you like, over the telephone, as Deputy Hughes said, since, but as far as I can see there is going to be no move from that.  We are quite prepared to sign an agreement, the sort of agreement that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes would like, that the British Government would take all the stuff we have at our price.  Anybody would sign that agreement.  But the British Government will not sign it; that is the trouble.  It never appears to strike Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes that the British Government will not sign an agreement like that.  They will not, and that is the end of it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes said something about the slaughter of calves. Why do not Deputies opposite try to be a little bit informed about things?  I think, of course, that it may not be altogether honest on Deputy Hughes' part to talk of the slaughter of calves. I have explained here on many occasions what the bounty on calf skins was given for.  Of course, Deputies opposite like to refer to it as the slaughter of calves.  They think it is a sort of stigma on this Government. Really, the Deputies opposite should be ashamed to talk of the economic war if they had any shame in them, but they have not.  They go on talking about it.  We got up against the British Government in regard to certain payments.  The Party opposite might have stood by us, but they did not.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputies sitting on the opposite benches will not follow Deputy Keating's example by leaving the House.  I shall not be much longer. Deputy Hughes said that even if we grow all our wheat requirements, <Col N="616" /> 800,000 acres, we would still have a lot of land for other crops for which we would have to get a market.  I do not think that is quite correct.  A good farmer will not sell all his grain.  He is not a good farmer if he does that. By a good farmer I mean a mixed farmer.  He wants a certain amount of grain for his animals.  He may be able to manage 15 or 20 per cent. of his tillage as a cash crop.  That is all he should have if he is working his farm properly.  It is a question of having a small proportion of the grain crop as wheat, the portion the farmer wants to sell for cash.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey asked me whether we could not get more consumed at home. Deputy Childers gave the figures. Our agricultural output represents £60,000,000 in value and we export about £20,000,000 worth.  We could keep a certain part of that at home and give our own people more to eat and drink, but I should like to point out that of the £20,000,000 about £14,000,000 is made up between cattle and pigs.  All the other items are very small and when we talk about the export market, with the exception of cattle and pigs there is not much in it. A big proportion of our output goes for home consumption and only a small proportion goes for export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has described a good farmer as a mixed farmer.  Perhaps that could also be applied in this way, that a good <Col N="617" /> Minister is a mixed Minister and the Minister for Agriculture is certainly very mixed in his ideas as to how the agricultural industry can be preserved. I candidly admit that the Minister is faced with a number of complex problems.  Deputy Norton would make it appear that the problems which face this country are very simple.  We have only to consume our exportable surplus and all our problems are solved. I think Deputy Norton has the sympathy of every Deputy here when he points out that there is a large section of our population under-nourished.  But Deputy Norton has overlooked the important point that every nation must balance its economy in exactly the same way as the small farmer or the large farmer balances his economy on the farm.  Every nation has to live within its income.  That is to say, the payments which a nation has to make for the goods it requires must be balanced by the prices which that nation obtains for the goods and commodities it produces.  That is a fundamental fact which a lot of people seem to forget and while I have some sympathy with those who claim that our economic problems could be solved by a reform of our financial system, I believe many of those who advocate such reforms forget the essential fact that we must have a balance in our external trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of attention has been directed in this debate to the need for securing increased quotas for exports and increased prices for our exported goods, but there is one aspect of the question to which I think not much attention has been directed.  Steps should be taken in any negotiations with Great Britain to secure that the goods which we require from Great Britain are supplied to this country at an economic price.  It is, to my mind, an extraordinary thing that when we meet the British and tell them that we have agricultural produce to export, they inform us that they will not give us more than a certain price for such produce, that they can get it elsewhere at a lower price, but when the British meet us, and ask us to take their exportable surplus of coal and other <Col N="618" /> products, we are not in a position to say to them: &ldquo;We shall not accept your goods at the price which you state; we must get them at a reduced price.&rdquo;  Until steps are taken by our Government to put this country on a sounder economic footing than it is at the present time we shall not be in a position to deal with external dictation. I should like to point out that our Government must face the whole economic position.  They must face the need for a stabilised economic condition in this country.  They must, as a matter of fact, do what continental countries have done; they must adopt at least a five year plan.</P>
    <P>That plan must be directed towards conserving the largest possible market within this country for home-produced goods.  An extraordinary statement was made by Deputy Childers to the effect that our industries require £20,000,000 worth of raw materials per year.  I believe that attention must be directed sooner or later to the need for cutting down imports which are considered essential in this country at present but which are not, in the main, essential.  It is not sound that this country should require to import £20,000,000 worth of raw material. Until we eliminate the consumption in this country of imported goods, which can be dispensed with, we shall never be in a position to deal with any foreign Government in the exchange of goods and commodities.  Therefore, I believe that, instead of less self-sufficiency, instead of more free trade, we shall have in the future to direct our policy towards a more rigid control of imports.  I believe it is possible to reduce our imports, and when we do that we shall be, as I have said, in a position to bargain with England or any external power which requires our exportable surplus, because we shall be able to hold our goods if the price offered is not adequate.</P>
    <P>In addition to restricting imports&mdash; and I believe that policy will have to be continued and intensified&mdash;we must do everything possible to increase the production of goods and commodities which we can export.  Apart from that, more agricultural produce could be <Col N="619" /> consumed in this country if we had the standard which Deputy Norton rightly advocates.  The question is how can we increase agricultural production so long as we pursue a policy of impoverishing the people who are engaged in that production.  So long as we refuse to give the agricultural producer a fair return for his labour, and a fair return for the capital that he invests in the industry, there is absolutely no hope of bringing about an intensification of agricultural production in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture tries to get away from his responsibility of providing a fair price for oats and barley by asserting that those products are the raw material which the farmer requires for other branches of the agricultural industry&mdash;for live-stock feeding. The Minister for Agriculture must remember that there are areas in the country in which the farmers must grow a surplus of oats.  They must have some cash crop.  They cannot grow wheat or beet successfully.  I know there are such areas.  In fact, in Wicklow and parts of Carlow there are areas in which wheat or beet cannot be grown successfully.  Surely the farmers in those areas must have a cash crop of some kind, and, since there is a demand for a certain quantity of oats, it should be a sound economic policy for the Government to provide a market, at least in such areas, for oats.  It may be necessary, in order to carry out such a policy, to register the growers of oats for sale.  That would not be impossible.  In the case of beet, for example, there is only a limited market.  If every farmer in this country who could grow beet were to go in for beet production, you would have an unlimited amount grown, and the result would be chaos.  A number of farmers would have beet on their hands and could not dispose of it.  The same position applies in regard to oats. If it is possible to arrange to have a limited acreage of beet grown for sale, it is equally possible to have a limited area of oats grown for sale.  The areas in which oats could be grown for sale under licence could be very easily discovered <Col N="620" /> and outlined.  I think that there should be no difficulty in regard to that.  Farmers who require to grow oats which was not for sale could grow as much as they liked.  The same would apply to barley.</P>
    <P>In this connection there is urgent need for a central body in this country to purchase both oats and barley, so as to make sure that a uniform price is paid to all growers who produce grain of the same quality.  It is certainly a grave hardship for a farmer to find, when he has grown an excellent crop of barley, that he cannot sell it except at a price which is 10/- less than his neighbour obtained, perhaps for an inferior sample.  That state of affairs should never have been allowed to develop. I and other Deputies in this House have frequently suggested that what this country needs, and needed long ago, is the establishment of a central pool or board to purchase the oats and the barley of the country, and to store it so that the price will be stabilised, economic and equitable. One of the advantages of such a scheme would be that in years in which the yield would be very high, it would be possible to hold over a reserve for the following year.</P>
    <P>A nation such as ours should always hold a reserve of grain, which, I think, would be more valuable to this country, or indeed to any other country, than a reserve of gold.  That policy should have been adopted long ago and perhaps it is not too late even now to adopt it.  When we have a large number of people unemployed, and when the Government claim that they are trying to find employment for such people, surely it would give very useful employment to provide suitable stores into which the grain would be taken and stored by the State for any need which might arise.  That would have the effect, in the first place, of giving farmers an economic and equitable price and, in the second place, of ensuring that there would be always reserve stocks of grain in the country.</P>
    <P>The most important point in regard to the growing of barley and oats is that the State has a very grave responsibility <Col N="621" /> in regard to the remuneration which the farmers receive for their expenditure of labour and capital.  The State has taken action to compel farmers to put a certain acreage of land under cultivation.  Although it seems that the State may have been acting rather illegally in that matter, at any rate the intention has been to compel farmers to put a certain acreage in grain.  Having that intention, there is a moral responsibility on the Government to ensure that farmers get a proper return.  The Government have made no attempt to meet that moral obligation.  They have simply let the farmers take whatever they can get for their produce.  Of course, the argument was put up that farmers could have grown wheat.  As I pointed out, there are large areas in which wheat cannot be grown.  Apart from that, as long as you have unregulated production of oats and barley and unregulated prices there will always be a temptation to go in for the production of those commodities if, through an occasional shortage, the price rises.</P>
    <P>We know the position last spring when the price of oats was over 30/- per barrel.  Naturally a great number of farmers felt that with oats at 30/- per barrel there was reasonable ground to hope that after the harvest oats would be at least £1 per barrel, and it was a very reasonable enterprise to grow oats as a cash crop.  If, as I say, we had a reasonable measure of control and regulation of the price of grain that situation would never have arisen. The position with regard to oats and barley would be the same as with regard to beet.  The farmers would know before they put the grain into the ground exactly the price they would obtain, as the acreage would be regulated or restricted and there would be no danger of a surplus.  I think that would be a sound policy for the Minister to adopt, instead of the haphazard method of allowing farmers to take a chance and grow whatever they think will give a return and find at the end of the year that they have backed a loser.  We know that for particular farmers barley has been an economic proposition, inasmuch as <Col N="622" /> they got rid of it before the brewers were fully supplied.  For a very large percentage of the farmers, however, it has been a disastrous business, because, in the first place, the Government failed to take adequate steps to regulate production and regulate the marketing of the produce, and, in the second place, because the Government definitely intervened to prevent the farmers from exporting their produce where there was an economic market.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government would be quite justified in preventing the export of barley provided they were prepared to ensure that the farmers would get an economic price, or at least the same price for their produce that they would have got if they had been allowed to export.  That is quite a reasonable and just claim on the part of the farmers.  If they are prevented from selling their produce in a market which is open to them, if they are asked to withhold it, surely they should not be asked to bear the cost of doing something which may be in the national interest, but which, if it is in the national interest, the entire nation should bear the cost, instead of putting the burden on a small section of the community.  Surely that is a matter which should have been carefully thought out and considered.  Justice demands that where farmers are compelled to do something in the national interests at least they should be compensated for the loss incurred in the transaction.</P>
    <P>Almost every branch of agricultural production has been mismanaged by our mixed Minister for Agriculture. We have the position, for instance, in regard to pigs for which a statutory price was fixed.  I know that in my own county pigs are being bought at 7/6 less than the fixed minimum price, simply because the farmers cannot afford to hold their pigs until such time as the pigs commission find it possible to come and take them.  That is a very serious injustice to the people engaged in pig production, because I think nearly everybody will admit that the present fixed price is not an economic one having regard to the cost of production.  Then in regard to the <Col N="623" /> poultry industry we have the position that, while a good deal has been done to promote increased production, in a number of counties poultry-keeping is absolutely uneconomic, because they are completely overrun with foxes.  I think that matter has been brought to the notice of the Department of Agriculture but no action has been taken. In a good many parts of the country farmers have had to get out of poultry-keeping altogether, because there is absolutely no protection for them.</P>
    <P>In the same way, for two or three years past, a very great part of the tillage areas has been completely overrun with rabbits.  Some time ago the Minister stated that the number of rabbits was declining, but I think those responsible for supplying that information did not discharge their duty very efficiently.  At any rate, the destruction last year, as a result of this pest, was greater than in any year previously.  I hope that, as a result of the campaign that is been waged against rabbits at the present time, the situation will be improved.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy classify the stock of rabbits as part of the agricultural surplus production dealt with in this motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that as far as numbers are concerned we are exporting more rabbits than anything else, and I hope we shall continue to do so.  It is the one item, the export of which has not been interfered with, and I hope the Department will take every step to ensure that no area is neglected.  I hope the Government will also take steps to see that property which is under their direct control, such as forests, and land acquired for division, will also be dealt with.  Now, Deputy Dillon took the farmers to task because some of the farmers, or a large number of them, have permitted their dairying industry to be carried on on uneconomic lines.  He pointed out that the farmer who keeps a cow which will not produce more than 400 gallons of milk is not conducting his <Col N="624" /> industry on efficient lines, but Deputy Dillon apparently forgot that there are more questions to be taken into consideration than the yield of milk in regard to cows.  If Deputy Dillon were engaged in dairy farming, he might quickly find that, if he were to invest £30 or £35 or £40 in a good type of dairy cow, which would produce up to 800 gallons of milk in the year, at the end of the year he might have to sell that cow for beef, at a very much reduced price, owing to the prevalence of sterility, contagious abortion and other diseases which are inflicting very serious losses on the dairying industry and making it impossible for dairy farmers to improve their herds.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is not pure inefficiency or carelessness on the part of farmers that results in farmers keeping cows which are not strictly economic. It is due in a large measure to the fact that they have not sufficient capital, and it is also due to the fact that that disease is so prevalent, and it is very difficult to improve dairy cows.  I think that in this connection the Department would be very well advised to take some steps to assist farmers improve their herds, either by introducing national registration of cows or by giving some inducement, if it were only by way of free insurance of such registered cows against disease.  I think it would help farmers to go in for a more economic type of cow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, in connection with dairying we have the fact that very large expenditure is being incurred in the subsidising of exported butter.  I do not think that the subsidising of exported butter is altogether economic. I think that if that money were paid for the purpose of promoting increased consumption of dairy produce of all kinds within this country, it would be more usefully spent, and I think the Government should direct their attention to this aspect of the problem. Surely, it is not a sound enterprise to spend public money in order to provide butter for another nation at an entirely uneconomic price&mdash;and I am sure that that is also true of a lot of other items of our exportable produce.  We are too much inclined to export at any price, <Col N="625" /> whereas our policy should be to secure a thoroughly economic price and, if such was not available, we should be in a sufficiently economic position to hold our produce.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is causing a good deal of dissatisfaction among farmers is the lack of sympathy and understanding shown by officials to people, engaged in the agricultural industry.  We have a case in our county of a farmer who was prosecuted and fined £20 for having a sheep suffering from maggots.  Now, of course, everybody knows that flies will attack sheep and that, in the course of a few hours, the sheep will be affected, and no farmer, no matter how experienced or no matter how careful he is, can escape such things happening, and the fact that a statement was made by this official, that this sheep had been affected by maggots for over a fortnight, shows how little officials know about agricultural conditions, because a sheep affected for a fortnight, or even three days, would be dead.  These are causes which are producing the widespread discontent which prevails in the agricultural industry at the present time and which is leading to a diminution of production and to the unsatisfactory condition prevailing at the present time.  There is just one small matter to which I should like to refer, and that is in regard to sheep licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the terms of reference or, in other words, the motion before the House.  That motion relates to the disposal of our agricultural surplus production, and the dead sheep to which the Deputy refers could hardly be included.  The Deputy should come to the matter to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just coming, Sir, to the matter of export permits.  There is grave dissatisfaction in regard to permits for the export of sheep.  One of the reasons why that dissatisfaction prevails is that in many cases the number of permits which have been allotted to a particular individual exporter is so large that it enables that particular exporter to control the <Col N="626" /> market entirely.  I had brought to my notice a case where an exporter came to a fair with 700 permits and no other buyer in the fair had any permits whatever.  Surely, a condition of distribution which permits such a state of affairs is hardly wise.  I understand that the reason why this particular buyer had such a large number of permits in his possession was that he retained the permits, which were issued for the month, until the last week or the last few days of the month, while other exporters had disposed of theirs. The result was that he was able to control the entire market.  I suggest that a reasonable way out of that difficulty would be to have these permits distributed on a weekly instead of a monthly basis, so that they could not be held over in that fashion.  If that were done, I think there would be a more equitable distribution of these permits.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I think we are not making a reasonable effort to dispose of our exportable surplus unless we have a sound economic survey of production for the coming year; or, better still, for four or five years&mdash;unless we are in a position to plan ahead, and unless we have a determination on the part of the Government to control effectively the marketing of such produce as barley and oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to wheat, everyone will agree that it is desirable everything possible should be done to have the largest possible acreage during the coming year. A great many people, however, overlook the fact that there is a very large area of the country in which winter wheat cannot be grown, and for that reason more attention should be paid by the Department to the provision of suitable spring seed.  Great losses were caused to farmers who grew wheat for the first time in recent years, owing to the unsuitable types of spring wheat provided.  Some varieties could be grown economically if suitable seed was available.  By having a larger acreage of wheat, the problem of surplus oats and barley would, to a certain extent, be relieved.  I want to emphasise that effective control over the marketing of oats and barley is essential, and there should be a guaranteed <Col N="627" /> price before farmers are asked to increase the acreage under tillage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that Deputies did not keep more to the point when dealing with the motion.  I agree with the last speaker in a great deal of what he said, because everybody must admit that the average farmer is suffering from low prices, and that the position of the mass of the agricultural community, both farmers and labourers, is entitled to a good deal of consideration.  I am satisfied that their standard of living is far below what it should be. Why is the agricultural industry so depressed?  I am inclined to believe that they are the victims of combines and monopolies.  Why is there such a difference between the price that the farmer who produces bacon gets for his produce and the price that the consumer has to pay for it in the shop? I have never been satisfied why the price of oaten meal is so high compared with the price of oats.  As farmers have to produce food for the nation I am satisfied that the agricultural community has a genuine grievance about the sale of it.  Deputies referred to the prices obtainable for wool, oats, barley and other produce. I am satisfied that farmers are the victims of the present capitalist system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very important factor also is transport charges.  I heard Deputy Childers talking about England's desire to buy up all the wool she could get, not only for war purposes, but because it might be useful as currency when the war ends.  We heard from the Government Benches that there is only one third of the normal supplies of artificial manures available, and that there was no possibility of getting further supplies. Farmers have to pay the heavy cost of transport of these imports.  I went to the trouble of ascertaining some particulars of the shipping in the port of Cork for the last nine months, and having some knowledge of the grain trade, I found that we brought in 146,000 tons of maize and wheat for which we paid foreign shippers an average of £6 10s. a ton or something like £900,000.  Including Cork and <Col N="628" /> other ports, and putting the charge at the mild figure of £5 a ton for maize and wheat, we have paid over £5,000,000 to foreign ship owners for freight charges of grain and timber.  At the moment we are unable to get ships to bring in the timber we require. Merchants here are charged £6 and £7 a ton for freight on timber and are not able to get sufficient supplies. During the past year, 1938-39, 52 ships brought in raw phosphate, but to-day we cannot get a ship for that purpose even by paying the exorbitant prices now charged.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy Childers and other Deputies that if the Government had complete control of currency they should have exercised that control long ago, and have ships available for the carrying on of our trade, instead of leaving us in the position that nothing can now be done in that respect. If there is one way of dealing with the surplus produce of farmers it is by providing cheap transport.  At present farmers cannot get ships to take their cattle across the Channel.  Some cattle are getting through via the North of Ireland because no ships are available in Cork.  I heard the Taoiseach speaking recently and he told us that we had to build up an economy of our own here, so that we could provide frugal comfort for all, and that in order to do that we would have to adopt a different outlook on our way of living.  I am rather disappointed with the excuse the Minister for Agriculture gave when, having admitted that the farmers were badly off, he said that as long as he could remember they were badly off.  That is no consolation to the farmers or anybody else.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of unnecessary talk about the English market.  We are agreed that the English market is worthy of exploitation at any time but, for goodness' sake, let us first of all try to feed our own people before we talk about sending the food to any other country.  If we want to produce more food for export, as Deputy Childers has pointed out, we have 120,000 unemployed who can till more land and produce all the goods we want for export, in addition to the surplus <Col N="629" /> we have at the moment.  I admit that we have no surplus on hands at the moment that can be turned to food for the people.  Read the report from the doctors in Dublin.  There is over 80 per cent. of the unemployed not getting the necessary food to keep them, as they should be, in a state of health.  Anybody who listened to the wireless on last Sunday night and heard the appeal for the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Dublin must realise that it is a shocking commentary on our social system that these people should not have the wherewithal to get food for the nourishment of their bodies.  There is something deeper than talking about this export market and talking about the economic war.  There is a good deal to be dealt with, but we must have some more equal distribution of the wealth of this country first of all.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned yesterday&mdash;and I am prepared to mention it again now&mdash;I would not be one bit surprised at the farmers having a complaint and a genuine grievance to express, while we have in this country 2,500 persons with an annual income of £8,500,000 between them.  I read this morning in one of our newspapers that the annual income per head of the population is something about £60 per year.  If that is so and we find that there are 2,500 persons in this State with an annual income of over £8,000,000, it is clear to anybody with the least imagination that there is poverty existing among masses of the people.  This thing is not being dealt with in the sort of manner I expected.  We had the Taoiseach here saying that the fundamental thing was production and that it was more important than money.  I wish to say seriously to those on the Government Benches that the problem of production is solved but the problem of distribution is not solved, and that a solution is not being attempted by the Government Party.  I can picture those members on the back benches coming from rural areas and they know much more than I do about it.  There is a big majority of the farmers, and their sons and daughters, who do not enjoy an egg for their breakfast or butter for the table, because of their poverty. <Col N="630" /> Here are people producing food for the nation and not able to enjoy it.  Then we are told there is a surplus.  We may want to produce goods for export, but let us first of all feed our own people in the manner in which they should be fed and then put the 120,000 idle workers to produce the goods that Deputy Childers wants to export in order to bring in raw materials for our industries.  I suggest to the Government that that is a most important thing.</P>
    <P>I have listened to all the criticism by Deputy Dillon as to what should be done and what can be done, and I should like him to be here to hear me now.  If Deputy Dillon were over on the other side with the Minister for Agriculture and had side by side with him all the angels he could bring around they could not solve the present problems of unemployment and poverty as long as they are prepared to stick to the present social system and the present capitalist system.  I am saying that deliberately, since I am satisfied that Deputy Dillon and the Minister for Agriculture are as anxious as anybody else to end the problem of poverty.  Under the present capitalist system it cannot be ended, and until such time as purchasing power is placed in the hands of the people there will be a surplus of production and there will be poverty.  If you have, as Deputy Childers says, complete control and dictatorial powers over the currency and credit of the country then, I suggest to the Government, that they exercise that control.  Then we will be in a position to deal with the surplus and the poverty of the country.</P>

What is the surplus of which complaint is made that we cannot find a market for it?  Is any Deputy here prepared to say that 126/- per cwt. is an economic price for butter to-day?

      <P>That is the price the Irish people are being made pay in order to provide cheap food for Britain, for the market that Deputies opposite said would make them all right if they got it back.  They got the English market back and, having got it back, what is the meaning of all this?  Was their policy wrong in regard to the English market?  If the Irish farmer had not the market that has been afforded him for wheat and had not the market that has been afforded him for beet, could he exist at all?  Still, the price of Fine Gael co-operation, as given here by Deputy Dillon from the bench opposite somewhere around 12 months ago, was that we abandon wheat and blow up the beet factories.  That is the policy he had: that is the Deputy who had the nerve to stand up here to-day and talk about the dud Minister for Agriculture over here who did not know how to do his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the barley question, on which many Deputies were vocal, including Deputy Hughes.  I certainly blame the Government in regard to the barley question&mdash;I blame them for giving some heed to the advice of Deputy Dillon and abandoning the admixture scheme. In order to be fair to the Minister for Agriculture, I must say that he published at least seven times in the newspapers a warning to the farmers against growing too much barley last autumn. The position in 1932 was that there were between 50,000 and 60,000 acres of barley grown here, and it was sold at 12/- a barrel&mdash;what could be sold of it. There was no other market, and no other hope of selling any but what the brewery liked to take and pay for, whenever they paid for it&mdash;and they never paid for two months after getting it.  That was the position in 1932 when <Col N="632" /> we came into office&mdash;12/- a barrel.  In 1935 that price was up to 14/3; in 1936 it was 16/3; in 1937 it was 18/1; in 1938 it was 17/6; in 1939 it was 24/-, and in 1940 it went up to 30/-.  There was this change in the farming community: in 1939 it was 24/- a barrel for barley, as compared with 12/- in 1932, but they still grew only 68,000 acres. The other guaranteed Government priced crops were so advantageous to them that there were only 68,000 acres of barley grown in the 1939 season, at a 100 per cent. increase in price, as compared with the price the farmers were getting when Fine Gael was in office.</P>
    <P>Now there is a complaint because we have a surplus for which they will only get £1 a barrel, despite the fact that the Minister for Agriculture warned the farmers solemnly that there was a grave danger that, with the admixture scheme gone, there would not be a market for all the barley grown.  That is the position, and that is what the Deputies on the opposite side are complaining of now: that the farmers who got 12/- a barrel for their barley when Fine Gael were in office now have to take £1 a barrel for the whole of it, or at least for what is left after the brewers' requirements have been satisfied. We in the Beet Growers' Association, representing the farming community, threshed all this out with the brewers last year.  We got a guarantee from Messrs.  Guinness that they would pay 30/- a barrel for the quantity of barley they required, which it was indicated would be in the neighbourhood of 400,000 barrels.  Decently enough, they have bought an extra 100,000 barrels.  The position to-day is that our Minister for Agriculture took the advice of Deputy Dillon and abandoned his admixture scheme.  The result of that was that we have been left with only one market for barley. On the day that the Minister took Deputy Dillon's advice the barley-growing business was killed, and there was no use in producing barley beyond the quantity estimated to meet the requirements of the country.  In the same way it is, in my opinion, a waste of time to be keeping milch cows to <Col N="633" /> produce milk for the creameries at 6d. a gallon in view of the present cost of animal feeding stuffs.  That is the most that you can get in the English market, and unfortunately the price there is something of a guide here.  If our industries require £20,000,000 to bring in the raw materials for them, then I say let the agricultural community pay their share, but let the industrialists also start to do a little at a loss, and see how they will get on.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of ridiculous argument put forward from the opposite side on this motion.  Complaint is made because our Minister for Agriculture could not go over to Britain and say: &ldquo;Here is our price and we must get it for an exportable surplus; you must pay us double what you are paying New Zealand.&rdquo;  I admit that some Deputies opposite have made a better bargain, but it all depends on what you are prepared to sell.  As things stand, and as things stood, you cannot expect to get in any market more than what the people in it have to pay for the goods themselves to other countries.  If Britain can get butter from New Zealand, or any other country, at 126/- per cwt. there is no danger she is going to pay us more. That is the market for which Deputies opposite were prepared to pay a tribute of £5,000,000 a year.  They fought and dragged the country asunder over it.  They nearly plunged the country into civil war to force us to pay a tribute of £5,000,000 a year to John Bull.  That is the difference between their policy and ours.  Under the policy that this Government have put into force, we have been able to build up a home market for the farmer in which he can get at least the cost of production, plus some profit.  That is to be contrasted with the policy of the Party opposite, the policy of blowing up the beet factories and of saying: &ldquo;I would not be found dead in a field of Irish beet.&rdquo;  Their policy was to blow up the beet factories and to produce for that market.  That is the difference between their policy and ours.  Some Deputies opposite have been foolish enough to support that policy.  God knows some of them are old enough to know better.  We have Deputy</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> James Dillon putting down a motion which says that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If economic collapse is to be avoided effective steps to dispose of our agricultural surplus production must be taken forthwith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where are they going to dispose of the surplus production, anyway?  They are not going to dispose of much more beef in Britain because the people there have nothing to cook it on.  They are now living in shelters underground. Their gas mains have been blown up, and they have no gas cookers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass from that.  I am simply giving reasons to show why the market is not there for our farmers. To sell food at an uneconomic price is not going to pay anybody.  If we are ever to get down to bedrock in this country we will have to get something else to make a start on.  We will have to start cutting down our overhead costs, and the sooner we attempt to bring these into line with what our farmers can afford, the sooner we shall have a country in which the farmers can hope to get something for themselves.  The idea of attacking the Minister for Agriculture on this point is ridiculous since he has succeeded, starting in 1932, in building up markets in this country for our farmers which they had not before that date, markets which, in fact, they were not allowed to have.  At the present time, under the policy of this Government, when a man is putting in a crop in the spring he knows what he will get for it when he harvests it.  An agricultural labourer down in my part of the country got £43 15s. this year for an acre of wheat.  I do not know how many bullocks he could fatten on that acre.  If the Deputy on the opposite benches who was so anxious to interrupt this evening were here now, perhaps he could tell us.  Our farmers have that guaranteed home market for wheat.  I admit that some of our farmers gambled last year and increased the acreage under barley by close on 100,000 acres.  In a gamble of that sort some were bound to lose.</P>

I wonder what the small farmers of County Cork, County Carlow or County Galway, who are getting £30 or £40 an acre for beet, would do if they were dependent on Deputy Dillon's British market for their butter, bacon and bullocks.

      <P>The statement made by the Taoiseach&mdash;a statement of which I am very proud&mdash;has changed the course of this whole debate.  We all know that our troubles are maddening, and that to solve them is very difficult. I have been inclined to blame the Government, but the great majority of the people must take part of the blame. They elected the Government, and if it does not please them it is their own fault.  The people must take the blame for the many problems left unsolved. You cannot expect to have your loaf and eat it.  For seven or eight years we have had political antics the like of which no other country has experienced &mdash;a small nation trying to best an empire&mdash;with the result that the resources of our State were wasted, the farmers were denuded of their assets and are now without cash.  The whole problem affecting the small farmer is that he has no money.  The whole initiative of our people has been destroyed by excessive spoon-feeding during the past few years&mdash;giving with one hand and taking away with the other. There has been far too much State interference, and the farmers and the people of the rural districts were far better off and more manly when left to stand on their own legs and fight their own battles.  Morning, noon and night we have nothing but officials, inspectors and organisers, and trouble about quotas and licences.  A person who has received only an ordinary education does not know where he stands.  Every farmer would require a solicitor by his side to solve his home problems.  At present a Bill is going through this House whereby close on £1,000,000 is to be utilised to create a new industry in a bog called Clonsast.</P>

      <P>If instead of going into that bog, that £1,000,000 was directed into agriculture it would provide an economic price for the oats which are surplus, and we would be doing much better for our people generally.  These new schemes are very good, but if half of them were left over until we saw how the country <Col N="637" /> stood after the war some of them might not be necessary at all as their subject matter might not be in existence.  We know that the lands of our people will be in existence no matter how the soil is blown up.  Our people can derive a living in a meagre way from the soil. Our surplus money should be devoted to improving our soil so as to provide food for our people and, if we can at all, have a surplus for export.  There is no use in blaming the Government for failing to utilise the British market to a greater extent.  We all know that they have not the whip hand.  John Bull has the whip hand and, if he uses it as he has done for 700 years, he will use it to his own advantage.</P>
      <P>The tillage problem is one of the burning questions of the day.  To my mind, Meath should be considered as a special area.  One of the grandest little markets we had in County Meath for the last dozen years or so&mdash;during the period of the last Government and part of the period of the present Government&mdash;was that provided by the large farmer for the small farmer on the poorer type of land who always tilled a fair amount&mdash; almost as much as he has to till under Government orders.  The big farmer or rancher did not till because he found it more remunerative to rear cattle for export.  He provided the market for the small farmer in Meath.  To-day, the large farmer has to till his land and he may have up to 1,000 cwts. of oats in his stores.  The small farmer finds his market taken from him because the big fellow, instead of buying from his neighbours, is a seller or exporter of oats himself.  That is a most unfortunate thing for County Meath because the small farmer lived on that market.</P>

The Deputy will have an opportunity of dealing with the matter to which he is now referring on the last motion on the Order Paper, which must be taken within 21 sitting days.

      <P>I should like the Minister to allow first and second crop hay to be classed as tillage because they are really tillage.  Another of our problems is that arising from having so many people drawing money and giving no return to the State.  To keep these people in idleness is costing the ordinary farmer too much.  The Government should make every effort to inaugurate schemes by which these men would give some return for their money.  It is not their fault that they are idle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose you could class them as surplus, but they are not for export.  A better effort should be made to solve the oat problem.  That is the principal problem in the Midlands to-day.  The Minister should make some effort to help the small farmer in Meath who cannot get 7/6 a barrel for his oats.  I was lucky to sell my surplus oats at 7/6, but there is no market now.  The small farmer in poor circumstances has only a damp old barn and, if he keeps oats there for a week or two, they commence to grow. The ordinary farmer of from 20 to 30 acres has not, as a rule, a loft in his barn.  He has to put the oats on the ground floor, where they reek with dampness.  I saw them with 2½ inches of a sprout after a few weeks.  The farmer has no market for his oats and no loft.  The Minister has taken the market away from him because every man had to till his quota whereas, if the Minister treated certain counties in a certain way, he would be providing a real market for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will say that he did not ask them to grow oats, but that he wants them to grow wheat which is a paying crop.  It is all very well for the big man to go out with a tractor and plough 50 acres of good sound, rich land and get wheat out of it, but when you come to the ten, 20 or 30 acre man and ask him to sow five or eight acres of wheat, he can do it and get a fairly good crop, but what can he do next year or the year after?  All that the 30 acre farmer is able to manure is one Irish acre or one and a half Irish <Col N="639" /> acres.  He has not got the stock for the production of manure because he cannot keep stock over the winter as he has no grass and very little hay, so that there is no use in talking of the small man having a big crop of wheat.  If he does have it, as I have seen him have it, his land goes absolutely wild; it goes into dockens, thistles and weeds of every sort and it will take 20 years to bring such land back again.  That is the case with the growing of winter wheat.  The spring wheat is not so long in the ground and is not so dirty a crop.</P>
    <P>I believe that the problem of the country is that there is too much State interference in agriculture which has resulted in the people being unable to decide where they stand.  The farmers of to-day are not the farmers of 20 years ago.  They were more free, more independent aye, and more thrifty, and they solved their own problems then. At present, they are watching for others to solve their problems and nobody comes forward to solve them for them, with the result that the initiative of 20 years ago is gone, and we have a nation which is looking for spoon-feeding by a State which has no money to spoon-feed them.  Until we get away from that idea and develop a spirit of enterprise, of initiative and of standing more on our own feet, this nation will go down.  I can see no other fate for it. We have the dole men looking for money for nothing and the farmer looking for the dole which he cannot get and a market for his crops which he cannot get.  Where do we stand at all?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is doing his best but the unfortunate thing is that he is a man you cannot get at.  He is too gentle, and nice, and has a grand smile.  I would rather that the Minister for Agriculture was the present Minister for Supplies.  Then we could get under his sleeve and rattle him, but you cannot do that in the case of this Minister for Agriculture.  Everybody in the country says: &ldquo;He is a hell of a nice fellow and you would not like to hurt his feelings.&rdquo;  I have that feeling myself, and that is one of the things which has left this Government in a hell of a happy position.  I have met people in my own county who curse the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> Government, morning, noon and night and who throw up their hands and ask, &ldquo;Will you ever get them out?  But, after all, that Dr. Ryan&mdash;he is no good, but he is a decent fellow&rdquo;.  I admit that he is a hell of a decent fellow, but so far as helping the farmers to solve their problems, he is not too decent.</P>
    <P>Another point is that this country cannot carry all the officials it is carrying at present.  We have officials all over the country, passing each other on the road and drawing big salaries.  For what?  For trying to keep the people fooled, and nothing more.  We have warble-fly inspectors, tillage inspectors, Land Commission inspectors, factory inspectors, bacon inspectors and devil the one of them we want at all.  The farmer will be his own inspector.  There is no need for wheat inspectors and warble-fly inspectors if the farmer can make his land pay.  He will cut his weeds, trim his hedges and drain his land, and will need nobody to look after the warble-fly because if he can get a pound or two more for his bullocks by taking them out, he will take them out.  There is no need for these inspectors, drawing a huge amount of money for nothing.  They may see three or four farms but they draw their money the whole year round for nothing.</P>
    <P>The root of the whole problem is that we started on too big a scale.  The State which we of the old Republican Army tried to set up was a plain, common Irish State, ruled in a small, sensible way.  Instead of that, we started off as though we were a budding part of the British Empire with its huge wealth resources.  Here we are to-day in the position that we are too big for ourselves and, like a good many people in the country to-day, living beyond our means.  That is one of the problems, and if this House cannot solve that problem, somebody outside the House will try to solve it, and God forbid that we should allow that to happen.  We are in the midst of a war and we have a neighbour across the water who should be our friend, but who, perhaps, cannot be our friend&mdash;there are many difficulties in the way&mdash;and who is not of much use to us.  We see gentle threats in American and British newspapers <Col N="641" /> that there may be more interference with us and all this leaves us in a hopeless position.  We are not able to adjust ourselves to the needs of the country quickly enough to the extent of going down to the level at which we should be living and at which we should be ruled.</P>
    <P>We must get away from all these officials and inspectors and allow the people to solve their own problems. We must have this House a plain House and not the House of Parliament of a mighty empire.  We make laws to-day and break them to-morrow; we amend them the following day and we wipe them out the next day.  It is all for nothing and all a huge waste of time, paper and money.  I do not blame the Fianna Fáil Government for this but the whole country.  We are imbeciles if we think we are going to carry on in this country as we have carried on for the last 20 years.  We must ask those people with a proper national spirit to wake up; we must start in a small way and build up because at present the nation is just struggling along, wobbling on its legs and that spirit of nationalism and patriotism which we had in the past is dead.  We have united our people as best we can, but what for?  They are merely looking at each other, with no resources and no energy, and until we can get them back to a proper sense of the spirit of Irish nationalism and put first things first, we will be, what we should not be, a down-trodden and subject people, the prey of anybody who wishes to use or abuse us as was done in the past and as will be done to-morrow if it is possible.</P>
    <P>The problems of the country are many and the problems of our Irish agriculturists are the problems of Ireland.  In my county, we have created a number of colonies to relieve congestion in the west of Ireland.  I think new colonies should be started in my county and that in them should be put all the middle-men, the monopolists and the surplus inspectors.  They should be put on 22-acre farms with a house and one shed and given five years there, and then let us see what sort of living they will knock out of them, and let them realise that the Irish farmer has to live likewise.  If you put all <Col N="642" /> these types, who are bleeding our country white and living like gentlemen in Dublin and in the grand surroundings of the city, in such a position and give them a taste of what we have to live on down the country, this will be a better country for us because there are a lot of gentlemen in this country who live too damned easily on the unfortunate suffering people.  These people are locusts in our midst; they are the people who are getting what the Irish farmer should get.  What flows out of the Irish farmer's pocket is flowing into the pockets of these middlemen and monopolists in Dublin, many of whom have names we never heard of and which we hope we will never hear again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that if economic collapse is to be avoided, effective steps to dispose of our agricultural surplus production must be taken forthwith.</P>
      <P>This debate has gone on all this evening, and not one speaker from the Opposition Benches has yet made any attempt whatever to prove that we had a real surplus of agricultural production; neither have they made any attempt to prove that, even if we had a surplus of agricultural produce, we would suffer economic collapse.  That is what their case is founded on.  They touched everything under the sun in the course of the debate, but never touched the vital point as set out in their own motion.  For instance, Deputy Dillon took us along through the exports of wool, the importation of artificial manures&mdash;which has got nothing to do with exports&mdash;and wept over the prohibition of the export of onions, and mentioned the surplus oats held over here since last year.  I think the Minister for Supplies answered him pretty well on most of the points which he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now come to the question of the oats held over since 1939, which perhaps is now being held responsible for the so-called surplus, and which I am very doubtful is there at all; but even if it is there, I think it would be very sound policy to hold on to it.  Early this year we heard a great deal in this House about the conditions which gave rise to this surplus of oats.  It is a <Col N="643" /> well-known fact that last harvest certain dealers in oats down the country bought oats from the farmers at a comparatively low price, held it during the winter and spring months, and then offered it to the farmers as seed oats at the exorbitant price of about £25 per ton.  In order to ensure that there were adequate supplies of seed oats in the country last spring, and to ensure that the farmers would not get fleeced at the hands of those merchants, the Government very wisely allowed in Canadian oats, and thereby came to the rescue of the farmers.  If the merchants in question suffered, they had nothing to blame but their own avariciousness. Although Deputy Dillon touched on the cattle, sheep and pig trades, I notice that he did not belabour either of those subjects.  We have not a surplus of butter at the moment, although we had some during the summer months, but we have a surplus of cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
    <P>They are now being offered, and were being offered all this year, in the market across the water, that market about which the people on the Opposition Benches have preached so much for years past.  I am very sorry to say that, as a result of war conditions, the people across the water could not buy sufficient of our surplus stocks of those animals, and were not even able to pay a remunerative price for those they did buy.  I think it will be agreed by most people that every avenue was explored in an attempt to get as many as possible of the cattle, sheep, and pigs taken off the farmers' hands.  Of course, Deputy Hughes has a different outlook on that.  He blamed the Minister for not going over at a certain period to try to get the British to purchase more of our live stock.  On the other hand, he blames him because he did go over, so he was inclined to blow hot and cold with the same mouth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, repeated what can now be termed his annual advice to farmers, to hold on to their stock until the spring and everything will turn out all right.  Last winter, I think somewhere about the month of February, he advised the farmers to hold on to their stock and they would get a good price.  I am not a prophet <Col N="644" /> any more than Deputy Dillon, and it is really hard for anyone to say whether or not the price will be good in the spring, but the unfortunate position is that farmers, whether they wish it or not, are bound to hold on to some of their live stock.  Deputy Dillon, and also, I think, Deputy Norton, made the suggestion that the State step in now and purchase the grain which the farmers have on their hands at the moment, and resell it to the farming community at a later period when it would be needed for the feeding of animals.  To my mind, that is not a very good suggestion.  I think it would be uneconomic, and I think it would not work out in the best interests of the farming community.  If the State carried out that suggestion, they would have to rent granaries, they would have to pay buyers, they would have to pay storage costs and so on, and by the time the grain got back to the farmers there would have to be a pretty nice price tacked on it, too, in order to meet the overhead costs of the reshuffle.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Hughes also took exception to the fact that the Minister for Agriculture at some period this year&mdash;not so long ago; I think it was in October&mdash;was not able to say how long the British thought they would stick to the present quota regarding the importation of Irish cattle to Britain.  Surely to goodness he cannot blame the Irish Minister for Agriculture for an act or rather for an omission of the English Minister for Agriculture?  I think that is rather an unreasonable attitude to adopt.  He says there is no good in expanding production as there is not a market for our produce.  Well, of course there is not much use in expanding the production of certain produce for which there is no market.  For instance, I do not think it would be very wise at the moment to expand our cattle and sheep raising, or our pig raising, because the market seems very slack. Would it not be the sensible thing for Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes and the other Deputies in the Opposition Benches to think this over in a business manner and to realise the wisdom of the Government policy here in making provision for guaranteed markets for wheat and beet?  If there <Col N="645" /> are some people temporarily embarrassed because they have more oats and more barley than they need on their hands at the moment, if these people had followed out the advice of the Minister for Agriculture and had grown wheat instead, would not they have now disposed of that crop and have their cash in their pockets or, at least, have the crop and the knowledge that there would be demand for that crop?  It would also be one of the guarantees against an economic collapse which we are told must be avoided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hannigan&mdash;of course I do not blame him&mdash;he is a city Deputy and he tried to deal with a purely agricultural matter&mdash;told us about the English market and thinks we should be in a position to supply the British market and, according to the tone he adopted, I understood from him that he made that suggestion regardless of whether the British market could give our people the cost of production.  If the farming community cannot get the cost of production for certain products then they have got to change their system. The wise thing for any businessman is to produce the articles that would pay him.  Where our farmers through the country followed the advice given by the Department of Agriculture this year and grew wheat instead of oats and barley as a catch crop, they are pretty thankful to the season, they had a good average crop of wheat; they got a good price; they have got their money weeks ago and they are not in the position of those who, instead, followed the advice of Deputy Dillon and other members of the Opposition when they suggested to them not to mind the wheat and the beet but to go in for potatoes, oats and barley.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be of far more benefit to the country at large if the Opposition members showed some common sense when taking part in this debate, and made some real, constructive suggestions.  I have listened to a number of speeches here and I honestly say I heard hardly one really constructive suggestion during the whole night's debate.  I cannot see any danger of an economic collapse just because at the moment the export of <Col N="646" /> certain agricultural products is prohibited from this country.  In fact I believe the holding here of our grain crops and of our butter is the best safety valve and the best guarantee we can have that we can weather economically the stormy days that seem ahead at the moment.  Is it not better for us to have our food in the country so that we can feed our people?  It is less than 100 years ago that our people, through advice and through coercive methods, exported thousands of tons of foodstuffs across the water and a few months after the very people who helped to raise those crops and helped to harvest them felt the pangs of hunger and upwards of 1,000,000 of them died of starvation.  I think that if any Government were so weak-minded or so weak-kneed as to listen to the clamour of certain people to allow what some people would term a surplus of food to be exported from this country, they would not be worthy to be a Government.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on taking the right steps to preserve the food supply for our people.  In times of scarcity and times of dire economic pressure oats and barley could be converted into human food, but even if we are not compelled to go that length they are still left available for feeding our cattle and our pigs.  I do not know whether or not the Opposition mean to put this to a vote.  I do agree that, of course, to carry on international trade we must have an export trade. Nevertheless, export or no export, the first concern of a Government is the welfare of the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say a few words on this motion.  I might say that the discussion here has covered a very wide ground, and I do not propose to follow in detail all that has been said by the various Deputies. All I am concerned with is to see that the farmers of the county which I represent will be placed in a position to dispose of any cereals that they have to sell at the moment in the manner which they think will give the biggest return to themselves.  The last speaker put the question to the members of the Opposition as to whether there is any agricultural surplus at all in the country, <Col N="647" /> and he stated that no speaker on the Opposition Benches gave any figures to show that such a surplus existed.  In like manner I should like to put the point to him that he himself did not disprove that this surplus does not exist.  Anyhow, this motion has been set down as a result, I believe, of the opinions expressed by the farmers throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-Six Counties that they had a surplus of agricultural produce to dispose of and that at the moment they were not in a position to turn that surplus into cash.</P>
      <P>One does not like to be personal in a discussion of this kind, but yet it is hard to have to sit in this House and listen to one Deputy&mdash;I mean Deputy Meaney&mdash;saying that the Government should see to it that this agricultural surplus should be kept in the country even if it means a little expense to the farmer.  I want to tell Deputy Meaney, without being personal to him, that the small farmers, on whose behalf I speak here this evening, have not a salary of £480 to enable them to keep their barley and oats for six or nine months in case there might be a scarcity in that period.  It is all very well for Deputy Meaney to speak in that strain but I will give you my experience, practical experience, in going through the county and mixing with farmers, whom I represent, and on whose behalf it is my duty to state here the opinions they have expressed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last week I visited the farmstead of one of the most up-to-date and hard-working farmers to be found in Eire, a man over 74 years of age who, in winter and in summer, is out of bed by 5 o'clock.  I was discussing the position with him, not from the political or narrow-minded point of view, but from an honest point of view. I went through the various portions of his agricultural work, telling him I thought he was doing well in such and such a direction and, on the other hand, expressing sympathy with him in so far as I thought he was not getting a fair return for his work in other directions.  He brought me into the barn and showed me 80 barrels of oats, well saved after hard work on his part and on the part of three men to whom <Col N="648" /> he has to pay wages ranging from 37/- to 30/- a week.  He told me he could not get 80 pence for it.  One can imagine the feelings of that man.  Not wanting to score any political point, I said I thought times were not so bad with the farmers.  He pointed to the 80 barrels of oats and said: &ldquo;Get me cash for them, because I cannot get 80 pence for them.&rdquo; On top of all that, in comes an inspector and he asks for that man's books to see what wages he was paying his men.  If he had a slash-hook at hand I believe he would have taken the head off that inspector, and he would be more or less justified.</P>
    <P>That is the honest expression of opinion you hear, not from the inefficient or careless farmer, but from farmers of the type who have helped to build up this country.  To-day that man whom I visited is not able to cash the crop he spent so much time raising. Mixing with the farmers and not wanting to score political points one learns many things.  In a casual conversation with one farmer, speaking about cattle, I said: &ldquo;They are not doing so badly; you may get £23 or £24, perhaps, for a 10-cwt. bullock.&rdquo;&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I can remember when they would be worth £27 10s. or more.&rdquo; Another farmer remarked to me: &ldquo;To-day I may get £22 or £23 for my bullocks, but when I look across the Border I can see the farmers in Northern Ireland getting £27 to £28 for the same class of animal.&rdquo;  Deputies on the Government Benches do not make much allowance for the farmers who give expression to those views.</P>
    <P>It is the same way in the case of pigs. Right along the Border, in Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, the pig trade is practically killed in so far as producing pigs at a remunerative price is concerned.  On the other side of the Border there is as much as £1 a cwt. more given for pigs.  Is it any wonder that the farmers complain of the prices prevailing in Eire as compared with the Six Counties?  That position is due to a very large extent to the policy pursued by the Government during the past eight or nine years, when they were fighting an economic war with Great Britain.  I do not like to go into <Col N="649" /> that matter in any detail, but I will go so far as to say that to-day you are trying, with your cap in your hand, to get into the same market in connection with which the Taoiseach once said: &ldquo;Thank God it has gone for ever.&rdquo;  It does not matter what Deputy Corry, Deputy Meaney, or even the Minister, says here.  I suppose they are counting on the short memories that, unfortunately, we Irish people have; they imagine that we will forget those days. Let me point out that you are depending more on the British market to-day than ever you were.</P>
    <P>You speak about what is consumed in the home market.  Take the figures that the Minister for Agriculture read out.  He spoke of 300,000 cattle, 170,000 of which were consumed in the home market, the rest being exported. What would the position be if you could not export that number?  It is the same with the 800,000 cwts. of butter.  In the home market 500,000 cwts. are consumed and 300,000 cwts. are exported.  Where would you be if that could not be exported?  It is the same with sheep, pigs and bacon.  There is no use in Deputy Corry or Deputy Meaney trying to make out that you are independent of the British market. You never were so dependent on it as you are now, and you will be dependent on it in the future.  The sooner you get away from trying to put that across here and on the people of the country, the better.</P>
    <P>Now we come to a matter that is very much in the limelight.  The Minister said it would not be fair to allow onions to be exported for the reason that the people here would then have very little for themselves.  There again I think the Department showed a lamentable lack of foresight, so far as the disposal of onions is concerned.  At the beginning of the season I made it my business, representing a district where onions are grown very extensively, to visit the Department and point out to them the position of the growers of onions in that area, especially the cottiers who go in for the growing of onions on little plots consisting in the main of a rood, a half acre, or perhaps an acre.  I implored the Department to grant licences in order to enable those producers of <Col N="650" /> onions to export them to Northern Ireland, where there was a ready market.  I did that because I knew that at that moment there were clever people going round snapping up onions at prices ranging from £8 to £10 a ton &mdash;£12 was considered a good price.  I put forth the view that if they allowed a limited quantity of onions to be exported from that area into Northern Ireland it would be very advantageous to the people there, but the Department would not agree.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Onions were taken from Kerry and other parts of the country to Dublin and a crowd of racketeers, who never grew onions, got the onions in Dublin and put them across into Northern Ireland for as much as £40, £50 and even £60 a ton. That may seem extraordinary, but that is the fact.  There were men who made £300 overnight on ten tons of onions, getting a profit of £30 a ton after paying £20 a ton for them.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying here&mdash;and I would say it as well from any public platform&mdash;that so far as I was personally concerned, I did my best to convince the Department of the reality of the situation.  I said to the officials of the Department of Agriculture: &ldquo;Assuming that not an onion left Eire, how long would the supply last?&rdquo;  One of the officials replied that the supply would last up to April or May.  &ldquo;If that is so,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;then I, for one, will not lose a night's sleep if I do not see an onion after to-morrow.  All I am anxious about is to see that the producer, the little cottier and the small farmer, who devoted his time to the growing of onions on the advice of the various agricultural instructors attached to each agricultural committee throughout the country, would get some little advantage from the production of these onions, that they would get £25 to £30 per ton&rdquo;&mdash;a price which they got afterwards in spite of the Department.  Again, in spite of the Department the onions went across.  One cannot but remark at the same time that many of the people who took these onions across would be quite capable of shouting &ldquo;Up Craigavon&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up the North&rdquo; when they went across the Border, for the lucre of gold, and when <Col N="651" /> they had sold the onions to feed Craigavon and his men across there, they would be quite equal in the next minute to shouting &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the position as I see it at the present time.  We make no apology for disclosing it on this motion.  We are accused of introducing it purely for the purpose of criticising the Government, but that does not give me a thought once I leave the House.  I try to do my best for the people I represent and I do that, not alone here, but all through the county.  We make no apology for coming here and stating the facts of the situation as we know them at the present time.  If Deputy Corry, Deputy Meaney or any other Deputy on the opposite benches thinks that we are just here for the mere purpose of criticising the Government, I take this opportunity to disabuse his mind of that impression because the Government is the least of my concern when I sit down.  My concern is to do my duty as a Deputy in the House and to make my views felt whenever necessary. I seldom speak but, when I have to do so, I make no apology for it.  It is our duty to emphasise whatever points we think would be of benefit to the Minister in his efforts to bring about a situation advantageous to the farmers of the country.  I am not going into details on the motion. I know it covers a very wide field and, in the terrible times that we are passing through, possibly the best plans may be blown sky-high.  While there is not much use in talking about the merits of respective policies, we must do the best we can in present conditions and that is the object of this motion.  We are not asking the Minister to do the impossible, but we do say that the farmers have a surplus of produce on their hands for which they have no market at present, and it is necessary to devise some means of enabling them to dispose of that surplus, if they are to have the necessary cash to enable them to carry on.</P>

      <P>The circumstances under which this debate was initiated by myself and Deputy Hughes have been described in the introductory exchange between myself and the Taoiseach <Col N="652" /> to-day.  Concerned as we were to approach the economic problem of the country, we have pursued steadfastly a certain course throughout this debate but, into the middle of it, the Taoiseach deemed it prudent and expedient to inject a statement on the international situation now obtaining. The terms of the statement seemed appropriate to a situation of gravity and yet, so far as I am aware, no demands have been made upon us, no threats have been issued against us, no violence forecast.  I could not help asking myself whether, in these circumstances, the terms of the statement we heard to-day were those best calculated to promote a calm preparedness amongst our people for the unforeseeable future.  It seemed odd in my ears to hear the possibility of bloodshed between two neighbours who are at peace&mdash;so happily at peace after centuries of discord&mdash;mentioned even as a remote and contingent possibility.  I cannot help feeling that our people and the English people, the simple people who make up our respective nations, do not, and cannot, contemplate bloodshed between them and I am certain as that I am standing here that any difficulty which lies before us is surmountable by consultation and understanding.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is in order because he is referring to the atmosphere created by the intervention of the Taoiseach at a certain point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe that the ordinary people of our nation and of the British nation can contemplate the solution of any differences that could possibly arise between them by a solution involving the shedding of blood and I have no doubt that&mdash;as in the past, so in the future&mdash;no demands, no threat, no violence, will be employed by our neighbours calculated or <Col N="653" /> designed to prejudice our sovereignty in this State.</P>
      <P>I pray that in the future, as in the past, that happy state of affairs may continue to which the Taoiseach referred in his observations to-day, wherein no question was ever raised as to the right of the sovereign Irish people to determine what the Irish nation should in all contingencies undertake.  I believe, on reflection, that those concerned in this matter on both sides of the seas that divide us will reach the same conclusion as I do now, that nothing must ever be allowed to come between us, that consultation, understanding and desire for friendship will not be equal to surmounting.</P>
      <P>The economic problems which were called into review in the course of this debate I think received scant attention from the Minister for Agriculture when he came to reply.  I do not think it is enough for those of us who are in Parliament in this day and age to stand by and wring our hands and say &ldquo;nothing can be done&rdquo;.  There was a time when democratic Governments took the view that all they were called upon to do was to maintain the public peace and the freedom of man's passage from place to place and then to allow the classic law of economics to rule the economic relations of men.  That day is past, and with the passage of every year the Government claim the right to interfere further and further and further in the private affairs of all citizens for their better regulation. But the Government have no right whatever to take upon themselves just those tasks they choose to do without accepting responsibility for correcting the consequences of their intervention where they are evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the pig trade regulated, we have the butter trade regulated, we have the egg trade extensively regulated, we have almost every branch of agricultural production at the present time made subject to the most exhaustive regulations by the Minister himself.  Not only that, but recently the Government have taken upon themselves the right to dictate to every individual farmer in this country how he will operate his own farm.  If a man is not operating his farm in accordance <Col N="654" /> with methods which recommend themselves to the Government, they claim the right to take his land from him; they claim the right to go to the man and say: &ldquo;This much you shall till, and that much we will leave you discretion to handle as you please.&rdquo;  But, having claimed all those rights, when the harvest comes and the fruits of that harvest designed by the Government are saved, the farmers are told: &ldquo;Go and dispose of them now in what way you like; we cannot help you; if you find yourselves in a grave dilemma, we cannot help you to get out of that; it is not reasonable to ask us.&rdquo;  It would not be reasonable to ask them to do it if they did not claim the right to insist on what we should do.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the comparison I made here to-day between the treatment meted out to industrialists and the treatment meted out to farmers. The Minister for Supplies justified his record and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do go to textile manufacturers and I do tell them that that machine must produce a certain cloth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But he stopped short there.  He did not go on to add: &ldquo;I told them, I give you a 10 or 15 per cent. profit on the costings of that operation, and whether you turn out one mile or ten miles or 50 miles of cloth, I bind myself now, before the wheels begin to turn, to take every inch of it, and to pay you for it all, and, what is more, I will barter the property of every farmer in this country to secure a steady supply of raw materials for your machines.  If that means a loss to the farmers, let the farmers lose that.  I will get you woollen yarns; I will get you the machines, and I will spare you all the import taxes on them.  If you want to bring in new machines I will exempt you from all duty on these machines when they come in.  If you want a trade loan, come in and explain to me that it is a good social service, and that you are going to employ men, and I will give you a trade loan on terms that no commercial bank would contemplate. When I have done all that, if you say that the exceptional demand that my order is calculated to create requires an expansion of your premises greater than your normal business would indicate, <Col N="655" /> I will build a premises for you, and if you do not make more profits out of my contracts than will redeem the lot for you, I will excuse you the loan and make you a present of the premises; and, at the end of all that, I will guarantee you, not a market, but a profitable market based on your costings and giving you a day-to-day guarantee of a steady rate of interest on every inch of cloth you produce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then comes the farmer.  The farmer has a little factory, but a different Minister comes to call on him.  Here is no promise of a trade loan; here is no guarantee of an abundant supply of raw materials; here is no promise to exempt all farm implements from tariffs and taxes; here is no guarantee that every ounce of stuff produced will be bought and paid for at a price which will guarantee a profit.  Not at all. Here is an order: &ldquo;Get on with the job or we will give your land to someone else; plough that field, do what you like with the other one; but if you want seeds go and get someone to supply them; if you want manures you cannot have them, the Irish manure ring will not let you; no one can have manures in this country if the Irish manure ring does not want to give them to them.  If you want to produce a crop, produce wheat or we are not interested; if you cannot produce wheat go hang, because if it is oats or barley you can take your chance; if the rats eat it that is just too bad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we all farmers' sons in this country or were we all born under a shuttle?  Have we all suddenly turned on our own?  Have we all suddenly entered into a conspiracy to tear the hearts out of our own people in order to line the pockets of the Jabiotinskis and the Moisewicskis, who have poured into the country in the last ten years? Is it a shame, is it something for which men must apologise that they stayed on the land?  Is it something to which farmers must plead guilty that they carry the whole State on their shoulders?  Are they always to be beggars?  Are they always to be jeered at?  Are they always to be told that they are damned lucky to get 30/- per week for 54 hours' work, while an industrial operative, whose products the <Col N="656" /> farmer has to buy, is getting £3 and £4 for a 44-hour week?</P>
    <P>I heard a story recently of one of the Department's inspectors going to visit a small farmer in this country.  He asked him what stock he had and he told him; he asked him what crops he had and he told him; he asked him whom he had working and the farmer said: &ldquo;There is an old broken-down fellow who does a bit of work around the place.&rdquo;  The inspector got quite interested, and said: &ldquo;What do you pay him?&rdquo;&ldquo;Pay him?&rdquo;  says the farmer.  &ldquo;He gets whatever is going. He gets three meals a day, if you can call them meals, and sometimes he gets a bit of tobacco for his pipe and sometimes not, and he is glad to get even that.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, that will not do at all,&rdquo; said the inspector.  &ldquo;Did you ever hear of the Agricultural Wages Act?&rdquo;&ldquo;I did indeed.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well, where is this man?&rdquo;  says the inspector.  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says the farmer, &ldquo;you are talking to him now.  He is standing before you. This is the poor &ldquo;ould&rdquo; wreck that was fool enough to stay on this farm, and he was the only one that was fool enough to do so, and he counts himself lucky to be able to get three meals a day, to get a bit of tobacco for his pipe now and then, if he is lucky, and to have a roof over his head.&rdquo;  And the inspector, who was in receipt of £350 a year, got into his Ford V8 motor car and drove away into the gloaming&mdash; and 135 Deputies of Dáil Eireann, each several member of which is in receipt of £480 a year, smiled at the plight of the poor &ldquo;ould&rdquo; fool that sent them here.</P>

      <P>Troth, it is an old story &mdash;it is ten years old but, God help us, it is true, and I confess that, so long as the Fianna Fáil Party can find enough of these old fools to send them back here, it must be a great temptation to get them to go on sending them back.  An error that many people in this country fall into is to imagine that Ireland is an abstraction, or a country, or a landscape.  She is none of that.  Ireland is our people, our people who are bound to this country&mdash;<Col N="657" /> not fly-by-nights who can clear out in the hour of adversity and return to batten on the people when they have accumulated a little reserve, but the people who won the Land War and the people who held our country against every aggression and against every attempt to dispossess them.  Those of us who were brought up in the Land League and the Land League atmosphere never guessed that we should see the day when the children of those men who followed Davitt would be regarded by an Irish Parliament as the exploitable serfs and that the frauds who financed the powers that would have robbed our people of our birthright would be erected into a new landlord class for the robbery of our people.</P>
      <P>The Land War was fought to take off the backs of our people rack rents, because the poverty borne down upon them by those rents robbed them of their capacity to claim their freedom. It was when that burden was lifted off them that our people had the spirit and the courage and the resistance to rise and keep upright till they got their freedom.  This Parliament is piling back upon the backs of our people, in the form of taxes, tariffs, restrictions and oppressions, denials of their right to live, that very burden that broke down their grandfathers, and I am telling you now that if we stand up and let that thing be done, we will build up in Ireland a generation of people who will lose the birthright that those who came after '98 had no longer the substance or the strength to claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has seen its dark days. It has seen times when our people were brought so low that there was scarcely a voice to rally them or a light to <Col N="658" /> guide them on their way.  Providence always sent us back someone to gather the people again, but if we now, having for the first time the responsibility ourselves of looking after our own people, put upon their backs burdens and disabilities that the worst oppressor England ever sent here never dreamt of afflicting them with, we will do them an injury perhaps more fatal than any foreigner could ever do, and all I can pray God is that the generation to which I belong and the era of public life into which I have entered will never go down into history as the era of Irish public life that destroyed our own people.  I want to see our people living in dignity, peace and freedom, without doles, without the necessity for doles, but with the ability to stand upright and, without being beholden to any politician, whether in the Fine Gael Party or the Fianna Fáil Party, to rear their families and hold their heads high.</P>
    <P>If we can establish in our country a people so circumstanced on the land, then Ireland is safe.  Come all the world against her, she can meet it.  It is our job to enable that time to be. I have tried, in technical detail, to bring home to the Minister for Agriculture to-day that he is failing in that job, and I do not think he has attempted to meet the case we made, and I put it to him and his colleagues of the Executive Council that, unless they meet it and unless their shoulders are equal to the burden that circumstances put upon them, they ought very seriously to consider changing the personnel of the Executive Council, if not to change the Government itself.</P>
