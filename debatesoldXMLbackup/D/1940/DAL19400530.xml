      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it was represented to his Department that the parties to the dispute between the Irish Women Workers' Union and Messrs.  Alex Mitchel &amp; Co., rosary bead manufacturers, Waterford Street, Dublin, would welcome the setting up of a court of inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, to determine the issue involved in the dispute, and, if so, whether he is prepared in these circumstances to set up a court of inquiry.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that, in an effort to settle this dispute, my Department has already held a joint conference between representatives of the Irish Women Workers' Union and of Messrs.  Alex Mitchel &amp; Co.  Unfortunately, the conference did not result in agreement.  To set up a court of inquiry under the powers contained in Part II of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, would be a costly and cumbersome procedure. Part II of the Act is normally used in connection with a trade dispute of such magnitude as would justify that procedure.  In an ordinary trade dispute between one firm and its employees, it is, clearly, preferable to use Part I of the Act.  I would be prepared, in accordance with the terms of Part I of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, to refer this dispute for settlement by arbitration and, in accordance with the Act, appoint an independent arbitrator to decide the matters in issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been customary to take the discussion on Votes 9, 10 and 11, and also the Supplementary Estimate in connection with Vote 10, together.  The salaries, wages, travelling and incidental expenses of the whole administrative staff of the Office of Public Works are borne on this Vote.  The Vote also covers the staff dealing with special works financed out of the Vote for employment schemes, but it is recouped from that Vote.  There are no unusual features in the provisions for 1940-41. The Estimate at £146,724 shows an increase of £13,694 over last year, due mainly to the rise in the cost-of-living bonus and to certain additional staff, particularly in the architectural branch largely for the purpose of schools.  This branch has for some years been understaffed and it was necessary to make fairly considerable extensions in its personnel to cope with the growing building programme.</P>
      <P>The reductions in Sub-heads E (1) and E (2) arise from a decision that loans under the Land Improvement and Land Law Acts are to be discontinued. Their extent has been negligible for some years, with the result that the cost of administration has been disproportionate to the amount of the loans issued.  The service has for many years been confined to applicants with a valuation of £20 and under, and it will now pass to the Agricultural Credit Corporation which already deals with applications for loans from applicants with valuations in excess of that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vote 10, in which is found provision for expenditure on Public Works and Buildings, covers a wide range, including the erection of new and the maintenance of existing buildings acquired for the public service, and the rents, furniture and fuel charges incidental thereto.  It also contains the estimates of expenditure and drainage works on airports and national school buildings. Difficulty has always been experienced in accurate estimation of the annual requirements of this Vote.  In certain of the sub-heads, it is possible to make close forecasts, but, in others, notably such matters as purchase of sites, new works and drainage, the number of unforeseen <Col N="1359" /> circumstances which arise &mdash; many of them entirely outside our control&mdash;make estimation, at the best of times, a matter of considerable uncertainty. It will be readily appreciated, when the added uncertainty of the supply position at the time when these Estimates were prepared is taken into account, that there must be a considerable margin of error in this year's figures.</P>
    <P>The net figure for 1940-41 is £1,234,765, showing a decrease of £136,563 as compared with the year just concluded.  It is, nevertheless, larger than last year's actual expenditure.  Whether we shall be able to reach the figure must depend to no small extent on the manner in which world conditions affect our supplies of building materials and other commodities.  If they are seriously curtailed, we shall be unable to carry out our full programme; on the other hand, if there is no serious interference, our expenditure on certain items will, we hope, be considerably above our forecast. There is no need to take up time in dealing with many of the sub-heads, which are routine in their nature, and I propose to take the more important items out and refer generally to our activities under these heads.</P>
    <P>The provision for grants for national school buildings is £175,000, £75,000 less than that inserted in last year's Estimate.  The expenditure out of grant moneys on national schools has been steadily rising.  In the three years, 1934 to 1937, it averaged about £130,000; in 1937-38, it rose to £160,000; in 1938-39, it rose to £197,000; and last year, it rose to approximately £230,000.  These figures do not, of course, represent the full expenditure on schools.  The local contribution represents a substantial additional sum.  We reckon that if the war had not taken place, we should have been able to reach, if not to exceed, our estimate of £250,000 in the past year, and our commitments for 1940-41 would have been well over £300,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the acclerated programme for the replacement of old and obsolete school buildings, there <Col N="1360" /> are extensive demands for large schools in the new housing areas about Dublin and the completion of these schools is regarded as a matter of great urgency by the Department of Education.  The reduction in the Estimate must not be taken as an attempt to economise at the expense of the school building programme.  It represents the view&mdash;I hope an unduly pessimistic view&mdash;taken at the time the Estimates were framed of the difficulties which might beset school managers and building contractors as a result of war conditions.  There will be no avoidable curtailment of expenditure on this service and if, as we hope, the figure of £175,000 proves too low, it can be dealt with by Supplementary Estimate in due course.</P>
    <P>The largest item of expenditure is that for airports.  The engineering works at the Dublin airport have been virtually completed and the civil aviation services were transferred from Baldonnel to the new aerodrome in January last.  An elaborate and up-to-date system of field lighting has been installed, and the utmost care has been taken to ensure that the largest planes can land and take off in safety.  The building works have taken longer than was anticipated, but they are now well on the road to completion. The provision of £313,000 for works on the Shannon airport includes the estimated expenditure for this year on laying down concrete runways and the development of an anchorage for seaplanes, as well as works on the hangars and terminal building.  The contract for the concrete runways has been placed and work on them is at the moment in hands.</P>
    <P>The programme of drainage work has necessarily been curtailed.  It has been obvious to us for some years that the existing drainage code is not sufficiently elastic to permit of satisfactory schemes for many of the larger rivers.  It has become increasingly impossible to find any new proposals which were not wholly uneconomic and existing districts were not being adequately maintained. The Drainage Commission, appointed towards the end of 1938, has been <Col N="1361" /> working strenuously throughout the year hearing evidence and investigating the various catchments in an endeavour to find a solution of the problem.  We have laid before it all the information at our disposal&mdash;and this, I may say, was considerable &mdash; regarding the possibilities and requirements of the various districts. Local representations also have been received on the same subjects and it is to be hoped that the deliberations of the commission will result in presenting us with material upon which a useful programme for the future can be based.  I am hopeful that that report will be available at an early date.  It is well forward at the moment.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, we are engaged in bringing to completion our works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.  The sums provided in this year's Estimate are, with one exception, intended for the final clearing up of districts upon which the main works have been completed and which are in process of being brought to award.  The only exception is the Kilmastulla River, which is the last under the 1925 Act dispensation.  In all, 51 schemes were confirmed under this Act.  All but this one have been virtually completed. Final awards are still outstanding in a number of cases, but we propose to tidy up this situation as rapidly as possible, so as to have the decks clear for action under whatever new code may emerge.</P>
    <P>Considerable publicity has been given to complaints regarding the Barrow drainage scheme.  In so far as they relate to the finances of the scheme, they are not open for discussion at this stage, as the finances are regulated by existing statutes; in so far as they relate to the works, I am quite satisfied that they are grossly exaggerated.  We have had the flood conditions under pretty close observation in the most adverse circumstances and there is no doubt as to the effectiveness of the discharge.  Photographs of selected areas showing wide flooding immediately after abnormal rainfall have been published as part of a Press campaign against this <Col N="1362" /> scheme; we have in our possession photographs of the same areas taken 24 hours later which show that the flood waters have been carried away, as it was intended they should be carried away, by the improved channels constructed under the scheme. The scheme was not designed&mdash;no drainage scheme is designed&mdash;to prevent all flooding: the cost would be prohibitive; it was designed to prevent flooding under normal conditions and to expedite the run-off of abnormal floods&mdash;both of which it has shown itself capable of doing.  It is true that some of the tributary drains have fallen into bad condition due to siltage, and weed growths; there has been a considerable hold up in getting the maintenance machine into action; the difficulties have, however, been now overcome, and it is to be hoped that any arrears will be overtaken this summer.  Half the cost of the maintenance works is refunded by the State for the first 35 years after award.  I think that is the only case of drainage in which such provision is made.</P>
    <P>A new drainage service appears on the Vote for the first time&mdash;hydrometric surveys.  An interim report of the Drainage Commission, recognising the absence of reliable data regarding rainfall and river flows, recommended the extension of the rainfall statistics collection and the organisation of a service to record the river flows throughout the country.  The Government accepted the recommendation and we are in process of installing discharge gauges and providing current velocity meters, so that this information which is essential to the scientific design of drainage works of any magnitude, may be made available and placed on record.  I might mention that during the past year part of the Rotunda Gardens have been acquired for conversion into a memorial park to those who lost their lives in the struggle for freedom and that Iveagh House, the generous gift to the State of Lord Iveagh, has passed into our possession.</P>
    <P>Vote 11&mdash;Haulbowline Dockyard &mdash; amounts in all to less than £5,000; and presents no unusual features.  The <Col N="1363" /> decrease of £2,965 from last year's figure is mainly explained by the fact that the new watermain from the mainland to the island has been completed. The position has now been reached, as will be seen from the figure for extra Exchequer receipts arising from rents, etc., at the island, that this service is almost self-supporting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one or two questions to the Parliamentary Secretary on Vote 10.  There is an item representing works to be undertaken by the Board of Works on behalf of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I observe that apparently no estimate has yet been made for the erection of a new sorting office at Pearse Street, although a couple of years ago the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs expressed the opinion that, not only would the work be put in hands soon but that it would be completed in 1941.  We are now half way through 1940 and, beyond the erection of a temporary wooden annexe there, no steps appear to have been taken to rear a main building on that site, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give some intimation as to what progress, if any, has been made in the erection of the new main building. The present building is only a make-shift temporary arrangement which is quite unsatisfactory for housing a large staff and quite unsatisfactory as the main sorting and delivery office of the capital city of the State. Moreover, it is not possible for the present building to accommodate either the staff or the traffic during periods of heavy pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that, last year, a sum was voted for provision of adaptations at Thurles Post Office.  Both the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the staff and the local authority have complained of the utter unsuitability of the present office and of the grossly inadequate accommodation provided there. It was hoped last year that the Board of Works would undertake some of the adaptation work referred to, but apparently nothing has been done.  One would reasonably expect the provision to be carried on this Estimate but <Col N="1364" /> instead of that, it is intimated that while £1,000 was voted for that work last year there is no provision in the Vote for any work on the premises this year.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say why that is so?  In face of representations from another State Department that the work is urgent, in face of complaints from the staff that the office is unsuitable, and in face of complaints from the local authority that the office does not satisfactorily meet public needs, why has the Board of Works done nothing to proceed with work of that kind during the coming year?</P>
    <P>I should also like to ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary what the Board of Works programme is in respect of the Kildare military barracks during the current financial year. A sum of £80,000 was apparently the estimate for the work undertaken up to the 31st January, 1940.  A very substantial sum of money is yet required to complete this work and I observe that only £45,000 is provided for such of the work as will be undertaken this year.  The Parliamentary Secretary will understand that a very considerable amount of work remains to be done on the barracks there.  While certain progress has been made&mdash;I would say, fairly substantial progress &mdash; there is still a vast amount of work to be done.  I would like to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is intended during the present year to slow down the work or whether the policy of the Board of Works is to complete the barracks with the minimum delay.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is quite aware that this has caused a great deal of trouble, apart from the flooding.  To my personal knowledge, it has destroyed a number of farms.  In one farm, out of a total of 45 acres, one man has 38 acres subject to flooding.  In that case the Parliamentary Secretary will see the necessity for going ahead as speedily as possible with the work.  I am aware that there are many difficulties, and that whatever delay has taken place has not been due altogether to the Board of Works. Their share of the blame would be the smallest by far, and I wish to be quite fair.  I was anxious to know&mdash;and I am glad to know now&mdash;from the Parliamentary Secretary that the work has actually been started and that it is intended to proceed with it.  I hope that when the work has been concluded it will prove more satisfactory than under the original scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few matters on this Vote.  First of all, I should like to pay tribute to the Board of Works for the manner in which they are handling the question of replacing obsolete, insanitary and unhygienic school buildings.  At the same time, I should like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, unless there is a definite shortage of supplies, the work of establishing school buildings and replacing obsolete ones should not in any way be retarded.  The Parliamentary Secretary, and Deputies generally, will agree that the replacing of some of those insanitary, unhygienic obsolete buildings is absolutely necessary in the interests of the health of the children in those areas.  I have to complain of the machinery connected with the work of school building.  There are really three Departments involved &mdash; the Department of Finance, the Department of Education and, very largely, the Board of Works.  I have made the suggestion before in this House, and I repeat it now, that it might be possible to get some kind of co-ordinating committee to deal with this very urgent problem of school buildings.  There are in various parts of the country school buildings in which <Col N="1366" /> one would hesitate to house cattle and they have remained for years in that condition.</P>
      <P>I have one school in mind&mdash;I may say that I am not blaming the Board of Works for delay in proceeding with the building of a new school&mdash;which was condemned as unfit for human habitation away back in 1876.  As I say, I am not blaming the Board of Works for that; I am just giving an example of the condition of some of these school buildings all over the country.  I make the suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be possible to get some kind of co-ordinating committee to whom one could refer plans and in that way expedite the work of school building. The procedure at present is rather round about.  One, first of all, has to go to the Department of Education to find out what their views are.  Then one has to go to the Board of Works, and after that comes the question of a grant.  The question of a local contribution, which is usually one of the most difficult matters in the whole procedure, arises acutely and forms a very thorny subject in many cases.  I would, however, impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that it is absolutely necessary, in the interests of the health of the children, that these obsolete, insanitary buildings should be demolished and replaced by proper structures as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I think provision is made in this Estimate for a new Civic Guard barracks at Commons Road, near Cork City.  I hope that work will soon be proceeded with.  I have spoken on this matter here in this House before and drawn attention to the condition of the existing building in which a number of Civic Guards are housed. It is a danger to health and the accommodation provided is entirely inadequate to house a sufficient number of Guards for that area.  I am pretty certain that I saw some provision in this Estimate for it, but in any case it is a very necessary work and should be carried out without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I have drawn the attention of the Parliamentary <Col N="1367" /> Secretary and his Department is concerned with the renovation of the coastguard houses at Crosshaven.  Portion of the premises is devoted to a Civic Guard barracks, but there are a number of houses there and I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be a very good economic proposition to renovate these houses, to put in front doors where there are no front doors at the moment, and to make each of the buildings a self-contained house. There is only a common backyard at the moment and there is no entrance from the road.  It would not take very much to do the work I suggest.  Some of the houses are untenanted at present because people will not take the houses in their present condition.  A number of Civic Guards who live there have threatened, or are threatening, to leave the houses owing to their condition and the absence of proper facilities or privacy.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what are his intentions with regard to Haulbowline Docks. The people of Cobh are very interested in having the docks repaired so that facilities may be provided for such commercial ship repairs as may be required.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has received representations from the people of Cobh on this matter and that certain alterations are to be carried out there for certain purposes, but the people in Cobh and district are anxious that these alterations should include facilities for commercial ship repairing.  At the present time, there is a tenant there, Fitzpatrick, who, I am told, is under notice to quit.  He has made representations to be allowed to keep one of the sheds which he at present occupies.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has received representations on that matter also and I hope he will consider them very favourably because this man gives a certain amount of employment.  Twenty-five or 30 men have been employed there in boat building and boat repairing.  It constitutes a little industry in itself and it might be possible to allow this man to remain in possession of the portion of the premises that he has occupied for a number of years from the Board <Col N="1368" /> of Works.  I hope that the representations of the people of Cobh will be favourably considered by the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the effective repair of the dock.  I am told on good authority that to provide facilities for ordinary ship repairing would not involve the expenditure of a very large sum of money.  As I stated yesterday, it is the duty of the State to come to the assistance of that area as much as possible because it was the change-over from the British Government to the Irish Government that caused a good deal of the dislocation of trade and unemployment in that area.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider favourably the points I have put before him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters to which I want to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary. I was rather interested to hear Deputy Hurley refer to Cobh.  While he was speaking the thought ran through my mind that since this House came into existence no place in this country has been so much talked about as Cobh.  The one thing that puzzles me now is how Cobh managed to exist for the last 20 years since the changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>You might have left it to me then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it must be a very nice place, at any rate.  However, what I want to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to is the question of the erection of new Gárda barracks or new schools.  When such new barracks or schools are being built in any particular area, I think it would be well for the Board of Works to get into touch with the local sanitary authorities before erecting these new buildings.  Very often, local authorities find that new barracks or schools have been erected, and then it is found that there is no provision for water or sewerage.  For that reason I think there should be the very closest co-operation between the sanitary authorities in any <Col N="1369" /> particular area and the Board of Works&mdash;and particularly in rural areas &mdash;when there is any question of erecting schools or Gárda barracks.  I mention these two types of buildings, because I think they are the two principal types of buildings that are erected in these rural areas.  I know, for instance, of one case where a school and a barrack were erected, one on each side of the road, and it was found afterwards that there was no water available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Where was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was at the village of Ballycullane.  At any rate, I think it is necessary that, when there is any decision to erect any such buildings, there should be some clear policy laid down as to the matter of co-operation between the local sanitary authorities and the Board of Works.  Up to this, as far as I understand the matter, there has not been that co-operation, but, on the other hand, a certain amount of friction going on between them.  I think that that friction is due to the fact that the local authorities feel that, to a certain extent, at any rate, they are being ignored all the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter in connection with which, I think, the Board of Works might consult with the local engineer or county surveyor, is the matter of the location of these buildings.  I have seen some of these buildings being erected &mdash; not recently, I admit&mdash;at a cross-roads and as close as possible to the edge of the road.  I know of one case, certainly, where that has happened.  It was in connection with an old building that had been burned down in the troubled times in this country, but at any rate I think that that is a matter in which the Board of Works should try to co-operate to the fullest extent with the local county engineer or surveyor. I think that, in the matter of the location of new buildings about to be erected, it is very important that there should be that co-operation.  Of course, there is a Town Planning Act in operation, but outside the County of Dublin I do not think it is having very much effect, or, at any rate, will not <Col N="1370" /> have very much effect for some time to come.  It is for that reason I think it is very important that close co-operation should exist between the Board of Works and the sanitary authority and county engineer or surveyor of the area concerned.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter of the building of local Gárda barracks and schools, there is another point to which I should like to refer.  For instance, take the case of Courtown Harbour where the barracks have been closed down.  Now, that is an area where there is a scarcity of dwellings, and yet these houses are being allowed to go into disrepair.  I do not know what is the reason for that, but I do know that some of these houses were in fairly good repair, and yet, when the barracks were closed down, I understand that the Board of Works refused to repair or rebuild these houses.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of drainage. The Board of Works, I understand, are carrying out drainage on the River Barrow down about New Ross. They are repairing the breach in the embankments of the River Barrow there, but there are three other breaches on that river and, as a result of these breaches, a very big amount of land has suffered.  Now, this matter of the repairing of the breaches in these embankments is a very burning question so far as the local residents are concerned.  I admit that the landholders, under their purchase agreements, entered into a certain agreement with regard to the upkeep of these embankments, but the position has now been reached that the local landholders could not possibly afford to pay for the repair of these embankments. The embankments put up many years ago were very good but, through one cause or another&mdash;neglect or otherwise&mdash;these breaches have occurred, and I am sure that it would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds now to repair them.  These embankments were built originally, I understand, out of some free funds, and it is important for the town of New Ross and the lands surrounding that district that they should be kept in good repair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> I am afraid there is no possibility of the local landholders being able to spend sufficient money to keep these banks in repair.  Of course, I suppose it will be pleaded by the Parliamentary Secretary that he has no power to deal with that matter unless there is unemployment in the area.  I think, however, that that is a blot on the administration of his Department.  Of course, I do not mean that that is the fault of the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am glad that there has been some change in connection with this matter by giving over money to the Ministry of Agriculture, but I do believe that in areas such as this&mdash;whether or not there is unemployment&mdash;so long as there is work of public utility to be done, such as the repair and maintenance of these large embankments on the Barrow, that work should be done and these embankments should be maintained.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter, particularly with regard to the three breaches in the neighbourhood of New Ross&mdash;two of them to the north of New Ross and the other lower down.  I think that it is very important that this work should be undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Vote, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to a very important matter &mdash; the Barrow Drainage&mdash;affecting three counties.  I do not want to duplicate any discussion on this matter, since there is a motion down on the Order Paper dealing with the same subject, which, I presume, will come on for discussion later on.  I simply want to ask a question of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I understood him to state that he was satisfied that the complaints made were grossly exaggerated. Am I to take it that the Parliamentary Secretary has made a close examination of this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that a number of the tributaries of the river were choked up with weeds and silt, and that the position is that many of the banks have burst and there is flooding over a wide area of the country.  Now, taking one thing with another, and agreeing that great benefit has been done in that area by the drainage scheme, I think we can agree that the whole of that drainage work is going to be spoiled if maintenance work on these embankments is to be neglected over a number of years.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he hopes to be up with the job this year.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has now said, I do not want to provoke any discussion on this in anticipation of discussion that may take place later on the issues raised by the Barrow Drainage Ratepayers' Association.  I do put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if his private secretary will give reasonable notice to all the Deputies concerned of the date and time that it will be convenient for him to meet the Deputies concerned, then <Col N="1374" /> it will be the responsibility of any Deputy for the area if he does not turn up at the time appointed by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do think it would be of advantage to have with Deputies some of the local people who know the facts.  They are living on the spot, and are naturally better acquainted with the realities of the situation than Deputies representing any of the areas involved can possibly be.  Those people also have expert advisers, technical men, who can give some information to the Parliamentary Secretary and to his technical advisers.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should be agreeable to allow some of those people to see him in company with the Deputies for the two or three constituencies concerned, and I would, therefore, ask him to reconsider that.  I may say that I have the greatest possible respect for the Parliamentary Secretary's technical advisers, but they are not infallible, any more than the Parliamentary Secretary is on any matter in which he takes a deep interest outside of politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress a point that was made by my colleague, Deputy Allen, when he urged on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity of the Board of Works getting into touch with the local bodies when they are about to build a school or a Gárda barracks in the rural areas.  I have in mind one particular place in my constituency where a school was built in recent years.  In view of the fact that it was built on a lower level than that of the village it has been found impossible to connect up that school with the sewerage system in the village.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that that is a very bad state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  That, I suggest, is a thing that should not happen.  Deputy Allen also referred to the village of Ballycullane where a school and a barrack were built recently.  There is no water supply in the vicinity at all.  Within the last two or three weeks representations were made to the County Wexford Board of Health, with a view to providing a water supply for the area.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if the Board of Works, or the contractor who carried out the work there, had got into touch with the local authority prior to the erection of those buildings, accommodation could have been arrived at with the view to the provision of a water supply on, perhaps, cheaper and easier conditions than it will be possible to do it now.  I would, therefore, stress the necessity that in all cases of this kind the Board of Works, or the persons concerned, should get into touch with the local authority before carrying out works in those rural areas.</P>
      <P>Drainage has been mentioned by practically every Deputy.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if he received recently a report from one of his inspectors in connection with a certain part of the Sow drainage in North Wexford.  I want to say that a splendid job has been done in recent years by the Board of Works on the upper reaches of that river.  It was an expensive job, but it was well done and seems to be very effective.  In the Ballymurrin and the Ballagh areas, however, the position is still very bad.</P>
      <P>The land owners in those areas are prepared to give every facility to the Board of Works with a view to having certain work done there.  I hope, therefore, that the Parliamentary Secretary will give due consideration to the report of his inspector who, I believe, is of the opinion that work should be done in these two areas.  If the work cannot be done under a drainage grant, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would consider doing it as part of the scheme that he outlined yesterday in connection with the reclamation of land and the improvement of farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> Deputy Hurley also referred to the question of schools in rural areas.  I, like him, want to pay a tribute to the Board of Works for the magnificent buildings they have erected in various parts of the country but, while I say that, much more remains to be done. It is to be hoped that the war situation will not interfere with the erection of very badly needed schools in some parts of the country.  In my constituency some very fine new schools have been erected in recent years, but I regret that there are some very bad ones in the constituency still.  I refer in particular to the school in the village of Kilrush, in the northern part of the county.  The school there is very bad, one of the worst I should say in the country.  There are no sanitary arrangements, and the building is so bad that it is likely to fall at any moment.  During the snowfall that we had in the early part of the year the roof collapsed, while during the very severe weather of last winter it also suffered considerably.  I understand that an arrangement has been arrived at between the manager of the school, the Very Rev. John O'Connor, P.P., and the Department of Education, and in view of that I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the school is built this year.  As I have indicated, it is in a very bad state of repair.  Another school that I want to refer to is the Convent of Mercy school in Wexford.  I understand that during the past fortnight advertisements were issued inviting tenders for the erection of a new school there, but while that is so I am given to understand that it is not yet certain whether the school will be built.  A lot, I understand, will depend on the amount of the tenders received.  The present Convent of Mercy schools in Wexford are in a very congested area, and because of that it is not possible to extend or enlarge them.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do his best to see that the new school is built during the present year.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question about St. Andrew Street Post Office, and whether he has yet found who the <Col N="1377" /> owner of the site is.  I see that the sum of £44,800 is being provided for a new post office.  I presume the plans for it have been got out.  St. Andrew Street is in a very important part of the city.  Its situation is such that, from the town planning aspect, the site should be carefully gone into.  I have the utmost respect for the Parliamentary Secretary's architects, but I understand that Government Departments are exempt from the provisions of the Town Planning Act.  I should like to know whether any consideration, as between the Board of Works and the Corporation, has been given to the lay-out of the site, and when I say the site I mean the frontage.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to inform me on these matters when replying.</P>

      <P>On Vote 11&mdash;Haulbowline Dockyard&mdash;I suggest that unless the Parliamentary Secretary changes his tactics the name of that ought to be changed.  I never heard of a dockyard without a dock, and I respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that something ought to be done in connection with the dockyard itself. We have had it now for a considerable period, and I am glad that part of the white elephant trouble, in regard to Haulbowline, has been removed.  In regard to Haulbowline Dockyard itself I want to say that appeals have been made here&mdash;and I am pretty tired of making these appeals for the last 13 or 14 years &mdash;to have something done in connection with that dockyard.  I do not know what arrangements were made with the Board of Works or what compensation they received for the damage done by the people who were in possession of this place for some time, but I know that estimates were looked for afterwards <Col N="1378" /> and one estimate put the figure at £12,000.  I understand that a recently completed survey has been made of the Haulbowline Dockyard.  I wonder could the Parliamentary Secretary now tell us whether it is intended to do anything at this stage?</P>
      <P>We all know that it is rather a joke to see the first harbour in this portion of Ireland, indeed the first harbour in the whole of Ireland, without any repair facilities whatsoever.  There were repair facilities in it when it was handed over to us.  Any change that has come about since or any deterioration has been due to the management of the Board of Works.  If machinery were sold, well it was sold by the Board of Works.  If machinery were scrapped there, it was scrapped by the Board of Works.  If any damage were done to the dockyard that damage was permitted by the Board of Works.  The position of the town of Cobh to-day and for a number of years is bad, and the condition of the people depending totally on the amount of employment in Haulbowline is entirely due to the fact that this dock was allowed to go into disrepair.  It was allowed to be wrecked and robbed whilst under the management of the Board of Works. That surely is an unfortunate position. I raised the matter here a few years ago to ascertain whether the Board of Works had got compensation from the firm that did the damage, and if so, if that compensation was to be expended in making good the damage done.  Now that a survey has been made and an estimate prepared by the Department, surely we can expect some work to be carried out there. What steps does the Parliamentary Secretary intend to take towards putting the dockyard into repair or is it the policy of the Board of Works to let it become derelict?  We are entitled to some explanation.  If it is the intention of the Board of Works to allow the dockyard to go derelict then we should be told so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary who lives very near Cobh is well aware of the unemployment position there.  He knows what has happened.  He is <Col N="1379" /> aware that when ships are brought into Cobh in a damaged condition they have to be towed out to other countries for repairs.  There are boats coming into Cobh, some the property of the Department of Defence and some belonging to the Fisheries Department, but these have to be taken elsewhere for repairs. That is very unfair and very bad treatment for Cobh.  While work is awaiting to be done, the dockyard is lying idle.  That is one of the things I had in mind last night when speaking on the Estimates for the Board of Works. I submit that money spent in that direction is money well spent.  The employment given would be worth 100 times the money paid.  Money was thrown away on roads and street improvement that might have been spent on this dockyard.  If that dockyard were in proper repair we would be in a position to do our own work and we would not have to be sending these ships out of the country for repair elsewhere. Several times the local people have made appeals on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is high time that we should know definitely where we stand as regards Haulbowline.  If that dockyard were in working order, at least the boats belonging to the Department of Defence and the Fisheries Department could be repaired there and when a damaged ship came into Cork Harbour we would not be in the position that we are in at present.  Some time ago a ship came in needing repairs and all that could be done in the dockyard was to throw 50 or 60 bags of cement into the ship and tow it across to England. I do not want to labour the position too much and I dislike having to make the appeal year after year but it means a great deal to the unfortunate people in my district.  I again ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take the necessary steps to have the dockyard repaired.  Perhaps he would tell the House what the figures of the survey and estimate were.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary when he expects the report of the Drainage Commission?  I ask the question <Col N="1380" /> because a great many drainage schemes are held up waiting for this report.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would urge the Drainage Commission to speed up their report as quickly as possible.  If there is any hope of doing anything it should be done at once.  I am aware that the smaller drainage schemes have been held up awaiting the report.</P>

      <P>Last year the Parliamentary Secretary promised me, and I might even go so far as to say that his predecessor promised me, that this matter of the building of a Gárda Síochána barracks in Roscommon was engaging the attention of the Public Works Department.  But nothing has since been done.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any report on this matter?  If it is any help to him I can get a report from the sanitary inspector that the present barrack is in an insanitary condition.  It is unfair to expect that the Gárdaí should live in a place like that.  They have to go down steps, down to an old floor, to rooms that are damp and squalid.  The whole place is appalling.  The State cannot have men in proper health and efficiency if they insist on their living in barracks of this sort.  I have been raising the matter every year and have got any amount of promises, but nothing has been done so far.</P>

      <P>I must say that whenever I raise the question of drainage here I get a most sympathetic hearing from the Parliamentary Secretary and my hopes are buoyed up for two or three minutes.  I have a bad memory but sometimes an inconvenient one and I very clearly remember that my hopes were similarly buoyed up some years ago.  Some of our speeches on this question of drainage could almost be set to music.  When this matter of the Drainage Commission was first raised it was agreed that it was a very urgent one as the work waiting to be done was pressing.  But where is the report?  I can only compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the annual recurrence of his spirit of optimism with regard to the promise of an early report from the commission.  I had the honour of giving evidence before that commission and it struck me that it was rather large if a quick report were to be expected from it.</P>
      <P>I know there are other commissions which were somewhat smaller that may or may not have presented reports, but certainly we have not seen them&mdash;the Government may have seen them.  I understand that some of these other commissions did report rather quickly. That may be because they were in a position to make up their minds or, possibly, found the problem insuperable. Certainly, they have not been as long as this commission in presenting a report.  I would say for the commission that I think they were anxious to present a report which would be found workable.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remember the position of the people who, year after year, are waiting, not for the findings of that particular commission, but to see the actual work done.  I wonder if it would be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to depart from the usual vague reply&mdash;that he expected or hoped to get the report at an early date.  Unfortunately, I was not here when he was making his preliminary statement. I do not know whether he expects or whether he merely hopes for an early presentation of the report.  But, could he give us some idea, within a month or two, as to when it can be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> I cannot see, apart from regulations and inter-Departmental <i>amour propre</i>, if I may use the phrase, why the principal Departments and even the sub-departments of one Department could not work together and do at least some work there.  I put it on more than one occasion, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary is fully alive to the matter, that the longer works of this kind are delayed the more expensive they become.  I am afraid that we are going to be presented with another difficulty now. The outbreak of the European war, which I admit was beyond the control of the Government, may send up prices considerably, and what you might have done for £100,000, say, two years ago, may well cost £200,000 or £250,000 by the time work of this kind is undertaken.  I am not saying that the Government should have foreseen these things&mdash;that is a facile criticism that I certainly should not be guilty of.  But the unpleasant fact is there. If there were difficulties in the way of undertaking these things before, they certainly have not been diminished. That makes me all the more regret that at least something in the way of preventive work was not done, if necessary out of money from other Votes.  In one case to which I referred, the River Maine, I gather that work was to be done by the Land Commission.  But, as I say, I do not see why some work should not be done in some of the other cases as well.</P>
    <P>I have heard the explanation&mdash;I shall not say the excuse&mdash;put forward that as a considerable amount of embankments would have to be made on the Brick and Cashin rivers, and the banks might not always run along where they are running now, that was a reason for not doing anything.  I find it hard to accept that.  That there will be some changes if the scheme is undertaken is probable, but that the changes will be so considerable as not to justify any expenditure now on that ground I find it hard to grasp.  If a certain proportion of the money went in providing banks in that particular place, and even a small proportion of them had to be scrapped afterwards, I think that <Col N="1383" /> the amount of preventive work done in that way would prevent further damage and would more than compensate for that.  In connection with various drainage schemes through the country&mdash;and I have taken the three Kerry ones, Maine, Brick, Akeragh, with which I am most familiar as a Deputy to illustrate my case&mdash;I know that the Department's attitude is that they are not economic, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary's definition of uneconomic would be something like this: that even if you give 100 per cent. of a grant, the upkeep might cost more than the annual value of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.  Even so, I doubt whether it would not pay to do it, though economically it might not.  But may I direct his attention&mdash;I have no doubt he does not pay to these things the attention which is their due&mdash;to the statement made by a Minister with whom he is familiar, namely, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement of this year.  Possibly he can value better than I can the worth of that statement. With a certain amount of unction&mdash;I think that the term I always give to the pronouncements of that Minister &mdash;he said he would not be deterred from doing useful work on the ground that it was uneconomic and that that would not prevent him from giving grants.  I think if the Parliamentary Secretary will look up the Budget statement he will find that when I was speaking on the Budget I expressed the hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister would study that particular pronouncement and give it practical reference so far as drainage was concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is what is no doubt useful work and I will tell you what I am afraid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> I am afraid the work will be done in this way, that in ten years, or whatever time you like, there will be an agitation in that portion of the country, pressure will be put on at the wrong time, namely before an election, and a promise will be given to do that work.  Whatever may be said about the uneconomic character of work of that kind, under these conditions it is certainly going to be made still more uneconomic.  I assume the Parliamentary Secretary knows that I am not convinced that the expenditure of money by the Government on schemes, experimental and otherwise, is always economic.  In some supplementary estimates presented in the last six months I would find it extremely difficult to convince myself of that.  I put it to the Government that they are likely to spend more money uneconomically in other directions than in drainage.  That may be a prejudice on my part, but I certainly believe it about the Cashin and Brick&mdash;that every scheme put up by anybody has been turned down on the grounds that it might be wrong.  There is a problem there created by the tide.  I suggest that a barrage would meet the situation. Probably it would.  That is a work that will be done sometime.  It is bad for the countryside, and creates a lot of discontent and trouble and, as I gathered from doctors living there, possibly ill health.</P>
    <P>It is a very unsatisfactory lookout for the people that they are told that they need not expect the report of the Drainage Commission at any definite time.  Hints have been dropped that if the report was brought in the Government would find it difficult to do anything in these particular cases that I put to the Minister, while the people see their land getting worse year after year.  I often wondered why it was that other countries found it economic to go in for large schemes of reclamation, and how in this country, Governments got into the extraordinary conservative habit rather of finding difficulties against schemes than in finding schemes which they might attempt to carry out.  I gather generally that the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to find schemes for employment, <Col N="1385" /> but whether it is that the country is so prosperous, or that there are no other schemes for the unemployed, or because the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary are getting older and more conservative, I do not know what the reason is for the difficulty about these schemes.  I think he will agree that the difficulty increases year after year.  We are thrown back on road work.  It should be remembered that when roads are made they have to be remade very often, no matter what the intentions are when a grant is given.  There may not be maintenance costs immediately; but there is very often the remaking of roads as well as maintenance charges that fall on local bodies.</P>
    <P>If he equates work of that kind with drainage I put in a plea&mdash;I do not say a pathetic plea, because I am sure the Minister's heart is sympathetic in this matter&mdash;for more practical consideration of schemes.  Now that the Parliamentary Secretary has the Minister for Lands near him I ask would that not be constructive work.  In view of the relations that prevail amongst them, I cannot see why the Land Commission, the drainage section, and also the unemployment section in the Board of Works could not come together and, at least, do useful preventive work.  I have raised in this House the damage done by delay, and the Board of Works and the Parliamentary Secretary are fully aware of these warnings.  I do not suggest that any special gift was required to give these warnings, but considerable damage was done in the last couple of years on the lower Maine.  The damage done there about 18 months ago was widespread, because the banks had not been cared for.  That means bigger expenditure later on for preventive work.  I think my feeling is well founded, that the longer the work is postponed the bigger the problem, the more expensive it will be, and the more damage will be done.  For that reason, as the Parliamentary Secretary is not in a position to tell us when we may expect the report of the drainage commission, or that even when we get it any action will be taken, I recommend him at least, to take steps to see that there is <Col N="1386" /> no further deterioration, and, if necessary, to have the close collaboration of the Land Commission with his own particular work in connection with the unemployment relief fund.</P>
    <P>I gather, as far as that is concerned, that he would take up the line that that is primarily a form of relief, most of which must go into work, and that it is on road work there is most return. There is a certain amount of validity in that, but I do not think it should be pushed too far, if there is useful work to be done elsewhere.  I may be prejudiced in reference to drainage, but I am very interested in these problems and especially in those that are brought before me in Kerry because they are typical of the work that should be done.  I ask that, at least, some preventive work, if necessary, should be done through the co-operation of the three Departments of State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hurley suggested a schools' co-ordinating committee.  I did not quite gather what the purpose intended was.  I think it was intended that there should be some place where Deputies could go and get all the information available.  I do not think that any other function was suggested.  So far as co-operation can be arranged, it exists in a very close form between interests of that kind.  When a school comes to be built, all sorts of interests have to be dealt with&mdash;local interests, site interests and financial interests.  I am satisfied that, at present, with the special, newly-devised organisation in the Board of Works, all that can be done to get the schools built is being done.  The schools section of the Office of Public Works is now well above reproach and is doing all the work that can be done.  They hope to face any difficulties that exist and try to get rid of them.  I think that you are in very good hands in the Board of Works so far as schools are concerned. A point was made as regards new schools and the requirements of the sanitary authorities.  In building schools, barracks and other institutions our architects give every possible consideration to the surrounding circumstances. If there is a particular case in which there has been any slip-up of that kind, we shall be glad to hear of it.  As I have suggested to the House before, the place to make complaints, if you want grievances remedied, is to the Board of Works in writing.  Then, the staff of the Board of Works will definitely get down to those complaints. It is my policy not to give any preference in matters of that kind to questions which are raised here.  I shall give the preference to those who take the ordinary method of dealing with these matters.</P>

      <P>The right method of making complaints.  We get a complaint here as regards a particular school which I have never heard of. That is the wrong way of dealing with the matter.  If it were a matter which Deputies had complained of or written in about, I could have inquiries made, but to sling a lot of disordered questions at me about matters about which no complaint has been made to the office gets us nowhere.  The Deputies doing that are taking advantage of the machinery of this House over and above the men who are doing their work in the proper manner. There are Deputies who never raise questions here or who only raise them when they find that they cannot get things done in the ordinary way.  I do not say this by way of complaint, but for the information of people who want to get things done.  If you apply in the ordinary way to the Office of Public Works, there is machinery by which a complaint or inquiry must come out of the machine if it goes in. Some odd statements made here, that there is not sufficient co-ordination between X, Y, and Z will bring us nowhere.  In saying this, I want to help Deputies, and I think they know that.</P>
      <P>We are carrying out no works at New Ross on the Barrow at present, and we have no functions in regard to these embankments of any kind, sort or description.

We have no power to do anything else, and I am not prepared to argue with those who think we have.</P>

This question has been carefully considered over a considerable period to see whether or not there was any even moderately economic basis on which a shipyard could be established there.  A committee was appointed in Cork which consisted of representatives of the lower and upper harbour, of Deputy Corry's constituency and of Deputy Hickey's constituency, experts from the Harbour Board and others.  We were all there and that was the place to put up evidence to convince a very partial jury that something practical could be done.  Deputy Corry was a member of that committee.  No such evidence was <Col N="1391" /> produced.  That is the answer.  If and when the project is reasonably possible or there is even a hope, the matter will be treated in the most sympathetic manner, but it is not sufficient to say that we should set up a dockyard for ships that are brought in once in a while.  Some better evidence than that will have to be produced.</P>
      <P>There is a long story in relation to that yard.  There was another yard at Rushbrooke which was carried on for a considerable number of years and which eventually went out of business. That was a yard which, under a previous administration, had a subsidy given on the wages for the purpose of trying to keep it economic.  At the time when that yard was in process of collapse, very much the same interests came together and did everything humanly possible and investigated every likely means of finding revenue for such an organisation.  We got the co-operation of the local authorities in reducing rates and, so far as unskilled labour was concerned, unskilled labour came forward and volunteered to work at time rate of wages.</P>
      <P>I am only giving you the background of the efforts made on that occasion. Even under those circumstances, with a smaller and much more economical yard actually in full operation, it was not possible to continue.  I cannot change those facts and I am not going to pretend that anything can be done. It would be quite easy for me to say that something will be done, but, so far as I know at the present moment, no case has been put forward, even on a moderately sound basis, upon which the State would be entitled to expend the very considerable sum of money which would be required to put what would be a rather uneconomic size of dock into operation as a ship-building yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry raised the question of a previous tenant of the Office of Public Works who proved to be a bad tenant.  He said he never heard of a settlement in relation to that matter. The settlement in relation to that matter was disclosed in full detail to this House on, I think, the last <Col N="1392" /> Estimate, if not on the preceding one. It is on the records of the House and there is no difficulty in ascertaining what was done.  A question was also raised with regard to an existing industry there, the size of which I think was exaggerated.  In relation to that matter I may say that every consideration that is possible within the limitations of the duty of the State to the user of that building will be given. More than that we cannot do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen raised the question of a Courtown coastguard house.  I do not know the circumstances of that case, but I will look into the matter.  We have already dealt with the New Ross embankments.  As regards the matter raised by Deputy Corish in connection with schools, I have already given you the story of the gradual increase in the work which has been done in the last two years and, if it is interrupted now, it must be taken that it is interrupted very unwillingly.  In the three years, 1934-37, the amount of the State grant was £130,000; in 1937-38 the amount was £160,000; in 1938-39 it was £197,000, and last year the figure was £230,000.  We had budgeted to do work to the value of £250,000 and we would have done it but for certain interruptions. We probably would have been budgeting for £300,000 this year if circumstances were different.</P>

      <P>I would not know the circumstances about an individual school.  I do know there are numbers of schools involved, but it is really a question of getting the whole work done.  We are doing the best we can, clearing off the schedule which we have and in which, no doubt, that particular school is included.  All the schools that have to be done will be done as rapidly as possible.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of the Drainage Commission Report.  He would very much like to get from me some engagement as to the date on which this thing will be completed.  I should like to point out that a man who enters into an engagement may <Col N="1393" /> render himself liable to be sued for breach of promise and I am not in a position to enter into any definite engagement with the Deputy.  It is very difficult to get a form of words which will convey to the Deputy the impression I want to convey to him, without leaving myself either under an engagement or subject to a breach of promise. I am perfectly satisfied, and I think the Deputy's experience of commissions will bear me out when I say that that commission, from the day it was set up to the present time, has been with the fullest possible energy pursuing its task of investigating the whole subject and formulating a report.  It had reached the stage some time ago where the findings of the commission were to be vetted by a technical committee.  This is a highly technical question.</P>

      <P>If I were the Deputy in this particular case, I would be more hopeful than I am entitled to tell him to be.  I remember in the Budget discussion Deputy O'Sullivan raising a point with the Minister, and there was a suggestion that the Minister might not be too attentive to the economic aspects of a proposition.  But there must be some limit to the proposition which he will accept.  I think the proposition Deputy O'Sullivan has in mind is one in which the whole of the capital cost will have to be paid by the State, in which the totality of the improvement would not equal the cost of the maintenance and in which the security of the finished work would be absolutely doubtful.  I do not think that is a definition of liberality in relation to the spending of public money that the Minister for Finance is going to impose upon me or upon anybody else. I have the greatest possible sympathy with the Deputy in the matter, but there is some limit, and I think his case is the absolute limit.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of applying the means test, in regard to old age pensions, I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether or not the local investigation officer has any discretion in the matter. I will give a concrete case to bring home what I want to point out.  I know a man who will be 81 years of age next November.  He has been drawing the old age pension for the past two or three years.  He does two nights a week watching for his old employer, for whom he was working for 53 or 54 years.  He watches a ship which comes into port.  He has to go out at 5 o'clock in the evening and remain until 8 o'clock.  He gets 7/6 each night.  It was discovered that he was doing that work and he has received notice during the past week that his pension is reduced by 2/- as from the 19th May last.  This man's wife is 68 years of age.  I am just wondering whether the investigation officer is too conscientious in a matter such as that.  I do not think that it is expected that a man should be so rigid in applying the means test.  I have written to the Department and to the <Col N="1398" /> investigation officer and I am told that they cannot do anything in the matter. I am quite satisfied that the Minister or anybody else does not expect that test to be applied too rigidly in the case of a man who is 81 years of age, who has to give up two nights in the week to support himself and his wife.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I put down this motion as I have felt, for some time past, that there is not a true appreciation of the position of the rate-paying community in this country, that is, of the position of the agricultural community in general. Efforts have been made all around us to assist production in other countries, but the same effort has not been made here.  One of the best, and, in fact, the only way to assist production is to relieve overhead charges and other such burdens which press heavily on the farming community.  One of those burdens is the rates.  The rating position has been rather abnormal.  If one were to study the figures since 1920, or even since 1930 or 1934, one would be surprised at the position of the rate-paying community to-day.  If the Government in 1932, or previous to that and since that, thought the rate-paying community were entitled to certain relief because of their burdens, that relief is not at all comparable with what was given in 1932.  I have here the figures in relation to ratings in the country, and in my own county in particular.  The gross demand for rates in 1931-32 in Roscommon was £86,000 and the relief by way of agricultural grant was £61,000.  Last year the rates amounted to £128,000, the same as this year, and the grant was increased to £65,000.  If the Minister would only consider the whole position that has arisen and that has brought about that situation, he would realise &mdash;much as he may feel that the Government is dealing generously with the farming community&mdash;if he compares the figures 1931-32, 1933-34, 1935-36 with 1939-40 and 1940-41 that it is not the same position at all.  The burden has been increased enormously.  It was in order to draw attention to that that I moved that the Vote be referred back for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> The rate warrants of county councils in 1931-32 were £2,527,916 and against that a grant of £1,948,000 was given. In 1932-33&mdash;when the present Government had come into power&mdash;the grant had been increased by the predecessors of the Government by £750,000.  The present Government wanted to show its further consideration and generosity and increased it by another £250,000, bringing the total grant to £2,198,022. At that time the rate warrant was £2,453,000.  To-day, 1939-40, the rate warrant is £3,863,000 and the grant is £1,870,000 or £328,000 less than what it was in the year 1932-33.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will realise that it is impossible for the rate-paying community to carry the burden which is at present being placed upon them.  He will also realise that, on the other side of the Border and in Great Britain, they have derating, and yet the agricultural community here has to go into competition with those people.  If this overhead charge were a fixed one, there would be something to be said for it, but it is of such a type that one never knows the position.  Consequently, it is manifestly unfair that the farmer&mdash;who is the producer&mdash;must make provision for anything that may arise.  The Government does not appear to appreciate the changed position.  In addition to that we have&mdash;as recorded in the Minister for Finance's speech on the Budget&mdash;an increase in the estimated charge in respect of dead-weight debt of local authorities.  This is increased from £575,000, in 1931, to £796,000, in 1938.</P>
    <P>All this goes to show that an ever-increasing burden is being placed upon the rate-paying community while our competitors are free from such a burden.  At the same time, our competitors are also receiving a bounty for the cultivation of land, which we are not receiving in this country.  We are at every disadvantage that one could possibly imagine.  Even if we had derating as is given in other places, we would still be at this disadvantage with regard to tillage.  Two pounds an acre are given in bounty across the Border and in Great Britain, while we have no such thing.  The Minister for <Col N="1412" /> Agriculture says that we have fixed prices for beef and wheat and he says he has assisted in that way, but he has not.  There has been an entire misconception in this State with regard to derating.  Derating is nothing new: it is in operation on the other side of the Border and does not seem to have created any administrative difficulties there.  There seems to be an idea&mdash; which, to my mind, is completely false&mdash; that, if derating were given here, it would give an advantage to the man who had a big valuation and was paying high rates.  The same thing might be said with equal force with regard to the halving of the annuities.  The man who had a £5 annuity and got it halved got £2 10s. only, while the man who had a £200 annuity got £100 off. Government spokesmen say that that was of general advantage, while at the same time they pretend that if something similar happened with regard to rating, the man whose rates were £5 or 50/- would be badly treated as against the man who had to pay £100 rates. My idea about the matter&mdash;and I think the Government themselves held this view very strongly when they were giving bounties on certain produce&mdash;is that if the larger farmers were relieved of this burden, it would enable them to give higher prices for the stock which they purchase from the smaller farmers.  It was always held that if a bounty were given on stock exported, as livestock bought for export represented the greater part of the purchases made at our fairs, the bounty would influence prices the whole way down and would create a certain competition in bidding for livestock amongst the people who were actually getting the bounty.  I hold that the same thing is true in regard to the remission of the burdens on the larger farmers.  Calves, for instance, are not reared by the big farmers.  They are reared almost entirely by the smaller farmers and are purchased from them by the larger farmers.  If the large farmer is relieved of a burden of, say, £100 rates, the repercussions of that must be felt the whole way down, because that farmer must enter into competition with his neighbour who is similarly rated and who is also buying <Col N="1413" /> from the small farmer.  If his overheads are reduced by £100, he can afford to give a higher price.  It is an entire misconception to think that if you give derating, you give it at the expense of the small man any more than the having of the annuities was conceded at the expense of the small man.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have increased production in this country&mdash;and that is absolutely necessary&mdash;we should be very anxious to relieve producers of their burdens.  If we are convinced that the burden placed by way of rates on the producing community of this country is retarding production, we ought to make some effort to relieve them.  I am not making any outrageous suggestion in regard to derating or with regard to the provision of more money for agriculture.  I think the farmers of this State are entitled to whatever reliefs their competitors in outside markets enjoy.  If we expect them to produce more, we should at least put them in the same position to make a living wage out of their labours, as their competitors.  We should aim at putting them on an equal footing with those with whom they have to compete in outside markets.  That is all I am asking.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has been any true appreciation of the position of farmers or of the farming community since the days of the late Minister for Agriculture.  In his day, any Acts that were passed, any reliefs that were given were always considered from the standpoint of the repercussion or reactions they were likely to have on agriculture.  We shall have to get back to that outlook.  Agriculture being the main industry, we must see that whatever we do, whatever legislation is enacted is, if not favourable to agriculture, at least not harmful to it. Here we have a burden of which it should be relieved to a much greater extent than it is being relieved by this Supplementary Grant.  If there was an excuse in 1932-33 for a grant of over £2,000,000, considering the amount of the rating warrant at that time, there is greater reason for the same grant or a much higher grant at present.  I maintain that our farmers should be <Col N="1414" /> put in the same position as farmers on the other side; in other words that we should have de-rating.  If we cannot do that we should at least give an increased grant for the relief of rates, something commensurate with the load which these people have to carry.  It is of such an uncertain type that from year to year they do not know what it is going to be.  I have heard from different salesmen, auctioneers and other people engaged in business of that kind, that banks and lending authorities generally are always very chary about the position because of fluctuating amount of rates.  They never know exactly what the outgoings on a farm are to be.  Neither does the farmer himself.  That is an unsatisfactory position, and it is because I want to draw the Minister's attention to what I think has become an intolerable burden on the agricultural community that I am moving that the Estimate be referred back for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Brennan's proposal that the Vote be referred back.  Many Deputies on this side of the House have gone even further than Deputy Brennan went to-day in regard to the general principle of de-rating.  We have definitely pledged ourselves to the proposal of absolute de-rating.  A good case could be made for it, perhaps even a better case now than in former years. A number of Deputies on this side of the House opposed the recent Bill providing for the appointment of managers for county councils.  The main grounds of my opposition to it were that in the circumstances in which local expenditure has now to be undertaken, I did not see that there was going to be any economy under the new system.  I think I did say on that measure that if that Bill were the precursor of a measure of derating I would support it.  I think if you are completely centralising local services&mdash;and I think that most Deputies will discover that that will be practically the effect of the new Bill when it comes into operation&mdash;those who are connected with local government in the future will be more and more under the heel of the head authorities, the Local Government <Col N="1415" /> Department.  As I say, I would not object to that if we could have advanced further on the same lines as our brethren in the North and the people across in England and have given absolute derating.  There would then be a case for the County Management Bill.  If the Government are prepared to make the costs of local services a general charge on the Exchequer, they certainly have the right to control the machinery of local government, but I do not see why they should have that complete control if the burden of local services is still to a great extent borne by the local ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burden of rates has increased tremendously in the last nine or ten years.  Deputy Brennan gave some figures in that regard, but without confining myself to any figures, the fact remains that when you subtract the grant from the rate for the 1931-32 period and apply the same proportion to the rate and grant in the current year, you will find that the amount that actually falls on the ratepayer will be increased to a tremendous extent&mdash; to something over £1,000,000, I think. Now, that is a burden that the ratepayers of the country, generally, are not yet in a position to bear.  Of course, I suppose we shall hear&mdash;we have heard a lot already&mdash;about the increased prosperity of the farmers during this period of general world strife: that prices have risen and that the farmer is now in a better position to pay his rates than he was previously. I think that that is a complete fallacy. Even if we assume that, in some branches of agriculture, some prices have risen, the overhead charges have risen to an altogether greater extent. At any rate, in one particular branch of the farming industry&mdash;that is, the dairying industry&mdash;prices have not risen at all and, in fact, if anything, prices are tending to diminish rather than to increase, and there is a danger, as the Minister for Agriculture pointed out to-day, that the position may become worse, so far as that branch of the farming industry is concerned, inasmuch as it may not be possible to continue some of the subsidies that have <Col N="1416" /> been already given to the dairying industry.  Accordingly, the position of the dairy farmer, generally, is not a rosy one at all.</P>
    <P>Now, if we come to look at the position of the dairy farmer, I think it will be generally found&mdash;taking conditions all over this country generally&mdash;that the man who is a dairy farmer is a man who pays more in rates than the average ratepayer on a farm.  His farm, generally, is of a higher valuation than that of a farmer engaged in other kinds of agricultural industry, because, if his farm is big enough at all to engage in the dairying industry, it may be taken for granted that that farm must have a certain valuation. Therefore, I think it will be found that, taking the dairying farmers generally all over the country, the average valuation of their farms is higher than that of those farmers who are engaged in other forms of agriculture, and the rates, probably, will fall more heavily on those engaged in the dairying industry than on farmers engaged in other types of farming.</P>
    <P>So much for this question of rates, but there is also the question of the distribution of the grants that are provided. It is our contention that, so far as the dairy farmer is concerned, the share of the grants given to him is not nearly enough in comparison with what is given to farmers engaged in other forms of agriculture.  That brings to me an old sore of mine, in connection with which I have launched attacks annually at the Minister for Agriculture, and that is in connection with the distribution of the Agricultural Grant and the injustice of what I might call, having regard to the unemployment relief scheme, making a differentiation between male and female workers.  I shall refer to this matter again, and I am afraid I shall have to refer to it so long as the Agricultural Grant is being distributed in the way in which it is now being distributed. My point is that the number of women workers engaged in the dairying industry must be as great as the number of men engaged in that industry, and probably more.  They do the same kind of work and they get the same amount of wages.  There is <Col N="1417" /> no question of price-cutting or differentiation in that industry, and any women who are engaged in that industry get the same wages and work under the same conditions as the men engaged in it.  Now, my argument is that, if one particular farmer is to be allowed to get a certain amount of the grant because he engages two men, there should be nothing to prevent the farmer who engages two women, under the same conditions and at the same wage, from getting the same relief. I hold that that man is entitled to the same relief as the other type of farmer, but that has been consistently refused, and it is my belief that that is putting a burden on farmers which is unfair&mdash;that is, if you are to relate their conditions to those of their neighbours. I regret that I am compelled to draw the attention of the House to this matter again, and I only hope that other Deputies, who have the interests of the dairying farmers at heart, will support me in any effort that can be made in order to have this injustice remedied. I certainly regard it as an injustice. On every conceivable occasion I drew the attention of this House to that injustice, and shall continue to do so, because I believe it is a real injustice. I know that there are other injustices in connection with the distribution of that grant, but I think that the most flagrant injustice is that there should be the same differentiation between male and female workers, who are paid at the same rate as the men and who work under the same conditions, as is made in other cases where the rate of wages is different and the conditions of work are also different.</P>
    <P>An argument could also be raised on the difference in the amount of relief given to the larger farmer as compared with the smaller farmer.  For some reason, there has always been a tendency in this country to put the small farmer in opposition to the large farmer.  I do not know why that is so. The conditions are the same, but the overhead charges are not the same.  You will always find that the overhead charges of the large farm are greater than those of the small farm, and yet it is the man with the larger farm who is penalised in every possible way.  He <Col N="1418" /> pays about 70 per cent. of the rates, and he pays for much of the reliefs&mdash; and there are many great reliefs&mdash;to which the small farmer is entitled.  The small farmer, with a much smaller rating, is entitled to participate in certain reliefs provided out of the public rates, but the large farmer, who provides a good deal of these rates, is not entitled to such reliefs.  There are hundreds of ways in which the smaller farmer benefits as a result of the payments made by the larger farmer, and I say that any relief that may be voted in this House ought to be regarded as a general relief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the argument that the small farmer did not refuse the having of the annuities. He did not, certainly, and he would be a fool if he did so, but surely nobody would argue that that should be confined to only one class of farmers.  I hope that nobody ever will argue along those lines.  Why should we take the view that rates or anything else should be confined to only one class of farmer?  You might as well argue that, in the case of every benefit that this House provides for various classes of people in this country, there ought to be a differentiation with regard to the distribution of these benefits, whether for the relief of the poor, the sick, the old or infirm, or any other kind of social services, and that we should proceed with its distribution on the lines that one section of the community should get more than another.  I think that that would be a very unfair method of distributing any funds that are at the disposal of the House.  I think that we ought to come to the conclusion&mdash;and I hope we are advancing to the day when we shall be able to agree upon it&mdash;that this House will agree that the ultimate cure for the whole problem is the adoption of the principle of complete derating.  I think that we will have to come to that sooner than most people realise.  A lot of people say that we are getting more united in certain ways every day, and I hope we are.  I hope that the Government Party are learning to come around to our point of view, and that, having shown a very conciliatory spirit towards us&mdash;latterly, anyhow&mdash;they will <Col N="1419" /> go further, and that we will all come sooner or later&mdash;and soon, I hope&mdash;to consider the idea of full derating as a sound policy, particularly considering that a certain portion of this country, which we hope will be united with the rest of the country eventually, is already enjoying the benefits of derating. Let us hope that we, in this part of the country, will also be enabled to enjoy the benefits of derating.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward, in the very near future, to a general demand being made by Deputies and their supporters in the country for the acceptance of that principle.  I have no doubt it is coming.  We are all, as I have said, anxious that the acrimonious debates which we had in the past should cease, and that we should all get a bit better. I think we are approaching that position.  I am afraid, however, that this question of derating will always be a bone of contention.  In my opinion it would be better for the House, for the country and for everybody concerned that the principle of derating was adopted.  If we do not reach agreement on it during the lifetime of the present Government, I would ask them to consider the present position with regard to rating in the country.  In a period of ten years the rates have gone up by something like £1,300,000.  Bearing that figure in mind, there is surely a good case for increasing the agricultural grant.  In conclusion, I desire to say that I heartily support Deputy Brennan's motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett spoke about the inequality of the allocation of the agricultural grant.  I understand the grant was originally introduced for the purpose of increasing employment in agriculture.  Deputy Bennett may be curious to know that the net result from it has been a decline in the amount of employment given in agriculture to the extent of 43,000 people.  In addition to the figures given by Deputy Brennan I should like to put another set before the House. The amount of irrecoverable rates in 1933 was £23,826; in 1934, £44,451; in 1935, £47,482; in 1936, £46,892; in 1937, £37,554, and in 1938, £64,456, so that, in the period taken by Deputy <Col N="1420" /> Brennan, the amount of irrecoverable rates has increased almost three times, while the actual rate in 1933 was £1,300,000 less, and the agricultural grant about £300,000 more than it is to-day.</P>

      <P>It is a very good argument for the present holders to be in favour of derating.  I have here on page 27 of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Derating an argument I would like Deputy Brennan to bear in mind, because he based his argument for an increase in the agricultural grant and in favour of derating on the fact that we need increased production.  This report suggests that even derating would not guarantee us increased production.  Here is what the Commission said: &ldquo;The improbability that any large portion of the rate relief would in the ordinary course be employed to increase production is a serious objection to the proposal to derate.&rdquo;  They did not even hold out any hope.  It does not follow at all that it would increase production.  I am glad now that that derating report has succeeded in clearing up this matter.</P>

I am not making the case that it is much higher in proportion as the rates are higher now than in 1932.  But if the rates are continually going up through the action of the county councils, which are mainly composed of farmers, then the farmers are more responsible than anybody else.  Is it not quite true that the county councils are mainly composed of the farming community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am stating a fact.  There are reasons why the rates go up.  When I was Minister for Local Government and Public Health I urged the county councils to do many things.  I urged them to increase the public health services.  Some county councils who would not adopt the school medical system were compelled by mandamus, for the good of the community, to do so.  There are other things adding to the cost and putting up the rates.  The cost generally went up by this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; we forced them.  The previous Government did the same.  But aside from that, and I am talking of the cost only, some county councils representing their communities did want advances made in social services and public health services. Every time there is a sitting of the Dáil here, some Deputy or other is claiming additional social services. They argue that our social services are not comparable to what these services are in the Six Counties; the spokesmen of the Opposition demand that these services be improved.</P>

      <P>Here is another excerpt from page 59 of the report: &ldquo;It should be appreciated at the outset that the cost of affording relief from rates on agricultural land and buildings must be provided by taxation.&rdquo; We are all agreed on that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer buys an ounce of tobacco or a pint of porter or a glass of John Jameson.  That is the way he transfers it.  You get good value for it.  There is another excerpt: &ldquo;Moreover, we think that if, on general grounds, a redistribution of the national income were decided upon the question whether other sections of the community&mdash;such as, for example, the poorer elements of the town population&mdash;have not at least as strong a claim as agriculturists would still have to be faced.&rdquo;  I am not going to say that if the State could afford it, agriculture is not entitled to further consideration. I certainly agree that agriculture is our main industry and everything and anything that this Government can do to improve, develop and encourage agriculture in the matter of increased production, as Deputy Brennan has said, should be done by the Government keeping its eye on the main interests of the country.</P>
      <P>I believe that should be done.  I cannot see that with our present resources we can do any more.  Certainly this Government, since it came into office, has given a considerable amount towards helping and encouraging agriculture. Apart from the reduction of the annuities, increased prices for certain crops, subsidies of various kinds, the help given to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and a variety of other items, perhaps small, but still amounting in the aggregate to a very considerable sum, grants have been given and are being given for the help and encouragement of agriculture and, with the resources as they are, and in present conditions, I cannot see that we can do more.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,583 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1941, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Minister for Supplies.</P>
      <P>It is only some weeks since the Dáil discussed at some length the Estimate for the previous year for the Department of Supplies.  When moving that Vote, I referred to the special features in the organisation of the Department which are indicated in the Book of Estimates and to which, I presume, it is not necessary to refer again.  I stated then that the main functions of the Department of Supplies are to endeavour to secure the maintenance of essential supplies, to regulate the distribution of commodities which are in short supply or where there is any reason to anticipate a shortage, and to control the prices to be charged for commodities. For the discharge of these functions the Department has been organised on the basis of two divisions, one dealing with the supply of essential commodities and the other dealing with questions of distribution and the control of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the maintenance of supplies, action has been taken by way of administrative arrangements <Col N="1429" /> with various British Government Departments with the object of reducing to a minimum the interference with the flow of goods which would be caused otherwise owing to the operation of the licensing system introduced in the United Kingdom, which is the main source or channel of supply of a wide range of essential commodities required in this country.  Moreover, in cases in which the licensing system has been applied, steps have been taken administratively to secure that licences will be issued for the release of goods to this country, and, in some cases, those steps have been successful.</P>
    <P>Positive measures to maintain supplies have been taken by the control of exports and, in certain cases, by control over imports.  One of the principal objects of the control over exports is to ensure that raw materials grown or produced in this country will be reserved, in the first instance, for home manufacturers or producers.  In the case of a few commodities which were imported from abroad, and which it was anticipated would be in short supply, it was considered necessary to make special arrangements to facilitate the purchase abroad of the goods concerned and their shipment to this country.  Those arrangements took the form of organising importers and the formation of special non-profit-making companies to whom the arrangements for purchase and shipment have been entrusted.  To enable those companies to function properly, imports of the goods with which they were concerned have been prohibited save under licence, and it has been arranged that, ordinarily, licence to import will be granted only to the special companies which have been formed for that purpose. Those arrangements have so far been applied in respect of grain, animal feeding stuffs, and timber.</P>
    <P>It is obviously desirable so far as possible to ensure that there will be an equitable distribution amongst consumers of any essential commodity of which the supply may be short, and, where necessary, special arrangements to achieve that object are being made and will be made.  The position in that regard, however, is the same as on the previous occasion on which the <Col N="1430" /> Dáil discussed matters of supply; that is to say, it has only been found necessary yet to institute a system of rationing in relation to one commodity &mdash;petrol.</P>
    <P>In the months since the outbreak of hostilities the general position concerning supplies has been one of relative ease.  A number of factors contributed to that end, and of these not the least important was the Emergency Supplies Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce. That branch, which was set up in September, 1938, had the special duty of preparing plans for coping with the problems which would arise under emergency conditions in relation to the maintenance and distribution of essential supplies.</P>
    <P>A complete survey of requirements was made, and industrialists and traders were urged to increase their stocks to the utmost practicable limits. The extra stocks which were accumulated as a result of these activities were particularly valuable in relieving the difficulties caused by the dislocation in supplies, which resulted from the first impact of war.  Their value did not, however, extend to the initial stage, and in more recent times these stocks have, in many cases, helped substantially in enabling the demand for various kinds of goods to be met satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The stocks are not yet exhausted, but there are signs that the margins they have helped to fill will, in the case of some industrial raw material&mdash;and I mention particularly iron and steel&mdash; become wider, because of the increasing difficulties that are being found in obtaining fresh supplies.  Generally speaking, the experience in the period since the war began affords no true guide as to the future position in regard to essential supplies, and I think it is very desirable to emphasise that fact both in this House and outside it.  We may expect that there will be shortages, some of which will be likely to continue in existence for the entire duration of the war.  The difficulties will grow as the field of combatant activity extends, and, while every effort will be made to meet them, <Col N="1431" /> it has to be anticipated that they will not be entirely overcome.</P>
    <P>Many commodities are not now on tap, as ordinarily they are in times of peace, and if the supply difficulties inseparable from war conditions are to be tackled with any hope of their being successfully alleviated, it is essential that programmes of future requirements should be prepared.  That advanced planning must cover the longest possible period ahead, and it requires that there should be the most complete co-operation with the Department of Supplies by producers, wholesalers and other importers in estimating requirements.  As the Dáil is aware, an Order was made under the Emergency Powers Act, called the Control of Exports Order, the primary purpose of which was to regulate the outward flow of goods either of home or foreign production, so as to reserve an adequate proportion of the available supplies to meet home demands. Under that Order the export of certain commodities was prohibited, save under licence.  A list of these commodities was published in the Press. There have since been amendments by way of additions or withdrawals, and these amendments have also been published from time to time.</P>
    <P>In some cases special measures have had to be taken to overcome the difficulties of administering the Control of Exports Order, arising from the absence of any characteristic feature by which prohibited goods could be readily identified from licensed goods of the same general description when offered for export at a port or land frontier station.  In the case of raw wool, it is necessary to reserve only certain grades and qualities for the home manufacture of woollens and worsteds.  Those merchants and wool exporting merchants have been consulted, and an arrangement was made which worked successfully during the first six months of the war, in restricting exports of the kinds of homegrown wool required by manufacturers in this country.  There is now under consideration a scheme for the sale of our entire exportable surplus of wool to the United Kingdom Wool Control.</P>

Before the war from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. of our wool exports went to the United Kingdom, but only about 10 per cent. of our exports went to that country in the six months from September, 1939.  In that six months' period the bulk of our wool was sold in the Low Countries and in the United States of America.  There is now no market in Holland or Belgium, and sales to the United States of America are likely to become more difficult on account of the scarcity of shipping space, as well as the uncertainty of the demand.  A definite arrangement to sell to one buyer would have many advantages, provided, of course, that a satisfactory price can be negotiated. There have been preliminary discussions with the interested parties for the purpose of settling the necessary details, and it is the intention to give adequate representation in any exporting organisation that may be formed to the interests concerned in the marketing of wool.  It is also the intention to use the Prices Branch of the Department of Supplies to ensure that a fair return for his wool will be obtained by the farmer producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special arrangement has also been applied in restriction of the exports of waste paper and rags, after consultation with paper manufacturers and waste paper and rag merchants.  Fully satisfactory results have not been obtained from the export control as applied to hides and skins.  To conserve for the Irish tanners the hides they want for upper leather production, it has been decided to refuse licences for the export of calf skins and light hides.  But there is evidence to suggest that these prohibited qualities are being exported concealed in bundles of heavier and coarser hides for which licences have been given.  That matter is at present under consideration, and discussions have taken place with the Federation of Irish Tanners in connection with it. It is obviously desirable that action should be taken to prevent that evasion of our export regulations, even <Col N="1433" /> if it should have drastic consequences for the persons concerned.  Amongst goods, the export of which has been prohibited, and for which no export licences are being granted, are the following: Scrap sheet lead, scrap lead piping, scrap zinc, scrap sheet aluminium, soap, wheat, barley, oats and maize.  In the case of maize there was until recently a substantial illicit export over the land frontier, and a number of offenders were successfully prosecuted in the courts.  This traffic has now ceased or, at least, has been reduced to insignificant proportions.</P>
    <P>Another objective of the control of exports is to prevent a transit trade with the United Kingdom in goods which are prohibited from entry to that country if consigned from a source other than this country.  The United Kingdom Government, as Deputies are aware, have prohibited the importation &mdash;save under licence&mdash;of a wide range of goods, but, in order to facilitate the normal trade of this country with them, they have issued in our favour an open general licence under which all goods consigned from this country, save a relatively small number, are admitted without special licence.  This concession, which was arranged by administrative action, is clearly of material advantage to this country, and it is very important that the benefits of it should not be withdrawn or curtailed by abuse on the part of British importers in having goods, prohibited from direct entry to the United Kingdom, consigned to them from abroad through this country.  Several attempts to evade the British restrictions in this manner have been discovered or anticipated, and to defeat these attempts, restrictions have been applied under our Control of Exports Order to the exports of biscuits, grapes, buttons, elastic, glass, and glassware.</P>
    <P>There is a very large number of commodities in respect of which difficulties of supply have arisen or have been anticipated and in relation to which action has been taken by my Department.  It is not possible, in the course of my statement here, to review, even briefly, the position in respect of each of these commodities, and I propose <Col N="1434" /> to deal only with some essential commodities in relation to which the supply position is of general public interest.  The first of these is, of course, wheat.  Up to the present, supplies of imported wheat have been maintained at normal levels, and the total stock in the country, including the special reserve established before the war was, on the 30th April, 151,000 tons or, approximately, 15 weeks' supply.  In addition, on that date a number of forward purchases had been made and, taking these forward purchases into account, the position on the 30th April was that the total stock in hand or in sight was 218,000 tons, or the equivalent of 22 weeks' supply.  It is anticipated that the arrangements for buying and shipping wheat which have been made will be reasonably sufficient as a safeguard for the continuity of supplies from abroad, but that depends on the future course of the war, and any development that further impedes shipping will increase the risks to be faced.  To meet these risks, home production of wheat is being stimulated. It is anticipated that the wheat crop of this year will yield us, approximately, 45 per cent. of our total annual requirements.</P>

The national percentage required to be fixed by the Minister for Agriculture under the Cereals Act has now been fixed at 45, but it is possible that the actual crop will be larger and that an additional percentage may have to be fixed later.  The price of imported wheat, on distribution, is fixed by Grain Importers, Limited, in consultation with my Department.  For the four ports of importation, a uniform price is fixed from time to time by reference to the cost of purchases coming forward and also to the cost and levels of stock already in hands.</P>

In fixing the price, regard is had to the price at which grain is being sold at the time, the cost at which the stocks in hand were purchased, and the levels of these stocks. In addition, a levy of 3d. per ton is imposed to meet the administrative costs of the company.  The current allocation price of imported wheat is 55/- per 480 lbs.  As there has been no difficulty in maintaining supplies of wheat heretofore, there has been, of course, no shortage of flour and, consequently, few complaints have been made as to the difficulty of obtaining supplies of flour.</P>

      <P>The supplies are allocated to the flour millers.  If any of the members of this company are directors of flour mills, the flour mills of which they are directors get their normal allocation of wheat, based upon the quota of the mill as fixed by legislation a number of years ago.</P>
      <P>The extraction of flour from wheat still remains around 70 per cent. but, as Deputies are aware, all flour is now straight-run.  Circumstances have not yet arisen requiring an increase in the extraction and, in any event, we consider it desirable to keep the extraction about the present figure so as not to reduce the output of wheat offals.  The extraction is the same as it was pre-war and, notwithstanding war conditions, the public are still getting very high-class flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position concerning maize on the 30th April last was that stocks held <Col N="1437" /> by the importing company and by the millers were estimated at 27,000 tons, or about four weeks' supply.  At that date, forward purchases amounted to 91,000 tons.  Of those forward purchases, approximately 22,000 tons have since been landed.  There is reason to expect that supplies of maize will continue to come forward under the arrangement made, but there can, of course, be no certainty in present circumstances, and additional supplies, though fairly regular, have been insufficient to meet full demands.  There is no evidence that the restriction on the supplies of maize to millers has resulted in a shortage of maize that could be regarded as amounting to serious proportions.  Nevertheless, until supplies increase above the present level, if they do increase, there can be no expansion in allocations to millers.  On the 30th April, the stock in the country and the cargoes in sight represented cover for the country's requirements to the end of August, and could reasonably be regarded as the minimum safety margin.  While that position remains, and while it continues necessary to restrict supplies to millers to something less than 100 per cent. of normal pre-war requirements, no provision can be made for increasing supplies in the case of individual millers, or for supplies to persons who did not mill maize during the 12-monthly period preceding the outbreak of the war.  Such provision could only be made by reducing the quantities of maize available to established millers, but that would represent a departure from the principle underlying the distribution arrangements which could not be accepted in present circumstances. The price at which maize is allocated is determined in the same manner as in the case of wheat.  The present allocation price of maize is £11 4s. per ton.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with the position of all commodities, even though in respect to some of them difficulties have arisen, or are anticipated. If Deputies are interested in any particular commodity, I am prepared to give them whatever information is available when I am concluding the debate.  So far as animal feeding-stuffs <Col N="1438" /> are concerned, we have been able to maintain reasonable supplies heretofore, and the same is true in the case of tea, in respect to which no difficulties have arisen yet, although that statement must not be interpreted as meaning that difficulties may not arise in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will merely mention that up to the present there has been no difficulty in maintaining full supplies of tea.  In the case of sugar, as a result of the arrangement made the supply position has been satisfactorily maintained, and in the middle of the present month the stocks held represented the requirements for about 30 weeks.  Arrangements are being made for the purchase of further supplies and these further supplies will be brought in mainly in the form of raw sugar.  It is expected that during the current season the total area to be sown with beet will exceed 60,000 acres and, with normal conditions as to yield, that acreage should yield sugar in excess of 90,000 tons.  It is not anticipated, therefore, that any difficulty will be experienced in making suitable arrangements to provide whatever additional quantities are necessary to meet our full requirements in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not impossible.  I want to make special reference to agricultural fertilisers.  In the course of the present year approximately 85 per cent. of our normal requirements of <Col N="1439" /> superphosphate were made available from home sources.  Some manufactured superphosphates were imported. Deputies will remember that we had a discussion on this matter before.  The restrictions upon the importation of manufactured superphosphates were removed here, although at that time the countries from which supplies of manufactured superphosphates might be obtained were maintaining a prohibition on export.  With the conclusion of the season in those areas, it was found possible to obtain licences for the export of the stocks of fertilisers remaining in the manufacturers' and distributors' hands and some parcels of fertilisers were imported here.  The recent developments in the war have, of course, shut off that source of supply.  There are, however, still some lots available and these are being procured. I understand the Irish Sugar Company have made arrangements to import a quantity of superphosphate which, with the quantity of special beet manures available from the Irish Fertilisers Manufacturers' Association, will provide adequately for the needs of the sugar beet crop.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to be specific as to what the position is likely to be in respect to the supply of raw materials for the manufacture of fertilisers for the 1940-41 season.  We have made a careful estimate of our requirements, but it is anticipated that shipping difficulties will again prove to be of considerable magnitude.  We will, of course, have to make every effort to overcome them.  Our supplies of rock phosphate come from North Africa, and it is in relation to them that difficulties concerning shipping are anticipated. The present source of supply of potash manures is Alsace.  Supplies from that region may be cut off through war operations.  There is an alternative source of supply in Spain, from which it is expected some supplies can be obtained to meet requirements should the necessity arise.  I can say that the Department of Supplies is fully conscious of the necessity for taking every possible step to maintain a full supply of agricultural fertilisers.  We will do everthing possible to that end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility of obtaining supplies from Spain.  I want to make a brief reference to coal.  Our supplies of coal come entirely from Great Britain.  For a period after the outbreak of war the maintenance of those supplies was found to depend in some measure on the prices settled for deliverance.  In pre-war years the prices to this country were above the general export prices and lower than British internal prices.  When the industry was taken over under British Government control after the outbreak of war, the first step taken was to level up export and bunker prices with British inland prices.  In view, however, of the existing schedule of prices in operation for this country, the application of increased prices here presented a complication for the British control.  Accordingly, the matter was discussed between representatives of our Coal Imports Committee and the British collieries and an agreement was reached in November, 1939, providing for an increase of 1/6 per ton on coals shipped here.  Even with that increase there was still a wide differential between the prices at which British coals were sold in this country and the prices obtained for British coals in other markets.</P>
      <P>The Central Council of Colliery Owners, early this year, represented that such a wide differential, exceeding in some instances 4/- per ton, would make it impossible to maintain supplies to this country, more particularly having regard to the growing demand for British coal.  Accordingly, they submitted fresh price proposals for the coming year which commenced on the 1st May.  With a view to ensuring that supplies would not be cut off almost entirely, the proposed schedule has been agreed which, generally, means an advance of 2/6 a ton on existing winter prices, with the exception of South Wales where, for large and sized industrial coals the increase will be 4/4 per ton, and 3/- per ton for other industrial coal in that area.  The normal summer reductions for house coals have been discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> Apart from a period of temporary dislocation which followed the severe weather conditions in January of this year, the supplies of coal have heretofore been forthcoming in quantities adequate to meet demands.  The position for the future, however, will be materially worse, and it is expected that from now onwards deliveries of coal from Great Britain to this country will be substantially below the amount required to meet our demands.  That position arises from the fact that more and more coal is required by Great Britain for her own war effort and for the war needs of her allies.  It has been indicated to us that every effort will be made to maintain supplies to this country at as high a level as possible, but it is understood that, in fact, not more than about 80 per cent. of our requirements will be provided.  Steps to meet the new situation created by that curtailment of supplies are being taken urgently, and arrangements are being made immediately to deal with it.  Deliveries for domestic consumption will have to be restricted, but that restriction, we trust, will be accompanied by measures intended to relieve any undue hardship on the poor.  It is intended, so far as possible, to maintain the supplies for industrial and similar purposes so as to prevent any increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the one commodity in respect of which definite shortage involved a rationing scheme, is petrol.  Up to the present we are endeavouring to make available all the petrol required for essential road services, both passenger and freight services, for commercial goods vehicles, for general haulage tractors and agricultural tractors and machines.  The requirements of local authorities, of industrial users and of persons who require petrol for domestic purposes, such as for lamps, are fully supplied, but, as all these services get practically their full requirements, other vehicle owners must of necessity be strictly rationed.</P>
    <P>Every attention is, however, given to the needs of owners of small service vehicles, that is to say, taxis, hackney cars, and the like, and the requirements of the owners of these vehicles <Col N="1442" /> are being liberally met.  After all, these services have been provided for, the balance of the petrol available is distributed as equitably as possible, always keeping in mind those persons who require to use their cars as part of their profession or business.  Those persons include clergymen, doctors, veterinary surgeons, commercial travellers and a great many other classes.  At the moment, the basic allowance for private cars has been increased by 50 per cent., and, taking into consideration the difficulties which have been experienced in obtaining supplies, the owners of private motor cars must be regarded as getting generous treatment. For the summer months also, private motorists are not compelled to purchase their basic allowances in the month for which the coupon is available. Petrol may be purchased at any time within the rationing period.  That arrangement was intended to facilitate the public demand during the holiday season, but I want to make it clear that I can hold out no hope that an increase in the allowance now made can be granted.  In other words, if a private motorist uses his three months' supply of petrol in the month of May, he cannot expect additional allowances for the other two months.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of all concerned that there should be full co-operation with the Department of Supplies in carrying out the petrol rationing scheme.  I have received complaints that garage proprietors who were complying with the law, selling petrol in exchange for coupons, were losing trade to persons who were illegally selling petrol, that is, selling petrol and not receiving coupons for it.  For some time past, however, inspectors have been enforcing the regulations, and such complaints are now much fewer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They had the petrol in stock.  I want to warn those garage proprietors that they will be wasting their time appealing to the Department for additional supplies.  Those who sold petrol without receiving coupons will find themselves short of <Col N="1443" /> supplies and will have to remain so.  I think it is worthy of mention that there has been no very substantial reduction in the number of any type of motor cars registered this year as compared with last year.  That is somewhat difficult to explain, but it is a fact.  It is true, of course, that the number of private cars registered in January is always less than in the summer months, and it is yet too early to say how the summer figures will compare, but, up to the present, the introduction of petrol rationing or the increases in the price of petrol have not, apparently, effected any significant reduction in the number of cars on the roads.</P>
      <P>I want to make reference to our position concerning woollen and worsted yarns in connection with which there have been considerable difficulties which have occupied a considerable proportion of the time of the officers of my Department.  Our import requirements are met ordinarily almost entirely from the United Kingdom, and since the war began difficulties have been found in getting tops, yarns, and raw wool owing to the control which has been applied by the British Government to the wool trade and to the distribution of supplies for both internal and external needs.  The difficulties have been greatest in the case of the lower quality worsted yarns, for which there is a large demand by the hoisery and knitting industries. Supplies of the finer counts of higher quality yarns have not been curtailed so severely, but even these yarns have not been forthcoming in quantities fully sufficient to meet the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations with the British Government Department administering the wool control have taken place on the basis of our requirements, and it has been agreed generally that merino tops and raw wool will be allocated to this country during the current year in quantities which bear the same ratio to total requirements as that adopted for the allocation being made to firms in the United Kingdom for the civilian trade of that country.  No provision has been made for an allocation of the lower quality yarns, but the question <Col N="1444" /> of supplies of these qualities for Government needs in this country is being pursued.  At the same time, efforts are being made to obtain an improvement of the 2,000,000 lbs. of merino tops, and the 750,000 lbs. of raw wool which have been allocated to us.</P>
    <P>In the case of timber, as the Dáil will remember, the position at the outbreak of war was that reasonable stocks were then held by importers, and it was found possible, during the period from September to the middle of November, to replenish and augment the stocks by imports from Scandinavia, the Baltic and Canada.  Cargoes from Scandinavia and the Baltic areas generally must now be regarded as being finally cut off, and, for the future, importers will have to depend, in the main, on supplies from Canada. The chief difficulties to be encountered in arranging such supplies will arise on account of the shortage of shipping space, but it is believed that arrangements which are now being put in train will help materially to resolve those difficulties, and that supplies will be sufficient to meet the reduced demand in the war period.  The position will also probably be relieved to some extent by the substitution of other materials for timber in building construction and other works.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that we have experienced considerable difficulties concerning the supply of iron and steel, and it is anticipated that these difficulties will continue.  In the early days of the war, there was a very considerable interruption of supplies, due largely to the inevitable disorganisation of normal industrial life and to the congestion and delays in transport inseparable from a major emergency.  The position improved somewhat, however, and, for a time, it looked as if we were likely to get reasonable, if not fully normal, supplies of all the metals we required.  The intensification of the war effort on the part of Great Britain is, however, now reflecting itself, so far as we are concerned, in the restriction with increasing rigidity of the quantities and varieties of essential metals that are being made available to us.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to stress the vital <Col N="1445" /> and paramount importance which a nation at war attaches to steel, iron, copper, brass, aluminium and so forth, and, consequently, we must face up to the certainty of increased and increasing difficulty in obtaining supplies of those metals from United Kingdom sources.  Within the past week or so, the Department has been in communication with the users and consumers of these metals in this country in an effort to obtain a reliable estimate of what our essential requirements are.  The results are being examined at the moment, and it is hoped to use the information so obtained in further efforts to improve and ensure the supply position.</P>
    <P>I do not propose now to deal with any other individual commodity, unless some Deputy requires information as to some commodity I have not referred to. I want to refer again to one of the principal activities of the Department, that is, control of prices.  The system of price control in operation was described by me at some length when the activities of my Department were last reviewed here, and it seems unnecessary, therefore, to cover the same ground again, as there has been no change since in either the organisation or the methods adopted.  Generally, the object aimed at is to limit profits and profit margins to normal or peacetime proportions, and to restrict price increases to the recovery of unavoidable and proved increases in costs.  As a rule, the persons and firms concerned co-operate with the Department, and it is not necessary in most cases to make formal orders.  The prices are agreed with the Department and the arrangements are then brought into operation voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The increases permitted are, as I have said, in respect of unavoidable increases incurred, and every effort is made to secure that new costs like increased wages are not automatically passed on to the rest of the community. A common ground for a claim for increased prices is that precaution must be taken to accumulate reserves to meet a possible fall in prices after the war.  The circumstances that arose after the last war are held out as a precedent, but, so far, there are no <Col N="1446" /> good grounds for believing that the post-war conditions of 25 years ago will be repeated.  There is now a national Government whose duty it will be to look after the particular interests of our own people in such an eventuality.  We cannot, therefore, agree to permit the public to be mulcted to safeguard a situation that may never arise.  There may be exceptional cases in which some special arrangement must be made, but all such cases are considered on their merits.</P>
    <P>So far as producers are concerned, it might be said that no increases are made in the prices of commodities of importance to the community without the knowledge and the consent of my Department.  That involves the continuous review and revision of costs by the staff concerned, including, in numerous cases, the examination of accounts.  In the course of the past few months, investigations have been made into the prices of a very large list of commodities.  The control of prices charged by importers, wholesalers or retailers is a much more formidable task and a huge organisation would be required to do that work completely. The multiplicity of methods and customs of determining profit margins is such that a rigid enforcement is possible only for a limited number of commodities.  For the remainder, control on broad lines is exercised, either by agreement with groups of trades, or by survey and inspection of individual traders.</P>
    <P>So far as retail prices are concerned, the assistance of the public is especially desirable.  All complaints of apparent excess retail charges are investigated. The number of complaints received is decreasing and has fallen substantially in recent months compared with the number soon after the beginning of the emergency.  Prices investigations have been carried out locally and some 40 cities and towns have been visited by members of the staff of the Depart ment for that purpose.  Special attention is paid to the prices of coal and foodstuffs during those investigations, and, in the past couple of months, coal has been the commodity particularly <Col N="1447" /> concerned.  The prices branch has been of considerable assistance to local authorities as well as to other Government contracting departments, in advising them on the prices charged in their contracts, and a very large sum has been saved to the taxpayer and the ratepayer as a result of these activities.</P>
    <P>I understand that the review I have just given of the work of the Department and the outline of the activities upon which it is engaged is necessarily brief.  I may not have dealt with quite a number of commodities about which Deputies are concerned, or about which they may have received representations. There is a motion down to refer back the Estimate.  That possibly relates to some matter I have referred to, or it possibly relates to some matter I have not referred to, but if there is any matter about which any member of the House requires further information, I shall be only too glad to oblige him, if I can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. In proposing the motion to refer back this Estimate I was guided by the difficulty in finding out where the Prices Commission were really located.  When the Minister made a statement about his Department on a Supplementary Vote, I raised the matter of the Prices Commission and he disclaimed responsibility. On the Vote of the Minister for Industry and Commerce I endeavoured to raise this point and I was told that, in the meanwhile, the responsibility for the Prices Commission had been referred back to the Minister for Supplies and that he was now responsible for that body.  I understand that the facts are midway between those two points of view, and that the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce for the activities of the Prices Commission relates only to the Extension of Functions Act, 1938 (No. 15 of 1938), that is, where they would review, at the request of the Minister, the operation of customs duty and other import restrictions.  The <Col N="1448" /> rest of the responsibility for the Prices Commission, I understand, rests with the Minister for Supplies.  It is very dangerous to prophesy in these days, but I would venture to make a minor prophecy, namely, that the reviews under this Extension of Functions Act will probably be few and far between this year.  That means that really the whole of the Prices Commission expenses ought to be put on the Vote of the Minister for Supplies. The fact is that they do not appear in it at all.  As I say, the difficulty I had in finding out who was responsible for that body is what prompted me to put down this motion. I do not know whether the Minister would agree with what I have said: I may be wrong, but if I am right&mdash;and I have tried very carefully to ascertain the facts&mdash;I would like to ask him how he can get out of assuming responsibility and putting something into his Estimate for the Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly wanted to call attention to the activities of the Prices Commission, as they have a procedure of costings, when they engage in negotiations with manufacturers, which I think is rather unjust to other sections of the trade.  The distributors are not called in, and the treatment, as between a manufacturer in Ireland and the distributors in Ireland, on the question of price is that the price is reviewed by the Prices Commission and fixed in consultation with the manufacturer, the distributors being left absolutely without any redress and not consulted in any way.  The Minister may say that he has no responsibility for the distributing trade and that they ought to look after themselves.  That might be quite fair if an absolute monopoly in certain industries had not been handed over to certain manufacturers. That being so, I think it behoves the Minister and the Government to see there is fair play as between those two sections of the community.  One instance comes to my mind where the manufacturer was called upon by the Prices Commission to reduce the price to the public.  He did so, but he did not reduce the price to the distributors, and the position was that the distributors had to forgo the amount of the <Col N="1449" /> profit by which the price of the article had been reduced, while the manufacturer's profit on the transaction was not reduced at all.  That is the sort of thing that arises when one section of the community is left without any appeal.</P>
    <P>As an instance of that sort of thing and of the effect it is producing on the distributing trade, I made a list of seven firms which, in the last 12 months had been selling one particular commodity&mdash;amongst others.  They all sold this particular commodity, and these seven firms either went bankrupt, closed down, or carried an arrangement with their creditors.  My conclusion was that these firms employed 190 persons between them.  If the distributing trades are cleaned out at that rate, it will not be very long until the unemployment figures become a great deal higher than they are at present.  All sections of the community in this country should get a square deal from the Minister's Department.  It should not be a case of a manufacturer being handed an absolute monopoly and his treatment of other sections of the trade not being subject to review.  That position should be rectified and, while I am sure the Minister will contend that there are very many important and weighty matters engaging his attention at the present time, he cannot do anything better than put in order the system in which the trade of this country is carried on.</P>
    <P>As far as commodities are concerned, he has given us a very comprehensive survey, although he has pleaded that he has not covered the whole ground. I suppose we would be here until tomorrow if he tried to cover all the commodities that come into this country, but certainly his Department, in very difficult times, are doing their best, I think, to increase supplies.  Of course, they make mistakes, and there are matters in which people do not see eye to eye with them, but I think that there is a very great endeavour made to do what is possible for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is one very important commodity to which the Minister did not refer in his statement <Col N="1450" /> and that is paper.  Perhaps in his reply he would give some indication as to what is the position in that regard.  I understand that there is no pulping plant in this country&mdash;I do not know whether that is correct or not&mdash;and that the pulp is imported for paper manufacture here.  That means that we must rely on Canada for supplies.  I think the Minister might give some information as to what the possibilities are, because I am afraid our people are living in a fool's paradise in this matter.  We are consuming paper at the same rate, in many cases, as in normal times, and we are allowing supplies to run very low.  Suddenly we may find that the supplies have reached vanishing point.  That remark applies also to newsprint.  We all know that newspapers have been drastically cut in size on the other side, whereas the cut in the size of our own newspapers has been of a very minor nature.</P>
      <P>There are a few smaller matters to which the Minister might also refer in his reply.  There is the question of fats, for instance, in which I know the position is rather difficult, and also the question of starch.  The Food Controller in England, I understand, has cut supplies of this commodity to about two-thirds of normal requirements. There is a certain amount manufactured in this country.  I take it the Minister will permit that manufacture to go on, but, as regards imported starches, whether the two-thirds reduction will apply also to this country, I do not know.  The Minister in his remarks referred also to the question of waste. I should be glad if he could give us any information on that matter because it appears to me that no satisfactory arrangements are being made in this country for salvage of any description. It may be that salvage is not worth while.  I do not know, but if anything could be done in regard to salvage, I think some energetic steps should be taken to make it effective.  That would tend to spin out existing supplies of finished materials which can be made from some of the articles that are going to waste at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The supply of almost all our essential requirements, apart <Col N="1451" /> altogether from price, was, since the inception of the emergency, on the whole fairly satisfactory, but I agree with the Minister that no man can venture to express an opinion as to the future, because the position must be influenced in a great measure by the development and the extent of the war. For that reason, the position must be tackled in varying circumstances, as it arises.  I simply want to refer to a few matters that I consider of some importance.  On the question of wool, the Minister mentioned that the intention is to sell our surplus supply to the United Kingdom Control.  I wonder could the Minister give us any information as to when he hopes to have prices fixed, because I am sure the Minister is aware that this year's clip is off at present?  It is in the hands of the farmers, and no price has yet been fixed.  Tentative prices are being offered here and there, but the clip cannot be stored in proper places and may become damaged.  Some producers would like to sell on the understanding that the merchant would take it over, and that he would pay whatever price is fixed later on.  I suppose that would be a proper solution.  If the producer were informed that a price would be fixed by the Minister or his Department later on, I think it would be the proper procedure, but it would be advisable to have the clip in a proper store.  The position at the moment is very unsatisfactory, and the sooner it is clarified the better.  An early announcement as to how the price is going to be arrived at, as between the farmer and the merchant, is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the supply of artificial manures is a very important matter, and it is probably going to present a problem for the coming year. I think the House was given to understand by the Minister, in discussing this matter before, that a considerable percentage of our requirements in phosphates was in the hands of merchants or manufacturers here before the emergency period.  I wonder could the Minister say what percentage was in their stores?  What percentage of raw rock was in the <Col N="1452" /> hands of manufacturers before September?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>About half of our normal requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any arrivals of raw rock at the present time, or when does the Minister anticipate arrivals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to answer that question.  The rock will be brought in as shipping becomes available.  An opportunity may arise to-morrow or may not arise for a month.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned the fact that some surplus of manufactured &ldquo;super&rdquo; was available from other countries, and that was bought up.  I suggest that any possible surplus that may be available in any place, and nearly at the price, should be bought, because on most of the land of this country we cannot produce a decent crop without artificial manures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they are out of it altogether now.  On the question of potash, I do not know that there will be much difficulty in getting supplies apart from shipping.  We could get a considerable supply of kainit from Spain.  I believe Spain has opened up all the kainit quarries.  In fact, a considerable amount of our requirements last year came from Spain.  I want to stress the necessity of availing of anything in the way of phosphates that is offered from any source. I do not know what examination has been made of the possibility of exploiting the Clare deposit, or whether it is possible at all to work it.  It may not be a commercial proposition in a normal period, but, of course, there again it is difficult to estimate the duration <Col N="1453" /> of the war.  I would imagine that even at present prices it may be a commercial proposition.  That is a matter, I am sure, that is not escaping the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed the House that we were getting in some soft wheats.  I presume that those soft wheats are going to districts where there is a demand for household flour, because, of course, it is from the soft wheats that household flour is manufactured. In certain districts, such as the City of Dublin, I suppose the consumption of flour would be bakers' flour to the extent of about 75 per cent., whereas in the country districts it might not be much more than 60 per cent.  Accordingly, I think it would be well that the supply of soft wheats that may be available should be held for those districts.  I understand that the supply of soft wheat is limited. The main sources of supply of wheat were South America, Australia, and certain countries on the Pacific coast, and of course the supplies now available are nothing like what we used to get.  For that reason, the amount of soft wheat available is very limited.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the supply of harvesting machinery, I do not know whether the Minister can give us any information as to the supplies available at the present time in the matter of spare parts and replacements for our harvesting machines.  The Minister may remember the difficulty that was experienced with regard to tractor ploughs and tractor machines last winter, and there may be, possibly, a great demand for tractor binders, and for spare parts and replacements. In my opinion, now is the time to examine that matter, with a view to seeing if the necessary supplies are available, and particularly if spare parts for some of the American machines will also be procurable.  Possibly, there might not be much difficulty about it, but I think it should be borne in mind that most of the binders in this country are of American manufacture, made by the International Harvesting Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of coal, the Minister <Col N="1454" /> is aware that the supply of coal from Castlecomer has been cut off, practically, as a result of the strike in that area.  Now, we have a number of anthracite cookers in this country which depend on a supply of anthracite coal.  At the moment, there is no supply of Welsh anthracite coal available, and therefore I should like to know whether there is any possibility of getting the trouble in Castlecomer settled, since the matter is very important to all of us from the point of view of the supply of fuel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the Department of Supplies as one of the most important Departments in the Government service at the present time.  My idea of the functions of that Department is, first of all, to ensure that supplies of essential commodities are kept up, and, secondly, to ensure that reasonable prices are charged for those commodities.  Now, with regard to the first function of the Department, as I visualise it, I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied that we have sufficient stocks of wheat and flour in the country to last us over a certain period, and if he is satisfied that those supplies of such very essential foodstuffs will be kept up during the coming year.  The danger that faces this country at the moment is that supplies of all commodities from outside may be cut off at a moment's notice, and a good deal of the regularity of our internal economy and of our internal life will depend on the supplies we already have in the country.  Now, I do not want any information from the Minister that he might not think wise to disclose in the present circumstances, but I should like to be sure that the position is favourable so far as the supply of essential foodstuffs is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did mention the danger with regard to coal, and suggested that there may be a shortage of coal, and Deputy Hughes mentioned the matter of the Kilkenny coal supply.  In that connection, I only wish to say that, when this matter was raised in the House on another occasion, it was pointed out that, although there seemed to be no reason for it, the price of anthracite <Col N="1455" /> coal there had been advanced and that that advance in price had taken place before the time when there was a reduction in the wages of the workers.  I think that the total mentioned was 6/- a ton.  My information is that the workers concerned there offered to refer the matter to arbitration and, therefore, I think the Minister should co-operate with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or with whatever other Ministers might be concerned, with a view to seeing that this strike should be brought to a speedy termination.  I am not in close touch with the situation there, but from the information I have received I believe that the situation is one that could be ended very easily if the right spirit were displayed on both sides.  The workers, as I say, have offered to submit the points in dispute to arbitration. Personally, I do not think there should be any great difficulty in getting the owners to submit their case to arbitration also.  At any rate, I think it is very necessary that that strike should be terminated as quickly as possible, especially in view of the Minister's statement that there is a danger of a shortage in our coal supplies.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of price control.  That is a very important function of the Department of Supplies. In that connection, I should like to know if the Prices Commission is still in active existence and, if so, I should like to know who replaced the member of the commission who has recently resigned.  The Prices Commission, certainly, has very important functions to perform in connection with the Department of Supplies, and price control is one of the things that the ordinary people of this country have as a safeguard against profiteering during the present crisis.  The Minister stated that the number of complaints with regard to increased prices, or profiteering prices, as I take it he meant, was decreasing.  I am going to suggest to the Minister, however, that the reason for the decrease in the number of complaints is that the machinery which deals with such complaints is so cumbersome, and so <Col N="1456" /> dilatory in its effects, that people are beginning to lose all faith in the Prices Commission or in price control.  I came up against cases of this, early on in the beginning of the war.  Last November, we had a complaint in connection with the Fever Hospital in Cork of an increase of 10/- a ton being added to the price of coal, and, to the ordinary layman, there did not seem to be any justification for that.</P>
    <P>The matter was referred to the Prices Commission which, after some weeks, sent a very evasive answer to the effect that they were not in a position to examine all the factors governing the situation.  However, we persisted in our effort and sent the matter back again to the Prices Commission. Some time early in February we got a reply from them to the effect that the increase of 10/- per ton which was being charged by this contractor was justified because of the fact that he had got his supplies from some obscure port on the east coast of England, and that the freight and carriage charges were responsible for the increase.  But the astonishing thing about the prices that were being charged for coal in Cork was this: that the inspectors of the Commission who were in Cork discovered, as a result of their investigations, that the price of coal there was 2/- per ton more than it should be. We were not told how long this extra sum of 2/- had been charged, or whether anybody who had been charged that excess amount could get a refund.  We simply got the bald statement that, as a result of the inspectors' inquiries, the price of coal in Cork would have to be reduced by 2/- a ton.</P>
    <P>Another case came before the Mental Hospital Committee in Cork.  Shortly after the outbreak of the war there was a rise in the price of all commodities that were being supplied to the mental hospital by the contractors.  The matter was taken up by the committee, which sent on a request to the Prices Commission to investigate and see whether the increases asked for were justified, the committee being quite satisfied to pay if they were.  I had a very strong objection to paying those demands right off, for the reason that <Col N="1457" /> if a public body does that, the increase, whatever it is, will be immediately put on to the purchases made by the ordinary people in the area.  In this instance, the Prices Commission again told us that the matter was one for the committee to investigate themselves. The committee had not the machinery or the official knowledge that would be available to the Prices Commission to enable them to do that. It was only when they returned the complaint to the Prices Commission that the matter was investigated.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that, in view of what occurred in these cases, it is no wonder the number of complaints is decreasing at the present time.</P>
    <P>If there is a decrease in the number of complaints that the Minister speaks of, it is due to the fact that the ordinary person will not go to all the trouble that the Cork Mental Hospital Committee did to get their case investigated. That committee had to persist in its demand in order to get their complaint investigated.  If so little attention is paid to the complaint of a public body, one can realise how little attention will be paid to the complaint of an ordinary citizen.  I also want to say that the prices charged for vegetables in the City of Dublin recently have been a scandal, as much as 6d. and 7d. a head being charged for cabbage.  My information is that cabbage is being exported to London, and sold there at 4d. a head, while the people in Dublin have to pay 6d. and 7d.  I wonder was that matter investigated by the Prices Commission, and, if so, with what result.  Surely, in an agricultural country like this it is an cutrageous state of affairs if cabbage has to be sold at such exorbitant prices.</P>
    <P>In connection with price control, I suggested here on a previous occasion that it would be an advisable thing to set up local advisory committees, or local food control committees.  Complaints could be addressed to them, and if those committees were to investigate the complaints in the first instance, it would mean that the Prices <Col N="1458" /> Commission would be relieved of a good deal of routine work.  If I remember rightly, the Cork Corporation passed a resolution requesting the Minister to set up such a committee in Cork to deal with matters of that kind, because as those who lived through the last war know there is a tendency during a war situation to overcharge for commodities.  I seriously suggest to the Minister and his Department that it would be an advisable thing to get those committees going in the different towns and villages.  Parish committees, for example, could be set up, and these could be used as the machinery through which complaints, which could not be dealt with locally, could be sent on to the Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether he is satisfied that supplies of material for the building trade will be available during the emergency period&mdash;I mean supplies for normal building&mdash;or is the position this &mdash;that the supplies which are available, or will be available in the near future, will only apply to restricted building. I am anxious to get that information, because down in my area there is a good deal of building contemplated.</P>
    <P>There is the fear that if the building work is undertaken it may not be finished owing to the scarcity of supplies.  When I speak of building material, I take it that the only commodity that there can really be a scarcity of is timber.  Will the Minister say if the fullest use will be made of native timber, or can it be substituted for the supplies of foreign timber which formerly went into building? These are some of the matters on which I would like to have an assurance from the Minister.  In conclusion, I would stress the necessity for the appointment of local committees in the different areas to deal with the question of price control, because that has a very important effect on people whose wages are static.  These include a good many workers, as well as those who are living on unemployment assistance, home assistance, old age pensions, or widows' and orphans' pensions. All those classes are very hard hit by an increase in the price of commodities. <Col N="1459" /> As regards some of the increases in price that have taken place so far, probably some of them are, and can be, justified, but at the same time the greatest care should be taken by the Department to ensure that not only are supplies available but that they are sold at a reasonable price. That can only be done through the operations of the Prices Commission, with, I suggest, the help of local committees, the members of which will naturally take an active interest in this question of price control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, referred to the functions of Grain Importers, Ltd., one of which includes the issuing of maize to maize millers.  It appears that nobody can get maize for milling except he has been engaged in the milling of maize for 12 months preceding the war.  I think that, as a matter of fact, there was a particular date set down in the Order&mdash;31st July.  I should like to know from the Minister if he is quite satisfied that the Order has been scrupulously adhered to.  I have had a case brought to my notice in which a grave hardship was inflicted on a man simply because he was technically caught out by the terms of the Order.  The result, so far as he is concerned, is that he has been deprived of the right to mill maize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had been milling maize in his own small mill, and he got a further licence from the Department to transfer it to different premises which he had elsewhere which would be more convenient to him, which he hoped would make the production of the maize meal more economical and save cartage.  He had some delay in putting up the machinery in the new premises, and owing to this delay he had not been milling on the 31st July.  But as a matter of fact, under the licence of the Department of Industry and Commerce, he was milling in September, 1939.  Yet that man has been put out of action and employment for two of his men has been lost.  That man now has to purchase 50 tons of maize meal that he wanted for his customers from a firm of grain importers, instead of taking the maize from that firm and <Col N="1460" /> crushing it in the ordinary way in his own mill.  I submit to the Minister that that was too strict a reading of the Order, especially in view of the fact that this man and his family for over 50 years past had been distributing maize in that district.  No point could be made that it was more economical to put that man out of business.  That in itself was bad enough, but I have been reliably informed that a licence was issued by the Department of Supplies to somebody else who never milled maize before.  I would like to see the scales held fairly, and I would ask an assurance from the Minister that he will reconsider this case and undo the hardship that he has inflicted on the man I have mentioned.  There is one outstanding incident as to the value of the Prices Commission, and that glaring case was discussed in Kilkenny, where the Prices Commission insisted on increasing the price of milk from 1/4 a gallon to 1/6 a gallon, though the producers were quite satisfied to sell at 1/4 a gallon.  I wonder if the commission have been hauled over the coals because of that particular transaction which has caused an amount of indignation all over the country?</P>

      <P>I do not need to add one word to Deputy Hurley's argument about the Prices Commission, but it appears to me this is an outstanding case of the inutility of that commission. I would like to hear from the Minister that he intends to reconsider the case I have mentioned, where very severe hardship has been inflicted on an individual in the one case, and in the other where a man who had never had a licence has been given one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a matter that is perhaps problematical. The Minister has told us that the surplus wool of this country is to be sold to the British Control Board.  He is probably aware that the best market for the wool from black-faced sheep is to be found in America.  Considering the way in which other British Control Boards are treating us with regard to <Col N="1461" /> food and other agricultural products, and that they do not treat us very generously, I do not think we should unnecessarily throw ourselves into their lap.  When those control boards were set up in England people in this country thought that they were going to get a reasonably fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>I think we will admit now that we are getting a very hard crack of the whip.  Definitely, the Minister should not tie his hands in this matter of the wool unless he is treated fairly, in other words, unless the British Control Board pays the current market prices for that article.  The Minister should do nothing to penalise the people who in the main have to live by their sales of agricultural produce.  In the case of the owners of mountainy farms, a very large part of their income comes from the wool clip of their sheep, which is an important asset helping them to make a few pounds.  The British Control Board should not be in a position to take advantage of that.  With regard to wheat, did I understand the Minister to say that he had approximately about five months' supply on hands?  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call the Minister's attention, if he has not seen it already, to an article in <i>Irish Industry</i> for April.  That article is headed &ldquo;No Profits&rdquo;.  It refers to a company known as Grain Importers Limited, and to the statements of the Minister here that that was a company that was importing and selling grain without any profits.  At all events that was the impression the Minister's speech gave throughout the country.  The opinion of <i>Irish Industry</i> is that not only is that company getting profits but that they are getting double profits, that in fact they are getting 50 per cent. over and above what they had when these regulations were made.  The companies that were previously importing were <Col N="1462" /> getting 15 per cent. extra.  I will read for the House a couple of extracts from the article:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From the statement by Grain Importers Limited published in our last issue, we knew beyond any doubt that a profit is being made on the importation of maize into this country.  We know also, what we did not know before, that a double profit is being made in the importation of maize since the incorporation of Grain Importers (Éire) Limited.  No wonder that company, with a capital of £100, can be a non-profit-making company.  The official statement makes that double profit clear beyond any possibility of doubt.  In pre-emergency days a firm embarked its capital in the maize business and it made a certain profit, otherwise it would not be in that business.  Now mark what happens at present according to that official statement. The firm puts up its capital to Grain Importers (Éire) Limited and, on that capital so put up, it gets the current bank overdraft rate.  Let us say, for example, it is 5 per cent.; then the firm gets for a start, 5 per cent. on its capital so advanced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I now pass on to another portion of the paper, it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now let us assume what is a reasonable assumption that the capital so advanced by any one firm is turned over three times a year.  It gets 5 per cent. on each turnover, so that the firm gets finally 15 per cent. for the year on the capital advanced to Grain Importers (Éire) Limited and, in addition, it gets the same remuneration as it obtained in pre-emergency days.  Hence, those firms engaged in importing whole cargoes of maize in pre-emergency days have their original profits guaranteed to them and, in addition, they get about 15 per cent. on their capital advanced to buy maize.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is on the assumption that they turn over their capital three times, they get 15 per cent.  I do not want to say that is true, but it is for the Minister to clarify the position.  I am putting it before him to give him an opportunity of doing so.  There seems to be a great deal of confusion in the <Col N="1463" /> minds of the people on this matter. They are told here that the company has been formed and that it is doing certain services for the benefit of the public generally.  Not only is it getting a profit but it is getting 15 per cent. over and above the normal profit.  That is a matter that the Minister can deal with I am sure, and I only wish to give him an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>As to the supply of phosphates, I think that any time the Minister can get the raw material for phosphates he should not miss the opportunity.  Supplies of manures will always be necessary and if we can get them I am sure they will keep.  If nothing is done until they are wanted, the chances are 100 to 1 against our getting supplies in time, and then there will be a shortage as there was this year.  I hope that no opportunity will be missed of getting these phosphatic fertilisers any time they can be got.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the shortage of coal.  I think that the Minister should not lose any time in giving all the publication possible to the likely shortage of coal, because now is the time to provide plenty of turf to meet that shortage.  People who are in the habit of burning coal should be notified that they will not be able to get coal in future, so that they may have time to make provision against that.  If the matter is allowed to lie quietly for a month or two, it will be too late to provide for alternative fuel. Therefore, I think the Minister would be well-advised to give plenty of publication to this matter at once.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in the same connection which I would like to bring to the Minister's notice.  The Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works spoke yesterday of the difficulty of getting suitable works for employment schemes.  I think that there is here an opportunity, if the Department were not so hidebound and tied down by formalities, to set about simple schemes that could be worked without any extra expenditure on machinery.  For instance, I know districts, and I am sure every Deputy knows districts where there are large <Col N="1464" /> tracts of bogs and, at the same time, there are hundreds of unemployed people drawing unemployment assistance in those districts.  Coal is being imported into those districts and used year after year.  Could not the Minister, in co-operation with other Departments, provide some simple scheme to give a certain amount of money by way of subsidy to wages paid to people employed through the labour exchanges for the purpose of cutting turf in those districts?  It would then be up to those people, who have plenty of bog or who could secure bog for the purpose, to employ as many people and cut as much turf as they wish.  They would know that they were offered so much, and they could decide for themselves whether 5/- per ton or 10/- per ton would make it worth while for them to take all the chances and work the scheme.  If the Minister offered a certain sum, in certain districts it might be availed of, and in others it might not.  It could be confined to people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of unemployed people who would be glad to get work on the bogs.  In these mountainy districts there are people, such as very small farmers and their sons, who are not half employed at all seasons of the year on their own bits of land.  If some such scheme as this were adopted, there would be a greatly increased supply of turf.  At present some people, with the labour of their own families, supply turf for sale.  It is necessary now, owing to the shortage of coal, to increase the supply of turf for sale to those people who have been in the habit of buying coal.  I think the Minister should try to work out some scheme like that in co-operation with other Departments, such as the Land Commission, which has something to do with the provision of bogs.  I ask the Minister, in this time of difficulty, when there is so much unemployment, to co-operate with other Departments in devising some sort of workable scheme.  It would go some way to relieve unemployment and, at the same time, provide the necessary supply of fuel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate, <Col N="1465" /> but I really expected the Minister to say something about the supply and prices of meat.  In a reply to a Parliamentary Question which I put down a few weeks ago, the Minister stated that the supply of meat is as good as ever and the prices are reasonable.  The prices are reasonable in so far as the butchers cannot increase them.  If they increase them any more the people will not pay the prices.  If the Minister inquires into this matter I think he will find that the smaller butchers in the most congested areas of the city cannot get any more for the meat than they are getting while they are paying higher prices for cattle in the Dublin market every Thursday.  Every Thursday the prices appear to be going up. In the report of the Dublin cattle market in this evening's paper I notice that prices ruled higher and that supplies were down again.  The number of beasts on sale was 1,096, a decrease of 40, as compared with last week.  In the corresponding week in 1939 there were 1,543 beasts on sale; that is a 50 per cent. decrease.  There is a gradual decrease in the numbers every week.  The number of sheep and lambs was 6,559, against 8,378 in the corresponding week in 1939.  If the situation is not already bad, it certainly does not augur well for the future.  I think the Minister should reassure the public by letting them know what the position is and whether we can expect to continue to get a reasonable supply of meat.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Byrne need have the slightest fear that our supplies of beef will run out.  I have nothing to do with the fluctuation in the numbers of animals offered at the Dublin market on Thursday mornings. These cattle are mainly for export. I think we have an excess production of beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Cattle are very scarce now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Our production of beef is far in excess of our own requirements, and there is very little likelihood of any shortage.  It is true that prices have gone up, and that the increased prices will diminish the sales of <Col N="1466" /> certain retailers.  I do not see any remedy for that.  The increase in prices is due largely to increased prices for cattle for export, and it is not possible that any action we could take, other than a direct subsidy, which I think is impracticable, would effect a reduction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell is, I think, slightly confused concerning the functions of my Department in regard to prices. Deputy Hurley is also somewhat confused on that question.  The Prices Commission, which functions under the Control of Prices Act, still exists, but the whole organisation of the commission, including the personnel of the commission, now constitutes the Prices Branch of the Department of Supplies. It operates under the Emergency Powers Act.  That Act is wider in scope than the Control of Prices Act, in so far as it deals with all kinds of prices, whereas the Control of Prices Act deals only with manufacturers' prices.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell complained that the Prices Commission is confining itself to manufacturers' prices alone, and did not deal with distributors' prices.  If he is referring to the commission as such he is right, because the commission is confined by the Act which constituted it to manufacturers' prices, but so far as the Prices Branch of the Department of Supplies is concerned, it deals with prices of all kinds, including prices charged by retail distributors.  I can assure the Deputy that if there is any danger of the situation that he visualised arising, that is to say, prices being fixed for manufacturers which do not take into full account the circumstances of retail distributors, then I will give it my personal attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give Deputy McMenamin examples of a thousand allegations that that has happened. However, the Deputy may be assured that there is no animosity to retail distributors, much less a desire to effect a reduction or avoid a rise in prices at their instance.  The objective of the Prices Commission is to deal fairly with all interests and if, in some <Col N="1467" /> cases, the margin allowed retail distributors has been cut, as it has been cut, then the Prices Commission considered such action was, in all the circumstances, perfectly justifiable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Benson referred to our supplies of paper, and I can assure him in a general way that there is no need for concern.  So far as the class of papers that we import from Great Britain is concerned, we are an export market for the purpose of the British regulations, and consequently the restrictions they are imposing on the internal consumption of paper for special purposes do not operate to restrict exports to this country.  Our supply of newsprint at present is reasonably satisfactory.  In the ordinary way some 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. of it comes from Canada and the balance from the Baltic.  It is not correct to say that we have not taken action to economise in the use of newsprint.  We have done so by voluntary arrangement with the newspapers, and by that a reduction in the total tonnage used has been already effected.  A further reduction will be coming into operation in the near future, and another reduction at the end of June.  We have preferred to operate by getting voluntary reductions in the tonnage used rather than by making regulations concerning the size of papers, or in any other way. Of course, if we do not get by voluntary act the desired reduction of tonnage, we will have to proceed by Order.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies will appreciate that the voluntary arrangement, based on tonnage, gives the newspaper proprietors certain liberty of action.  They can economise by cutting the size, by reducing circulation, or by having a larger paper one day than another day.  So long as that system operates to get the actual reduction in the quantity of paper used that we desire to achieve, there is no reason why we should interfere.  If it does not operate to get the reduction desired, then we will have to proceed by order, fixing, as in other countries, the maximum size, or in some other way placing obligations upon newspaper proprietors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position concerning cardboards <Col N="1468" /> was affected by the invasion of Holland, where most of our supplies come from. Fortunately we have about one year's normal supply in stock, so that the problem in relation to it will not arise immediately.  So far as wrapping paper and craft papers are concerned, and the constituents required for their manufacture, they are manufactured here from wood pulp, waste paper, and rags.  The proportion of wood pulp used can be altered in relation to waste paper and rags.  With the cutting off of pulp supplies from the Baltic, steps are being taken to see that existing stocks, which are not small, will be spread over as long a period as possible.</P>
    <P>We have had considerable difficulty in maintaining supplies of animal and other fats.  Our existing arrangements are working satisfactorily, and users of facts find they are now amply supplied with raw material in sufficient quantities to enable them to get full production.  I do not say that difficulties will not arise again, but, at the moment, they have been overcome and no anxiety exists.  The same is true concerning starch.  Although there was some difficulty at the beginning, the position, as we understand it, is now normal, and we do not anticipate that difficulties are likely to arise in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Benson referred to the importance of saving waste materials. We must not allow ourselves to be influenced unduly by what has happened in another country that is at war, where the problems are different from ours.  As far as waste paper is concerned, we are getting all we want. Manufacturers of wrapping paper who use waste paper as raw material are getting all they require to keep up production.  The same is true as far as scrap iron and other waste materials, which are used as the raw material of industry, are concerned. If a problem should arise involving scarcity of some particular materials, we may have to take other action.  The general problem of securing the collection of waste materials for use in industry as raw material is being examined.  There is also the problem of securing economy in the use of <Col N="1469" /> materials which may become scarce and that is having consideration. Deputy Hughes inquired when the price of wool will be fixed.  I stated that that matter is being negotiated. I could not answer the Deputy's question, because the answer will depend on when we consider a satisfactory price has been offered.  We clearly appreciate the desirability of bringing these negotiations to a speedy conclusion, and every effort to do so will be made.</P>
    <P>So far as the supplies of artificial manures are concerned, Deputy Hughes will appreciate that, when he said that apart from shipping there should be no difficulty, he is, of course, leaving out what is the only difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I know that shipping is the only difficulty.  The rock is there still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as animal feeding stuffs and most classes of fertilisers are concerned, not merely is the supply position easy, but it is easier than ever it was because, formerly, Holland and Belgium were importers of these materials on a far greater scale than we are.  They cannot import now, and supplies which they would ordinarily get are available for purchase.  The only difficulty in getting them is that of procuring shipping, and the only reason why costs have gone up is because the cost of shipping has increased.  As Deputies are aware, we have been depending on neutral shipping for the transport of our supplies.  We chartered neutral ships but, unfortunately, the number of neutrals is shrinking very rapidly and our difficulties in connection with shipping are not likely to diminish. On the contrary, they are likely to increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards harvesting machinery and the procuring of tractor-plough parts, I cannot say that no difficulties will arise.  On the contrary, in relation to articles of machinery or articles manufactured from steel, difficulties are reasonably to be expected.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department will do everything possible to overcome these difficulties, but it is almost inevitable that there will be difficulties. <Col N="1470" /> Deputy Hurley paid me the compliment of repeating almost verbatim the speech he made here on March 7, when the Supplementary Estimate was under discussion.  I should like to pay him the compliment of repeating verbatim the answer I gave on that occasion. For reasons of economy, I ask him to read the statement made by me then. I do not think it is true to say that the people are not availing of our price investigation machinery because it is cumbersome.  It is anything but cumbersome. In my opinion, no simpler machinery could be devised.  If it is possible to simplify the machinery, I shall be only too glad to do so or receiving suggestions from any Deputy. Under the existing machinery, any member of the public can make any complaint he or she may wish to make concerning the price charged for any commodity on any occasion.  There is no longer any question of producing evidence of purchase or receipted bills. The mere furnishing of the complaint will get the machinery working and, provided the persons in charge do not think that the complaint is merely frivolous, it will be followed up by an inspector who is fully authorised to carry out an investigation and fully empowered to get all the information necessary for that investigation.</P>
    <P>I cannot assure Deputy Hurley that supplies of building materials necessary to support a normal building programme will be available.  Up to the present, no substantial difficulty concerning building materials, other than steel, have been experienced.  So far as timber is concerned, there are ample stocks in the country.  So far as other building materials are concerned, we are either producing them here in sufficient quantity or we have had no difficulty yet in getting supplies from abroad or we have existing stocks ample to carry on for the present.</P>

      <P>It is clearly impossible to give an assurance of the kind that <Col N="1471" /> Deputy Hurley is seeking, that no difficulties will arise.  Difficulties will inevitably arise.  It is because difficulties in securing supplies are regarded as inevitable that this Department exists.  If there were no inevitable difficulties, there would be no need for this organisation.  As regards the complaint of Deputy Keyes respecting the allocation of maize to millers, it is quite clear that, no matter what basis we work on, somebody will have a grievance.  We decided to confine the milling of maize to those actually milling maize during the 12 months prior to the outbreak of war.  If there were no limitations on our supply of maize, we should not have to impose that limitation.  It is because supplies are scarce that we cannot allow allocations to those who want to go into the business now or even to give to those in the business their full normal requirements. Whether we work on the basis of the 12 months immediately prior to the war or any other basis, somebody is going to be left out and somebody will have a grievance.  We tried to make the working of the scheme as equitable as possible.  Everybody who can possibly support a claim for allocation of maize is interested in doing so.  Here is a commodity which is scarce, for which there is a demand and the price of which is rising rapidly. It is, of course, good business for anybody to get an allocation of maize to mill if they can do so.  We have been deluged with applications from people who had not been milling maize during the qualifying period but who still think they have some claim for allocation of a supply of maize.  We rejected these applications, with the exception of one or two. In these one or two cases, we decided that the equity was in favour of giving the allocation.  These were, I think, mainly cases of people who were questioning the amount of maize allotted to them rather than the case of people who were trying to establish a right to get maize at all.  In every case we have strictly confined the allocation of maize because we had not a surplus to distribute.  If we gave an additional allocation to one miller, that would have to be taken from the allocation of <Col N="1472" /> somebody else.  If we gave an allocation to a person who was not milling at all in the qualifying period, that amount would have to be taken off those who were milling in the qualifying period.</P>

The price which we have been obtaining for wool in America is falling rapidly.  Apart from that aspect of the matter, there are administrative reasons why it is considered in the interests of the wool producers that we should make a bulk sale of our wool, if possible.  But we may not be able to do so by reason of the fact that the British will not buy that particular sort of wool.  However, that is subject to negotiation at the moment.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that they rest very near to the heart of the Minister for Agriculture.  If I heard as much about other things during the last couple of months as I heard about these people from the Minister, I would know a lot.  As it is, I do know a good deal about them. I know all about their interests, because the Minister for Agriculture has been talking continuously about them.  I would advise Deputy McGovern not to pay too much attention to what he reads in the particular publication he was quoting from.  It is true there are grain merchants in this country who are engaged in the business of importing grain and reselling it to millers in normal circumstances.  These people are still handling the grain which is imported by Grain Importers, Limited. They are the distributing channels through which the grain goes to the millers, who were their customers in the past, and are still their customers. So far as it is humanly possible for skilled accountants to devise it, there is no possibility of Grain Importers, Limited, making a profit on the transaction. If they do, it will be there for the Government to take.</P>

      <P>If they make a profit, it is there for us to decide what to do with it.  Perhaps they do make an occasional profit.  Deputies will understand that the allocation price for maize or wheat may be yielding a return slightly in excess of the purchase price, but if it does, it will be used later to effect a reduction.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Department of Supplies and the Controller of Flour have full particulars about every aspect of that matter, in so far as it is possible to get information in relation to a very complicated trade.  Apparently, the Deputy has not been reading the newspapers in regard to turf production. The Government have been engaged in a publicity campaign to get people to increase turf supplies.  I cannot deal with the suggestion that turf-cutting should be subsidised.  It would be entirely unwise to subsidise turf production. Those who are engaged in cutting turf can expect a reasonable return for their labour at the present time, and they might be expected to increase production in such circumstances without the inducement of a subsidy.  I think I have dealt with most of the points raised, but if Deputies require information on particular matters, I shall be only too glad, if they get in touch with my Department, to give them that information, if it is possible to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is a codification of a lot of the laws already in existence.  I do not think there will be any controversy arising on the Bill, but if any controversy would arise, it would be on the point where it fixes the number of members for county councils.  It proposes to reduce the numbers in certain cases.  It is not a drastic reduction.  That is the only controversial thing I can see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister in any case made arrangements with country councils as to the probable number? I think in the case of Cork the number suggested was 42.  Has that been done generally, or is it proposed to do it arbitrarily in this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters can be considered on the Committee Stage. Roughly, the proposals embodied in the Bill are: that where the members do not exceed 30 they should be reduced to 20; in other words, that there will be, roughly, two-thirds of the present membership.  With regard to urban councils and so on, the membership shall not be lower than nine in any case.  I should like to mention that the amendments sent back from the Seanad will be taken next Wednesday.</P>
