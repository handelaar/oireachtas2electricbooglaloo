      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he can now give the result of the examination which was stated some months ago to be taking place into the proposed extension of the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts so as to accord the benefits of the Acts to schools in Crumlin; and whether he will also state the cause of delay in giving sanction to the Dublin Corporation's (Schools Meals) Committee to accede to the request of school managers in Terenure and Ringsend, for the application of the Act in their districts.</P>

      <P>The corporation has been notified that the position as regards Crumlin schools could be dealt with by an extension of the city boundary.  As regards the extension of school meals to schools in Terenure and Ringsend the proposal was only brought to the notice of my Department on the 16th ultimo.  It was then stated that there was no provision therefore in the corporation's estimates. As the expenditure is subject to recoupment from State funds the matter required special examination. The corporation have been notified that they may provide meals, if they so wish, in these schools.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand from the Parliamentary Secretary that 4,000 children, who are only a couple of hundred yards outside the border of the City of Dublin and who were removed out there from the City of Dublin, are to be deprived of the benefits of the School Meals Act just because the school itself and not the residences of the children is a couple of hundred yards beyond the border&mdash; that they must await the extension of the city boundary in order to get the benefit of the Act?  Am I to understand that from the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation, in their clearance of houses in the city, were encouraged and helped by the Government to build houses in Kimmage.  We transferred these children from the city to the extended area of Crumlin, which is in the City of Dublin.  Not being able to get a more suitable site, the school was built 200 yards beyond the border.  Because the school is beyond the border, though the children's houses are situate in the city, we are to get no encouragement to give the children the benefit of the School Meals Act which is in operation in many schools in the City of Dublin?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether there are any remaining outstanding matters of disagreement likely to affect the satisfactory working of the port of Dublin; and, if so, if he will state what these matters are, and what steps, if any, are being taken to secure such agreement <Col N="2140" /> thereon as will prevent any further stoppage of the port arising therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the recent dispute at the port of Dublin there were two questions of principle involved: (a) an increase in the rates of wages; and (b) adjustments in the working conditions.</P>
      <P>The Unions concerned had applied for an increase in the rates of wages of 3/- per day.  Direct negotiations between the parties led to a provisional agreement on the basis of an increase of 1/- per day but this was made subject to a certain uniformity being brought about in working conditions in the cross-Channel trade.  It was on this latter issue that the negotiations broke down and a complete stoppage in the cross-Channel trade at the port was threatened.  The conference over which I presided dealt, therefore, not with the rates of wages which had been provisionally agreed but with the adjustment of working conditions.</P>
      <P>The agreement finally reached was that the parties should resume negotiations under the chairmanship of an officer of the Department and both sides undertook to continue these negotiations until arrangements satisfactory to both sides were made. Owing to the complicated nature of working conditions in the cross-Channel trade, considerable time will necessarily have to be spent in working out a scheme which will bring about more uniformity.  The parties have undertaken to have these negotiations completed before the 1st May.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, after my personal contact with both sides, that there is a sincere desire to settle the issues relating to working conditions which have, in various forms, been under discussion for several years and have from time to time led to partial and temporary stoppages of work.  Both parties realise the disastrous effects of a stoppage of work at the port and I think we may rely on their good sense to reach an agreement which should bring more settled conditions at the port and prove satisfactory to both sides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that Monaghan flax growers cannot get supplies of Liral Dominion flaxseed which suits their land; that Belgian seed, which is not satisfactory, is all that is available; and whether he will take steps to make available suitable seed in time for sowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that because of the much increased demand for flaxseed this season, seed of certain pedigree strains, including Liral Dominion, will not be available in sufficient quantity to be equal to the demand.  In the circumstances, arrangements have been made whereby such pedigree seed as will be available will be supplemented by a considerable quantity of seed of other well-known varieties similar to those grown in many parts of the flax-growing districts in recent years.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to secure further supplies of pedigree seed, but there is no justification whatever for the suggestion that the seed which will be available will be unsuitable for sowing in County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>Seed supplies will be available for distribution, through the usual trade channels, in good time for sowing this season.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  I am, however, aware that in a letter which the Deputy recently addressed to the Press the censor deleted a passage which it would be grotesque to describe as a reference to &ldquo;possible economies in the Army&rdquo;.  The matter was deleted by the Censorship Department as being a contravention of the directions issued by the Press censor pursuant to the provisions of the Emergency Powers No. 5 Order, 1939, and, indeed, the action taken in the present instance was calculated to save the Deputy, and the newspapers which might publish his statement, from the consequences of a prosecution for seditious libel.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that the delay in this case is due to the imposition by the board and referee of an obligation on the brigade committees to produce maps and records that would take at least three years to complete?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on the referee to see that pensions are not given to people who are not entitled to them, and it is through the help he receives from the brigade councils that he can make his decisions. I think there is no question about the fact that the board and the referee must rely on local knowledge, to a very large extent, in their decisions.  There may be delay, and I do believe there has been delay, in respect to brigade records being forwarded to the referee, but I do not think there is undue delay owing to other causes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  If the brigade committee has not got the information, nobody has it.  It is purely a question of the former colleagues of the applicant giving information which will be helpful to the referee and his committee when they are dealing with doubtful cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as my knowledge goes, I am only aware that the referee and the board ask for historical records.  The referee does not ask for surveys of the country or anything like that.  The referee and the committee ask merely for historical records which will enable them to decide whether or not pensions will be given in these doubtful cases&mdash;whether the applicants are entitled to pensions after records have been forwarded by these brigade committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on this Bill yesterday, I referred to the circular that the Local Government and Public Health Department addressed to all county councils.  That circular, if I may read it, is dated 1st February, 1940, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to state that in view of the necessity for promoting increased tillage every county council should consider the adoption of a scheme for the supply on loan terms of seed potatoes, oat seeds, barley seeds and fertilisers in the coming season to occupiers or cultivators of land who cannot procure supplies out of their own resources.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the adoption of a scheme by the council steps should be taken to give adequate publicity to the facilities available.  A form of public notice together with form authorising and undertaking to pay were enclosed with circular letter No. 31/39 of 15th March, 1939.  It should be noted that it will be open to councils to arrange for the supply of fertilisers as well as seeds.  Where arrangements are made for the supply of fertilisers the model forms can be suitably adapted.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the county council prefer to proceed by way of guarantee to approved seed merchants of the whole or a specified proportion of the price it would be open to them to give such guarantees.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Bill to validate any action taken by the county council in accordance with these instructions will be introduced by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> I presume this is the Bill.  The Minister, when moving the Second Reading of this Bill yesterday, gave us the total amount of money either guaranteed or lent, and the value of the seeds sold to farmers last year, at about £6,000 or £7,000.  By this morning's post I had letters from farmers in different parts of the country and they all agree on one thing, that a similar scheme to this, as worked in their counties, is useless.  In County Dublin last year we would not work the scheme.  I have a letter from a County Wexford farmer, which I received this morning.  He says that the scheme is useless for Wexford. The scheme that this Bill will set up and that the Minister visualises is the only help he is going to give to agriculture. If this is all he can prescribe for agriculture, then this year will be as bad as last year.  Let us remember that last year there was no war-time emergency such as we have now.  I suppose the Minister is aware that in different parts of the country last year land was ploughed but not sown.  My correspondent in Wexford says that the same thing will happen this year.</P>
    <P>If the scheme is to be of the same proportions, extent, and scope as the one the Department of Local Government visualised for last year, then I can say that we in the County Dublin will have nothing to do with it.  It seems to be begotten in the mind of the Ministry that this is some substitute for outdoor relief for down and out farmers.  That is not the sort of aid that agriculture wants at this time, or that we in the county council visualise as an aid for agriculture in the County Dublin.  We visualise a supply of money to meet a situation that world conditions have created for us in this year.  It is quite possible, and highly probable, that by the end of this year all human and animal life in this country will have to be sustained out of food produced here. What are we doing to produce that food?  That is the problem that I put to the Ministry.  Before we come to discuss the Estimate for Agriculture, I would like to know from the Minister if that is the situation that he visualises, and if it is for the purpose of <Col N="2150" /> meeting that situation that he has introduced this measure.  If this Bill is intended as a kind of out-door relief measure to help down and out farmers, then one can say that the Government have done nothing, except arbitrarily to make an order under the Emergency Powers Act, given to them by this House, directing all owners of land in the country to till a proportion of that land, without at all taking into account the impoverishment of the agricultural industry, the want on the part of farmers of liquid capital, the want of the wherewithal to till as much as they tilled last year, much less giving them facilities to till twice as much as last year.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that if the Government do not waken up to the position, and if the submarine warfare succeeds against shipping, as it looks to have a fair chance of succeeding, then this country is going to be up against a terrible situation.  It will be threatened with a famine for food to sustain human and animal life and all because the Government have not surveyed the situation properly and provided adequate means of meeting it.  So far as I know, no steps have been taken to provide capital for agriculture unless we are to understand that this Bill has been introduced for that purpose. I hope that when the Minister comes to reply he will give the House some indication as regards the scope of this measure and what he intends it for. Because of the lack of information I think there is not much use in debating it any longer.  I confess that I do not know what its real objective is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>If it helps to shorten the debate I will tell the Deputy now. So far, the debate has been of a very rambling kind.  This Bill has the same purpose as the measure that was introduced and passed in 1932.  The object of it is to help small farmers who are not able to purchase seeds or fertilisers. In cases where they can show the county council that they are unable to obtain credit, the county council will give a guarantee to the local merchants to supply those small farmers with seeds and fertilisers.  The money will not be collected from them <Col N="2151" /> until the end of the year.  It is not the purpose of the Bill, and it is not the province of the Department of Local Government, to provide credit in the wide way that the Deputy has in mind. There is nothing more in this Bill than was in the Act of 1932.</P>

Is not that evidence that it was a failure? Why go to all this trouble to aid down and out agriculture with a kind of out-door relief when you have that fact before you, that last year, taking the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, only £6,000 worth of stuff was distributed under the 1932 Act?  In view of that, is it not a waste of time, and simply an attempt to fool the people, to introduce a measure of this kind ostensibly for the purpose of aiding agriculture?  The public certainly will read this with interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that this measure, if it were to be interpreted as a contribution to the solution of the credit problem of the agricultural industry in this country, would be ludicrously inadequate.  It would do less than <Col N="2152" /> touch upon the fringe of the problem. If, however, it is concerned with nothing more than the very limited objective of getting seeds and manures into the hands of small farmers particularly, and large farmers as well, at once, and if the Government go on to say, that they propose to follow this up with comprehensive proposals to deal with the whole credit problem of agriculture, then I think more can be said for this Bill than at first appears.  The effect of the Bill will be to mobilise the credit of all the shopkeepers in Ireland for the distribution of seeds and manures, and if it is expeditiously worked I think it may do some good, provided three other matters are at once attended to.  The first is to take the import duty off superphosphates; the second is that the Government undertake to pay the bounty on imported superphosphates, and the third is that they secure supplies, because there is not the least use going to the farmers of the country and making credit available for the purchase of manures and seeds if, in fact, there are no seeds and manures to purchase.</P>

Supposing this Bill were passed at a time when abundant supplies of manures were available, suppose I could order in my shop 100 tons of Belgian super to-morrow, I think it would not be such a bad Bill at all; but, in the County Roscommon to-morrow, suppose my customers come in with dockets from the county council offering to buy super-phosphate of lime from me, I must say to them that I <Col N="2154" /> have not got super-phosphate of lime to give them.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate that, but my difficulty is that if I commend this Bill I apprehend that I am partaking in a fraud.  I cannot see that the provision of credit on these lines or on any other lines is going to achieve our purpose unless we are satisfied that it can be advantageously used.  I beg the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to appreciate that fact and to realise that, over and above his duties as Minister of his own Department, he has a certain duty to co-ordinate his efforts with those of his colleagues in the Government, and that he cannot simply wash his hands of all responsibility by saying, &ldquo;That is my own contribution to the problem, and if my colleagues negative that, it is their responsibility.&rdquo; He is a responsible member of the Government and it is his duty to see that the measures he takes to assist the people will not be rendered nugatory by the activities of other members of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right to say that, unless there are results from representations made elsewhere, this Bill is perfectly useless.  It is worse than useless, as it is going to have in this restricted sphere a very inflationary tendency.  It must be remembered that shopkeepers, like all other men, are human; and if there is a brisk demand for a commodity a competitive price will prevail.  If, however, you artificially create three times the demand without in any way augmenting the supply, prices will tend to rise.  That is particularly true of seeds; you may do something to control the prices of manure, but very little can be done to control the prices of seeds.  Therefore, unless the Deputy's colleague is going to take appropriate measures, this Bill, instead of being a help, may become a great menace.  The end of it will be that the man who has ready cash will be unable to get a supply and the man <Col N="2156" /> who is borrowing from the county council&mdash;trusting to God that something will turn up&mdash;will collar all the supply.  That will leave the man who wants to pay his way and who is in a position to pay his way unable to do so as a result of inflationary prices created by this Bill.  I appreciate the contention that the Government cannot be made responsible for supplies, but I trust that within the limit of your permission we have brought home to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the urgent necessity for co-ordination and for securing co-operation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is primarily responsible, but it is the local councils I am thinking of.  Something like this has been in operation for some time and has not been largely availed of, and will not be availed of on the present occasion, for one reason. That is, as Deputy Dillon has said, that most of the people know that what it is intended to provide cannot be provided. There is another reason: it is difficult to get a loan from the county council; there are a number of difficulties. I know of a farmer who went to the county council last week and asked about making an application for money for fertilisers, whereupon one of the county councillors told him to leave it alone, saying that it was so tied up with regulations and with looking for securities that it would not be any good to him when he would get it. That is the experience of a lot of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not provide easy credit for the purchase of fertilisers. Deputy Dillon says that if the stuff is there the merchants are prepared to facilitate the county councils and the farmers, but the farmers will have extreme difficulty in getting facilities under this Bill.  That is proved by the little advantage that was taken of it previously.  Last year in the whole of Ireland there was only £6,000 worth of credit availed of.  It will not be availed of here.  The Minister for Agriculture has made a hash of this particular matter in the last four or five years, and now when there is a pressing need amongst the agriculturists of this country he passes the the responsibility to the Minister for Local Government, and expects us to level whatever criticism we have here and now at this Bill and save him on a subsequent occasion from the direct accusations which ought to be levelled at him.  Now is not the time when <Col N="2158" /> provision ought to be made to give the farmers an opportunity of getting manure.  Three or four years ago would have been the time to do that. Even if manures and fertilisers were now available in proper quantities, as they are not, it would in some cases be too late.  In the last two or three years, because of the difficulty in getting manures at a reasonable price, some of the land has been allowed to deteriorate, and was not in a condition to give a proper crop last year, not to mention this year or next year.  There were various additions to the cost of manure.  Last year it was 25 per cent. over the year before, and we had 76,000 acres less crops than we had the year before.  I hold that one of the principal reasons for that was the lack of fertilisers.  There may have been other reasons, but that was one.  This year, I do not know what the result will be, because there will be less and dearer fertilisers than last year.</P>
    <P>There was a question asked yesterday by one of the Minister's own colleagues about the abolition of the 20 per cent. duty on imported artificial manures.  If that 20 per cent. had been taken off a year or two ago, as was demanded by several Deputies in this House, there would not be the same position in regard to fertilisers that there is to-day.  Fertilisers could have been got, and could have been in the stores of the merchants of this country, so that they would be available to the farmers.  I have here statistics published not by the Minister for Agriculture, strange to say, but by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>For the 76,000 acres less under tillage, there were substituted various other things&mdash;I do not want to go into it&mdash;but the net effect was that we had 38,000 acres less under crops, pasture, or anything else you like, last year, mainly because of the lack of artificial manures.  Perhaps this is not a matter for the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I do not know who is at fault&mdash;but when I looked into this list of acreage under crops, and the substitution of hay, second, third and fourth years, and permanent pastures, I find that we come down to the position that whereas in 1938 there were 11,606,000 under cultivation or in some other way used by the farmers, there were in the subsequent year 38,000 less acres under any form of use.  What I want to know&mdash;the Minister for Local Government cannot answer me; it is a conundrum&mdash;is what became of the 38,000 acres.  Is that loss due to coast erosion or to flooding or has the Land Commission taken over the land, or is it used for the propagation of various vegetable matters like docks, thistles, and other things, or have we adopted the American and Canadian system of summer fallow in order to restore the fertility of the worn-out soil?  In any case, 38,000 acres of land appear to have gone off the map, according to the statistics I hold in my hand.  Where that land has gone to I do not know, but it has disappeared according to the statistics here, and I should like to know what has become of that 38,000 acres.</P>

The stores could have been stocked with them, and there could have been sufficient there to carry on tillage last year efficiently, as well as having enough for this year, but it was not done.  Now this method of pretending to give the farmers access to some sort of credit to provide fertilisers is adopted.  That is simply passing the baby on to the Minister for Local Government, and from him to the local bodies.  It failed in previous years when it was possible to get artificial manures at some sort of price, big or small.  There is no chance whatever of its success in this year when the difficulty in obtaining any sort of fertiliser is enormous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You told Deputy Dillon, Sir, that we could not discuss fertilisers&mdash;that the Minister is not responsible. I agree, because I contend that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture.  It was the Minister for Agriculture who should have provided credit facilities, and who should have brought in this Bill, instead of dealing with it through the Department of Local Government.  To my mind, the Bill is a paltry and miserable attempt to solve a problem that is of vital urgency in regard to our agricultural economy at the present time. The country is seething with dissatisfaction and discontent.  That is due in no small measure to the total lack of financial resources whereby the present <Col N="2161" /> prices due to the war situation could be fully availed of.  One would expect that, with the prospect of better prices for agricultural produce a brighter outlook would prevail amongst our agricultural community, but such is not the case.  There is nothing but gloom and dissatisfaction, because many of our people, as a result of the policy of the Government during the last few years, find themselves without capital. Many of them are without stock, and many of them have no credit facilities whatever, at a time when credit if available could be used to very good purpose.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to provide credit facilities through local authorities for seeds and fertilisers.  To my mind it is not nearly enough and only barely touches the fringe of our problem.  It appears to me that it is simply pushing the responsibility of the Government on to the shoulders of the local authority.  I personally, and we here, do not believe that the local authority is a proper medium for supplying credit to farmers. Many of the local authorities already find themselves in financial difficulties and at most it is only going to provide a paltry few thousand pounds to the farmers at a time when credit is urgently needed.  Furthermore, I think that it will be impossible to get this Bill evenly or fairly, on balance, administered throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  What I mean is that you may find some local authorities will administer this scheme in a generous way while others will administer it in a very stingy way.  Their excuse will be that it is their responsibility to safeguard the ratepayers and that they are going to take no risks in that respect. I think this is a time when risks should be taken in providing credit facilities for our people in order to put them into production.  I am satisfied that this is not the method and that it is not going to prove satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, at most, the amount of money provided through this medium is going to be very, very limited.  We want to provide not only food for our people, but we want to provide animal food as well.  We are <Col N="2162" /> of opinion that the Government should make an immediate arrangement with the bankers to provide credit for the purpose of increasing tillage this year. We believe that this credit scheme should go much further than the provision of fertilisers and seeds.  When we can provide credit and loans for housing and industrial undertakings, for alcohol factories and for peat industries, surely to goodness the Government ought to be in a position to provide credit for the vital industry, the fundamental industry, of the country.  This is an opportune time for infusing credit into that industry, and if this opportunity is not availed of to restore the prosperity to agriculture that existed nine or ten years ago what is this country going to face in the aftermath of the war?  Every energy should be strained by the Government at the present time to rehabilitate our agricultural community and to put it into effective production.</P>
    <P>There are many farms in the country that are non-effective as food-producing units.  That is because they are burdened with debts already, which are known as frozen loans.  I think that in dealing with this problem of credit the first thing that ought to be tackled by the Government is the problem of frozen loans.  It is strange to say that in negotiations between the banking institutions of this country and people that availed of these loans to purchase farms during the Great War it has been found that the man who has tried to meet his obligations in that respect cannot negotiate a reasonable settlement with the banks and those who have absolutely refused to pay their interests and to try to reduce capital for three or four years find it less difficult to effect a settlement with the banks.  For that reason, this whole matter of the frozen loans should be tackled by the Government.  If necessary, I think legislation should be introduced to deal with it, to get rid of those that exist at the present time and to put these farmers into production who have had millstones round their necks for a number of years and who have been unable to work their farms effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> When we speak about loans for farmers we do not mean to provide loans for farmers to purchase land because, after all, that is not a loan, but a capital investment.  We do not advocate the provision of any capital for the purchase of land.  We simply ask the Government to provide capital to put our people into effective production, to enable them to buy stock to stock the land and to carry the existing stock that is on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>To make this scheme effective, at least in a small way, the Minister must put in some provision, to guard against that, that a local authority will have a prior claim on those people over the banks or anyone else.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out by Deputy Dillon, and I absolutely agree, that this Bill may have a very injurious effect if there is not a sufficient supply of fertilisers available and although you, Sir, pointed out that that is not the responsibility of the Minister, yet we can hardly refrain from touching on that matter.  At least, he can advise the Minister for Agriculture that if we are going to avoid inflation in the price of artificial manures a sufficient supply must be made available.  If that is not the case then the scheme is going to do more harm than good.  The demand will be increased.  The demand will become very, very keen and the goods will not be there, with the result that the tendency will be to force up the price.  That will have a very serious effect.  The solution is that we can undoubtedly buy quantities of superphosphates from England, Belgium and Holland at the present time and the tariff of 20 per cent. should be taken off immediately.  There is, I believe, a sufficient quantity of kainit and 30 per cent. potash salts available.  Supplies are available from France and Spain. Spain has opened up her kainit quarries, and there will be ample supplies of potash and nitrogenous manures.  Our real problem is in regard to superphosphates.  It would appear that only 75 per cent. of last year's supply is available and with the increased area of land which is being turned to tillage, there will not be nearly sufficient to meet our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> Our agriculturists realise that the very worst system of agriculture that we could adopt in this country would be to go to the cost and expense of putting land under the plough and of putting in seeds and then growing a poor crop.  You cannot grow a good or a profitable crop in this country without the liberal use of artificial manures.  That is of paramount importance. Over and above the consideration of the position of any manure manufacturer in this country, it should be the first consideration of the Government to provide artificial manures for the increased tillage operations this year because, if that is not done, it will mean that our efforts in a very great measure will be barren and ineffective.  We shall be turning up a lot of old soil in this country that has not been aerated for many years. We shall be turning up to a depth of six or seven inches, soil that is practically barren, coming from that depth, because it has not been exposed to the air for many years.  For the first year it will be nearly barren, until it has been properly aerated by the atmosphere. We must provide the constituents which that soil lacks by the liberal use of artificial manures.  I should like to impress upon the Minister and the Government the necessity of removing the tariff from superphosphates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude displayed by the Government in the introduction of this Bill reminds me of Uncle Podgers, a character in one of Jerome K. Jerome's books.  The outstanding characteristic of Uncle Podgers was his zeal in assuming heavy burdens and placing them on the shoulders of some other person afterwards.  In this Bill, the Government has taken up the burden of initiating this scheme and is placing on the unfortunate county councils, who are at present unable to meet their own liabilities, the responsibility of financing it.  It is impossible to imagine or to conceive how the Government think that county councils at the present time, with their heavy obligations for the financing of public services, their limited resources and their very limited revenue rating powers, can finance a measure of this kind adequately.  Any impartial person must admit that to finance increased agricultural production at the present time would cost about £2,000,000.  How can the county councils be expected to collect that amount or to take the risk of advancing that amount, the risk of suffering, perhaps, considerable losses and placing those losses upon the shoulders of the unfortunate ratepayers?  This is an absolutely irresponsible measure on the part of the Government, and it shows they have no sense of responsibility whatever or no real desire to increase or encourage agricultural production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite aware that the previous scheme was so objectionable and so difficult to operate that it was only availed of to a very limited extent.  The Deputy is aware <Col N="2167" /> that county councils, having regard to their limited resources, were extremely careful in advancing money to help agriculture.  The result was that the previous schemes were practically speaking, fiascoes.  That is why very little losses were incurred by the county councils.  The county councils cannot afford to take any risks having regard to their limited powers of raising revenue, but the State, having regard to the importance of the agricultural industry and to the enormous increase which can be brought about in agricultural production if a courageous and bold course is adopted in providing adequate credit for farmers, can afford to take a certain amount of risk which the county councils dare not take.  It is the duty of the State to take some risk in financing agricultural production, having regard to the extent to which the Government has, in various ways, restricted agricultural production during the past few years.  In order to compensate the agricultural industry for some of the losses which it has suffered, in order to enable the agricultural industry to take advantage of the prospective increased demand for foodstuffs, it should be the duty of the Government to do something more adequate than is outlined in this Bill. At the very least, if they are empowering the county councils to incur liabilities, they should guarantee portion of these liabilities.  They should guarantee the county councils for at least 50 per cent. of whatever losses may be incurred.  If they did that they would show some sense of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might remind the Government and the Minister of the credit facilities which were provided in this country by a private company in connection with the growing of sugar beet.  When the beet growing industry was introduced into this country by a Belgian company, not only were the growers provided with credit and with supplies of manures and fertilisers but advances were also made to the farmers to the extent of £5 per acre.  It must be remembered that seeds and fertilisers are not the only cost which farmers will have to incur in increasing their tillage.  The heaviest cost which will <Col N="2168" /> be incurred will be the cost of labour. Everybody knows that in order to cultivate an acre of land it is necessary to incur increased labour costs, to the extent of £7 or £8 an acre.  Surely the State should be able to afford credit facilities to the same extent as the sugar company with regard to beet, and advance £5 per acre to cover the cost of labour, prior to the harvest. Unless the Bill is amended the county councils will bear whatever loss is incurred by giving additional credit facilities.  If the Bill is amended in that respect it will not be as objectionable as it is at present.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Opposition one would imagine that the Bill would not be workable at all.  Deputy Cogan said that there would be difficulties in the way of anyone who wanted to avail of the facilities provided by the Bill.  He should remember that any county council that adopts this scheme may make regulations to make the Bill workable, and these county councils represent the farmers. If a county council makes stringent regulations against its own people, the members being sensible men, have good reason for doing so.  Deputy Bennett said that some farmers considered the Bill not worth availing of. County councils when drawing up regulations can make them as simple or as strict as they like.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel county councils to make regulations of any kind.  Some people object to the county councils making any regulations.  This is a simple Bill to validate something that was in operation last year, and that worked very successfully.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel any county council to put such a scheme into operation, but if there is need for it, it can have it.  A great deal of play was made by Deputy Hughes and by Deputy Dillon as to the need for the provision by the Government of other facilities for farmers.  I do not propose to follow the Deputies in that respect.  If a county council is not prepared to take risks, and if the State has to take all the risks, who is to pay? Will not the farmers have to pay their proportion in any case?  In my opinion county councils are in a better <Col N="2169" /> position to provide the machinery for giving the small credit needed under the Bill than the State, because they are much nearer the people and have the machinery available in particular areas.  As a result it would cost the councils little or nothing to operate this Bill, while it would be very costly if the State had to do it.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Bill meets the needs of people who may want credit. County councils can either provide the money or guarantee those who require it.  In the constituency I represent the council guaranteed the seed merchants and had not to provide any money. That scheme worked satisfactorily.  The number of people who applied was very small.  I believe that the numbers requiring credit generally under the Bill will not be very big.  I direct the Minister's attention to what I consider to be an omission in the Bill.  The Long Title mentions barley seeds and oat seeds, but does not mention seed wheat.  I think the definition should be amended on the Committee Stage. Perhaps the Minister would introduce a suitable amendment.  I wonder if money advanced or guaranteed under the Bill would rank as a limitation of the borrowing powers of councils.  It might be necessary to mention the total sum that a council could lend under the Bill, but I think the amount should not rank as a limitation of its borrowing powers.  I believe this is a useful Bill.  It was in operation last year and worked well in the counties where it was tried, and for that reason I support it and recommend it to the House.</P>

If there was some small scheme for providing credit, such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation provides, it might be of great help to the poorer sections of farmers.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for Agriculture is not in the House while this Bill is under consideration.  There is a scarcity of seed for spring wheat. The conditions laid down as regards <Col N="2170" /> borrowing are, as Deputy Allen said, a matter for county councils.  That is where the Minister shirks complete responsibility.  I suppose if the debts are not paid the county councils will have to meet them.  Apparently all the Minister has to do is to put this Bill through the House, and to give the county councils power regarding the loans that may be given for seeds and fertilisers.  At the county councils this proposal has been lauded as a great measure introduced by the Government.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill however, there must be two solvent securities, and the county council must recommend the man who gets the loan.  If I want £50 and if I have two solvent securities, I can go into any bank and get the money and I will not want a recommendation from the county council or the board of health.  I think that is a ridiculous provision to have in the Bill.  The Minister should have some control in the matter.  That is my opinion in view of the capital that has been made about this Bill.  If the conditions as to the granting of credit had to be made so tight, then it is as well not to pass this Bill at all, because any small farmer who had reasonable credit could go to any bank manager under such conditions and get £10.  I understand the Minister has been warning people over the radio not to use fertilisers on grass.  Fertilisers can be got from those who had seed wheat for sale. Everybody knows how the people growing beet get fertilisers and if we are not going to use fertilisers for grass, I think it would be better to leave it alone.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for Agriculture is not here to say: &ldquo;Take the tariffs off fertilisers and let every merchant get all he can&rdquo;.  I approve of the scheme, but I do not approve of the way it is to be controlled by the county councils, nor do I approve of the county councils lauding it as a great Fianna Fáil boon and then saying that there must be two solvent securities and that an applicant must be recommended by the county council.</P>

      <P>I am sure there will be great disappointment when the <Col N="2171" /> country realises the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister's excuse for the Bill is that it is practically the same Bill as that introduced in 1932 and Deputy Allen's excuse is that it is the same as the Bill that operated last year.  We had not got a war in 1932 or last year, and there was not the demand for tillage that there is this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it so.  I insist that there is a demand for more tillage and that we are going to have much more tillage.  The Government have asked that a certain percentage be tilled this year.  Is that not a demand, or has Deputy Allen not heard of it?  There is a very definite Government demand for it which, according to the Government, is going to be insisted upon.  Deputy Allen apparently has not heard of it, but nevertheless it is true.  Now, that demand exists and, with that demand before us, all we get is a repetition of the Bill that we had in 1932 and 1939.  In my view, all this is simply tinkering with a big matter.  If there was not an abnormal demand, it might meet the exigencies of the moment, but with an abnormal demand, it is practically useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go outside the scope of the Bill, but, to my mind, the Bill is an enlargement in some respects of the Bill referred to by the Minister <Col N="2172" /> and I do not think that in that matter, it is either helpful or useful.  It is really taking from the Government the responsibility which ought to be theirs and putting it on the county councils. I am sure the Minister will admit that there was a very large dissipation of the people's substance during the economic war, so far as farming is concerned and that has brought about a situation in which there are many people not credit-worthy in the country at the moment.  How are we going to make that up?  We are going to make it up by giving power to the county councils, as set out in the Long Title of the Bill, to provide and sell barley seeds, oat seeds and seed potatoes and so on, and by providing for the giving of guarantees in respect of sales.  I am sure that the Minister and everybody in the House will agree that it is not good business to turn a county council into a trading body.  In the first place, it has not got the experience nor the officers; it has not got the accommodation for storage, or any expert people to do the buying for it; and if you were &mdash;I have no fear that any county council is going to do so&mdash;to set up a county council in opposition to traders, you would not be doing anything useful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan and other Deputies have referred to the security which county councils will ask of people who require assistance.  The county councils have all my sympathy in these matters, and I agree with Deputy Allen that it is their own business. They may or may not prescribe restrictive regulations, but they are the custodians of the ratepayers' money, and I am sure that Deputy Allen or Deputy Ryan would not agree that they should consider their responsibilities in that regard lightly. I know that if there was free seed being given to-morrow, the number of people who would apply for it would be far greater than the number I would trust to repay, if it had to be paid for, and county councils have responsibility in these matters.  The principal change that I find in the Bill is in Section 3 which sets out that if any person who has got seeds paid for by a county council, or has got a guarantee which <Col N="2173" /> has to be honoured by a county council, fails to pay, the county council can incorporate the debt as a rate in the rating demand and apparently can have it collected by the rate collectors. That is important.  It is, I presume, a safeguard for the county council and it makes it easier of collection in that way.  I hope that all the borrowers will be acquainted with that regulation and with the particular section in the Act when they come to seek assistance.</P>
    <P>There are two ways, apparently, according to the Bill, in which money can be recovered.  It can be recovered in the way I have set out, or in the ordinary way, as in the case of the sale of goods, by taking people into court and recovering the money; but what appears to me to be a crux is contained in Section 5.  Deputy Allen asks that the moneys borrowed for this purpose ought not to limit the borrowing powers of a county council.  Section 5 takes care that it will not, at least to any extent, but that it will have to be redeemed within two years.  The moneys borrowed by a county council in 1939 must be repaid to the lender by 1941 and the moneys borrowed in 1940 must be repaid by 1942.  That strikes me as peculiar, because suppose there is money which has been lent, or goods paid for, and the accounts are out since 1st February, 1939, that money must be repaid to the treasurer from whom the money was borrowed by 31st March, 1941.  County councils have the right this year to put that upon the rates, to rate it up against the particular individual, if he is a ratepayer, or, if he is not a ratepayer, to collect it from him as if he were a rated occupier.  But then that may not be collected for another 12 months.  It has a whole year to run, and, in that time, the county council must make provision, according to Section 5, for repayment to the treasurer.</P>
    <P>They cannot make that provision by way of a general rate on the ordinary ratepayers, because they do not know yet whether the man is going to pay or not.  It appears to me, therefore, that if a county council is going to incorporate a debt of that kind in the ordinary rating against an individual, <Col N="2174" /> a longer period will have to be allowed than two years for repayment to the treasurer.  I do not think it can be done inside the period.  It appears to me that there is a crux there.</P>
    <P>The underlying principle of the Bill is, as the Minister said, that it is simply a Bill to deal with small farmers who cannot find money or credit to buy seeds and fertilisers.  But in practice it means very little.  We operated this scheme last year in Roscommon and there were between 40 and 50 applicants.  The amount ran into some £400, I think, a certain amount of which is outstanding yet, not a very large amount I admit&mdash;some £40 or £60.  I do hold that if these applicants who came to us for credit last year provided the same security to the seed merchants they would get the seed and manures.  After all, I do not know any seed or manure merchant who is not prepared to supply seeds and manures if he thinks he is going to be paid. These merchants have been carrying on a business of that kind for years. As a matter of fact some of them have probably burned their fingers over it. Nevertheless they have carried on in that way and are prepared to carry on. This Bill, therefore, is little more than a kind of pretence, because if the security which a county council will ask for, and must ask for as the custodians of the public purse, were forthcoming to the seed merchant, the seed merchant would supply the seed.</P>
    <P>This year, with the demand for extra tillage and the necessity for manures and extra seeds, the people expected that a big effort would be made to provide credits for the purchase of seeds and manures.  There is no such big effort being made.  This is nothing but a repetition of the Bill of 1932, and there is really very little in it.  I suppose the present is not the time to discuss what the Government ought to have done.  I do not think, however, that this Bill is much good.  I hope the councils will use it for what it is worth. I do not think it is going to be of very much importance whether they do or not, because I think the facilities that will be offered to people who want credit can be got outside equally well. <Col N="2175" /> Such as it is, we are prepared to work it in Roscommon, as we worked it last year.  It did oblige some 40 or 50 people to some small extent, but, on the whole, I do not think the Bill is worth much.  It is just a small attempt, as the Minister said, to meet the small farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this Bill, but if the Minister wants the Bill to be a success it is important that the matter should be speeded up and the seeds and manures made available as quickly as possible.  I also wish to let him know what some county councils have been doing with regard to this. The county council with which I am acquainted has laid down a rule that no farmer whose valuation is over £15 will be allowed to purchase seeds or manures under the scheme.  The farmer whose valuation is under £15 will only be allowed to purchase seeds and manures provided that the merchant who supplies him will act as a surety for him, while he must also provide another surety as well as the merchant. I think that farmers over £15 valuation should be included in the scheme. Another thing is that the farmers who are allowed to purchase are limited in the amount with which they can be supplied to 50 per cent. of their valuation. A farmer with a valuation of £15, therefore, can only get seeds and manures to the amount of £7 10s. 0d., which is a very small sum at present. A farmer whose valuation is under £15 will have more than 12½ per cent. of his arable land under tillage every year.  The farmer whose valuation is £20 or £25 will require credit in order to purchase seeds and manures.  I appeal to the Minister to have the matter speeded up and I also think that farmers should be made aware in some way that they can get this credit. The seeds and manures would really be required before the 17th March.  The potatoes will be in the ground before the 1st April and from the beginning of April the oats will be put in.  It is, therefore, time that they should get these seeds and manures so as to have them ready when they will be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know how this measure will affect the people in the congested districts.  The regular scheme in operation for the supply of cheap seeds to smallholders in the congested districts has fallen very far short of the requirements and this measure has been mentioned as a means by which the Department of Local Government might be able to meet the requirements of these people. I should like to urge on the Minister that people from the Gaeltacht or congested districts should be considered in connection with the benefits to be conferred by this measure, particularly in the present year.  We have this question of security which was mentioned here.  I should like to impress on the Minister that making seeds available through the county councils in that way might not be practicable so far as the congested districts are concerned. The best system so far has been the one adopted by the Department of Agriculture in making seeds available for people under £5 valuation; but even under that scheme the quantities supplied are not sufficient.  I should like to make the point that if this measure is to be put into operation immediately money should be made available by the Department of Local Government to meet the requirements of these people.  The cottiers in the Gaeltacht districts have been deprived of their usual allocations of cheap seeds and great hardship has thereby been created in those areas.  If funds could be made available through the Department of Local Government, those people who have been unable to avail of the allocations in the regular way from the Department of Agriculture would be able to get the benefits which may accrue from the present measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the great majority of cases in the past there was a considerable difficulty on the part of the county councils in the cases operated through them in recouping the amounts advanced, and that was simply because there was no real check on the system.  I hope that this will be a vast improvement on the existing system so far as advances and securities are concerned.  I would urge on the Minister, if at all possible, to make this measure applicable to the <Col N="2177" /> congested districts and to the Gaeltacht districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not pretend to be anything more than what it is.  The Department found that there was a number of councils last year who were anxious to continue the scheme. This Bill was primarily introduced or at any rate it was brought before the Government in order to validate what was done last year.  When that Bill was before the Government it was suggested that a number of councils were anxious to carry on the scheme this year and we found that a number of them were prepared to carry it on in the same way as last year's.  After considering what was done last year the Government decided on incorporating what was done under last year's scheme in this Bill.  Deputy Belton spoke well over an hour, I think, on this Bill, and in his attempt at showing his innocence, he pretended that there is something more behind the Bill than there is.  He seems to have in mind the turning of the county councils into financial corporations for dealing with frozen credits and seed debts.  That is only the Deputy's pretence, because the Deputy knows all about the previous Acts.  If he was not chairman of the Dublin County Council when that scheme was first in operation, we all know that he was a very big noise there.  That year the scheme operated only to the extent of £36; in 1933, £60; and in 1939 it was not put into operation at all in the Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of councils, particularly three councils, who have been operating this scheme&mdash; Cavan, Mayo and Leitrim.  In Cavan last year the figure was £2,406, Mayo was £1,800 one year, and £1,200 last year, and so on.  These three councils are mainly the councils that took up the scheme.  It is the small farmers who are mostly applying.  The number of them who took advantage of it in Mayo is 800.  Roscommon did not avail of it so much.  We will give facilities to councils who are anxious to avail of these schemes.  If a council desires to do anything in this way we do not see any objection to giving them authority <Col N="2178" /> to do it.  But we do not pretend that this scheme is going to give everybody seeds and fertilisers on credit.  It is intended for the persons who can show that they have places in which to sow the seeds or who can show that they need fertilisers and are not able to purchase them out of their own resources and are unable to get credit.  These are the people and these only are the people for whom this Bill is intended. If anybody suggests that the Government is going to operate this Bill as being a wonderful solution for the difficulties of agriculture that person is quite wrong.  The Government have no such intention to operate the scheme in that way.  It is simply a Bill to satisfy the councils who have been operating those schemes.  That is all.</P>
    <P>I am not going to enter into this question of the difficulty of supplying manures and fertilisers, their high cost and all that sort of thing.  I know perfectly well that all this will be out again here in a few hours' time on the Agricultural Estimate, the appropriate place in which to discuss it.  I am not going to follow Deputies into these irrelevancies or on those lines.  Deputy Nally and Deputy J. Ryan, also, raised the question of the insufficiency of time in this matter.  A circular was sent out on the 1st February to the secretaries of the county councils intimating to them if their councils wished to put those schemes into operation they could go ahead with them.  I understand that the councils' secretaries issued advertisements informing the people that these facilities were available. I understand what Deputy Nally said about the arrangement in the case of the Mayo Co. Council&mdash;that the trader is asked to sign.  Those are matters that the county councils in their wisdom or otherwise laid down for themselves.  The scheme has worked satisfactorily in Mayo up to the present.  It is entirely a matter for the councils to consider whether those precautions under the scheme might be loosened; whether they might extend it to people with the higher valuations, who are in need of seeds and fertilisers and allow them to avail of the facilities under the scheme.  These really are matters for the county councils themselves. <Col N="2179" /> Our experience has been that putting these schemes into operation has not resulted in any loss.  People have been paying up.  There is a difficulty in some part of Kerry where guarantees were given and these resulted in a little loss in the end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen talked about including wheat.  Wheat was included in the previous Bill.  It was found that the people who are usually applying for seeds and fertilisers were small farmers and, as a rule, these grew little wheat.  There really is no objection to including wheat in the Bill, and on the Committee Stage, I will have an amendment to include wheat.  I do not want to say any more about the Bill.  It is a very simple one.  There is no justification whatever for bringing into the debate on this Bill a discussion on the whole agricultural position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two large items in this Estimate which I shall deal with firstly.  One is the fertiliser scheme and the other is in connection with butter.  The fertiliser scheme first came into operation on the 1st September, 1938.  The expenditure by the Department in respect of the first season, up to 30th June last, was £84,960.  The quantity of fertilisers distributed was 183,000 tons.  The amount to be provided for the current season &mdash;20th October, 1939, to 30th June, 1940 &mdash;is £130,000, and it is anticipated that £50,000 of this sum will be spent by 31st March next.  The scheme is one to enable farmers to purchase manures at reduced prices.  It applies to fertilisers manufactured by members of the Irish Fertiliser Manufacturing Association having their factories in this country and relates to the following fertilisers: superphosphate, potassic superphosphate and compound and complete fertilisers manufactured by members of the association. A reduction at the rate of 10/- per ton will be allowed on all these fertilisers supplied by the association on and after 20th October, 1939, and this reduction is to be passed on in its entirety by retail merchants and co-operative societies to their farmer customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head M (7), under which I am asking the Dáil for £302,000, relates to butter.  The guaranteed value of creamery butter for the season 1939-40 was fixed at a minimum of 134/- net f.o.r., with the promise at the time to the trade that that value would be increased so far as available funds and possible increase of export value would permit.  This value was maintained for <Col N="2182" /> the months of April, May and June. For the months of July and August a production allowance of 8/- per cwt. was paid, bringing the net f.o.r. value for these months to 142/- per cwt.  For September, October and November, the production allowance was increased to 14/- per cwt., bringing the net f.o.r. value for these months to 148/-.  For the months of December to March, inclusive, a production allowance of 15/- per cwt. has been or will be paid, and as the levy of 11/- per cwt. has been suspended for those months, the net f.o.r. return will be 160/- per cwt. Production allowances <i>pro rata</i>, according to equivalent butter fat content, were paid during the months July to November on cheese, dried milk and condensed milk.  The average net f.o.r. value for the whole year will work out at 142/7 per cwt.  The average price paid to all creameries was 5.66d. per gallon, with the skimmed milk returned.</P>

      <P>Not at the world price of butter at the time.  The total butter production for the year will be approximately 720,000 cwts., which is a drop of 30,000 to 40,000 cwts. below normal.  The expenditure on this sub-head will be offset by a reduction of the same amount in the expenditure on sub-head A of the Vote for Export Subsidies.  I should explain that a great part of the money paid out to the creameries was by way of production allowance rather than export bounty and, therefore, could not be paid out of the Export Bounty Fund, so that there is a saving on the Export Bounty Vote more than equivalent to the amount paid under this sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well now, to go back to the Supplementary Estimate and take the headings in order: after those two large amounts, there is an amount of £2,600, for travelling expenses, for which I am asking the Dáil to vote. That is due to the fact that we had to take on a number of inspectors under <Col N="2183" /> the schemes for increased food production or the Compulsory Tillage Scheme.  In order to carry out that order, 36 inspectors had been loaned to the Department by the Land Commission, and it is the practice, when an officer is seconded from one Department to another, that his salary is paid by the Department which loans him, but that his expenses are paid by the Department to which he is loaned. In this case, it is estimated that the travelling and subsistence expenses of these people will amount to something like £2,100, but it is expected that the travelling expenses of the general staff of the Department will exceed the amount provided in the original Estimate by £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are carrying out the duties that are necessary to be carried out in connection with the matter.  The next sub-heads are&mdash;F (1) Agricultural Schools and Farms, and F (3) Veterinary College.  There is an increase asked for in these particular cases, and this excess expenditure is largely due to the purchase of reserve stocks of feeding stuffs, fertilisers, and, in the case of the Veterinary College, chemicals, drugs and appliances.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to interrupt the Minister on a matter of detail.  Surely, he does not maintain that, in the Munster Institute, Cork, we have extra stores to the value stated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have.  As a matter of fact, they have a very big stock of feeding stuffs.  In the first place, they did not sell what they had expected to sell, and, in the second place, they have a larger stock than they would expect to have, normally, at this time of the year.  The next item is sub-head I (1)&mdash; Special Agricultural, etc., Schemes in Congested Districts&mdash;£2,000.  This includes £925 for travelling expenses and £1,075 for loans for the erection of glasshouses for the growing of tomatoes. The loans are £60 for houses <Col N="2184" /> with 400 square feet floor-space, and £80 for houses with 600 square feet floor-space.  They are repayable in ten annual instalments with interest at 5 per cent. per annum.  Since the scheme was started in 1934/35, 68 loans have been granted, of which 50 have been £80 loans.  Sub-head I (3) deals with Land Reclamation, etc., Schemes&mdash; £2,000.  The amount provided in the original Estimate for the salaries and expenses of the staff engaged in the supervision of these schemes proved inadequate.  More were taken on than had been anticipated.  Sub-head I (4), dealing with instruction in connection with Special Land Settlement Scheme amounts to £400.  This is to provide the salary and expenses of an assistant agricultural overseer employed to give instruction to migrants from the Gaeltacht, who are being settled on lands in County Meath and neighbouring counties.  Sub-head M (1) is to provide for the administrative expenses of the Pigs and Bacon Export Committee incurred in connection with the issue of licences for the export of pigs and bacon.  It is estimated that the receipts from licences will counterbalance this expenditure.  The next item is sub-head M (4)&mdash;Loans and Grants for Agricultural Purposes, etc. &mdash;£3,000.  It is expected that the increased food production schemes will give rise to a demand for more agricultural implements.  As a matter of fact, the number of applications is a good deal higher than it was at this time last year.  Sub-head M (5) has to do with the improvement of the creamery industry&mdash;£13,500.  This is to provide for the purchase of the business and the property of the Berrings Co-operative Agricultural and Dairy Society, Ltd., County Cork, and of the business and property of Scariff Co-operative Creamery, Ltd., and it also provides for the conversion of Cahirciveen separating station into a central creamery, and the provision of a new travelling creamery.</P>

The next item is sub-head M (8)&mdash;Importation of Seed Wheat, £12,420.  This represents the cost of unsold stocks of Diamante wheat which had been imported by seed merchants under a guarantee against loss given by the Department. At this time last year we thought that there might be a serious shortage of certain varieties of spring wheat seeds, and we arranged with two importers here to bring in special quantities of Diamante wheat, guaranteeing them against a loss on any quantities that they had left unsold.  A certain quantity was imported by these merchants under the guarantee, accordingly, and the amount unsold at the end of the season was taken over by the Department for the purpose of storage until the beginning of the next sowing season.  There was, however, a certain amount of deterioration in the wheat taken over as seed, and the net loss to the Department would be something over £800.</P>

      <P>I am afraid not.  It is a bit better, but I am afraid that it is not adequate.  Subhead M 9&mdash;Agricultural Production, Consultative Council &mdash;£200&mdash;is concerned with the Agricultural Production Consultative Council that was established by an order made on 31st October, 1939, for the purpose of advising and assisting the Minister in relation to matters affecting agricultural production, and sub-head M 10 deals with the travelling expenses of Trade Representatives&mdash;£150.  This is to provide for the travelling and subsistence expenses of a number of persons who were invited to advise the Minister on matters relating to the marketing of agricultural produce. During our various negotiations with the British Government, or the Departments of the British Government that were concerned, with regard to the marketing of cattle, pigs, and so on, we asked, on a number of occasions, representatives of the trades concerned to accompany the people engaged in these negotiations to London, and the expenses of these people were paid. With regard to sub-head O 1&mdash;Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, 1939&mdash;£3,850 &mdash;this sum is required for the payment of the salaries and expenses of additional temporary junior marketing inspectors whose employment was necessitated by the coming into operation of the recent Act.  That was forecasted when the Bill was going through the Dáil.  In connection with the next item, sub-head O 8&mdash;Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts&mdash;£1,100&mdash;up to 12 men have been employed for varying periods since the end of September, 1939, staining imported seed wheat. That may not be necessary any longer, because, at one period, a year or two ago, it paid merchants to bring in seed wheat and sell it afterwards as native-grown seed since there was a profit to be made on it, but I do not think that will be the case now.</P>

We have given a guarantee to a co-operative society which imported a large quantity of flax seed that, if the flax seed is not used, the society will be recouped in respect of losses on a certain quantity over and above what it was prepared to bring in.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have it in fair quantities.  I might mention that the Department has arranged with the British Ministry of Supply that that Ministry will purchase the flax produced in Éire from the 1940 crop at an average of 20/- a stone.  They will purchase the crop in the coming season, and we have undertaken to sell the complete crop to the British Ministry of Supply.  It will be necessary at a later stage to make an order prohibiting the export of flax except under licence, and licences will be given for the export of flax only to the United Kingdom.  Sub-head AA refers to a defalcation with regard to insurance stamps.  I cannot say more at the moment about this because the matter is still under investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Appropriations-in-Aid, there are additional receipts to the extent of £30,317.  These include repayments to the extent of £2,000 from the Vote for Employment Schemes in respect of the cost of administering land reclamation schemes, etc.  Then there are repayments of loans advanced to co-operative creamery societies, to the amount of £5,000.  Under the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act the receipts from additional fees, etc., collectable under the Act come to £9,000.  When the <Col N="2190" /> last Eggs Act was passed, the inspection became very much more exacting and we had to employ something like 27 new inspectors.  The levy, which was up to that 1d. per case of eggs, was raised to 2d., so that the appropriation is increased.</P>
    <P>The amount in the case of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts is £2,000.  This is related to a contribution of 3d. per barrel by importers to cover the cost of staining seed wheat. The estimated receipts from licences for the export of pigs and bacon total £800.  The Committee set up to deal with the export of pigs and bacon have a levy of 2d. on bacon and 2d. on live pigs.  That is expected to bring in the £800.  It is not intended to make a profit on this business, and it may be possible to lower that levy to 1d.  The sale of seed wheat brings in £11,517. This has relation to the guarantee given to the importers last year.</P>
    <P>There is an estimated deficiency in the receipts.  The first is £2,000 in connection with the repayment of agricultural loans.  This arises out of the type of loan given for implements or for any other purposes, and it appears very probable that there will be a shortage of £2,000.  In connection with the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, there is £1,550 less than was anticipated.  The amounts collected by way of levy in respect of cattle and sheep slaughtered came to £434,128. The total levy payable amounted to £469,988, leaving £35,860 due at the beginning of 1939-40.  I am not sure what portion of that amount must be regarded as bad debts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that in the ordinary way the bounties payable to creameries for the production of butter would come out of the Export Bounty Fund, but, owing to fluctuations in price, it was necessary to give payment on production rather than by way of export bounty.  The payment on production <Col N="2191" /> could not legally come out of the Export Bounty Fund.  It is merely a transfer, and it is paid as a production allowance.  When we come to the Export Bounty Vote you will find there is a saving there of £345,000, which is more than has been paid out in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the most important item dealt with in this Supplementary Estimate is that concerning seeds and manures for the coming season.  To-day our attention was engaged on a Bill brought before the House by the Minister for Local Government to provide credit facilities for the farmers to enable them to purchase seeds and manures.</P>
      <P>It at once became evident that what was present in the minds of Deputies on all sides of the House was that credits were no use unless the seeds and manures were on offer to purchase with the credits made available.  I am in a position to say now that if the farmers of Roscommon go to the county council and get credits to purchase, and bring these credits in to me, I have not got the manures to give them, and I cannot get them.  I think the Minister knows that.</P>
      <P>I have here in my hand a letter from the County Tipperary, from a merchant who finds himself in precisely the same position.  That merchant writes to a manure manufacturer, who replies to him as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to further supplies, as we see that you have already taken delivery of your quota we regret that at present we are unable to give you a further quantity.  You will appreciate that we have to make sure that all our regular buyers take their allotted quantities, and when each has been satisfied in this way we will then be in a position to see how we stand with regard to offering further supplies.  You can, however, rest assured that we will keep in touch with you if further supplies become available.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The merchant in question writes to me to say: &ldquo;We have not got a bag of manure in our store and our customers <Col N="2192" /> are in a bad way for same.&rdquo;  Now, what is wrong with those customers is not that they are short of credits but that there is no manure to be purchased with the money that they are in a position to pay.  I do not deny for a single moment that there are large numbers of farmers in this country who would gladly have availed of the credit facilities provided under the Bill introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but, when they have availed of them, what are they going to do?</P>
    <P>Now, it would be bad enough&mdash;I direct the Minister's attention to this especially&mdash;if we only had to contend with the situation of the farmers who got credits from the county councils and were not able to convert these credits into manure, but if there is a limited supply of manures available and you expand artificially the credits available to purchase manures, then, inevitably, you are going to raise the price of seeds and manures to all consumers in this country because you will have three customers for each bag of superphosphates that there is to offer. The Minister may say that he will control the price of superphosphates.  I do not know whether Deputies understand this or not: that price control must be operated to give the distributor or the manufacturer a certain margin of profit on each item that he sells. The artificial manure trade is a trade which is largely done for the purpose of keeping your customers.  It is so competitive that there is little or no profit made upon it, but in order to oblige your customers, and to hold yourself out as a competitive merchant, you cut the price of artificial manures to an altogether uneconomic level of profit.  You do not do that out of love of your customer. You do it in order to hold yourself out as a competitive merchant.  You know that there is one item that all your customers are going to buy and that is superphosphate, and if you are not as cheap for that commodity as the cheapest person in the countryside, word will go out that yours is a dear shop, and if you are dear for superphosphate, you are dear for everything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> The result of that is, speaking for my part of the country, that the average retail profit on 1 cwt. of superphosphate of lime is 3d.  The manure is delivered to you at about £3 15s.  That, I think, was the price last year.  It is sold at 4/- per cwt.  If the Minister's Department were to fix the price of manures it could not, in equity, impose on every merchant the obligation to sell super at a profit of 3d. per cwt., because it is obviously an uneconomic procedure, but so long as there is a scarcity of super, and three customers for each bag of super, if the Government fix the price, then every merchant is going to work at the Government fixed price, and the Government fixed price will have to show a margin of profit of at least 6d. or 8d. a bag, which means that you are going to increase the price of manure by about 10/- per ton on the whole community. That is what happened when you put a tariff on manures.  You increased the price because you withdrew the element of competition in the case of the seller.  You left three buyers for every bag of manure.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that to-day, above all other times, the urgent necessity is to remove all restrictions on every source of supply of artificial manures.  We could buy manures from Belgium at present&mdash;I admit there would be difficulties about transport, but I believe these could be overcome; but we are prevented from getting those supplies of superphosphates from Belgium by a tariff of 20 per cent., and by the refusal of the Minister to pay the 10/- bounty on any superphosphate of lime that is imported from outside Éire.  We could get supplies of superphosphates of lime from Great Britain, not large supplies, but I am convinced that those manufacturers who had been delivering superphosphate here in the past would, at least, give the importers who were dealing with them in the past a share of their previous purchases.  But we cannot get them because the Minister will not give the 10/- subsidy on those imports.  Deputies will realise, of course, at once that everything we are getting at the present time, at least 90 per cent. of what we are getting, we are getting by the grace of the British <Col N="2194" /> Government.  If the British Ministry of Supplies did not give us the things we want, then we would have to go without, to the extent of 80 or 90 per cent., of the supplies that we are bringing in here.  Deputies should not deceive themselves into the belief that we are bringing in all that we require. If the British Government closed down all our sterling credits and forbade us to use them in the markets of the world, we would be absolutely paralysed for supplies. We could not get any at all.  If Deputies imagine that without the goodwill of the British Ministry of Supplies we could get a share of the artificial manures that we had been getting heretofore, they are under a complete misapprehension.  We are getting at the present time what we are getting because the British Ministry of Supplies and the British Treasury permit us to get it.  If they forbade it we could get nothing.  We are prevented from getting supplies of superphosphate of lime from Belgium by a tariff, and by the refusal of the Minister to give the bounty, and we are prevented from getting supplies of superphosphate from Great Britain because the Minister refuses to give the bounty, although there is no tariff. We are left in the hands of the strictly-controlled Irish manure ring.</P>
    <P>What supplies they have managed to get I do not know, but to judge from a letter I have just read to the House, they themselves believe that there is going to be a very material shortage and I, as a manure merchant, am informed by the ring that all I will get is bag for bag what I got last year.  Now, if that is so, and if we are going to increase the tillage immensely, it means there is going to be an acute shortage of artificial manures in the spring. Surely, with that prospect before us, the Minister will be able to insist that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, will take off all the tariff, and that he on his part will say that he will give the bounty of 10/- per ton on any manure of standard quality, no matter whence it comes.  If he fails to do that now, the blame for the shortage, the blame for the failure to produce, the blame for not filling the gap that this emergency may create in our agricultural <Col N="2195" /> output, is the Minister's responsibility.  He has been warned in time.  I wrote to his Department a month ago, pointing out the vital urgency of announcing his readiness to give the 10/- bounty on English manures, and I got no satisfaction.  He has had full notice of this problem, and if he closes his eyes the responsibility for the shortage is his, and his alone.</P>
    <P>These considerations apply also in the matter of agricultural machinery. There is provision in this Estimate to facilitate loans for agricultural machinery. Every bit of such machinery bought in this country is carrying an immense tariff&mdash;all the increased cost that is levied on it as a result of its being protected by tariff.  I wonder if Deputies in this House&mdash;particularly those Deputies who come from the eastern parts of Ireland&mdash;understand the measure of the hardship that that tariff is on the small farmer of Western Ireland.  Do people here who are in the habit of thinking of tillage in terms of tractors and three-furrow ploughs and disc harrows know what it means to till land with a láidhe and a harrowpin, or with a harrowpin and a donkey-plough?</P>

      <P>I most earnestly put it to the Minister that to ask people in the poorer parts of Ireland intensively to increase tillage and at the same time to block them from getting efficient farm implements is a most imprudent and reckless contradiction I would like to bring home to Deputies, if I could, the difficulties of the man who cannot afford to buy an efficient harrow.  If Deputies in this House would realise the complete change in a person's life which is brought about by the substitution of a modern spring harrow for an old-fashioned small, wooden harrow furnished with harrow-pins by the blacksmith, they would appreciate the measure of the injustice of denying to the poorer farmers of this country access to efficient implements.  I venture to say that one stripe of a good spring harrow is as effective as 12 of a make-shift harrow such as 90 per cent. of the small farmers west of the Shannon have to use.  I do not suppose that Deputy Allen has ever seen land ploughed either with a láidhe or a donkey-plough.</P>

I want to see the farmers here given access to the spring harrows of the world, so that they can get the cheapest and best: if we are making the cheapest and best in this country, people will buy the ones that are made here.  Why should the poorer farmers in the West of Ireland be condemned to sweat and toil like beasts of burden in order that manufacturers of farm <Col N="2197" /> machinery in this country should be afforded an opportunity of charging more for machinery to the farmers in the West of Ireland than those farmers could buy it for in Britain and elsewhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen&mdash;as the Minister, no doubt, has seen&mdash;farmers who used to cut their meadows and oats with the scythe, and sometimes with a sickle, turn over to a mowing machine.  I do not know if Deputies here realise the difference that that makes in the life of a small farmer, but it is quite astonishing&mdash;it means the transition from something approximating to slavery into something approximating to a tolerable and happy life. Yet the farmers of this country are at the present time constrained to pay £4 or £5 tax on a mowing machine. Some of them buy Irish machines; some of them pay the tax; others go on using the scythe, as they cannot afford to do otherwise.</P>
      <P>Is it reasonable to insist on these people doing an increased tillage when they are confronted with the necessity of completing it with the inefficient implements which are thrust upon them by the tariffs and charges imposed on cheap, efficient machinery that would otherwise be available from sources abroad?  I say it is not.  I think the continued taxation of the raw materials and equipment of the agricultural industry is an outrage, and I believe that all these credit schemes are a futility so long as they are promoted side by side with a policy designed to raise the cost of seeds, to raise the cost of manures, of machinery, of everything else the farmer has to use.  In this particular time, all these abuses are exasperating, through the difficulty of supply, and&mdash;so far as Dáil Eireann is concerned&mdash;no reasonable or effective measures have been taken by the Government to correct or overcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters arising out of this Supplementary Estimate to which the Minister made reference in his introductory remarks, the first <Col N="2198" /> being the idea that the Minister is satisfied about the quality of coldstored butter.  I know enough about the dairying industry to realise how highly technical it is and to appreciate that, unless one is versed in it, it is hard to understand the day to day difficulties there are.  Butter should not be sold as Irish creamery butter&mdash; cold-stored or fresh&mdash;which is not good butter.  I have bought from Irish creameries in the last couple of months butter that was not good; it was just plain bad; it smelt.  I was told by the creameries from which I bought it that it was not their butter; that it was cold storage butter which they had received from some central bureau, the exact nature of which I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could that be traced to the maker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it could, but I imagine there is some kind of central depôt that the Government maintains through the dairying industry for the cold storage of butter against the winter shortage, but certainly the cold storage butter coming out of that central depôt reflects no credit on it, and I think the Minister ought to look into the matter.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether he has heard any other complaint of that nature?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister the name of the creamery from which I got the supplies, and perhaps they can be traced.  I must say this, that the creamery in question, when producing its own butter, produces an excellent article, so excellent that I felt it good business to go a long way out of my normal course of supply in order to get their butter, but this cold stored stuff seemed to me to be deplorable, and if it were going abroad as an Irish product it would damage the trade. Deputy Curran says that his experience has been that the butter was not up to the mark.  I think that is a fairer description.  I do not say the butter is unfit for human consumption, but it has a strong smell and a strong taste, and would ordinarily be described as tainted.</P>

I saw a notice published in the paper to-day that Messrs. Henry Denny and Son will not take fat pigs at all. The bacon manufacturers of this country have made a good thing out of making up bacon for the last four or five years, and it ill becomes them to be getting up on their ear now.  They are well gilded with the unjust profits which they knocked out of the farmers and consumers of this country for the last four years, and if they are giving any back answers or making difficulties for the pig-producing trade in this country there is not a body of citizens in Ireland should get a shorter knock than the bacon curers of this country. The sub-head to which I refer is M (1). I can assure the Minister that, if he wants to deal with those gentlemen drastically and effectively, very few voices will be raised to demur from any action he deems it necessary to take.  In the meantime we ought to consider gravely the interests of the pig producers, and, if those heavy pigs are going to be refused by the bacon factories in Ireland, is the Minister going to take any steps to ensure that they will be expeditiously exported alive to the British market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The strange thing is that the export licences have not been used. Not more than half of them have been used in the last couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can imagine that, because it not infrequently happens that the normal trade would not absorb the heavy pigs in Great Britain at this time of the year.  But I would put <Col N="2200" /> this to the Minister: is it not nearly time he took his courage in his hands and went to London, met the British Minister of Agriculture, and worked out with the British Minister of Agriculture a comprehensive scheme which could be based on a plan extending over five or ten years?  The present situation is this, that we are sending to London excellent civil servants, who, when they go to London, meet excellent British civil servants.  They discuss the matters at issue, and then they come to a point of difference.  The British civil servant says to our civil servant: &ldquo;Well, that is the limit of my instructions.  I cannot go beyond that&rdquo;; or perhaps the British civil servant says to our civil servant: &ldquo;Can you meet us in this particular?&rdquo; Whereupon, our civil servant is obliged to say: &ldquo;I have gone to the limit of my instructions.  I can go no further without referring the matter back to my Minister.&rdquo;  By the time references back are made and adjustments are arrived at, not infrequently unsatisfactory settlements are made, because the difficulties of continual references back and the pressure of time have made it necessary to arrive at some kind of an agreement.  If the Minister for Agriculture of Éire meets the Minister of Agriculture of Great Britain, and both approach the negotiation with full power from their respective Cabinets to reach agreements, no such difficulty could possibly arise, and if the negotiation tends to widen out into something larger than was at first anticipated there are full plenipotentiary powers on both sides to carry it through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pig industry is invaluable to this country.  We ought to be able to capture an immense share of the British market.  Why does not our Minister for Agriculture go to London to-morrow and say to the British Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;Look here, we are prepared to set out towards the objective of supplying all the pigs you want if you will undertake to ensure that at the end of this period of emergency you will continue to take the maximum production that we reach in the period of emergency.  We cannot ask our people in Ireland to increase <Col N="2201" /> production indefinitely if at the end of the emergency they are to find themselves without any market for their pigs at all.&rdquo;  We could not go to England and ask the industrialists there to build vast factories to supply some emergency demand we have, just as the United States manufacturers will not build vast factories, without adequate guarantees, to supply the industrial demands of England at the present time.  It is not an unreasonable request; it is not a blackmailing request; it is not a threat.  On the contrary, we can perfectly honestly say: &ldquo;We are going to stimulate the production of pigs in any case, but if you want us to throw the whole weight of our organisation behind it you must give us that security, that at the end of the emergency we will not find ourselves with millions of pigs on our hands and nobody to buy them.&rdquo;  I have not the slightest doubt that, if the Minister entered into a discussion of that kind with the British Minister, we could start now indefinitely expanding our pig production, growing barley here to feed the pigs, and developing a branch of our agricultural industry which would return immense profits to the community as a whole.  Will the Minister consider that, and when he comes to reply, tell us what he proposes to do in connection with it.</P>
    <P>I just want to mention one other point before the Taoiseach intervenes. I mentioned earlier to-day a special Liral flax seed for the farmers of County Monaghan.  Would I be free to say to the farmers of County Monaghan that those who attach special importance to getting that Liral flax seed would be facilitated by the Minister through the local agricultural instructor? I think the Minister implied earlier to-day that he wanted to keep this seed for the purpose of propagating other seed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but certainly, with other crops, the Minister used to provide that you sowed some intervening thing like artichokes or something of that kind which shaded and protected the crop from cross fertilisation.  That might not be sufficiently efficient in the case of flax.  I do not know.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate does not arise out of any new services or extension of old services.  It arises rather as a result of an attempt to cut the Estimates too fine.  There have been from time to time complaints that in estimating the expenditure for the year the Departments are inclined to overestimate.  In this case the error has been in the opposite direction. The best thing to do would be to take the items in order as they appear on the Paper.  There is, first of all, a sum <Col N="2204" /> of £1,400, grant to training colleges. That has arisen from an error in selecting the basis for the grant.  The grant to training colleges consists of two parts.  First there is a sum of £30 per student actually in residence, which is intended to cover the cost of food, laundry and such expenses as would go up roughly in proportion to the number of students there.  Then there is a sum of £45 which is paid, not on the actual number of students in residence, but in regard to each one of what is called the licensed number. That number was chosen from the point of view of what would be an economic efficient number, taking the overheads of the college into account. A sum of £45 is paid on each one of that number.  The registered number in question for the two colleges was 240, whereas the number of students in residence was 180.  There was a difference, then, of 60 between the number in residence and the registered number and in making the calculation the difference between the two portions of the grant was not fully borne in mind. Therefore, an error occurred in that connection.  There would have been a saving on other accounts were it not for that, and this sum of £1,400 represents the difference.</P>
    <P>The next item is refund of cost of training.  Deputies may be aware that when teachers are trained if they enter the Civil Service or do not continue in the profession of teaching they have to make a refund, on a certain basis, of the cost of training.  They are supposed to do that.  In certain cases a refund was obtained where it was not really due and this is refunding a refund. The sum here is £668.</P>
    <P>Next comes the biggest item, which is £17,000.  It is big absolutely but not relatively, when you take into account the large sums on which the underestimation has arisen.  It is not easy, on account of the new schools being opened and so on, accurately to determine the salaries and the sum that will have to be set aside for salaries for any particular year.  In this case there has been an underestimation of the amount that is actually required by £17,000 and this is to make good that amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2205" /> The next item is van and boat services. There is an underestimation of £1,600 there.  That was due largely to the fact that the Crumlin schools were not opened as early as was anticipated. It was anticipated that they would open on the 1st April last, whereas in fact they did not open until the middle of July and in the meantime a children's bus service to a city school was continued.  The service was fairly costly and is the main part in that item of £1,600.</P>
    <P>Then we have superannuation of teachers.  There is a sum of £7,500 in that case.  There again, the charge for pensions is constantly increasing.  At its maximum it is anticipated somewhere in the neighbourhood of £500,000 would be the annual cost of the service. In this case there has also been an underestimation of £7,500.</P>
    <P>These items added together will give you the gross total of £28,168, but on other sub-heads there have been savings to the amount of £15,650, and that gives you the net additional sum for which we are asking the Dáil&mdash; £12,518.  I do not know that there is anything further that I need explain, but if there is I will be happy to do so.</P>

      <P>Sub-head C (1) provides for the payment of teachers, principals and assistants in ordinary and model schools.  I want to say a word upon that, but before I say a word upon that I want to compliment the Minister for having to come before the Dáil for a Supplementary Estimate as a result of having estimated too closely. That is a fault to which few Ministers can plead guilty and, speaking as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I can assure him that it is good financial practice and is a mistake into which he need never fear falling again. I think it is much better to ask for too little than for too much.  The course he has pursued in this case spares the taxpayer's pocket and avoids raising the cupidity of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are paying a very substantial sum every year to principals, assistants, and others of ordinary schools to provide primary education for our children.  I recently had to direct the attention of the Minister for Education to the fact that certain pupils in <Col N="2206" /> a technical school were judged by the staff to be quite incompetent to derive any benefit from the instruction to be imparted there because the children were able neither to read nor write, having done their full course in a primary school.  I am going to submit to the Minister for Education that there is a reason for that.</P>
    <P>Now, let us not overstate the case. It may have been true in regard to some of those children that no matter what methods you employed to teach them, you could not have taught them to read and write.  I admit that freely, but that certainly is not true of the whole 14, or 18 I think was the number. I am going to ask the Minister for Education because I believe him in this regard to be a reasonable man&mdash; I emphasise, Sir, &ldquo;in this regard&rdquo;&mdash;is it consistent with educational sanity to bring impressionable infants from their homes into school for the first time, none of these infants ever having heard a word in their lives but English, and impose upon the teachers the obligation of speaking to those children exclusively in a language not one word of which the children understand and in which the teachers themselves are far from fluent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to put to the Minister is this.  Is it right that these infant children who never heard a word of Irish, and who have never heard any language but English, should be addressed exclusively in the Irish language by teachers who have an immensely difficult task in educating infants at all, but whose task is rendered 20 times more difficult by endeavouring to carry on that most delicate job through a language of which they themselves are not complete masters and mistresses?  Here I want to parenthesize to say that I am satisfied that I speak French as fluently as 90 per cent. of the national teachers speak Irish, but I would no more think of imparting instruction through the medium of French than I would attempt to fly.  Is it right to ask teachers who have no greater competence in Irish than I have in the French language to impart all the instruction that our children in the <Col N="2208" /> primary schools are going to get, from the first standard to the seventh, through the medium of Irish when not 10 per cent. of the children have any degree of fluency in Irish and when half of the teachers have not that degree of fluency which would qualify them at all to impart instruction through the medium of that language, never mind to impart it to children who have an imperfect knowledge of the language themselves?</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  In the first place it would not be at all right if we did not give the Deputy an opportunity of speaking on the matter.  I know he is interested in this matter, and I am very glad that he is.  In regard to the first item shown in the details of the Estimate, £100 for reformatory schools, I might explain that the original Estimate in respect of these schools was £4,960.  It is now estimated that we require £5,060, the difference being due to additional committals beyond those anticipated when the original Estimate was framed.  In the case of the industrial schools, an extra sum of £1,300 is required.  This is also due to a greater number of committals than was anticipated.  There are savings shown in the Appropriations-in-Aid which lessen the total by £850, leaving a net sum of £520 which I ask the Dáil to grant.  I could give figures in regard to the numbers in detention in these schools but I do not think it is necessary for me at this stage to say more than that these sums of £100 and £1,300 are due to the fact that a greater number of boys are in detention than was anticipated when the original Estimate was framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter.  In regard to matters of education I have high hopes of the Minister. Whether they are going to be dashed <Col N="2210" /> or not I do not know.  I have said on more than one occasion that one of the principal functions of a public man is to regard himself as a trustee of the poor.  The children who are going to these schools are the children of the poor.  I suggest to the Minister, more especially when he is bringing in a Supplementary Estimate to provide for additional committals to these schools, that he should regard it as part of his duty constantly to review committals to these schools and reformatories, with a view to seeing whether they are being done in the best interests of the children.</P>
      <P>We are not here dealing with criminals.  There is no element of retribution about the committal of these children.  The committal is done exclusively for the purpose of providing the children with the best prospects of normal, healthy development, and that function much more properly belongs to the Minister for Education. That is why I am concerned more with the welfare of children than with any police magistrate in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister by his action to imply any rebuke or reproof or repudiation of the magistrate concerned in the administration of juvenile criminal justice, but I am asking him to watch each of these children as though he were himself a trustee for them.  They have nobody else to protect them.  Their parents are simple people, most of them not knowing that they have a right of appeal in these cases, to a superior court, if they are dissatisfied with the verdict of the court of summary jurisdiction.  Many children are carried off to these institutions and the parents do not know that they have a right of appeal.  They do not know how to go about it, so that the Minister as their trustee has a heavy responsibility on him, not only to satisfy himself that the children are properly treated in these institutions, but that each individual child committed is having its own best interests served by continued detention there. If he is not satisfied that that is so, then it is his clear duty, in my submission, to exercise his power and to release these children to their parents at once.  I can say with reverence that <Col N="2211" /> he is not entitled to abrogate to himself the right to improve on Divine dispensations, and if there is a doubt as to whether the children would be better off with their parents or in the schools, then they should be given back to the parents.  The doubt should be interpreted in every case in favour of returning the children to the parents. If the Minister does that there will be failures and disappointments, but I want to give this undertaking from this side, that if there are disappointments, and if children sent back to their parents fall into delinquency again, he can rest assured that his action will be endorsed and defended in any gathering where it is called into question.</P>
    <P>With regard to reformatory schools, the Minister stated on a previous occasion, in answer to a Parliamentary Question put down by me, that he intended to abolish Glencree and secure more suitable premises.  I appreciate the difficulties in getting the right kind of premises, and I would be glad to hear how the negotiations are progressing, and what his hopes are.  I do not want to create the impression in this House or elsewhere, that industrial schools, or indeed reformatories, are dreadful places in which children suffer unmentionable wrongs. That would be quite false.  These institutions are run largely by Christian Brothers and orders of priests, who do their very best, very often with deplorably inadequate equipment.  That is no fault of theirs, but these institutions are not adequate substitutes for good family surroundings, and inasmuch as none of us would suffer our children to be removed to industrial schools, we should be scrupulous to see that no poor person's child should be removed without the same consideration and care being taken in arriving at that decision as would be taken with regard to our own children.  I do not want to go over ground that I went over before in regard to reformatories. I do not think it is necessary, because I think the Minister agrees with me. Is it in order to suggest that the Minister should take under his jurisdiction, in addition to the reformatory <Col N="2212" /> and industrial schools referred to in the Estimate, the Borstal institution, or would that require legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that that institution ought to be wound up.  There might be a great deal to be said for using it for remands, if you had there a good matron, a doctor competent in psychological therapy, and a good chaplain for children brought and detained there for a week or a fortnight, who would be able to advise the magistrate as to the state of the child's health mentally and physically, as a place where a child would be under care, where parents would feel that instead of being punished the child was being built up and its morale restored, where people would be freely invited to go to see their children during the period of detention.  But a little creature may be transported from the slums into a place which, it must be admitted, is clean and decently kept, but which is, in fact, an old Georgian house every window of which is barred as if Bill Sykes were about.  I live in one of these Georgian houses, and God knows, with all the amenities I can provide, it is gloomy enough.  As the Minister for Education has reason to know, if a child from 8 to 12 years were incarcerated in such a house behind bars, such an experience would make an impression on its mind from which it would never recover.  I do not think that such an institution would be tolerated to-day in the United States of America or in England. <Col N="2213" /> Surely the standards considered requisite for the children of these people are not too high for ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me whether any progress had been made in regard to providing an alternative to Glencree, and I am happy to state that considerable progress has been made in that respect.  I hope in a few months time to be able to announce that a new location will be available.  As the Deputy knows, if we had to build a place for a reformatory it would take a considerable amount of time.  Therefore, we had to try to find a place, already built, that would be reasonably suitable.  It is in that direction I am working, and I hope that we can have a place which will be more suitable than Glencree. I do not think I can say anything more at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to provide agricultural training there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will be a suitable farm associated with the institution.  This whole question of juvenile offenders and their treatment is extremely difficult.  The Deputy is aware of that.  I must say that I sympathise with a great deal&mdash;I cannot say with everything&mdash;of what he said.  I think it is a very serious matter to take children away from their parents, unless it is essential in the children's own interest to do so.  It is only in such cases that that might be done, or where it is essential to do so&mdash;which is tantamount to the same thing&mdash;in order to prevent them becoming criminals or a danger to society.  I am afraid it would be a burden that a Minister for Education could not reasonably undertake to go completely into every case. He could examine a case incidentally to satisfy himself about it.  The Minister always does that whenever any appeal comes along.  As to examining cases and deciding whether an appeal could be heard and children liberated, the Deputy made a point stating that it was all very well for those who knew that they had a right of appeal, and then asked what about those who did not know they had a right of appeal, even to the Minister, apart from any <Col N="2214" /> question of the courts.  In that case, any Minister will have to depend very largely on the information available to the officers of his Department who have to represent him in work of that kind.  I think every one of the officers with whom I have come in contact appreciates the seriousness of the whole matter and approaches his work in that connection in the same spirit as the Deputy would approach it, if he himself were one of these officers.</P>
      <P>With regard to boys on remand, I am afraid that one would have to consider that with regard to the whole system.  Everything depends on what part it has to play in the system. Sometimes the view is taken that first offenders are to be cured of the tendency to commit certain offences by a certain amount of threat, and that if the building is made too attractive, instead of having it as a deterrent, there may be rather an inducement.  I visited the remand house.  I had no idea at all what it was like before I went there, but I found, as the Deputy has said, that it was scrupulously clean.  There is a very small number on remand at the one time, as a rule.  On this occasion there were three boys, and they were under the control of the officer who has charge of the house and of an assistant. I saw the boys, and I think they were being taught how to read, or something of the sort, at the time.  I appreciate that if you had a large number, and if you were dealing with boys who were going to be detained of a certainty, you might approach it more in the spirit in which the Deputy has spoken, but there is something to be said for the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is certain that boys have committed a certain offence, it may be better for the boys to let them appreciate the difference between being in their own homes and conducting themselves there, and being taken away.  That may act as a deterrent and cure them of their desire to do certain things. That is the point of view which, I think, was taken by those who have in the past used that remand house as a place of remand between one hearing and another.  I am not satisfied at all with the whole system, but, having heard about this place&mdash;it had been <Col N="2215" /> spoken of by the Deputy and by others as a dreadful place&mdash;I went prepared to find something very much worse than anything I did find.  I do not know anything about the locality.</P>

      <P>I think that 14 would probably be the maximum number.  I am sorry; that statement is incorrect. I believe there was a larger number there one time, because I asked the question, but the present average number is about three, and the total number not more than five.</P>

      <P>I have no information which leads me to think that, from the point of view of numbers, the need was not met.  I would prefer to see a larger space for recreation and so on, but if you accept the point of view which I have indicated as being the point of view which apparently has been taken by people very sympathetic to the treatment and handling of children, and who know something about it, namely, that it is very useful, for these few days they are there, to help them to feel that there is a very big difference between being free in their own homes and being in a place of detention, then you will understand why there was evidently no desire on the part of those who thought of this to make the place attractive.  There were bars on the windows.  In fact, I looked for the bars, because I was wondering what would happen if some of the children tried to break through and to get out the windows.  Barring is absolutely necessary above the first storey, and I think I cannot find any fault with the barring.  The bars were only as heavy as would be consistent with their being effective for their purpose. There was also the question of what would happen in the case of fire, and they had a contrivance by which these bars could be quickly removed.  I do not say that it could be completely effective in that case.  There would be a danger, and it would be one of the things that one would have to look out for, but there was this contrivance by <Col N="2217" /> which these bars could be removed very rapidly.</P>
      <P>All I can say to the Deputy is that I am interested in the question.  I think it is one of the most important duties of the Minister for Education so long as this particular Department is under his control, and I will consider whether any better arrangement could be made.  The Deputy&mdash;I do not say that he is wilfully exaggerating&mdash; has an exaggerated view of the effect on the children of being housed in this place for a week or so.  After all, the intention is to try to deter these children from committing these offences, but there is a limit, and I would say the same of the schools in which they are detained for a considerable period. I think you have to have things simple there.  It is a mistake to try to accustom them to conditions which they will not be able to reproduce when they come out afterwards to earn their living.  They must be conditions which will not lead them to feel, when they come out, that there is a very big and violent change.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach to apply to Summerhill a test which he is in a position to apply, but which I, unfortunately, am not: In the case of his own son, if he committed a petty offence for which small children are committed to Summerhill and such was reported to him, would he consider that the most appropriate method of correcting him would be to send him to Summerhill for a week?</P>

      <P>That is the point&mdash;if I believed it was going to cure him. Mind you, I can see the point of view of a person, district justices or others, who say: &ldquo;There has been an objective offence committed against the community, and if this thing were to continue, if, at a later stage, this habit were to develop, this young person would ultimately become a criminal.&rdquo; If such persons thought that threaten-him as to the results of his conduct would cure him, I believe myself that they could uphold their view.  I can understand it.  If he had committed an offence and taking him there for two or three days was going to cure him, I feel I would have no cause of complaint against the public authority.  I would be sorry for him&mdash;I am sure all parents would be&mdash;but in the long run I could not say that I had any complaint.  There must be, of course, an assumption of guilt. I do not think any magistrate would remand a boy to Summerhill if he were not, in the first instance, practically certain that he had committed the offence and, therefore, that it was really a short temporary detention the purpose of which was to deter him from future offences of the kind.  I would be sorry for the boy, but I would have to put up with it.  I feel I can understand the view of the authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not think that I trespass too far if I put another view. It is legitimate, I think, to take the view that that is a somewhat archaic outlook on juvenile delinquency.  Certainly one could not commit oneself to that deterrent course until one was quite satisfied that the psychological make-up of the child is normal and that there is nothing in its surroundings which is inducing it to the course of conduct which brings it in conflict with the law.  It would be obviously wrong to apply sanctions to the child to deter it from wrong-doing, if the wrong-doing were in fact none of its fault.  It is for that reason I suggest that a preliminary course of investigation is requisite both into the child's make-up and surroundings before the deterrent action is determined upon.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that in every juvenile delinquency case in Great Britain and in the United States of America such a report is always presented to the magistrate before he is allowed to detain the child at all.  I urge the Taoiseach most strongly to require a résumé of the current legislation for dealing with juvenile delinquency in Great Britain to be laid before him. The facts are there.  The Juvenile Delinquency Act passed in 1926 in Great Britain is a comprehensive measure, and the Juvenile Delinquency Acts, particularly in the State of New Jersey, not to speak of those passed in Illinois and, I think, in Colorado, would not permit juvenile delinquents to be dealt with without reports of that aspect of the case being laid before the magistrate.</P>

      <P>This sum is required owing to the depreciation of the £ in terms of Swiss francs.  Our original Estimate for the loss on exchange, I think, was about £2,507, and it has had to be revised owing to a drop from 20 francs to the £ to 17.77 between the time that Estimate was made and the time the payment was made.  That meant that there was a sum of £1,280 which had to be met.  As against that, there are savings on travelling expenses, etc., which amount to £920, leaving a net sum of £360.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have reached a stage when I wanted to make certain categoric inquiries.  I had already written out these inquiries and sent them to the Minister so there is no necessity on his part to take a note of them now. I had written him saying I would raise these matters here on the appropriation for Agricultural Schools and Farms.  I am glad that on this Estimate the Minister for Education is <Col N="2222" /> present.  I want to put it to the Minister for Agriculture that the scope of these agricultural schools and farms is not wide enough.  In Australia, and in New Zealand, too, it seems to me that every young fellow who is going to make his livelihood out of the land has an opportunity of learning to be a farmer.  In this country the only employment upon which you embark without any training at all is that of common labour and agriculturist. Common labour requires no skill at all; agriculture requires the most highly skilled type of labour in the country.  I think our objective should be to provide in every county in this country an agricultural school to which those children who are to make their living upon the land should go and learn practical agriculture.  I am quite convinced that the money expended on that would give an ample return in improved production and in raising the standard of living upon the land.  I think we should have boarding schools in each county worked very much like the diocesan colleges, and marching alongside the diocesan colleges.  Let the son of the farmer who is to be given a profession go to the diocesan college, but the son, the heir, who is to be a practical farmer on his own homestead go to the agricultural college, and let him be there trained to be a skilful help to his father when he goes back to his own farm.  If he can find a lady who would be instructed competently in domestic economy the standard of living would be very substantially improved for our people, the loss of which more than anything else has failed to keep the people on the land.  Because until we can dissociate agriculture from dirt and from being looked down upon you can never keep the young people on the land.  Agriculture, that is really the most dignified profession, is being looked down upon and so is the farmer.  Any futile academic pursuit is being regarded as superior to that from which the means for our national life come.  There are a couple of other matters to which I wish to refer in that connection.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education are now present. I ask the Minister for Education <Col N="2223" /> did the Minister for Agriculture forbid him to continue evening schools in practical agriculture?  I know of a county where schools were stopped by the Minister for Agriculture.  I am glad now that the two Ministers are here cheek by jowl at this discussion. I have already told the Minister the name of the county in which the stoppage was made.</P>
      <P>In regard to sub-head F (3)&mdash; Veterinary College&mdash;of this Vote I notice there is a very big appropriation here for the purchase of drugs, laboratory and surgical equipment.  I would like the Minister to tell us why he is not able to get supplies of acapron, a Bayer product.  This was a specific for red water, and we are in very great difficulty about getting supplies, and this difficulty has manifested itself since the beginning of the war.  Further, I want to ask the Minister what research work is being done in the veterinary college in the use of the prontosil group of drugs.  If there is one affliction from which live stock suffer most in this country it is mastitis.  Are any measures taken in the veterinary college to discover whether injections of benzine ring drugs into the mammary tissues help in correcting this infection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any such discovery were made, the saving to the country would be immense.  A cow that loses a quarter is always the best cow of the herd. It astonishes me how this country can go on as it has been going on with virtually no veterinary research being conducted here at all.  I admit that I am not so familiar with the work done in veterinary medicine as in other branches of analogous science.  But it does seem to me that veterinary research is of a low standard.  In many branches of veterinary medicine the outlook is antediluvian.  They are talking in terms that were employed by Niemeyer in the eighties of last century. Why is that?  Surely this country should be a centre for veterinary research in respect of cattle, swine and horses.  I can well imagine this being a country to which students would come from all parts of the world.  I can all the more imagine that condition <Col N="2224" /> of things, bearing in mind that the greatest centre in the world for the teaching of gynaecology and medicine is Dublin.  Is there any reason why we should not advance in the same way in veterinary research and veterinary medicine?  The gains in the savings of our live stock would be immense.  The distinction which veterinary surgery would bring to the country in the prevention of disease and in the curing of such diseases as contagious abortion, mastitis and sterility would be immense.  The annual losses to this country through these diseases are appalling.  They must come to near £4,000,000.  It is hard to believe that, but it is true.  Take sterility, for instance. Take the cows in this country that cannot be got in calf.  I am now distinguishing between contagious abortion and cows that do not come in calf.  Is there any work being done to correct that condition amongst our cattle?  If there is, I cannot find any one to show me any of the fruits of the work?  Has any research been made to ascertain whether sterility in cows does not arise from the absence of vitamin E, or whether wheat germ incorporated in the diet of the cattle might not correct any part of the sterility that obtains in the country?  I do not know of any work of that kind being done. I think it is a great shame that we should continue to appropriate large sums for the veterinary college unless something of that kind of research is being done.</P>
    <P>Now, to come to other matters&mdash;is it proposed to continue or extend the principal's tenure of office?  I am told that there are grounds for thinking that the principal is entitled to an extension of tenure in the hope of securing a more adequate pension.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken on sub-head G (3)&mdash;the Fertilisers Scheme.  The Minister spoke of onions coming from Kerry.  Now, the most beautiful onions are being grown in this country.  That is one of the few good schemes for which the Minister is responsible, and if the growing of onions is properly located, it is a fine scheme.  But the Minister waxed wrathful with me when I said that there were certain areas in this country where onions could not be grown.  I tell the Minister he should <Col N="2225" /> open his eyes to facts.  If he does not, he is going to damn the whole scheme of onion growing.</P>
    <P>The counties of Kerry and the Gaedhealtacht are places where onions can be well grown in this country.  But now we are reaching the time when the success of this industry can be very easily jeopardised by the failure properly to cure the onions.  Onions usually will keep until Christmas but unless one is able to cure them properly it will be found that from Christmas to March many of the onions will deteriorate and no merchant will care to handle them or if he does he will lose money on them When one buys onions at 15/- or 16/- a cwt. he may have to sell them for as little as 3½d. a lb; the prospect of making a profit out of them is very doubtful if they are not properly cured.  I put it to the Minister that the most urgent measures should be taken so that nobody will put onions in a bag branded &ldquo;Irish onions&rdquo; unless they are properly cured.  In Egypt and Spain, I am told, the onions are cured by the sun.  We have not got that kind of sun here.  If you want to cure onions for sale in the spring in this country, you have to grow the right variety and cure them with artificial heat.  If you do not do this, Irish onions will become a byword and it will be a great pity because I think there is hope for the production of Irish onions.  I have been complimenting myself that I gave notice to the Minister of several questions of a specialist character which I proposed to raise so that he would not be taken unawares.  I have dealt with each of these and I invite him to deal with the matters in detail when he is replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate thing about Dutch seed is that it only suits certain areas.  In Deputy Dillon's constituency&mdash;Monaghan&mdash;Dutch seed will grow fairly well.  In Donegal, I do not think that Dutch seed would suit. In Cork Dutch seed was invariably a failure If the only seed available is Dutch, the encouragement to growers to go in extensively for flax this year will not be very great.  I suggested a few years ago that we should go in for saving flax seed.  It is a great pity that, when we had the pedigree seed, we were so short-sighted that we did not start saving our own seed.  I understand that the Minister is going in for flax-seed saving and Deputy Dillon suggested that Monaghan should get the preference.  I have an open mind on that matter but if you go in for any line of pedigree seed you must choose some isolated area.  You cannot have it anywhere near where flax is grown because the pollenization will spread.</P>
      <P>If you go in for the production of pure-line seed, you should do so in some area where no flax has been grown.  Get into a county where flax was never grown and where you will be operating on virgin soil, and I guarantee that you will have seed that you can stand over as pedigree stock.  From the little experience I have I give that advice to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise a big price for flax for some years to come, even if the war were to end in the morning.  I think, therefore, that it would be advisable for the Minister to recommend the saving of flax-seed in every area where it is grown.  I do not refer to the saving of it in bulk.  The man who grows three or four statute acres of flax should have one acre for seed. When we started saving flax seed in 1914, when the war broke out, we had only the ordinary commercial seed.  I was connected with the Department, and I happened to be in Monaghan. We saved a lot of seed there.  It was well saved, although the people had no experience of saving seed.  They have had much more experience since.  They had experience during the four years of the war, and in the last years of the war they used only their own seed.  The <Col N="2227" /> man who saves his seed will also be able to save his fibre and will have results both ways.  I recommend that flax-seed saving be undertaken this year, and that every grower of flax be asked to save a rood, or two roods, according to the quantity he has sown. There is going to be a big increase in the acreage of flax this year.  During the past 12 or 15 years, when the production of flax went down practically to nothing, the mills went into disuse.  Loans should be available for the erection and equipment of scutch mills where they are necessary to handle the increased crop.  There will, I presume, also be grants available for the training of scutchers where flax has never been taken up, or even in other areas where scutchers have to be trained.  I shall not go further into the flax question save to say that I do not think the development of the seed should be taken up where commercial fibre-flax is grown.</P>
    <P>The question of artificial manures is important, and I am not satisfied with the way the Minister has handled it. Even the Bill discussed to-day is a belated measure.  Knowing the demand for increased tillage&mdash;in fact, for compulsory tillage&mdash;it was a mistake that this Bill was not introduced and passed when the war broke out.  I know a number of farmers who, when there was danger of a scarcity of artificial manures, sold their cattle at a loss so as to be able to buy artificial manures which would help them to raise crops for the coming year.  If this measure had been passed, they could have held their stock until next April or May, when they would be more valuable.  I am not at all satisfied with the way the Minister has handled this artificial manure question.  Belated though his efforts are, I appeal to him to remove the tariff and restrictions on continental &ldquo;super&rdquo; and give people a chance of getting it, if at all possible. Remove the tariff and see if we can get it.  I do not see any reason why there should be a 20 per cent. tariff on artificial manures, or why the subsidy should be withheld on foreign stuff.  It is the height of nonsense to have that going on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2228" /> I should like to refer to another aspect of this question.  Along our sea-board&mdash;I raised this matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week and this week&mdash;sand and seaweed are of considerable importance to everybody.  Certain strands have been closed by order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I know the Minister for Agriculture cannot help that.  I may, perhaps, be going beyond bounds in referring to it, but I want to explain the position.  There is a complaint from somebody about erosion&mdash;probably from some official who does not care a damn whether the farmer will be able to grow fruit, potatoes, corn, or anything else, so long as he himself is going to have enough while he is in his position.  However, the complaint comes to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that erosion takes place.  Now, I know one particular strand for almost 50 years, and whilst there has been an encroachment of the tide&mdash;perhaps there would be 8 or 10 acres submerged by the tide&mdash;the erosion has not been caused by that. Nature provides for what may be drawn away.  You can go in and draw 200 loads of sand from that strand to-day, and yet to-morrow you will have that sandbank full.  No matter what sand is drawn away, nature will come and fill up the sandbank again, and yet it is the proposal of the Minister to take away that sand from the people who need it.  No matter what you may put up in the way of groynes or anything else against coast erosion in these particular places, the storms will come and fill up the sandbanks again.</P>
    <P>I think it is nonsense for a Minister, who professes that he is anxious to help his brother Minister in the development and encouragement of increased tillage, to deprive at the same time these hard-working people of the benefits they derive from the sand that is available in their districts. Dredged sand is available in these districts.  You have that sand dredged along the Courtmacsherry, Glandore and Bantry coast, and I think that the Bantry sand contains something like 70 per cent. of sulphate of lime&mdash; it is a complete manure factory in itself.  This dredged sand is being <Col N="2229" /> taken into the inland areas by lorry, and I think that they pay about 2/- or 2/6 a load for it, and those people who take it use it as manure.  They have the advantage that they are in a position to pay for it because their valuations are low and they are able to pay 2/6 a load, whereas, along the seaboard, under Griffith's Valuation, those who live beside the sea are taxed by about 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. more than the others, and are deprived of the use of the sand at the moment. The result is that the inland man is in a position to pay 2/6 for a load of dredged sand, while the poor man beside the sea is being deprived of the free sand to which he should be entitled.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter of great importance, and that it is creating a lot of trouble and turmoil along the seaboard where these people are deprived of the advantages of the use of seaweed and sand to which their fathers and their grandfathers were used for generations before them.  I suggest to the Minister that, no matter what the law may be in this regard, since there is this drive for increased tillage and since there is a scarcity of manures, it is an awful thing that a responsible Department of State should prevent people from producing the best possible crops at the least cost to themselves and to the State.</P>
    <P>Coast erosion does occur and will continue to occur, but, in regard to the districts to which I refer, a storm will come and, in one day, restore what has been already taken away, and I want to urge the Minister to point out to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that, in regard to the districts I am referring to, no matter what quantity of sand you remove from a strand, there is as much sand again in on the following day.  However, I think I have said enough on that.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to this matter of land reclamation schemes in congested districts and other special areas, we generally hear complaints here of too much money being expended and of extravagance in Government services, but I think that, instead of extravagance, in connection with this matter, we have meanness displayed.  Take the case of the congested areas in <Col N="2230" /> West Cork.  Those schemes are not developed, and not half developed, and there again you have the case of people who are deprived of the sand and seaweed.  They get a certain quantity of seed oats and seed wheat at a reduced rate, but in any case, I think, that under the special circumstances these poor people should get these free, since they are striving under such terrible difficulties in order to exist.  I should like to see a much bigger sum of money being provided for these schemes in such areas.  What good is a few pounds for draining and reclaiming schemes at the moment?  It is no more than a flea-bite when you come to deal with such a question as the reclamation of land, and these people should get a little more help and a little more encouragement; and if they got that help and that encouragement you would not have the drift from the land that you have at the moment.  If they were to be provided with a little more comfort, it would be an encouragement for them to stay on the land, and you would have happier and better conditions generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to this matter of improvement in the creamery industry, I cannot say very much, except in the case of, let us say, the travelling creamery, such as the one in Castletown. I think that that is a success and that it should be encouraged.  I think it is a step in the right direction, but I do not know about the other areas, particularly such areas where you have co-operative and proprietary creameries in the one district, one working against the other.  I think that is unfair.  Take the case of a co-operative creamery that might be compelled to set up in opposition to a proprietary creamery.  I take it that the policy of the Minister is to buy out the proprietary creameries as soon as he can?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Well, take the case of a proprietary creamery that is old-established and that, perhaps, has a grip on practically every supplier to the creamery, as a result, perhaps, of having a store as well.  Then you have <Col N="2231" /> a co-operative creamery across the road, into which people are expected to put their money, and how, in the name of God, is that creamery going to get any milk so long as the proprietary across the road is allowed to have his creamery there, run his store, and have a grip on every possible customer?  I think that the sooner the Minister can buy out the proprietary creameries, the better, and I think that no matter how much money may have to be spent, it will be money well spent and will give the co-operative movement the necessary fillip that it has not got up to the present.</P>
      <P>As to the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, I do not know what to say about that matter.  I think the matter has been bungled badly.  At the moment, I do not know if there is any quantity of pedigree seed oats in the country.  I do not think you can get these oats in in any commercial quantity and I think that, after years of trying to develop seed production here, it is a bad state of affairs when we have not seed oats and when we have not pedigree pure line seed oats. The Department of the Minister will not allow seed oats to be brought in except under licence, but an individual farmer can get a certain quantity under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many farmers in the State are in a position to pay for five or ten barrels of seed oats?  Of course to-day they cannot get it, but last year or the year before, or in any of the last five years, how many farmers were in a position to get the quantity of pure line seed oats they required?  I venture to say that there was not one in 100 who could do so.  No doubt they would be all anxious to get the seed, but they had not the money to pay for it. This was a useful suggestion put up to the Department more than once.  The idea was that merchants of repute, who would be in a position to give full guarantees of what they were going to do with the seed, should be allowed to procure and distribute it.  They would have the money and they could pay for the seed.  Those merchants would already have had years of <Col N="2232" /> experience of purchasing seed and they could not be fooled in the matter of purchase.  They would be in a position to deal with all the customs requirements, matters about which the average farmer would not bother or worry.  If merchants of repute had been allowed to bring in seed oats and distribute the seed among their customers, we would have a plentiful supply at the moment.  As it is, we have not a plentiful supply.  I am very much afraid that when we come to the next harvest&mdash;that is, if one is to judge by some of the samples of seed oats one has seen&mdash;we will be reaping a very poor harvest.</P>
    <P>On the subject of agricultural schools and farms, I would like to know what is underlying the £1,000 in connection with the Athenry agricultural station. Does that refer to the general expenses of management, or is it an increase in the cost of management?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it represents increased stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a step in the right direction.  The more we can increase our stocks, the better.  Reference was made to the contribution in connection with the staining of the wheat.  In the name of God, what was the wheat stained for this year?  Why was it necessary to keep a bunch of officials staining wheat and getting the importers to pay £2,000?  The man who bought the wheat had to bear his share of the £2,000.  The wheat was dear enough without that, and why stain it?  The top price for our best wheat was 30/6, and the price charged for the first seed wheat that came into my county from abroad was 35/-.  It was all right last year.  Possibly there was reason to stain wheat last year.  I believe some people tried to make money on it.  They bought it at 15/-and 16/- and were selling it at 30/-. This year, when the imported wheat was 35/- and we were selling at 30/6, could you not put these officials at something else instead of wasting their time so foolishly staining wheat?</P>

      <P>I hope they will not. With regard to the sand, I hope the Minister will appeal to his colleagues to see that those of us along the seaboard will get sand from every strand that is available.  I would go further and ask him, at a time of stress like this, to put lorries on the road and take sand further inland, where it would be of great advantage to people who are not so well circumstanced in the matter of lime and other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy O'Donovan's proposal that restrictions on the supply of super-phosphate and artificial manures from abroad should be withdrawn.  I support the proposal for a different reason to that which Deputy O'Donovan has in mind.  I support it so that those people will be in a position to see that the supplies cannot be got from outside.  I heard Deputy Dillon talking in his usual foolish manner&mdash;I cannot refer to <Col N="2234" /> it in any other way&mdash;about all the supplies of superphosphates that could be got from Britain.  Anybody reading British farming journals will see that the farmers there are threatening to strike, and they refuse to till because they cannot get sufficient artificial manures.  They cannot get superphosphate in Britain, and they refuse to plough.  According to Deputy Dillon, there is so much of it to spare there that they are going to throw some of it over to us.  If there is anything that has shown how utterly foolish are Deputy Dillon's statements in this House during the few years that he has been here, it is what has occurred since the 1st September last.  If we had taken Deputy Dillon's advice and allowed foreign artificial manure merchants to swamp our markets and push out our native manufacturers of artificial manures, where would we be now in regard to those artificial manures? I suggest we would be in the same position as was the Irish Sugar Company in September last when the British informed them that, although they had contracts made and supplies of sugar ordered from Britain, they would not get any supplies, and for any they did get they would have to pay an increased price of fully 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>What applies to artificial manures applies with equal force to agricultural machinery, with reference to which Deputy Dillon was also howling.  The tariff on the harrow that Deputy Dillon was so noisome about was 10/-, and if British manufacturers were unable to compete with the Irish manufacturer, with, I might say, a greenhorn manufacturer starting up here, then they were not worth considering.  If we had not encouraged the Irish manufacturer, if we had not protected him and kept him in production, I wonder where would the harrows come from now, and I wonder what the price would be, with the ships carrying them going down every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that what has happened here since the 1st September last affords a complete justification for what the Government have done in regard to the protection of Irish manufactures. Deputies have not such short memories that they cannot remember what happened <Col N="2235" /> in the case of beet.  I invite them to direct their minds back to that little item of three-farthings a pound on the poor people's sugar.  That was put on in order to pay to foreigners what was refused to the Irish farmer when he looked for an increase last year. Deputies should keep their minds on that as well as on what the position of the people of the country was going to be at the present time if they were totally dependent on foreign supplies. I, for one, would like to see the tariff taken off artificial manures, because for one thing it would enable us to see how much of them were going to come in: how much John Bull could afford to send across to Cinderella.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister to give serious consideration to the points brought before him with regard to sand and seaweed.  Undoubtedly, you find covenants in old leases with regard to both sand and seaweed.  Land within three miles of the sea coast in the old days was valued on the basis that the sand and the seaweed were available to land occupiers.  Now the unfortunate farmer finds himself in the position that, due to coast erosion, a few acres of his land have been eaten up by the ocean, land for which he still has to pay an annuity to the Land Commission and rates to the county council. Due to the fact that some gentleman from town has taken it into his head that he would like to spend his summer holidays in a tiny house by the sea coast, the farmer finds himself in a difficulty with regard to the removal of the sand.  The gentleman objects to the horses and butts drawing the sand from the seashore.  That, according to him, interferes with the amenities of the place, and he makes representations to the county council and the Department of Industry and Commerce. He gets a couple of civil servants down, people of the same tribe as himself, and they, seeing eye to eye with him, arrive at the decision that the proper thing to do is to stop the horses and the butts drawing sand from the seashore.  The result of all that is that farmers in those districts are deprived of what they have always been entitled to, namely, free sand, for <Col N="2236" /> which they have been paying in their rates.  They require this free sand now for the cultivation of their holdings.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy O'Donovan meant when speaking about seed oats.  In connection with that I did not find any difficulty in the last couple of years.  The farmer got the permit and passed it on to his merchant.  The merchant, having received a large number of permits, imported seed oats for all his customers.  The position to-day is that seed oats is anything up to £25 a ton and cannot be got at that.  The blame for that, as well as for the shortage of barley for feeding stuffs, rests with Deputy Dillon and with the people who were foolish enough to take his advice.  I often think that some Deputy, with time to spare, would be rendering a useful service if he went to the Library and endeavoured to make out an estimate of the amount of the time of this House Deputy Dillon has wasted by the speeches he delivered here attacking, as he called it, the utterly foolish idea of endeavouring to fatten Irish pigs on Irish oats and barley.  It would be a very valuable thing indeed if we had made available for the country an estimate of all the money that has been wasted in printing the foolishness that Deputy Dillon has uttered on that subject.  It would give Deputies, too, an idea of what Deputy Dillon's presence in this House has cost the country within the last five years.  Of course, it would be necessary to add to what the Deputy's foolishness has cost the country an estimate of the losses that Irish farmers have sustained by not having oats or barley now.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is a trying time for farmers.  It will have to be got through in one way or another.  I am afraid that even the measure that was before the House to-day which aims at providing farmers with seeds and manures will not enable them to get over their present difficulties.  As I have already said, farmers have to-day to pay £25 a ton for seed oats.  If this measure, to which I have referred, had been introduced last September, instead of at the present time, farmers would have been enabled to seed ten acres of land for a sum that to-day will <Col N="2237" /> only seed five acres.  I admit that Deputy Dillon has a rather brazen way of doing things.</P>
    <P>He gets up and complains that because tariffs are not taken off agricultural machinery is not coming in.  He knows very well that in any event agricultural machinery would not come in: that the people who used to be engaged on that work at the other side are now employed making dum-dum bullets and high explosives.  They are more in their line than agricultural machinery. If we were depending on them for our supplies we would simply be told that we would have to wait.  As a matter of fact, one manufacturer in my district is doing very well at the present time manufacturing a few articles.  I have heard members of the House&mdash; Deputy Belton and Deputy Hughes&mdash; spend a good deal of time attacking his manufactures.  He is engaged in making shovels, forks and implements of that description.  I am glad to be able to say that during the last few months he has been doing a very prosperous export trade with Birmingham in these articles.  The position we were in used to be that we had to go to Birmingham for manure forks, hay forks and such like: now we find the position is that we are sending them across. That is rather a change in the programme; however, that is how change comes about.  If there is anybody who is going to tell me that, when you find the English farmer threatening to go on strike because the British Government cannot supply him with artificial manure sufficient for manuring his land, John Bull in his generosity is going to make a position of greater scarcity over there in order to supply us, then such a person does not know John Bull as well as I hope I know him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to think that anyone, either inside or outside this House, will object to any increase in the amount expended by the Minister's Department on agriculture, provided that it is spent to good purpose, to promote and foster agricultural prosperity.  Most of our people now realise that a prosperous economy for this country must be built on a healthy and prosperous agriculture as a basic <Col N="2238" /> industry.  Just at the moment we are chiefly concerned with the provision of seeds and fertilisers for our increased tillage operations, to provide essential food for our people and our livestock during the emergency period.  Reference has been made in this debate by other Deputies to a number of people who are conversant with the real artificial manure situation in this country being quite worried about the policy of the Government in regard to the supply of superphosphates.  I believe that a sufficient supply of potash manures is available; we will have ample supplies of potash manures, both from France and Spain, and I think we can rely on a sufficiency of nitrogenous manures. However, the basic manure&mdash;phosphates&mdash;is likely to be short and it is doubtful if we will reach the amount of super that we used last year.  With the increase in tillage, and particularly with the big increase in the amount of land likely to be put under beet crop requiring intensive dressing of artificial manure, the situation is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that Deputy Corry's attack on Deputy Dillon simply shows how blissfully ignorant Deputy Corry is of the whole history of the manufacture of artificial manures in this country.  I am quite well aware of the fact that after the Great War, when foreign continental phosphates were brought into this country, there was a substantial discrepancy between the price of home manufactured manures and that of continental super.  Usually, the continental super was of good quality: sometimes it suffered damage in shipment, possibly through heavy seas; sometimes one did not get it in the same condition as the home manufactured article&mdash;but, on the whole, it was certainly much cheaper, the difference in price approximated to £1 a ton.  When that manure came in at that time, the home manufacturers sat up and realised that, if they were going to maintain the home market for super here, they would have to manufacture superphosphates at a keener price.  Eventually they were able to do that&mdash;there is no doubt about it; in an open market here the home manufacturers held their own right through. Any reduction in recent years in the <Col N="2239" /> amount of artificial superphosphate in this country was effected in the amount of foreign superphosphate coming into this country; but the amount of superphosphate that was allowed into this country secured for the farmer a keen competitive price.  The farmer knew and felt that he was buying at the very best price, as the competition was there at all times.  One thing that ensures a keen price to the consumer is the element of competition.</P>
    <P>Then Fianna Fáil came into office and, for no reason, put on that tariff. The amount of foreign super shut out by the introduction of that tariff was negligible, but the price automatically went up; the ring was formed, they fixed their own price and charged it. The reaction that set in immediately from that was a reduction in the amount of superphosphate used and that was detrimental to the interest of our primary industry&mdash;agriculture. There is one thing we have been trying to get into the minds of the Government&mdash;and particularly into the mind of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; namely, the necessity for an intensive use of artificial manure.  We have pointed out, over and over again, what our competitors are using relatively per acre of arable land; what the Danes have been using, for instance.  Denmark and Holland are using approximately ten times as much per acre of arable land, New Zealand is using about the same, and Great Britain is using about six times as much.  Yet we boast of our agriculture, though we are easily the lowest users of artificial manure in the world, relatively speaking.  We ought not forget this fact, that we can probably get the best results in the world from the use of artificial manure. One thing absolutely essential for that is a moist climate and we have that above most countries.  Yet this is our position in the use of artificial manure.</P>
    <P>Never have I listened to such balderdash as one listens to at times from Deputy Corry, who went on then to chase Deputy Dillon into what he had said about machinery.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to this: there is a tariff on a particular machine&mdash;a <Col N="2240" /> manure distributor&mdash;and there is no decent manure distributor made in this country.  There is one thing essential to the best results: proper distribution of artificial manure.  The quantity spread over an acre of land is relatively very small and even distribution is difficult.  If you have it thrown on haphazardly on a cereal crop you will have lodging occurring at one spot, while others will not get any assistance at all.  We have to-day produced by people who make agricultural machinery&mdash;particularly the International people&mdash;an excellent machine.  As I say, there is no such machine made in this country.  They do make some attempt to make a manure distributor, but the pattern is obsolete&mdash;it is at least ten years obsolete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an old Westphalian pattern and is at least ten years obsolete. Any farmer can tell that it is not suitable, and that it is not in the same class as an International machine.  We talk a lot about the use of artificial manures, but a tariff of 33? per cent. is clapped on the one machine necessary for the even distribution of them. Is that a progressive policy?  Is that in the interests of agriculture?  The number of manure distributors that are made in this country is relatively small, and the number of men employed on the manufacture of those few machines is relatively small.  We give a monopoly to a few individuals to make an obsolete machine here, and then compel the unfortunate farmer to pay 33? per cent. too much for that machine, or go without it.  That is the position in regard to artificial manures and machinery in this country.  We stick too long to the old pattern in those machines; there is no progress at all.  Deputy Dillon mentioned the mowing machine.  The modern machine, made by the International people again, is on the very latest lines, all run on ball races, made like <Col N="2241" /> a motor car, but we are still sticking to the old pattern in this country, and the people are forced to pay the difference in price.</P>
      <P>On the question of seed oats, Deputy Corry told us that it was quite a simple matter.  Deputy O'Donovan complained that the position with regard to seed oats is bad, and that the seed oats generally had deteriorated. I must say I agree with Deputy O'Donovan.  The seed oats in this country has undoubtedly deteriorated, because we have not available here sufficient supplies of imported seed oats.  Deputy Corry said it was easy for the farmer to secure a permit, to hand that permit over to the merchant, and to get his seed without any difficulty. But we must remember that, taking the average farmer in this country who is working in a small way, as a rule he does not bother about permits or anything else.  He goes to his merchant and orders what seed oats he requires.  If the best is not available at the time, he takes what is available and sows it.  That may be downright carelessness on the part of the farmer, but nevertheless that is the case, and the Minister must face the situation.  There is no earthly reason why the merchants should not be permitted to import seed oats in bulk, and have it there available for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the sub-heads have already been covered by other Deputies, and I do not propose to deal with them again, but there is one matter to which I should like to refer, and that is sub-head M (10)&mdash;Travelling Expenses for Trade Representatives.  I take it that, under that heading, we paid certain travelling expenses for the representatives who went across to make the recent live-stock trade agreement with the British Government.  I have no objection to paying those travelling expenses, except that I feel that those expenses were paid for the wrong men. I think the man who should have gone over&mdash;we would not object to chartering a special 'plane to take him across to do what I consider was a vital job for this country&mdash;was the Minister himself. I think he should have gone over, and taken with him a special advisory committee consisting of two men from the cattle trade, two experts from the <Col N="2242" /> live-stock trade, and two farmers. Instead of that, what did the Minister do?  Does the Minister or does this House really appreciate what the live-stock trade agreement means for this country, and the necessity of straining every effort to get the very last ounce out of the people who are going to buy our produce?  Do we not know that the people at the other side would, right away, appreciate the fact that the Minister himself had gone over to make that agreement?  Was not the agreement of such importance to this country that it called on the Minister himself to go over personally to get the very best terms that could be secured for our agricultural people? Instead of that, we sent over civil servants to negotiate this agreement.  I have very great respect for the civil servants in this country, but I do submit, Sir, that they had not the expert knowledge required to discuss a live-stock trade agreement with the Ministry of Food at the other side.</P>
    <P>The Minister went down to his own constituency recently, and he had very little to say about the agreement.  He told the people down there that he considered it was a good agreement no matter what anyone said.  I do not know how the Minister satisfied himself that the best that could be secured was obtained by that agreement.  If the method of approach had been different, and the personnel had been different&mdash;the Minister himself going across, with the people I suggested&mdash;I feel that better terms could and would have been secured.  In effect, what does the agreement mean, this agreement which the Minister thinks is a very good one?  There are five recognised ports of landing at the other side.  You have Birkenhead, Holyhead, Bristol, Fishguard, and Preston.  Our cattle are landed there.  They do ten hours' detention, and they are virtually handed over to the Food Controller.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to one representative at each port, and that representative is only entitled to see our cattle weighed.  We have no representation or no right of inspection in regard either to dressing or grading, and to my mind both dressing and grading are as important as weighing.  You can be <Col N="2243" />&ldquo;had&rdquo; on dressing.  You can go up a notch or two on the neck; you can go up on the knees, and you can go up on the hocks.  Again, in grading, you can get your cattle put into a lower class than they should be put into.  Is it not natural that, with the big interests we have involved in both those operations, we should be entitled to inspection in order to see that we get a fair crack of the whip?</P>
    <P>I do not know what attempt was made to secure that the British Ministry of Food would purchase our fat cattle on a live weight basis, but I feel that if at the time the best effort had been made we would have secured an agreement on that basis.  I might point out that, on the dead weight basis, if there is anything wrong with the carcass, the carcass is simply confiscated. The carcass is lost; we are paid nothing for it.  On a live weight basis if T.B. is present in the carcass, we are paid anyway.  No matter what the price is at the moment there are definitely disadvantages and losses which must be offset against that price. On this dead weight basis again, it is really only the heavy cattle that will travel well and kill out well, and that are graded as &ldquo;tops&rdquo;.  The policy which has obtained in this country during the last few years has tended to force our people into younger cattle. The Minister has often stated here that our numbers of live stock are no lower than ever they were; in other words, that we have maintained our live stock numbers.  I am not disputing that, but I do definitely want to point out that we have far more immature cattle to-day than ever we had before, and that we have far less three year old cattle.  The demand to-day is for the mature beast. The Englishman with a subsidy held out to him wants to turn his cattle three or four times a year.  With the very high cost of feeding stuffs to-day he wants to get a forward store in good condition that can be fattened off in a very short period, that he can cash and draw a subsidy and start turning again.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the price for English fat cattle is higher than for <Col N="2244" /> Irish, because the Minister took into account the increase in the cost of feeding stuffs in England.  The increase is estimated to average 33? per cent.  For the life of me I do not know how the officials of the Department of Agriculture satisfied themselves that that estimate was correct, that animal food in England is costing 33? per cent. more in England than it is here.  I am very much inclined to question that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no quotas in that item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing what results we got from the efforts of our trade representatives.  If we spend money we expect results, and I am discussing what were the results&mdash;what I think about them.  I would like to ask the Minister was there any attempt made to get rid of quotas?  The quota system that we have at present is a product of the economic war.  We never knew anything about quotas in this country until the economic war.  We have now a quota for fat cattle.  We have a quota for pigs.  Was it said to the British Minister that we are prepared to encourage our people to go into intensive pig production provided that whatever production figures <Col N="2246" /> we reach during the war period will be maintained in the post war period?  Is the Minister alarmed about the quota being preserved?  Does not the Minister know, as we all know, that at the present time the quota is a noneffective quota, that it is an unlimited quota?  Any number of licences the Minister asks for the month of March, or April or May next he is going to get because they want our pigs.  What is the necessity for preserving that quota?  Is it not obvious that the British are preserving that quota for the purpose of using it against us in the post war period when the Danes come back into competition against us? If they think it necessary to depress our numbers they are going to do so. Is not this the time to get rid of that quota?  What effort was made in this particular agreement by our representatives to get rid of that quota, which is a most objectionable thing and can be used any time against us?  What encouragement can be given to our people to equip themselves properly to go into pig production in this country, to build proper pig-styes, if, when the war is over, our numbers are going to be pushed back again?  Obviously, this is the time to straighten out all. This is an opportunity that is offered the Minister at the present time to get rid of this imposition.  What is being done about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again we are told that the British Government are spending huge sums of money at present in subsidising food.  Approximately £1,000,000 a week is being spent in subsidising food.  I am aware that a considerable proportion of that £1,000,000 a week is going towards subsidising wheat, but there must be a considerable portion going towards subsidising other food.  For instance, quite recently, the Canadian Government made an agreement with the British Government to supply 7,000,000 lbs. weight of bacon weekly. I believe that before that Canadian bacon is put on the British market it is credited with whatever portion of subsidy is coming to it and that we are selling against the lower level created by the assistance of that subsidy on foreign food coming in.  It may be said that the English farmer has <Col N="2247" /> also to sell against subsidised foreign foods coming in, but then he is an interested party.  He is an Englishman and wants to do his bit to win the war. We are not in the same position at all. We want to make use of the situation that is there and to get the best price. Was that aspect of the case examined and discussed?  Does the Minister know whether those foods that are imported at the present time are credited with subsidy before they are put on the market on the other side, or where exactly we are selling?  Are we selling against a lower level after these foods have been credited with subsidy?</P>
    <P>Of course, I do not agree with the Minister's statement at all that any effort was made by the Minister himself to get the best that could be got there with the opportunity that has arisen.  The Minister bears a very grave responsibility in this matter that he did not make a personal effort himself to get the best deal that he could get for this country.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that his Department has made an agreement recently with Northern Ireland for the sale of our live stock in Northern Ireland, and one of the clauses in the agreement says that fat cattle exported for slaughter in Northern Ireland will be purchased by Government buyers on a live weight basis at authorised collecting centres in Northern Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should not be granted because it was very badly spent.  I think it was spent on the wrong men.  I would have no objection if it were spent on the Minister, in providing him with elaborate travelling facilities or with a staff of experts, if he had only done the job himself.  I shall not go into the matter in further detail except to point out to the Minister that the result, as far as the Northern Ireland agreement is concerned, is that Northern Ireland at the moment is more attractive than the British market, especially for sheep. Sheep are fetching more money in Northern Ireland than if they were sent direct from Dublin to Great Britain.  What is the effect of that? That most of our live stock, intended for Great Britain, will be sent by rail through Belfast instead of having a direct trade with Britain ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter is that it is very much easier to get shipping for live stock from Belfast than from Dublin. There are only three cattle boats going from Dublin, and it is more difficult to get live stock shipped from Dublin than from Belfast.  We should have direct trading.  The Minister should have seen to it that the British agreement should have been more advantageous than the agreement made with Northern Ireland.  I do not think it wise that we should encourage exports through Belfast rather than through Dublin.  Although it is a relatively small sum, I am not satisfied that this amount of £150 under sub-head M (10), was wisely or judiciously spent in the <Col N="2249" /> interests of the country.  I am satisfied that a golden opportunity was lost, but there is still time for the Minister to make an agreement, extending over a ten years period at least, for this country.  I ask the Minister to make use of the opportunities that are available, and try to get the best terms that can be got for this country.  Such terms can only be got by personal representations from the Minister himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether item 4, given in the details of sub-head F (3)&mdash;Laboratory and Surgery Equipment&mdash;includes the X-ray apparatus that was recommended by the House Breeding Commission some years ago.  I think the Minister told us some time ago that he was about to purchase this X-ray apparatus, and I should like to know whether it has been since installed. There is also an item on page 6 under sub-head AA&mdash;losses arising out of misappropriation of National Health and Unemployment Insurance stamps, and of cash provided for the purchase thereof, £227.  Can the Minister tell us what happened in that case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the Bill that was before the House to-day and yesterday, which was 100 per cent. an Agricultural Bill, we missed the smiling face of the Minister for Agriculture. We thought he should have been behind the Bill.  However, there were matters in that Bill which can be related to this Estimate.  Speaking generally, I think the situation which arose at the end of last year should have been foreseen by our Government. It was certainly foreseen by ordinary intelligent citizens who were not in the Ministry.  From day to day nobody knew when the emergency would arise, but they foresaw that the emergency was inevitable.  No attempt whatever was made to cope with the situation that was staring this country in the face.  In the matter of fertilisers this <Col N="2250" /> country is in a hopeless condition.  I should like to hear if the Minister, with the experience he has had up to date in the matter of the supply of fertilisers, can still assure the House that 100 per cent. of the fertilisers procured last year are available for this year. He made a Tillage Order making it compulsory to till 12½ per cent. of all arable land&mdash;I do not think the word &ldquo;arable&rdquo; was used in the Order&mdash;but he showed no practical appreciation of the problem.  He did not even learn from his predecessors in similar circumstances. He did not learn from the British.  He made no exemption of dairying land, as the British did. Dairying land is as essential for the food of the people and produces food as useful for the people, as tillage land.  He did not look for seeds and manures.</P>
      <P>Merchants cannot promise more than 80 per cent. of last year's requirements but we have twice the amount of land under tillage, or will have, if the order is even substantially obeyed.  The extra tillage will require more artificial manure per unit under tillage, because we will scarcely have the same amount of farmyard manure.  We will not have as much farmyard manure as last year because stallfeeding is very much reduced compared with last year's figures.</P>
      <P>The conditions in agriculture manifested themselves in an unique way before Christmas.  I am relating what I am about to say to sub-head M (5)&mdash; Improvement of the Creamery Industry. For the first time this city found itself confronted with a milk shortage, and the Minister, using his special emergency powers, issued orders to 30 or 40 creameries in the South of Ireland to come to the rescue and supply Dublin with milk.  To do that the Minister wiped out all the public health regulations which had to be observed in order to provide the city with a supply of wholesome milk.  He undertook to break the strike by dumping into Dublin milk that was not fit, according to medical testimony, for human consumption. That went on for some time. Then an effort, in which I took part, was made to settle the strike.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that situation, it is agreed that there was a settlement which involved 30 creameries, and also the sub-head to which I am referring.  Of course, I am speaking subject to your ruling, Sir. The Minister admits that he has withheld some £1,600 from these creameries.  I submit that under the expenditure in the original Estimate of £7,000, and the revised Estimate of £20,000, as well as £13,500 now required, it is in order to refer to the withholding of sums to which they <Col N="2252" /> were normally entitled from these creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly.  I am not touching on the Order at all.  I say that the creameries were penalised, although in the terms of settlement the Minister agreed that there should be no victimisation.  I am not going to burden the House with the correspondence, but it is clear from Clause 7 of the settlement, which was sent by the secretary of the Milk Producers' Association to the Minister, and dated December 5th, 1939, that that clause has been broken.  Clause 7 was an assurance that there would be no victimisation. That was agreed to by a letter from Mr. Twomey, Secretary of the Department, on December 9th, but subsequent to that the Department deducted £240 from Drinagh Creamery and about £1,400 from about 30 other creameries.  When the Minister and the Department made an agreement they should have carried it through. <Col N="2253" /> They should have honoured their bond. I do not want to prolong this debate, as this matter was discussed upon the Bill that got a Second Reading to-day. A case, when made at all, if it is a good one, needs no repetition.  Deputy Hughes dealt with the agreement that was made in England about Irish cattle.  I cannot understand how anybody could make such an agreement. Under it we send our cattle over to Britain at our risk, and the cattle are graded there by a British grader.</P>

      <P>I do not remember the agreement being debated in this House.  I should like to have an opportunity of having a debate on the agreement, and going into the details of it. After all, in any business, the art of selling is the art which denotes whether the business is paying or not.  No matter how efficiently we produce, if we do not sell well, business will go down. The business of this country has been let down by a bad agreement.  I cannot understand why it is that the Minister who is responsible to the country through the Government and the Dáil did not go over to Britain and make an agreement first hand with the Minister there.  Every risk has to be taken by us.  Everybody in the trade would prefer to go back to the old system of selling cattle in Irish fairs or in the Dublin market.</P>

      <P>Only the results of the agreement.  We have to sell our stock over there.  Heretofore, we could make a bargain, but now we have no voice in making a bargain, and we have agreed to that.  We take the risks of submarine warfare and bombs from here to Britain, in order to get the article landed in Britain safely, and if it is, according to the British classification, of a certain grade, the Britisher will pay according to that grade, but he is taking no risk whatever, while we have to pay for the cost of it all.  Surely we have a business Government.  I do not think there is any use in labouring the matter, nor is there any use at this time of day in trying to correct people who do not know enough to know the depth and volume of their own ignorance on this matter. They will have to educate themselves before they realise how little they know about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point on which I should like some information from the Minister in connection with sub-head M (5), the additional sum required for the improvement, reorganisation and extension of the creamery industry.  There is one firm in Cork City which had a creamery out in the country.  That creamery was about to be acquired by Lissavard or Drinagh. The first negotiations started as far back as 13 years ago, and the price asked for the creamery was not regarded as a fair price by the Dairy Disposals Board.  Subsequently, one of the creameries offered a sum of approximately £1,500, but the Minister gave a licence to the other competing creamery in the district, and they built a new creamery.</P>
      <P>The owners of the original proprietary creamery facilitated the new creamery extension.  They did not interfere at all with the progress of the extension, but they are in this position, that while they could have got £1,500 from one of the two competing creameries, by reason of the Minister giving a licence to the other, the original proprietors are going to get only £70 a year for eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making any case for the manner or style of the negotiations on <Col N="2255" /> the part of the proprietors of the creamery, but I do say that, from an examination of all the documents submitted to me and of a fairly impartial description of the circumstances from the beginning, all that one can say is that there may have been unwise business proposals from the proprietary creamery people, but it is scarcely fair in all the circumstances to mulct them to the extent to which they have been mulcted.  They are not now in good circumstances.  It may be that according to regulations, rules and all the rest of it, they have lost the tide, but if we pride ourselves in any way at all upon equity in our dealings with the people, there is certainly a case for consideration in this particular instance.  I think the Minister knows of the case.</P>

I make no pretence whatever at putting forward a case for the way in which the business was handled, but I do say that, notwithstanding that, the property is there and the new creamery extension has got all the advantages which it would have had if a fair price had been paid, and that in the circumstances as I have had them described to me&mdash;and I have had them described from more than one side in the case&mdash; these people have been dealt with unjustly. They have not had a fair deal and it ought to be one of the primary attributes of a Government Department to deal fairly with a case of this sort and not to deal unfairly or unjustly in regard to the acquisition of property, where a question of public policy arises. It was not the original intention in connection with the institution of the Dairy Disposals Board, and the matter ought not now to be disfigured by one case of complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Could he possibly see his way to provide something approaching an economic price for milk, milk which is to be converted into butter? As the Minister knows full well, with the increased costs lately of wages, materials and other things, the price which butter will produce will not give the farmer anything near the cost of production, not to speak of a profit. This is a very difficult matter and the House is providing large sums of money, I will admit, for the creamery industry generally, but this matter of butter provision is possibly one of the most important in the State.  It is the one article of food for which, as the Minister knows, the producers generally are getting less than the cost of production, and if the industry is to be maintained, something akin to a profitable price must be provided.  The Minister has had various deputations on the subject, and I do not think I could add anything to what he has already been told.  The general opinion seems to be that anything under an approximate price of 8d. or 9d. a gallon would not, in present circumstances, provide the cost of production, much less a profit for the farmer.</P>

      <P>Looking over the Estimate, I do regret the number of additional sums provided under various headings for additional overseers, assistant overseers and so on.

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which I wish to refer to, and that is the question raised by Deputy O'Donovan with regard to the taking of sand along the coast.  I am not quite clear as to whether this order is a general prohibition with regard to the taking of sand, or whether it is peculiar to the district to which Deputy O'Donovan referred.  I do not know whether the Minister is acquainted with this matter or not.  If it is a general order, I cannot see how it can be defended at all.  The Minister's Department, of course, does not deal with this matter, but he should get into contact at once with the Department concerned and have a discussion about this matter. Unless the grass that holds the sand and protects the coast against erosion is cut, no injury is done by the taking away of the sand.  You can take 1,000 tons of sand away where there is a current running and that will be replaced by the next tide.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, that quantity of sand will be taken away again if it is left there.  Provided the portion where the grass known as bent grass is used for the purpose of holding the sand on the sand bank proper and not on the strand, and which was planted by the Land Commission and by the landlords in other days, is not interfered with, no injury is done.  The Minister should get into consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and come to some agreement with him in regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said about fertilisers, and in connection with that matter also the Minister should get into contact with the Minister for Lands with regard <Col N="2258" /> to the development of the kelp industry.  Some five years ago we asked the Department to get into consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce in order to get a portion of the money distributed by that Department on unemployment assistance, together with money voted to the Department of Lands, in order to pay a price of £6 per ton for the curing and storing of kelp.  If that advice had been taken five years ago, we would have heard less to-night about fertilisers.  It was looked upon then, I suppose, as a hare-brained scheme which it was ridiculous to suggest, as the kelp would never have been used.</P>
    <P>Apparently, there are four or five years of war before us, and I should like the Minister, and the agriculturists who talk about supplying fertilisers and the fear they have of submarines to look to the source they have all round the coast for producing fertilisers. In the last war a Deputy here paid £10 per ton to curers and burners of kelp which was sent to the manufacturers of artificial manures here to be manufactured and sold to the farmers. Farmers paid as much as £10 and £12 a ton during the last war for kelp to be used as a fertiliser.  I take it that it was not used in a treated form after the extraction of the iodine, but that they used the whole kelp as a fertiliser. There are so many expert agriculturists in this House that one fears to venture an opinion on a matter of this kind.  But I venture to submit that anybody who has used whole kelp as a fertiliser will agree that for the production of cereals and flax there is no other fertiliser to approach it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with this question of sand.  It is a serious matter for the small farmers around the coast.  He should inquire if the order is general, or if it only applies to the district to which Deputy O'Donovan referred.  He should also inquire from the Land Commission as to whether or not there is grass growing in this place from where the sand is taken.  If it is only taken from the strand which is controlled by the tide, then the farmers should be permitted to take whatever quantity they want. <Col N="2259" /> I would also ask the Minister to get in touch with the Minister for Lands in connection with the production of fertilisers by the development of the kelp industry.  I should like, however, to give him a warning.  The Department of Lands three months ago issued a notice offering £5 10s. 0d. per ton to the curers of kelp.  They will have to give another 30/- per ton if they want to get the work done.  I do not think that £5 10s. 0d. per ton is an economic price.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that there are sufficient seed oats in County Wexford to supply the needs of the farmers.  The constituency which the Minister and I represent will not stop at doing 12½ per cent. tillage. There is a great scarcity of seed oats in Wexford, and I should like to ask if the farmers can have an assurance that they will not be robbed when buying seed oats.  After the last threshing the farmers sold oats at 13/- and 14/- a barrel, and I think the price of seed oats will now be at least twice that price.  I ask the Minister to see that the farmers will get good seed oats and also that they will get <Col N="2260" /> their share of fertilisers.  Artificial manures are very scarce in that constituency. The people there do not order them until a week or two before they want them, and this year they may find themselves without any.  It would be a good thing if some advice were given to these people to look after their fertilisers in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, have had some consolation out of this debate to-night.  For the last four years, we have been subjected to ridicule because we have dared to talk about making the country self-sufficient as far as it is possible to do it. To-night it is the other way about. We are blamed by the Opposition because we did not go fast enough.  However, there is some consolation for us in that time has justified our policy, and the only grievance now is that we have not gone fast enough.  The only thing I want to say to the Minister is that tillage is being taken up very generally as far as I can see.  There will be a large amount of land ploughed up for grain crops and, in my opinion, unless fertilisers are available, the return will not be what it should be.  As to the statement that there is a tariff on foreign superphosphates coming in here, I know the argument can be used that there are about 200 people engaged in the manufacture of manures here. But there are many thousands of people engaged in agriculture, and the return from the land that will be broken up this year has got to be taken into consideration.  Therefore I would appeal to the Minister that if any superphosphate can be brought in here from any place, it is essential in the interests of the agriculturists to have it allowed in.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Victory has intervened in this debate in the way he has.  I am sorry that other members of the Fianna Fáil Party had not thought fit to intervene in the same way.  Other Deputies of that Party understand the condition of things down the country.  Deputy Victory knows perfectly well that if we are going to have increased tillage in this country, and if we cannot get adequate supplies of manure we are <Col N="2261" /> going to rob the land.  It is about 12 months ago since a motion was put down on this side of the House for a Commission on Agriculture.  I was the first speaker and the Minister for Agriculture spoke after me.  As a matter of fact he agreed to grant the commission. The germ of my contribution at that time was to provide artificial manure for the lands.  Deputy Victory supported me.  He realised the importance of my suggestion.  But the Minister did not see it and apparently he has not even yet seen it.  I endeavoured to point out that the salvation of this country was to be found in greater agricultural production.  I tried to impress on the Minister and upon the House as far as I could that artificial manures ought to be heavily subsidised. I did not anticipate at any time that a subsidy such as is suggested here would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the situation at all. I really do not think the proposed subsidy is any use now.  It is no encouragement to the use of artificial manures by the farmers.  The difference between £5 and £5 10s. is not enough.  I said then that the subsidy first granted and now continued only cheapened the manure to the man buying it.  It did not induce the man to buy any larger quantities.  That is not the way to tackle a big question.  We had money for alcohol factories.  We put practically £500,000 into bogs down the country.  That is all gone waste.  If we only had put this money into artificial manures we would have a different country to look at now.  We would have made a good investment in the soil for years to come.  I thought that after the settlement of the Economic War, Fianna Fáil would rise to the occasion and my aim was that by the use of artificial manures the man who previously had been able to rear six calves would thereby be able to rear eight.  Had this country provided £2,000,000 for artificial manures no better investment could have been found because it was something that would remain there and give a return year after year.  Now we are having an extension of the 10/- per ton subsidy in this particular Estimate.  My opinion again is that that is not going to encourage <Col N="2262" /> anybody to use more artificials. Deputy Victory has said, and I am informed that it is true, that the Minister has informed the importers of manure into this country that the Government will not pay a subsidy on foreign manures.  The farmers of this country will consequently be deprived of the use of manures for their crops. This Government is guilty of many crimes against the country.  If the Minister were now to make another grant outside the original subsidy which he is giving to the Irish manure firms&mdash;even if he were to pay absolutely for the manure out of the Public Funds&mdash;he would be justified in doing so.  Attempting to grow crops in this country without the aid of artificial manure is robbing the land.  We are taking plant food out of the land, and giving nothing back.  The Minister is here making a further provision for agricultural schools and farms to the extent of £5,500.  That is the additional provision made for these five schools and farms.  There is indeed in this figure clear evidence of the increase in costs in the running of the farms.</P>

I am very glad to hear that in the case of the Minister's farms the costs have not gone up.  I would be glad to hear if the Minister is going to live up to the Agricultural Wages Board's awards for labourers, will the costs go up, and if he is to buy manures and seeds will the costs go up.  Unless the Minister has curtailed his activities his costs must go up.  I was trying to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that costs everywhere are going up and here is evidence of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well I think there is pretty clear evidence of it for the Minister that they are going up. When providing an additional £2,600 for travelling expenses the Minister explained how this expenditure has arisen.  He said this was in connection with officers who had been seconded to the Department.  I had an idea that the Department of Agriculture had increased its staff enormously in the last eight years.  Now, when agricultural production in this country was valued at over £60,000,000, the administration cost was much less than it has been lately.  I had thought if an occasion like this arose that the Minister would possibly utilise some of those people whose services he had engaged some years ago when agriculture was on the low grade.  It appeared to me that he would have utilised them for the purpose of the extra tillage, instead of taking officials over from another Department at further expense.  I think Deputy Corry, one of the Minister's colleagues, was of the same opinion at one time.  I remember when this House passed some Acts in connection with the inspection of beef, it fixed a price for beef, but that Act was never operated. There was a number of inspectors appointed under that Act.</P>

      <P>They are not at that job because that job did not &ldquo;go&rdquo; at all.  Nevertheless, we paid for it. Now, when we do want extra inspectors we have to provide extra expenses.  The Minister should realise that the most important thing with regard to tillage is manure, and he should take the advice given him from these benches and from his own back benches and remove the tariffs and other difficulties that are operating against the delivery of manure.  Unless he does that, we shall not get anywhere.  A very good case was made by Deputy Hughes and other Deputies regarding the agreement with Britain.  I do not think that it is satisfactory or that a satisfactory state of affairs exists with regard to pigs or any of these other products. On a later occasion, I hope to thrash out the whole matter, and I trust the Minister will be able to put a better face upon it than it bears at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this question of manures, I believe that, even if the tariff were removed, supplies would not be available and that there is a good deal of exaggeration about the matter. Eventually, this question will have to be dealt with, and I suggest that, where possible, lime should be made available through the creameries in certain areas.  A scheme should be devised whereby the creameries would co-operate with kiln owners in the congested areas in certain counties.  A scheme of that type would be well worthy of consideration, especially as, as time goes on, there will be a greater shortage of artificial manures.  It will be a question of obtaining them at any cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of cheap seed in congested areas. People down our way were keenly disappointed at the action of the Department in the allocation of seed in these areas.  The deprivation of cottiers in the Gaeltacht districts of their usual allocation of cheap seed was commented upon.  Heretofore these allocations worked out satisfactorily and the cottiers had the benefit of the scheme. To our amazement, this year these <Col N="2265" /> people were deprived of the usual supply and some explanation should be forthcoming in regard to that matter. In South Kerry and along the south coast these smallholders&mdash;particularly cottiers&mdash;were deprived of any quota or allocation of cheap seed whatsoever. Even now, I think the Minister should consider some means of assisting these people.</P>
    <P>On this question of the development of the creamery system, I am glad to say that, in our areas, the development of travelling creameries has been a success.  The experiment has justified itself, and we have made a case for further development in some of these areas.  I cannot understand the statement of the Department that, even though a case can be made for further development, the question is one of money&mdash;a question as to whether or not the creamery can be built at a certain cost.  That is very shortsighted policy.  It is not what one would expect from the Department.  For instance, in an area where there is a cow population of, approximately, 1,800, the Department would hesitate to build a creamery, or ask the Department of Finance to approve the expenditure on account of the cost.  I think that there is something radically wrong with the whole system if development is to be held up simply because £500 or £600 cannot be provided for the building of a travelling creamery for such an area.  I know that the Minister has done his best in that direction, but I again appeal to him to consider the urgency of that scheme.  In conclusion, I want to mention again the question of the fertilisers.  The creameries should endeavour to get the co-operation of the kiln-owners in order to make lime available in the congested districts.  In the event of a severe shortage of artificial manures, lime would be a fairly good substitute.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £300,000 makes, with the amount provided in the original Estimate&mdash;£500,000&mdash;a sum of almost £1,000,000 available for the purposes of agriculture.  I am sure that, if that money be wisely and usefully spent, it will yield a very good return.  We <Col N="2266" /> must all agree that, in the difficult times through which we are passing, agriculture is the one industry on which we must absolutely depend.  For that reason, I agree that it is only right and proper that the responsible Minister should do all he possibly can to help that industry.</P>
      <P>Various sub-heads go to the making of this Supplementary Estimate.  I am not going to deal with them seriatim. I propose to refer only to two of them. There is a Vote of £50,000 for fertilisers. That money should be very useful at the present time.  The pity is that the amount is not greater.  I gathered from the Minister's opening remarks that this sum will enable the farmers to procure fertilisers at 10/- per ton less than they would otherwise have to pay.</P>
      <P>In connection with the question of supplies of fertilisers, I understand that the great danger will be a shortage of superphosphates, and I should like the Minister to give all the attention he can possibly give to the question of ensuring that a proper supply of that particular fertiliser will be available for our farmers.  I find that the bulk of this Supplementary Estimate is taken up with the provision of butter for winter requirements, and so on. The amount, in that connection, is something over £300,000.  I think that, again, that money will give a very good return.  Heretofore, during the summer months, we were in the fortunate position of being able to supply the British market, but unfortunately, when the winter months came along, we were not in a position to keep up that supply, and, as a result, we lost a very considerable portion of the British market to the Danes, who, by their fostering of the winter dairying, were in a position to keep up their supplies of butter to the British market all the year round.  I think that the provision of this sum is a step in the right direction.  If this Vote for over £300,000 will enable our farmers to increase their butter production and thereby enable them to keep the market for our butter, not alone in the summer months, but during the winter months, it will have a good reaction upon the whole industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2267" /> While I think that it is necessary that we should help this branch of agriculture&mdash;that is, in connection with creameries and the dairying industry generally&mdash;I also think it is only right and proper that the Minister should bear in mind that there is a danger that the result of this might mean an undue rise in the price of butter to the consumers here and that, thereby, a hardship might be imposed upon the consuming portion of our own population.  I think the Minister should bear in mind that there are over 100,000 unemployed people in this country at the moment and that, besides these unemployed people, there is also a very large number of people whose incomes provide them with only the barest necessaries of life.  If there should be any increase in the price of such an essential foodstuff as this, I hope the Minister will bear in mind that even the slightest increase would mean a great hardship on these people.</P>
    <P>I should like to issue that warning on this occasion, in the hope that the Minister, in making this provision, will take care that it will not increase unduly the price of butter to our consumers and thereby increase unduly the hardships already existing among very large sections of our people who at the present time find it very difficult to make ends meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this fertiliser scheme, I think it is a very useful proposal.  A situation, however, has arisen in the West, in this connection, which, I think, has been brought to the notice of the Minister already, and in any case I wish to bring it to the Minister's notice now.  This subsidy is very useful to people who are able to pay cash down, but in the present circumstances in the West I understand that merchants are not inclined to give manures out on credit; it has to be cash down, and they will not even accept the guarantee of the sugar company.  If something is not done to remedy that situation, it will have very serious consequences for the beet sugar factories, particularly in the West, and I think it would be very detrimental to the scheme generally.  I should like <Col N="2268" /> the Minister to take this matter up so as to ensure, at any rate, that, where the guarantee of the Sugar Company is given, a sufficient supply of fertilisers for the beet crop should be made available. Otherwise, the acreage under beet will go down.  I have been listening all the day to the same swan song from Opposition Deputies that I have been listening to for the past seven or eight years.  It is always the same kind of talk that goes on, and it is always to the effect that the Minister's policy has been a whole series of blunders.  I am just wondering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As a matter of fact, I believe that there will be very little necessity, if any necessity at all, to invoke the Compulsory Tillage Order.  I believe that the people will go wholeheartedly in for tillage because they see that it will pay them and because they realise fully that the policy of the past seven or eight years is the best policy for this country.</P>

      <P>On this side of the House we are always very glad of small mercies.  To my mind, this kind of Supplementary Estimate in connection with agriculture is nothing more than tinkering with a huge problem, and I believe that we must take a brave and bold decision in connection with this matter, that we must forget about past programmes and policies and face the situation that exists, which is more or less desperate.  What we want here in this country for agriculture is money.  We hear a lot about the provision of fertilisers, machinery, agricultural implements and so on.  To my mind, however, every farmer wants something different from what his neighbour wants.  One man wants a horse, one man wants machinery, and another man wants manures.  They all have different needs, and I think that the farmer could solve his own problem if we put money into the farmer's hands.  He knows how to solve his <Col N="2269" /> problems, if he has the money, and I think that we should float a loan of at least £4,000,000 in order to put agriculture on its feet.  I think that the farmer is entitled to that because of the huge losses he has suffered within the last ten years.  I do not think that this loan should be given out through officials or Government servants, but that it should be floated as a loan in the ordinary way so as to pay the land annuities to the Land Commission for two or three years, thereby leaving the farmer free to have the money, which he used to pay for annuities, to enable him to work his land.  In my opinion, that would save a good deal of overhead expenses and would give immediate relief to the farmer.  It would mean that the farmer would know where he stood and that he would know what machinery to buy, and so on. There is another way to save agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I think that that would solve the whole problem.  There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  If the war lasts for a long time everything will probably be all right as far as the farmer is concerned, but if the war should terminate in eight or nine months' time, as it may, where is the farmer going to be, with the huge amount of grain crops that he will then have on hands?  If that should happen, he may make bonfires out of his corn, straw, and so on.  I think that the Minister should guarantee against that happening by boldly taking his courage in his hands and going to Britain and arranging for a guarantee to the farmer against such huge losses as happened in 1918 at the close of the last war.  If the Minister does not do something like that, I think there is very little hope in us floundering along as we <Col N="2270" /> are to-day.  I think that the Minister, for once in his life, should beard John Bull in his own den and make an arrangement such as I have suggested, and I think that the Minister, if he were to do so, would be a match for John Bull.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to keep the House more than two or three minutes, but having seen this figure of £50,000 for fertilisers, I should like to ask the Minister whether it would be possible for him to increase that amount still further in view of the desperate necessity of this country at the present time for a far greater volume of fertilisers.  I was looking through figures for the yield of crops during the last war, and I think it is well that the House should recall the fact that the yield of wheat fell from 21 cwts. per acre to 15 cwts. per acre; that, in the course of the war, oats fell from 18.4 to 13, and potatoes from 6 to 4, indicating that the sudden intensive production of crops had its adverse reaction.  Although much more land was tilled by the end of the war, the land was yielding far less.  That picture may not repeat itself in exactly the same way during this war, but I have an idea that to a certain degree the yield of crops may decline as a result of rushing into tillage in the way that is necessary on account of the war situation.  One of the things that can stem that decline is fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have one of the lowest consumptions of fertilisers of any of the western European countries having principally an agricultural trade.  We spend, as far as I can make out, about 1/4 per acre of land in fertilisers.  Having regard to modern conditions and modern agricultural methods, that is fantastically small.  I use the word &ldquo;fantastically&rdquo; advisedly and deliberately.  It is really a fantastically small amount, 1/4 an acre.  It is a terribly serious thing to face the present emergency with that fact confronting us.  We have never reached anything like an adequate consumption of fertilisers at any time, either during the period of office of this Administration or the last one. Other countries have a far greater consumption of fertilisers than we have. <Col N="2271" /> There is the fact that on the outbreak of this war we had that abnormally low consumption as compared with other countries.  I find, as a matter of fact, that we consume about one hundredth the amount of nitrates that are consumed in England.  In the consumption of superphosphates we are the lowest of a number of countries, including Iceland, Denmark, Holland, England and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>I should like to plead with the Minister to take us into his confidence as far as possible and assure us that the most desperate efforts are being made to secure extra shipments of fertilisers, and that he will consider, if he possibly can, increasing the subsidy.  I believe that if we could have an agreed financial position in this country, if we asked depositors in the banks, or the banks themselves, to advance credits for the purchase of fertilisers, they would be willing to grant loans running into millions of pounds to enable us to give subsidies totalling practically 75 per cent. of the cost of the fertilisers, and it would be one of the finest investments that this country could possibly have.  I would once more plead earnestly with the Minister to let us know exactly what the position is.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the question of veterinary research. I also would like to call the Minister's attention to that, and to urge the need for it in a country like this, where there is such an enormous amount of live stock.  Not only is it important, but I think a step further should be taken by arranging with professional men to deliver a series of well-thought out lectures with a view to spreading knowledge and thus preventing the many diseases that live stock suffer from.  The loss that the country sustains in that respect was put by some Deputies here at £4,000,000.  I went to some trouble to prepare a rough estimate myself, and I am sorry to say that my estimate exceeds the £4,000,000 figure mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  My estimate is based on figures obtained from kennels and knackers' yards, and on the information I obtained I have put the loss at about £5,000,000. That is a very serious thing.  All these losses were not directly due to disease. Quite a number of them might be attributed to malnutrition.  It is true to say that veterinary surgeons have no remedy for that disease but, at the same time, by their advice, they can do a good deal.  Much of this mal-nutrition, it appears, arises from the <Col N="2274" /> feeding of crops, raised on very poor soil, to live stock.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the plea made by other Deputies that more artificial manures should be made available.  If more were used, they would help to improve the quality of the soil.  A good deal of this malnutrition may be due to the fact that the soil is deteriorating.  The matter, at any rate, is one that should get serious consideration from the Minister, not alone at this time but at ordinary times.  Everything possible should be done to improve the quality of the soil, because where you have a good soil you will have healthy animals, and that will have its effects on human beings as well.  We are all agreed in advocating more production. If a more generous use of artificial manures will bring about more production and give us healthier live stock, then I feel that I must join in the request to the Minister to look seriously into the matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to seeds and manures, Deputy Dillon gave his own experience of the amount of manures which he hopes to receive from the Irish manufacturers.  I think he will be lucky if he gets 100 per cent. of the quantity he received last year.  So far as I know, the position at the moment is that about 50 per cent. had been sent out up to about two weeks ago, the third 25 per cent. is in process of being sent out, and probably will be supplied to the trade by the end of March.  I am doubtful, in our present position, if the remaining 25 per cent. will be supplied in full.  I have not much fault to find with this debate, but I think we should try to understand one another's difficulties if we hope to make any progress in dealing with the problems that we are up against.  There is no use in the Opposition accusing us of doing things in the wrong way unless they have a fair foundation for their statements.  The present position with regard to manures <Col N="2275" /> has not arisen through want of energy on the part of the Government.  The raw phosphates were purchased by our manufacturers.  They purchased very much more than they did last year, but the whole difficulty has been to get them over here&mdash;to get shipping.</P>
      <P>As far as the Government are concerned, they have done everything possible to get shipping to bring these raw phosphates across from North Africa.  They are there at the moment. They had already been purchased by our Irish manufacturers, but it is extremely doubtful if we will get these raw phosphates moved in sufficient quantity by ship to deal with this year's crop.  Everything possible is being done, and I only hope that things may turn out better than we can foresee at the moment.  With regard to getting manufactured phosphates in from other countries, I do not know if we can get very much.  I do not see that there is any great objection now to the removal of the duty, but there are certain formalities that must be gone through before that can be done. I hope that we may be able to get the duty removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care how late it is.  What happens is this: that a merchant here will get in touch with a merchant in Holland, Belgium or elsewhere and ask if he can supply him with some phosphates.  The merchant will say that he will sell at such a price.  But when it comes to exporting those phosphates, the merchant is faced with two big obstacles.  The first is, will the Government of that country allow the phosphates out.  I may say that very few Governments are allowing phosphates out at the present time. I am doubtful if Belgium or Holland will let phosphates out.  The second <Col N="2276" /> obstacle is that, suppose the Government in that country does let them out, will a ship be available to bring them over here?  I do not know that the fact that a tariff is there prevented phosphates coming in here.  Deputy Dillon, for instance, spoke of British exporters who might be willing to keep up their connection here.  There is no tariff on phosphates coming in from Great Britain so that there was no difficulty in that regard.</P>

      <P>We had agreed to pay the bounty on phosphates going into the County Donegal, but found that could not be arranged through the ordinary trade channels.  The traders in Donegal could not get phosphates into Donegal from the Six Counties without Government intervention.  This Government had to intervene and use whatever influence it had with the other two Governments concerned in order to get that small transaction through.  It was found extremely difficult to get even a limited amount of phosphates shifted from the Six Counties into the County Donegal.  I do not know if it would be possible to get phosphates from Great Britain into the rest of this country.  It was only on the plea that a normal trade was there for generations from Derry into Donegal, and that, if that trade was not permitted to go on during those war years Donegal would be put to very serious inconvenience, that it was possible to get that much done.  I presume the exporters in Derry were at the same time using the argument that they did not want to lose that trade in Donegal. But, even with all that pressure, it was not very easy to get the thing made effective.</P>

Whatever criticism we have had to stand here in the past from the Opposition, I say now that we were perfectly and fully justified in keeping those manure manufacturers in production, if it were only for the sake of having them there when a war situation like this arises, as we may be short of fertilisers any time.  We are not using nearly as much as we should. We may be short of the amount that our farmers are prepared to use at present prices, but we would not have had anything like the present quantity were it not for the position of the home manufacturers.</P>

      <P>The same applies to the foundries of the agricultural machinery manufacturers.  If any of these had gone out of production it would be extremely difficult to get any agricultural machinery at the moment.  We have been able to import certain types of agricultural machinery such as tractors &mdash;some of the types not manufactured here&mdash;but we have been very limited in the amount of the shipping that can be put aside for that purpose.  If we were in the position of having to import all the agricultural machinery, we certainly would be left there.  I do not think it is necessary at all to defend these tariffs on the basis of employment given by the individual agricultural machinery firms or manure manufacturing firms.  I think they can be defended just as easily from the point of view of the agricultural industry, as, unless we have these industries to supply the agricultural industry, the agricultural industry not only in time of war&mdash;although then it is very badly off&mdash;but also in time of peace may be exploited just as badly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also spoke regarding cold stored butter.  I must say that I have not get any complaint from any source regarding any of our cold stored butter.  I remember that, when we went into this business first, we were assured &mdash;not only by experts in the Department but also by people in the trade&mdash;that butter, if properly put into cold store, improves rather than disimproves as a result of its being kept there.  I think that any Deputy who has gone into a hotel or restaurant in this city during the last two months has been all the time getting cold stored butter, and so far it seems that nobody has found any fault with it.  It is quite possible that Deputy Dillon has come across some particular sample of butter which was not altogether right and we would be very glad in the Department to have that traced up, in order to see to whom it belonged or what creamery turned it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2279" /> Deputy Dillon raised a few points about proprietary articles of medicine, the first one being &ldquo;Acapron&rdquo;, one of the Bayer products.  It is not to be got now, but I understand that the firm is making a strong endeavour to have this manufactured in America and, if they succeed, we would be able to get supplies again.  We will be very lucky if we can get those supplies before the summer, since &ldquo;Acapron&rdquo; is regarded as specific in the treatment of red water disease in cattle.  With regard to prontosils, which have proved so very useful in the treatment of streptococci in the human being, and also of staphycoccal infections, they have been used for mastitis, which is streptococcal disease in the cow, but it is found that they must be used in very large quantities and almost constantly and, although they are effective when used in large quantities and constantly, it is uneconomic because the quantity is so large.  That has been learned from the experiments carried on in other countries, as naturally the veterinary people here keep in touch with research elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Our veterinary surgeons here have carried on experiments with one of the group of prontosils&mdash;sulphanilanide&mdash; which was supposed to be a specific remedy for brucilla abortus, the principal organism in this country causing contagious abortion.  This particular drug was used on cattle and similar animals in the laboratory, but so far the results have been entirely negative and very disappointing.  We do research in the laboratory here, and in the veterinary college a certain amount of it is carried on.  It is impossible for any country to do all the research that would be necessary, but, if we do our part and keep in touch with other countries, it is all that can be expected of us.  We have been trying for some few years past to devote a little more, not only money but also men, to this very important subject of research, and it is possible that we may be able to do a little more in the near future. We had expected when enlarging the veterinary college&mdash;enlarging both staff and premises&mdash;that it would be possible to do more research there, and I think <Col N="2280" /> it will from this out when the staff has been suitably increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also asked about the principal of the veterinary college. Last July, I think, the principal of the veterinary college reached the age limit under which civil servants retire, and a certain extension was agreed to by the Minister for Finance until we got the college going again.  The principal is, as Deputies are aware, the professor of surgery.  A case was then put up to the Civil Service Commissioners to recommend a candidate for appointment as professor of surgery.  That appointment has not been made yet, but may be made, I understand, in the near future.  The procedure would be, of course, when a professor of surgery is appointed, Professor O'Connor would resign and a new principal would be elected in his stead.</P>

We had two veterinary surgeons for about six months doing experiments under the direction of the Research Department.  They got a good deal of information.  I think that is all we can claim that they got, because they did not get any useful results, but we cannot blame the professional men who were on this job, considering that every other country is also trying to get results and has not succeeded so far.</P>

      <P>They did from time to time.  There has not been anything published lately, anyway.  Another matter raised, I think, by Deputy O'Reilly, was that, in addition to this, lectures should be given.  I believe that very useful lectures were given by veterinary surgeons travelling around from place to place some years ago, and we have been urged for some time to try to have that system reestablished. We are at the moment seeking the necessary finance to have that done, and I hope that we may be able to revert to that system of having lectures from time to time through the country, at which the farmers could attend, and where veterinary surgeons specially suited for the purpose would give the farmers lectures on veterinary subjects, making them, of course, as intelligible as possible for laymen.  It is not an easy thing to get a professional man who knows his business well and who at the same time can make the subject plain and intelligible to the person who has no scientific claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to onions, I must say I am not convinced from any reports I have got from the technical staff in the Department that artificial heat will be necessary to cure onions even for the purpose of keeping them for a long time.  They have been doing experiments in storing in different types of stores, with regard <Col N="2282" /> to ventilation and so on, and I think it may be possible to have those onions stored in rather a simple way, while ensuring that they will keep quite well.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan advocated the saving of a certain amount of flax seed in addition to the pure line seed we may save under the special scheme which I mentioned, because he was afraid we might possibly find ourselves in an even more difficult position next year than this year, and might be very glad to have our own seed.  That is a matter which I will certainly look into. He believes that loans should be made available, especially for the equipment of mills.  There is a sub-head in the main Estimate which has not been availed of to any great extent.  I think it is under sub-head M (4) that loans could be made to scutch mills for improvements and so on.  The Deputy complained also that the Vote for reclamation and drainage in congested districts is not sufficient.  That may be so.  I think we would all like to see as much as possible spent under this particular heading.  I must say I have never yet met anybody who criticised that scheme for the reclamation of land in congested districts.  The smallholder gets a grant of £5 per acre for the reclamation of the land, and in the following year gets a grant for the liming of that land, and something towards seeds and manures, and he has a really valuable addition to his little holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan seemed to be under the impression that in certain cases in West Cork, where co-operative creameries are in competition with proprietary creameries, the Department was compelling the co-operative creameries to go into competition with the proprietary creameries.  That is not the position.  The position really is that the Dairy Disposals Board, which, of course, is working under the Department, or reporting to the Department anyway, has been endeavouring to buy out the remaining proprietary creameries but has not been able to get agreement in regard to price.  As Deputies will recollect, a great deal was done in the buying out of those creameries at the beginning of 1927.  A great deal was done in the <Col N="2283" /> first two or three years; then it tailed off, and it is very slow work to get the last few of those creameries bought out.  Those co-operative creameries in the area were continuously complaining that the Dairy Disposals Board and the Department and the Minister for Agriculture were not using pressure on the proprietary creameries to make them sell.  I explained to them several times that I did not think the time had come when pressure should be used.</P>
    <P>I thought we might eventually get voluntary agreement with regard to the sale of those creameries.  Then those co-operative creameries insisted as far as they could that, if we did not force the proprietary creameries to sell out, they should get licences to operate in opposition to them.  That was eventually agreed to, and licences were issued to the co-operative creameries to build creameries in the areas that had so far been controlled by those proprietary creameries, but that is a very different story from the impression that Deputy O'Donovan seemed to have that we had been urging those co-operative creameries to go into competition.  We really were not urging them.  In fact, we had prevented them, if you like, for three or four years by not issuing the necessary licences.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, because it is an analogous point.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to a certain incident with regard to a proprietary concern in West Cork. I do not want to mention names any more than Deputy Cosgrave.  There was a certain proprietor there, a small proprietor, who was offered a price by the Dairy Disposals Board some years ago.  I think it was probably eight or nine years ago, if not more.  The price was not accepted, and no agreement was made between the Dairy Disposals Board and this particular proprietor. The negotiations broke down, and they were not revived for many years.  Then after some years the negotiations again started between the two parties, but again the negotiations broke down and no agreement could be reached.  Some time after that, this proprietor ceased to carry on business.  He more or less <Col N="2284" /> went out of business as a creamery proprietor, but he did carry on a certain amount of factory butter manufacture. His premises were no longer regarded as a creamery, but were regarded only as a factory for the manufacture of butter.  At that stage two co-operative creameries asked for a licence; each wanted permission to build a branch near the place where this proprietor had his premises, and after due consideration the Department recommended me to issue a licence to A.  I believe it was more A's territory than B's.</P>
    <P>At that stage B came along and said to this proprietor: &ldquo;If we had got the licence we would have given you £1,500.&rdquo;  Of course A were under no obligation to give this proprietor any thing.  They were not buying his business; they were merely building in an area where a number of farmers had asked them to come in as a co-operative society, but when I heard of the case I asked co-operative A if they would, <i>ex gratia</i>, give this man something, because with his goodwill naturally they would get more business than if operating against him, and they did agree to give an <i>ex gratia</i> amount.  I do not know what the amount was. Deputy Cosgrave knows, I think, what the amount was but he thought the amount was very small.</P>
    <P>With regard to this agreement that was made with the British Government, we may debate that perhaps at another time because it does not, I think, fit into this debate very well.  I would like Deputies, however, to realise this: In the first place, I think, I may say that it is not only extremely difficult but impossible for our farmers to get more for their produce on the British market than the British farmers are getting.  In the case of bacon, sheep, mutton and lamb and a number of other products that is what they are getting.  The two big exceptions to that are fat cattle and eggs.  In the case of fat cattle, during these negotiations we did make every endeavour to get the same price as the British farmer was getting for his fat cattle, but the British Government did insist and continue to insist that they should maintain <Col N="2285" /> the element of subsidy that was there for the British farmer.  That in the end was the result.  In the case of eggs, if we find that our eggs will reach the maximum price, in other words, if we find that the consumers in Great Britain are prepared to give the maximum which is fixed for our eggs, then I think we will have a very strong case to go back to Britain and say that the maximum was not high enough but, so long as the price given by the consumer there is below the maximum fixed for our eggs I do not think we have any great case to go to the British Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the agreement made with Northern Ireland, I foresaw that if the price we got in Northern Ireland was favourable compared with Great Britain a certain amount of our trade would be diverted to Northern Ireland. On the other hand, if the price we got in Northern Ireland was not as favourable as it should be compared with Great Britain, then the farmers who live on the Border, in Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, and so on, who have been accustomed to send most of their goods to Northern Ireland, would be victimised because they would not get what they should if there was no control whatever.  It was an extremely difficult matter.  We considered it very fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price in the North of Ireland.  In the end, in regard to the prices that were arranged, I think I agree with Deputy Hughes to some extent that they were a bit favourable to the North, but if you put one thing against the other I think Deputy Hughes, if he were in my place, would say that it is not fair to victimise the farmers of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan by fixing them too accurately, and that if there is going to be any mistake it is better they should get a little more than a little less.  That is the position.</P>

We get reports regularly from all our inspectors through the country, and as far as we can judge from these reports I think there should be no shortage of seed.  As I said here before, it may happen that in individual districts a farmer who is a bit late with his crop may have to change from barley to oats or from Spring wheat to oats or from oats to Spring wheat.  I think that a farmer need have no worry.  He will get some cereal seed in the end, sufficient for his land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is supplied to the congested districts.  Deputy Brennan is quite wrong when he says that I did not realise the importance of this question of artificial manures.  I think there is really no question to which I and the Minister for Supplies have given so much time, and to which the officials of my Department have given so much <Col N="2289" /> time.  As I explained already, the whole trouble is shipping.  I do not know whether we will be able to do anything better next year.  We probably will try to commence bringing the manure in at a much earlier date and, as soon as the season is over, commence bringing it in again.</P>

      <P>Deputy Beegan spoke on the question of artificial manures and said that merchants in the West were not inclined to give credit.  He spoke in particular about beet-growers.  I have discussed that question with some of the officials of the Sugar Company.  I am not sure if we can get a very good solution of the matter, but at least we have not lost sight of it.  Deputy Childers says, quite truly, that the people of this country are very poor users of artificial manures.  He says, in fact, that our consumption is the lowest among civilised countries.  I am not sure whether that is true.  Perhaps it is, but I think Deputy Childers should not assume that the falling yields in the last war were entirely due to lack of artificial manure.  I think they might be attributed to other causes.  Towards the end of the last war, people tilled their land very unwillingly.  I am quite sure that if you compare the crop secured by a good tillage farmer who tills his field well, who prepares a good seed bed and sows his corn in that, with the crop secured by a man who only half tills his land and who puts a good dressing of artificial manure on it, probably the good tillage farmer would get a far greater yield.  He has paid more attention to tilling the land properly than to putting artificial manure on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The good seed bed was completely absent in many cases in the last war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  It is a bad conclusion to draw from the fact that yields were small, that we are poor users of artificial manures.  If I wished <Col N="2290" /> I could show that a small yield followed the extensive use of artificial manure in certain cases, and that therefore, no country should use artificial manures, but that would be a very wrong conclusion, too.  I think I have now dealt with all the points raised by Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has forgotten one point which I raised.  I directed attention to the fact that he had forbidden agricultural classes which the technical instructors were conducting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I meant to look up that point in the meantime. That is all I can say at the moment. There was a discussion between the technical branch of my Department dealing with education and the technical branch of the Department of Education, with a view to laying down certain principles.  Something might have happened arising out of that, but I should like to have an opportunity of going into the matter before making a statement about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Minister, on principle, would not prohibit technical schools from conducting evening classes in agriculture, if such a course tended to spread agricultural education in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we would. Certainly we would not prohibit it if they were able to do it with the county committee staff.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £10 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá <Col N="2291" /> de Mhárta, 1940, chun Conganta Airgid um Easportáil.</P>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for Export Subsidies.</P>
    <P>The first item, in fact the only item, in this Vote is £1,150.  That is made up of odds and ends of small subsidies that were payable in previous years but which were not exactly in order until now.  We found when we came to clear them off that we had not the Dáil authority to pay them.  If Deputies will look at note (a) they will see that &ldquo;The total savings on this Vote are estimated to amount to £345,000.  Of this sum £302,000 arises under sub-head A&rdquo;; that is for milk products.  The <Col N="2292" /> note goes on to say that &ldquo;provision for an equivalent expenditure on the payment of allowances in connection with the provision of butter for winter requirements, etc., is made by way of Supplementary Estimate under sub-head M (7) of Vote 52.&rdquo;  I explained already that we had to make most of our payments by way of production allowances.  That could not properly be done under the Export Subsidy Vote.  The only way we could do it was to pay it out of the Department of Agriculture Vote and have it voted by the Dáil, at the same time making the saving here.</P>

    <P>Vote reported and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until Friday, 1st March, at 10.30 a.m.</P>
