      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the names of the various commissions or committees of inquiry at present in existence, and who either have not yet reported, or whose report has not yet been published; and if he will state in respect of each, the date upon which the commission or committee was set up, when it is expected that (a) its report will be presented, and/or (b) its report will be made public.</P>

      <P>As the reply is somewhat lengthy, I will, with the Deputy's permission, circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is not concerned with the commissions or committees of a permanent or quasi-permanent character, such as the Irish Manuscripts Commission or the Central <Col N="2" /> Savings Committee or with departmental advisory bodies.  Subject to this assumption, the commissions or committees of inquiry at present in existence are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The Commission on Vocational Organisation, which was set up on 17th January, 1939, and is at present engaged in the taking of evidence.  I am unable to say when its report will be presented;</P>
    <P>(2)  The Commission of Inquiry into Land Drainage, which was set up on the 15th October, 1938, and presented an interim report in March, 1939.  The commission's final report has not yet been received, but it is understood to be in course of preparation.  It is not possible to indicate precisely when it will be presented;</P>
    <P>(3)  The Commission on Agriculture, which was set up on the 19th January, 1939, presented in August, 1939, an interim report on the pigs and bacon industries, which has been published, and within the last week sent in a <Col N="3" /> second interim report on silage which is under consideration.  Further inquiries are contemplated and it is, therefore, not possible to forecast when the commission's labours will end or what further reports will be presented;</P>
    <P>(4)  The Summer Time Committee, which was set up on the 6th March, 1940, has only commenced its inquiry and it is not possible to forecast when its report will be presented;</P>
    <P>(5)  The Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust Committee, which was set up on the 6th March, 1940, is expected to present its report in the near future;</P>
    <P>(6)  The Town Tenants' (Occupational Tenancies) Tribunal, which was set up on the 5th February, 1936, has not yet presented its report and it is not possible to say when it will do so;</P>
    <P>(7)  The Fruit and Vegetables Tribunal, which was set up on the 21st March, 1935, is expected to present its report within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The question of publishing the reports of these various bodies will be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>The payments to meet deficits in the accounts of voluntary hospitals have been made in respect of calendar years.  No such payments were made in respect of the year 1932.  Payments have not yet been made in respect of the year 1939.  For the years 1933 to 1938 the total payments were:</P>

The freight charges ruling from these different sources of supply account almost entirely for the difference in the increased prices of coal mentioned in the first part of the question.</P>

Where soldiers have not the requisite service for purposes of pension they are paid gratuities. These gratuities are based on a flat rate for each year of service irrespective of ordinary or additional pay, but in the case of long service <Col N="13" /> soldiers being discharged on grounds of age or disability the gratuity is calculated by reference to pay and additional pay provided that the soldier has been in receipt of such additional pay for a period of five years immediately preceding his discharge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is six months to a day since I introduced the Supplementary Budget, and though we have had many other major grounds for anxiety since then, I am happy to be able to inform the House and to congratulate the country that the revenue has shown an unexampled resilience despite the strain of adverse conditions.  This is due in part to the fact that the war in which our neighbours are involved has since November last pursued a course entirely different from that predicted either by the experts or by that legendary figure &ldquo;the man in the street&rdquo;.  Our import and export trade consequently did not suffer as seriously as was expected, and in the result our customs, excise and inland revenue yields proved satisfactory.  On 8th November last, in the light of all the <Col N="14" /> available data, it was estimated that if the then existing rates of duty were left unaltered the total yield of tax revenue, apart from motor vehicle duties, would be £1,550,000 less than the Budget Estimate of £25,320,000.  To offset this anticipated decline, I imposed additional taxation which was expected to yield £603,000, thus bringing the total tax revenue up to £24,373,000.  The yield to the Exchequer has, in fact, been £25,165,000, which, though below the original Budget Estimate of May last, is considerably in excess of the November expectations. Deputies must not rush to the conclusion that the extra taxation then imposed was unnecessary or excessive. It was unfortunately, as circumstances showed, only too necessary, because expenditure proved recalcitrant to all my efforts at reduction and the economies which I anticipated were, for reasons referred to later, not realised.</P>
      <P>In estimating the various heads of revenue we came near the mark in the great majority, the principal deviations occurring in regard to customs where the desire to replenish or add to stocks, to forestall rising prices or increased taxation, or to avoid subsequent scarcity was manifest in many directions.  The increased value per unit of the imports also added substantially to the yield of ad valorem duties, which, as Deputies are aware, are calculated on the landed price, including cost, insurance and freight.</P>
      <P>The total yield of customs was £10,579,000 as compared with a revised estimate last November of £9,653,000. This difference of £926,000 may, in the main, be explained as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motor cars, parts and accessories yielded £158,000 as against an anticipated £100,000; mineral hydrocarbon oils, £1,636,000 as against £1,470,000 anticipated.  In the beer and spirits group we have, I suppose, to thank the severe winter, in part at any rate, for an unexpected £250,000 in excess of the estimate, while tobacco was £35,000 better than we had hoped, and marked improvements were recorded in clothing and apparel and in piece <Col N="15" /> goods of all kinds&mdash;cotton, linen and wool.</P>
    <P>This frantic rush to lay in stocks will not be repeated; indeed, in many cases it cannot be repeated, and the yield of customs revenue in the coming year is bound to suffer under a number of heads, both by the existence of these large stocks and by inability to replenish them as they become exhausted.</P>
    <P>Exceptionally, sugar imports were disappointing, yielding only £593,000 against an expected £778,000.</P>
    <P>Coming to the excise side, a number of improvements were also noticeable, beer at £3,141,000 being £16,000 better than the estimate, though spirits at £1,735,000 were lower than we had expected by £185,000.  On home-made sugar the excise duty exceeded the estimate by £140,000, clearances being much higher than anticipated, just as those of imported sugar were much lower.  Home refiners of oil did not find their supplies of crude interfered with to the extent anticipated, and the yield of excise duty at £77,000 was £35,000 more than had been reckoned on.  Entertainments duty was £28,000 over the estimate, despite war conditions, but betting duty and dog licences both receded, being £6,000 and £5,000 respectively worse than the estimate. Whether there is any necessary relation between these two duties I do not pretend to know.</P>
    <P>On the inland revenue side, quite a number of declines are recorded on the revised estimates, estate, etc., duties being £157,000 down at £956,000; income-tax, surtax, corporation profits tax and excess profits duty (the last-named now nearly extinct) all showing trifling declines of about £10,000 in the aggregate.</P>
    <P>Motor vehicles duties showed up handsomely despite the higher price and reduced quantity of fuel available. The yield at £1,138,000 fell short of the estimate by only £27,000.  The motorists are stout-hearted and do not quail before a little taxation.  I do not propose to add to their burdens, which have not been lightened by recent increases in the price of petrol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> On the expenditure side I wish I had a more encouraging picture to present to the House.  The total issues for Central Fund and Supply Services amounted to £34,395,000, as compared with £33,110,000 in the year 1938-39&mdash; an increase of £1,285,000.</P>
    <P>Expenditure of an abnormal character on capital undertakings is, of course, included in the figures I have given but such elements are less for 1939-40 than originally estimated. The items which we set apart for borrowing usually comprise part of the Votes for Employment Schemes, Army, Public Works and Buildings and Afforestation.  As shown in Table I of the tables in connection with the Budget which are being circulated to Deputies to-day, in the case of afforestation alone has the actual borrowing been greater than that contemplated. In respect of airport construction, military buildings and defensive armaments it has been less.  It follows from this that of the aggregate expenditure mentioned above a much greater proportion is of the ordinary recurrent type which must be charged to revenue, so that, apart from the actual growth in the aggregate figures, the character of the expenditure has disimproved from the point of view of the Minister for Finance.  The result is seen in a deficit of £892,000 on the year's transactions, an amount equivalent to that by which the actual borrowings fell short of those anticipated. In the circumstances, I think it is, perhaps, not unfair to charge the deficit to borrowing inasmuch as by doing so we do not inflate the borrowing figure beyond that originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>The steady, and one might almost say relentless, growth of expenditure which has characterised Government operations in recent years, not only here but in all countries, is almost as disconcerting to a Minister for Finance as his inability to make any impression on it when the axe or the pruning hook is brought to bear.  In the course of my Statement on the Supplementary Budget, I felt confident that, profiting by the labours of the Economy Committee, I might curtail State outlay to the extent of some £400,000.  I was <Col N="17" /> bitterly attacked from many quarters for even suggesting this modest economy, and those Deputies who joined in the attack will, presumably, consider it a matter for congratulation that my ill-intentioned efforts did not succeed.</P>
    <P>While capital expenditure for defence purposes has been reduced below the estimate, recurrent expenditure on this service has risen considerably, due to increase in personnel, in personal allowances, transport costs, etc. Expenditure on the Army last year reached the high figure of £2,973,000, which was £1,206,000 in excess of that for the previous year, an increase of nearly 70 per cent.  All the Education Votes were up with the exception of Universities and Colleges and the National Gallery, which showed trifling declines.  Posts and Telegraphs, Agriculture and other important services also showed increases.  Public Works and Buildings were up by £203,000. The cost of Unemployment Assistance was higher by £132,000, in consequence of greater numbers and the more liberal rates of assistance given under the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1938.  Despite these adverse changes, the position of the Exchequer would not have disimproved to the actual extent shown had not the excess of recurrent expenditure on the Army been, because of the emergency situation, so unusually heavy.</P>
    <P>While the emergence of a deficit is definitely disconcerting in view of the additional taxation imposed in November last, Deputies will not deny that this is the common lot of Finance Ministers the world over in these times.  I do not wish to appear facetious on so grave a subject, but it was a phrase coined, I think, during the last depression that &ldquo;Budgets are being worn unbalanced this year&rdquo;. The fashion has come round again, but I hope it will not last.  Certainly I shall do my best to return to a more orthodox, if less fashionable, garb in the coming year.  Orthodoxy has, however, no appeal to me as such. When I was Minister for Local Government, I did not hesitate to strike out new paths in the realm of local government <Col N="18" /> finance.  I tackled housing, public health and other associated problems by methods and on a scale hitherto unattempted, and I can claim to have met with a fair measure of success.  Since I assumed office as Minister for Finance, it has been my object, in the course of the necessarily detailed study I have had to make of the many problems arising in the financial affairs of our country, to concern myself, in the first place, with ends rather than means and not to refuse the support of the public purse to schemes and projects which, on a strictly accountancy basis, could not be reckoned as profit-earning or revenue-producing. In this, I was largely following the enlightened policy of my predecessor, but with him, I recognise that, as the Majority Report of the Banking Commission pointed out, there are limits to the extent we can go in the creation of burdens, whether of a capital or a recurrent nature, which must, immediately or ultimately, fall upon the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The tables that have been circulated to Deputies show that, at 31st March last, the gross capital liabilities of the State amounted to £72,588,000, to which must be added £8,500,000, being the estimated capital value of the State liability in respect of housing, making a total of £81,088,000.  This represents an increase during the 12 months of £4,740,000, while capital assets rose at the same time from £38,630,000 to £40,900,000, an increase of £2,270,000.  Due to the repayment to the Exchequer by the Local Loans Fund, advances outstanding to that fund declined by, approximately, £2,000,000, but this did not in any way affect past or present loans from the fund as the necessary financing to meet the payment to the Exchequer was found entirely from other sources.  To the fund it meant merely the substitution of one form of indebtedness for another.</P>
    <P>A more important financial transaction during the year was the flotation of a public loan for £7,000,000. The flotation took the form, for the first time, of an issue of Exchequer Bonds, which were offered at par on <Col N="19" /> a four per cent. interest basis, maturing 1950-60.  Considering the circumstances of the time, this issue must be counted a success, a distinct success, indeed, if contrasted with the fate of similar issues made in various neutral European countries since the outbreak of war.  The result I attribute in large measure to the co-operation of the banks, to whose help in this matter I would like to pay tribute.  I feel that special mention should be made also of the assistance given by our leading companies and bodies of a religious or philanthropic character. The Bonds stand to-day at a premium over the issue price of 3½ points, which, allowing for interest accrued since 1st January, represents a net gain of two guineas to the investor.  This testifies in an undramatic but no less remarkable way to the confidence felt by the public in the economic and political stability of the State.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the estimated capital value of the State's liability in respect of borrowings by local authorities under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts and setting off the State's assets against total liabilities, the net deadweight Exchequer liability on 31st March last was £40,188,000, compared with £37,717,000 on 31st March, 1939.  This shows an increase in deadweight liabilities during last year of £2,471,000.  Of the latter amount, £1,180,000, or approximately 48 per cent., is due to the Government's assistance to the housing schemes carried out by local authorities.  The remainder of the increase in the net deadweight debt is due almost entirely to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) the borrowings during last year in respect of capital and abnormal items, i.e., expenditure on airports, defence, etc., amounting to £1,114,000, and</P>
    <P>(2) the deficit of £892,276 on last year's Budget, offset to the extent of £716,000 in respect of sinking fund operations and other capital transactions carried out during last year.</P>
    <P>I might add that the extra liability incurred is not entirely deadweight <Col N="20" /> since offsetting assets are created in the shape of airports, additional forest lands as well as certain public health works and miscellaneous development works financed from the Employment Schemes Vote.</P>
    <P>To get a true picture of the country's public debt, account must also be taken of the indebtedness of local authorities.  The latest complete figures on this head are for the year ended 31st March, 1939, on which date the gross indebtedness of local bodies amounted to £31,257,000 as against £28,179,000 at the 31st March, 1938. Allowing for the State's liability in respect of housing, which is included in this total, and for some other small adjustments, the net local debt outstanding on the 31st March, 1939, was £20,001,000 as compared with £18,380,000 on 31st March, 1938.  Making further allowance for the capital value of the portion of loan charges paid by tenants in houses provided by local authorities, the net deadweight indebtedness on 31st March, 1939, was £13,201,000 as compared with £12,028,000 on 31st March, 1938.  The total deadweight public debt of the State and local authorities combined at 31st March, 1939, was, therefore, £50,918,000.  Assuming an increase of about £1,000,000 in the net deadweight debt of local authorities during the year ended 31st March, 1940, the total deadweight public debt of the community on that date works out at, approximately, £54,250,000, and the gross capital liability at just over £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>I now come to deal with the matter of more immediate interest in to-day's proceedings, namely, our expenditure during the current year and the manner in which it is proposed to meet that expenditure out of revenue.  The latter will, of course, benefit by a full year's yield from the taxes imposed in the original and supplementary Budgets last year.</P>
    <P>The White Paper of Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure already furnished to Deputies shows that the total of the Estimates for Central Fund and Supply Services for the current <Col N="21" /> year is £35,584,000, while the total of tax and non-tax revenue at existing rates comes to £32,968,000.  My main task is to bridge this difference of £2,616,000.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Supplementary Budget in November last, I intimated that the standard rate of income-tax for the year beginning on 6th April, 1940, would be raised from 5/6 to 6/6 in the £.  The yield from the extra 1/- in the current year is estimated to come to £750,000.  This, added to the figure of £32,968,000 in the White Paper, brings our total revenue to £33,718,000, and the difference between expenditure and revenue is narrowed to £1,866,000.</P>
    <P>In response to numerous representations made with a view to increasing agricultural production, it is proposed to provide an extra £100,000 as a subsidy for the purchase of artificial manures in addition to the sum of £80,000 already provided for that purpose in the current year's Estimate for Agriculture.  This concession will, I hope, help to sweeten the element of compulsion associated with the tillage scheme.  While corn crops have largely gone into the ground, root crops, I understand, have still to be sown and the benefit accruing to farmers from this large additional provision should be considerable later on. We hope to get between 300,000 and 400,000 additional acres under the plough in the current year, and this should remedy, in part at any rate, the deficiency in imported foodstuffs as well as provide a more bounteous surplus for export.</P>
    <P>This substantial addition to the existing provision for Supply Services is made possible by an offsetting reduction, amounting to £125,000, in the Estimate for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance, as a result of a further scrutiny of the requirements in respect of unemployment assistance for the current year.</P>
    <P>It will be suggested that it should be feasible to effect savings on Supply Services in addition to that just mentioned. The total net provision in the <Col N="22" /> Estimates for these services in 1940-41 is £30,511,359.  The net provision in 1939-40, including Supplementary Estimates, was £31,422,626.  There is thus a reduction this year of £911,267.  As some critics object to the inclusion of Supplementary Estimates in the old year's figures when comparison is made with the new year, I shall compare the original net provision in 1939-40 wtih the current year's net provision. The original net figure in 1939-40 was £30,248,897, to which £370,000 was added in the Budget, and later provided by Supplementary Estimate, for Supplementary Agricultural Grant, making a new total of £30,618,897.  As compared with this latter figure, the 1940-41 provision is down by £107,538, admittedly a low figure, representing only one-third of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Provision for cost-of-living bonus on Civil Service salaries in the 1939-40 Estimates was based on an index figure of 75 for six months and 80 for six months.  In the 1940-41 Estimates provision for bonus is based on a figure of 85 for the whole year, involving an increase of roughly £150,000.  Allowing for this bonus addition and for the increase of £103,221 in the current year's Army Estimate, the other Supply Services are, therefore, down by £360,759 as compared with the original provision for 1939-40.  In the first Budget for 1939-40, £100,000 was taken off the Employment Schemes Vote, leaving a provision of £1,400,000, which is repeated this year.  Allowing for this deduction of £100,000, the various Supply Services, other than the Army, and apart from the cost-of-living bonus on Civil Service salaries, are down by £260,759 by comparison with the original provision for 1939-40.  This saving, if not very encouraging, is, at any rate, a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>On this question of bonus, it will be recalled that, when introducing the Supplementary Budget on the 8th November, I adverted to the danger to our economic position which would arise if increases in prices caused by war conditions were allowed to be reflected in wages, salaries and profits. I stated then that the Government had a duty to do everything in its power <Col N="23" /> to avert such a development and was determined to set its face against the efforts of any class to obtain compensation for the rise in prices at the expense of the community.  I also indicated that action to this end was contemplated with regard to all classes of public servants.  In the discussion on the Finance (No. 2) Bill on the 29th November last, I gave an assurance that, when the general position was clarified so far as the Civil Service was concerned, consultation with the service would take place before proceeding. I, accordingly, arranged a meeting on the 11th April between representatives of my Department and the staffs to afford the latter an opportunity of expressing their views on the question of stabilising the Civil Service bonus at the present figure of 85.</P>
    <P>The Government, in coming to its provisional decision to stabilise the bonus at the existing figure, was not unmindful of the fact that, generally speaking, since 1st April, 1922, the bonus figure showed a downward trend, which continued until 1st July, 1937, when it started to rise again, and that, during the period in which the bonus figure was falling, the remuneration of civil servants fell as a consequence. They benefited, however, from the fall in prices, which helped to re-establish the equilibrium of their family budgets, while those not on the maximum of their scales drew further benefit from increments.  Most other sections of the community suffered from contractions in income over the same period, and the Civil Service had no reason to complain.</P>
    <P>The position now is entirely different, by reason of the European war. My representatives, when they saw those of the Civil Service, pointed out that the effect of increases in prices being followed by increases in wages could only result in prices of commodities being forced up still further.  An artificial price structure would thus be built up which would inevitably collapse at the end of the war, if not before, leaving behind widespread unemployment and depression.  Those who remember the last war and its <Col N="24" /> economic aftermath are already familiar with the dangers of this kind of inflation.</P>
    <P>At the meeting to which I refer, the representatives of the civil servants contented themselves simply with demanding that the cost-of-living bonus arrangement should continue as if there were no emergency.  To that proposition I cannot agree for the reasons already stated.  Civil servants have fared rather well in having already received compensation in respect of a ten points increase in the cost of living since the European war began.  In that respect, they have been much more fortunate than the general body of the community. Members of the Civil Service, like other people, must recognise that these are exceptional times which call for some sacrifice and that no section or class of the community can be exempted from bearing a reasonable share of the burden.  Nothing more is being asked of the Service than what is reasonable.</P>
    <P>After hearing the views of the civil servants and further consideration of the matter, the Government feel that, in present circumstances, they would not be justified in allowing the cost-of-living bonus to rise above the present figure of 85, and it is proposed to take all necessary steps to implement that decision.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the question of economy, comparison is sometimes called for with the expenditure on Supply Services now and in 1931-32, and I am quite agreeable to that course.  For instance, the actual expenditure in 1931-32 on the following group of services, old age pensions, unemployment insurance, relief schemes, Land Commission and Department of Local Government and Public Health, amounted to £4,161,000.  The actual expenditure in 1939-40 on this group, with the addition of unemployment assistance and widows' and orphans' pensions, and with the substitution of employment schemes for relief schemes, was £9,390,000, and the estimated total for 1940-41 is £9,476,000.  There is, therefore, <Col N="25" /> an increase of £5,250,000 in respect of this group of social services.  Rather drastic economies were suggested in regard to some of this group and various other services, but, after mature consideration, the Government came to the conclusion that undesirable results might follow from such economies.  It was felt that we could not reduce the provision for ths group of socal services without a degree of hardship and injustice or without adding to the numbers of unemployed.  I would also remind the House that, instead of suggesting economies, most Deputies are clamouring for even more expenditure on these services and for their extension in the form of family allowances and other desirable but expensive measures.</P>
    <P>While solicitous in the interests of the taxpayer about economy, the Government has at the same time not been unmindful of its paramount duty to help in remedying unemployment. Apart from direct employment given to members of the Civil Service, Army and Gárda Síochána, there are large sums included in the various Votes which in many ways afford or stimulate employment.  I will refer briefly to a few of the main items: first, of course, comes the £1,400,000 for employment schemes, to which an additional £270,000 will be contributed by the local authorities.  There is next a sum of £900,000 in the Public Works and Buildings Vote for new constructional works of many kinds, national schools, Army and police barracks, airports, etc.  In the same Vote are included sums of £175,000 for maintenance and £13,000 for drainage.  The improvements sub-head of the Land Commission Vote, which is utilised in all parts of the country, totals £560,000; £320,000 is included in the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs for the conveyance of mails and contracts work; £207,000 in the Army Vote for civilian employees and A.R.P. grants; £200,000 in the Local Government Vote for housing grants; £130,000 in the Forestry Vote for labour in cultural operations and maintenance; £83,000 in the Industry and Commerce Vote for turf development; £69,000 in the Gaeltacht Services Vote for Gaeltacht housing, <Col N="26" /> rural industries and the collection of kelp and carrageen; £68,000 in the Stationery Office Vote for printing and binding; and £19,000 in the Fisheries Vote for grants to the Sea Fisheries Association.  All these items, contained in the Supply Service Estimates, total £4,146,000, but our contribution towards the relief of unemployment does not end there.  If Deputies will turn to the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure, they will see provision for capital issues in 1940-41 totalling £2,337,000, of which £1,015,000 is for electricity development, £297,000 for telephone development and £250,000 for advances under the Local Loans Fund Act.  The figure of £2,337,000 added to the £4,146,000 above gives a total of £6,483,000.  Our help to the Local Loans Fund extends far beyond the £250,000 mentioned, as provision is being made for advances from other sources of £1,650,000, making a total capital provision for that fund in the coming year of £1,900,000, which, added to the £6,483,000 referred to, gives us a grand total of £8,383,000.  No serious student of public affairs can deny that for a small country this represents a huge effort.  I wish I could translate for the benefit of the House into terms of actual employment the large financial provision mentioned, but I may say that, in the case of the Employment Schemes Vote alone, the average number employed from November to March last was, in round figures, 28,000, while the maximum number employed at any one time during the year was 38,000.</P>
    <P>The net result is that no further economies are at present possible, and we are thus faced with the problem of finding revenue to meet an expenditure of £35,559,000 on Central Fund and Supply Services.  As the House is aware, some Supply Service Estimates were prepared about six months ago, that is, 15 months before the end of the relevant financial year.  It cannot be expected, therefore, that the forecasts are absolutely accurate considering the many unforeseen contingencies that may arise.  Most Estimates have to be prepared on a relatively conservative basis and contain <Col N="27" /> safety margins.  There may be savings on some and overspending on others, necessitating the introduction of Supplementary Estimates at a later stage.  Normal experience, however, indicates that, in the aggregate, over-estimation generally occurs.  The actual over-estimation varies from year to year and, on last year's out-turn, it was much lower than in previous years.  After allowing for all factors, I propose to adopt this year a figure of £600,000 for over-estimation. Deducting this, the net provision for Central Fund and Supply Services becomes £34,959,000.</P>
    <P>Included in the Supply Services are certain items of a capital and abnormal nature which can justifiably be charged against borrowing rather than against current revenue.  Apart from the provision for replacements and for current requirements of equipment and stores, etc., the Army Estimate for 1940-41 contains a capital and abnormal provision for the purchase of torpedo boats, reserves of general and warlike stores, and A.R.P. equipment, amounting in all to about £390,000.  The Vote for Public Works and Buildings contains a sum of, approximately, £280,000 in respect of barracks, magazines and other new military works.  The total provision in the two Votes for these special and abnormal items is about £670,000.  Following last year's precedent, it is proposed to borrow £500,000, which is, approximately, three-quarters of this provision, and to charge the remaining quarter to current year's revenue.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the provision for airports and for the equipment of meteorological stations connected therewith, spread over the three Votes, Public Works and Buildings, Transport and Meteorological Services and Posts and Telegraphs, amounts to £417,000.  As was indicated previously, the cost of airports is being spread over a period of 15 years, and the annuity to be met out of revenue in each of these 15 years amounts, approximately, to £142,000.  Deducting this from the total provision in the current year's Estimates, the difference is £275,000 <Col N="28" /> and that sum is to be met by borrowing in the current year.</P>
    <P>The current year's Estimate for Forestry provides £45,000 as a Grant-in-Aid for acquisition of land and £108,250 for new cultural operations. It is proposed to borrow £69,000 in respect of these two items.  Many of the works financed from the Employment Schemes Vote, such as public health works, road schemes, land reclamation and other improvement and development works are of a capital and durable nature and it is, accordingly, reasonable to charge against borrowing portion of the provision.  I propose, therefore, to charge to borrowing one-fourth, i.e., £350,000 of the current year's Estimate for Employment Schemes.</P>
    <P>The total of the four capital and abnormal items to be charged to borrowing amounts to £1,194,000 and deducting this, the net provision for Central Fund and Supply Services to be charged against current year's revenue amounts to £33,765,000.</P>
    <P>On the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am proposing certain minor changes in existing protective duties.  These relate principally to articles of iron and steel, manufactures of clay, earthenware, etc., and soap, soap powder and substitutes, and comprise a few reliefs from existing duties, a few reimpositions which are required for purposes of clarification or convenience, and one new duty&mdash;on wadding.  The net result of the various changes, if approved, will be a slight loss of revenue, estimated at £2,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>This further widens the gap between revenue and expenditure, which I must now set about closing.  Certain proposals regarding surtax come first on my list.  I am recommending an increase in the charge to surtax for the year 1939-40 payable 1st January, 1941, in the case of incomes exceeding £20,000.  From this alteration I hope to get something like £12,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The second proposal extends to private limited companies registered before <Col N="29" /> the 6th April, 1914, the provisions of Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922, which was designed to prevent avoidance of surtax by an undue limitation of dividends.  Hitherto, private companies registered before the 6th April, 1914, have been excluded from the scope of these provisions.  The consequent increase in surtax revenue is expected to amount to about £5,000 per annum in due course.</P>
    <P>I shall move a Resolution to bring to an end a considerable loss of revenue arising from a device arranged by certain charitable bodies with their subscribers as a result of which the charity obtains in effect a subsidy from the State and the subscriber secures a deduction in the computation of his income for surtax purposes.  As the Resolution will not affect existing covenants during the period expressed therein, unless such period extends beyond seven years from the end of the year 1939-40, there will be no immediate increase in revenue, but it is estimated that the ultimate gain, calculated by reference to the existing rates of income-tax and surtax, will be, approximately, £13,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>I shall also move two further Resolutions which are not on the Order Paper to-day but will be introduced later on as Supplementary Resolutions. One of them is designed to defeat a device for avoidance of surtax by the declaration of a company that its dividends are paid &ldquo;without deduction of income-tax&rdquo;.  The other is designed to ensure that in certain cases in which married persons are legally separated double allowances for relief in respect of children cannot be claimed.  As these Resolutions will be designed merely to prevent future losses in revenue and will not produce any increase in the existing yield, they do not affect the figures of the Budget which I am submitting to the House.</P>
    <P>There will be three Resolutions designed to obviate possible losses of estate duty in the future by means of devices which have been adopted in Great Britain.  These Resolutions will be moved to-day and I will explain their individual scope at the appropriate <Col N="30" /> time.  They do not affect the Budget figures.</P>
    <P>Owing to the discontinuance of sponsored programmes broadcast by Hospitals Trust, Limited, the loss in revenue from that source in the current year will amount to about £38,000.  Apart from this actual loss, reflected in the White Paper Estimate, the substitution of alternative programmes will entail heavy additional expenditure on wireless broadcasting.  In order to make good, in part at least, the loss of revenue involved, it is proposed to increase wireless licence fees from 10/- to 12/6 per annum.  For this purpose, it will be necessary to issue a new Regulation under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, formalities in connection with which are now being completed. As wireless licences run from the first day of the month of issue, the increased fee will apply only to licences issued or renewed after the operative date for the increased fee, 1st June, 1940.  It is estimated that the change now being made will bring in an additional revenue of about £16,000.</P>
    <P>There is still a difference between estimated expenditure and estimated revenue, and I propose to bridge it by asking for authority to transfer £150,000 from the Road Fund to the Exchequer to meet general charges which will fall upon the Central Fund.  This follows on similar action taken last year.  One justification for this course is that a considerable portion of the provision in the Employment Schemes Estimate is spent on road works.  Last year, for instance, approximately £800,000 was sanctioned for rural and urban road works to be financed from the Employment Schemes Vote.  It is only reasonable, therefore, that the Road Fund should not be entirely relieved of responsibility for this heavy outlay on road works and the £150,000 may be regarded as a somewhat inadequate contribution towards such outlay. Apart from this, I might add that there is no more justification for appropriating the proceeds of taxation on motor vehicles for road improvement than there is, say, for appropriating the proceeds of the excise duty on beer to the <Col N="31" /> improvement of public-houses.  If we do not transfer £150,000 from the Road Fund to the Exchequer, the only alternative is to impose additional taxation, and, in the circumstances, I think that the transfer is moderate in amount.</P>
    <P>During the discussions on the Supplementary Budget of November last and the subsequent Finance Bill which raised by 12/- per barrel the excise duty on beer, several Deputies appealed for some relief for our small brewers.  I have since had the benefit of a full and frank discussion with a deputation representing these breweries.  My predecessor did something to help them in 1932 when a rebate of 5/- per barrel of beer was given to each brewer in respect of the first 5,000 barrels brewed, provided at least 80 per cent. of the cereals were malted or roasted in this country.  This concession has, undoubtedly, been helpful, but while it has kept the wolf from the door, it has not scared that ubiquitous animal completely away.</P>
    <P>Nothing, I am convinced, can do this short of a general reduction in the excise duty on beer, which I cannot contemplate at present.  I should be sorry to see any of these small breweries disappear, as they form little hives of industry outside the capital and give considerable employment, in the aggregate amounting to something like 1,000 persons.  Further, they absorb a certain amount of agricultural products from their immediate neighbourhood, and, besides, their disappearance would be a blow to our declared policy of decentralisation of industry.  The further increase in the excise duty imposed in the Supplementary Budget of November last has hit them very severely and, in all the circumstances, I have decided to seek power in the Finance Bill to double the amount of the rebate, making it 10/- per barrel of beer on the first 5,000 barrels brewed.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that the small brewers are suffering unfairly from the competition of the rather potent cider made in this country.  At present, this <Col N="32" /> home-made cider is not liable to duty, and I propose, therefore, to impose an excise duty as from to-morrow, at the rate of 1/- per gallon on cider made in this country.  At the same time, in order not to diminish the margin of protection enjoyed by cider makers in this country, I propose to increase, as from to-morrow, the rates of customs duty on imported cider by the same amount as the excise duty, viz., 1/- per gallon.  This will bring the customs rates to 5/- per gallon (full) and 3/- per gallon (preferential).  The additional rebate to the small breweries for beer will involve a loss of £13,000 to the Exchequer, which will not be fully felt this year, while the proposed duties on cider will bring in an additional £10,000.  The net effect of the two proposals is, therefore, a loss of £3,000 in revenue.</P>
    <P>During the discussions following the Supplementary Budget, I also promised to consider the strong representations then made from all sides of the House as to the effect of the increased tobacco duty on those people who smoke pipe tobacco and who are obliged to use the cheapest varieties. I realise that the increased rate of duty on leaf tobacco brought into operation last year has resulted in hardships which, though unavoidable in the circumstances, pressed with undue severity on many of the really poor.</P>
    <P>Even now I am not in a position to make as generous a gesture as I would wish, but, as proof of my practical sympathy, I am prepared to explore the possibility of reducing the duty on leaf tobacco so as to bring about a reduction in price to the smoker by 1d. per ounce of the cheap varieties of pipe tobacco.  Normally, a reduction in price of 1d. per ounce would follow on a reduction in duty of 1s. 4d. per lb. on the unmanufactured tobacco taken from the bonded warehouse to the tobacco factory, but I understand that the attempt to charge some leaf tobacco at a lower rate than other leaf might create serious difficulties for the manufacturers. I propose, therefore, to ask the tobacco manufacturers to discuss the problem with the Revenue authorities <Col N="33" /> and, if an agreed scheme is formulated, I will include the necessary legislative provision in the Finance Bill.  The scheme, if evolved, will cost, at least, £120,000 this year and £180,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>A small relief will appear in the Finance Bill in the shape of the exemption from musical instrument duty of that portion of the projector apparatus used in connection with cinematograph films which attracts that duty.  This liability hampers the circulation of small films for use in schools, etc., which have an instructional value, and I propose to remove the liability on projectors for all films.  The cost will be about £2,000.</P>
    <P>A further relief will appear in the Bill to the effect that any premises registered as a betting office will bear only one £20 charge of registration duty in any one year though there may have been changes in the proprietorship of the premises during the year.</P>
    <P>The last item to be mentioned under Customs and Excise is a small imposition for purposes of control and not for revenue.  It is an excise licence duty at the rate of 20 shillings per annum on each licence granted or renewed under fishery legislation to persons who are registered under such legislation as exporters for sale of salmon and trout.  The revenue yield from this duty will be trifling.</P>
    <P>In conformity with the promise made by the Minister for Defence in the Dáil on 7th June last, I intend to include in the Finance Bill a clause to grant relief in respect of income-tax, Schedule A, chargeable on premises occupied by the owner and used wholly as A.R.P. works, and I also propose to grant certain income-tax reliefs in respect of funds established by various concerns for the benefit of dependents of deceased employees.  The cost of these reliefs is at present uncertain, but it is not expected to be of large proportions.</P>
    <P>With the minor additions to Exchequer income that I have mentioned and the not unsubstantial reliefs that I <Col N="34" /> have been able to give, we have a total estimated yield from all sources of tax and non-tax revenue for the year of £33,769,000.  The total expenditure on Central Fund and Supply Services, after including £100,000 for fertilisers and after adjusting for capital items and for over-estimation, works out at £33,765,000, and so we arrive at a modest, I might almost say microscopic, surplus of £4,000.  The achievement of this result, without making further drastic calls upon the taxpayer, affords me genuine pleasure and will, I suppose, be the occasion for a sigh of relief from the country.  The Budget has, I am afraid, too long ceased to be a dispenser of benefits and has come to be associated in the popular mind with impositions and inquisitions of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In the critical world situation with which we are faced, the whole present efforts of the Government and of the people of Ireland must be devoted to maintaining stability of conditions at home during the period of the conflict. If we fail to achieve this objective, we risk the loss of all that we have already won&mdash;political freedom, economic independence and some measure of social justice.  But, if we do achieve it, we can reasonably look forward, after the war has terminated, to accelerating the progress of our national life.  For the moment, ordered progress, planned development and social betterment are ideals which cannot be carried forward with the same degree of intensity as in the past. This is part of the price that we, in common with belligerents, must pay for a world at war.</P>
    <P>No one acquainted with the facts would be so foolish as to suppose that the maintenance of things as they are can be achieved without effort.  There must be sacrifices, not merely of our expectations but of much that we at present enjoy, so that the burdens will be distributed as evenly as possible over the whole community.  There must be work, so that, in a world of wasting values, our increased production may still hope to command its price in terms of necessary goods and <Col N="35" /> services.  There must be patience and goodwill, so that our country can present a united front to danger, from whatever quarter it may come.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress in particular a few other aspects of the situation.  The last European war introduced the conception of a cost-of-living bonus by which it was hoped to nullify for the individual the impact of additional taxation and rising prices caused by the outbreak of hostilities.  Now that we have another European war, the demand for a cost-of-living bonus which will maintain the standard of living of the individual unimpaired is being raised again.  But we have learned much since 1914-18, and it should be realised now that the attempt to maintain unimpaired standards, in the face of the additional burdens and losses caused by war, is not only doomed to failure in its immediate objective but will cause the greatest economic difficulty and social injustice. There is set in motion a vicious spiral of mounting costs and prices in which settled values are destroyed, economic standards are upset, national credit is shattered and the less advantageously placed groups and individuals are ruined.  There is left behind a burden of debt and of social and economic injustice which paralyses the country for a generation. No Government could dare to accept the view that any limited section of the community can claim to be exempt from the effects of war at such a cost to the remainder of the country and to the country's future, and we will use every effort to ensure that no such situation develops.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point&mdash;the character of our export trade.  The demand from our principal market may increase by direct war buying and by the withdrawal, in whole or in part, of other suppliers.  But it is too often and too hastily assumed in this country that such demand takes no account of cost, and that, accordingly, we are relieved for the present from any obligation to produce for that market on sound commercial lines. There is also a widespread belief that <Col N="36" /> quality does not matter, that big profits are going to be made, and that the burden of rising costs can be lightly accepted and easily passed on to the consumer.  Whether we take the short-term or the long-term view of the position, it should be realised by all that this is far from being the case. Costs of production must be kept down to the minimum.  There is not going to be now, as there was a quarter of a century ago, a continuous upward surge of demand and of prices, due to unregulated buying and defective monetary policy.  Larger profits, except as a result of increased and more efficient production, cannot be counted on.</P>
    <P>It is also overlooked that we are in a vulnerable position ourselves.  It has scarcely yet become a seller's market for our exports, but it has certainly become a seller's market for our imports.  We have to rely on our export trade&mdash;and that means on our agriculture&mdash;to ensure that in spite of vast war demands we will obtain the wide range of imports required to maintain stability of conditions at home.  On the long-term view, it cannot be too repeatedly stressed that quality and orderliness of production should be kept at high standards and that charges, whether on capital or on current account, should be kept down.  On the maintenance during the war of a sound basis for our industrial and commercial life will depend our ability, when peace returns, to retain and develop our productive capacity and our export trade, and to restore and improve the standards of living of our people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I must utter a word of warning.  Our expenditure is heavy and certain; our revenue, though heavy, is by no means so certain.  It depends upon our ability to maintain, and even increase, our exports as well as our imports.  In the brief eight months of war that have elapsed&mdash;brief by the calendar but not so to those who have had to bear the responsibilities and anxieties of public affairs throughout that period&mdash;we have seen small nations subjected to all forms of <Col N="37" /> outrages by some of their powerful neighbours.  National rights and liberties have been ruthlessly invaded and suppressed by brute force.  Peoples have been mown down in thousands for defending their freedom.  Nations renowned in history for their industry, culture and refinement have been abolished as national entities.</P>
    <P>Through the sacrifices of our own people and the foresight and statesmanship of our national leaders of to-day and yesterday, we have, so far, escaped being involved in this conflict. I pray that this evil may not come any closer to our shores.  I have prepared this Budget on the assumption that no <Col N="38" /> such major catastrophe will befall us. No spirit of false optimism can, however, carry us through those difficult days.  Constant vigilance and a firm determination of a united people to defend boldly its rights are the price of the freedom this nation possesses. We may have to face difficult days. Let us not be caught unawares.  If hardships have to be faced, they will be nothing new in the history of this country and we will, I am sure, respond to the call for national effort no less heroically and effectively than we have done in the past.</P>

      <P>This Budget would appear, by reason of the reception it has got from the other side of the House, to be a popular Budget. Indeed, if one were an innocent travelling abroad and if one came to this House for the first time and listened to the long statement that the Minister for Finance has read out, and were to accept in all good faith everything contained in that statement, one would probably come to the conclusion that this was a happy and a prosperous country.  Looking back, however, over the last seven or eight years and comparing the results of the policy that has been pursued during those years with the policy that was pursued previously, and examining how all this additional revenue that has been collected over those years has been spent and going into the details which have been mentioned by the Minister, one cannot find much satisfaction in the results.  There is not much room for satisfaction if we are to compare those results with the results which obtained prior to the very heavy additional impositions of taxation which have taken place during the last seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the year 1927, down to the year 1932, there was an annual average increase of 11,400 persons in employment, if we are to take the revenue derived from the purchase of stamps under the National Health Insurance Acts as an indication of the numbers of persons getting employment. The increase, as I say, was at the rate of 11,400 persons each year, over and above the number employed in the previous year.  We have now an opportunity of examining the alternative policy that has been pursued during those eight years.  We have had an intensive industrial drive; we have had huge sums of public money raised, in taxation in some cases, borrowed in other cases, and all devoted, according to this statement of the Minister and the statement of his predecessor, towards improving and increasing employment throughout the country. The Minister mentions on page 25 of his statement that the Employment Schemes Vote alone afforded employment, from November to March last, <Col N="51" /> to an average number of 28,000 persons, while the maximum number employed at any one time during the year was 38,000.  That was a commendable effort.  It was apparently a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to deal with a situation which was largely the creation of the Government.  It was their policy, financial and economic, which had produced the situation which demanded such a large imposition of taxation, on the one hand, and such huge borrowings on the other.</P>
    <P>Scarcely, I suppose, in the case of any other European country has there been such an exhibition of colossal failure in their financial and economic policy, and the strange thing about it is that it does not appear to have penetrated the minds of the Ministry, except to a lesser extent.  There is now before the Seanad a Bill known as the Institute for Advanced Studies Bill.  I suggest that Ministers would go through the elementary studies first, go through the four main principles of arithmetic&mdash;addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  They should master these, master them in connection with our annual Budget, master them in order that there would be a headline for the rest of the country, because we have expensive national institutions here to deal with people who depart from practising the benefits that we derive from learning those elementary lessons of arithmetic.</P>
    <P>This Budget is, as it were, a Budget and a half.  We had the rather onerous part of it in November. Examining the financial tables which have been so courteously distributed to Deputies, we find that the Minister estimates the deficit on last year at £892,276.  The Budget, he admits, was unbalanced to that extent.  That is his confession&mdash;a deficit of almost £900,000. Now let us see how he has managed to escape with only £900,000 of a deficit. On the opposite side of table 1 we find the defence expenditure on Votes 11 and 65.  The Minister deducts almost £700,000, which is to be met by borrowing. For airports there is a sum of £55,000 and for property losses compensation, £3,000.  In the case of <Col N="52" /> afforestation the figure is £58,000 and for employment schemes, £305,000.  I can see no justification for the first and for the last item.  None whatever.</P>
    <P>The defence expenditure of £700,000 is a normal expenditure and it should be met out of revenue.  Unemployment schemes, £305,000&mdash;why are they needed?  Has there been any year for the last five years that we have not needed them?  Is it likely in the next five years that we will not need them? It is said that they have added to the value of our wealth.  If any of their predecessors had taken that line our dead-weight debt would now be very considerable.  But the Minister in the course of his statements takes £150,000 from the Road Fund.  He says he sees no reason why that money should not be available for revenue.  Surely the very name &ldquo;Road Fund&rdquo; suggests the reason for this collection.  It was instituted for the purpose of putting the roads in order for those who need to drive motor cars over them.  This fund has been used for a great number of years and, apparently, according to the Minister's own statement, it is not sufficient for the purpose.  But the fact is that £150,000 afforded employment to men who had 30/- to 35/- a week and something over that, and now it is devoted to providing them with three or four days' work a week which, to my mind, is the principal infirmity in the Government's economic policy; this policy, which has been pursued now for over eight years, is directed towards making people dependent on the national Exchequer and making them look towards Government, demoralising them, sapping their initiative, or taking away their initiative and self-reliance.</P>
    <P>The sum and substance of it is that we have now reached a point where instead of having 11,000 persons added to the employment list each year, we have gone down to an average of some-like 9,800.  More significant than that is the fact that last year not 1,000 persons were added on to the employment list.  Now is it not time in face of these facts that we should have a review of these circumstances?  This country has not been growing richer <Col N="53" /> during the last eight years.  It is only a country growing richer that could support and sustain an increased and increasing taxation year after year.  If we divert from the individual his responsibility for giving employment and place it upon the State, the first thing that happens is that it costs the State the money to collect the tax that goes to the Exchequer and it costs the State afterwards money to distribute that.</P>
    <P>In the course of the latter portion of the Minister's statement he described what huge sums of money had been disbursed for stationery, printing and various activities of one kind or another totalling up something like £4,100,000.  Quite true, but he could have said the same about the whole revenue of £32,000,000. But notwithstanding the fact that we have gone from £25,000,000 in our National Exchequer to £32,000,000 we still have unemployment. We still have the responsibility placed upon the central authority of doing something to relieve the situation they themselves have been responsible for creating.  Included in the list of social services that the Minister read out for us, services which have been increased in cost during the last seven or eight years, are the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the Land Commission. He totalled up that increase over what it cost the State in 1932 as £5,250,000.  I dispute that entirely.  I dispute the inclusion of the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the Land Commission.  If there are services performed by the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health which fall properly under those two heads I will concede them, but I am not disposed to include the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, Deputy Ward, as a social service; nor am I disposed to regard the Housing Commission as a social service; nor do I regard the Parliamentary Secretary for Lands, Deputy O'Grady, as a social service. He is not a social service at all.</P>
    <P>This Budget, in my opinion, is beyond the resources of the people of this country.  They can pay it I suppose <Col N="54" /> by lessening expenditure in other directions but it may create and it may be responsible for unemployment.  It may be responsible for hardships of one kind or another because it is not only this concession of 1d. per ounce on tobacco that we are passing now. We are passing now the Supplementary Budget of last November as well. We are keeping on all those taxes. We are keeping them on by passing this Budget.  We have it on the authority of the Minister that the yield of the import duty charged on the <i>ad valorem</i> value of the goods has gone up because the increased insurance and freightage are included in the values of the imported articles on which the duties are charged.  That only means additional taxation on the same goods. While nobody is to look for increased salaries or profits the Minister himself gathers in every penny he can by the highest tax that it is possible to collect.  In the course of the Minister's statement it transpired that the yield in respect of duties on spirits is down by £185,000.  The duty on spirits was increased last November but notwithstanding the increased imposition we collected £185,000 less.  Presumably it is because there is a majority of tee-totallers on the Executive Council at the present moment that that tax is left on.  But £185,000 is a considerable amount of revenue.  If it can be collected and at the same time leave the price of this stimulant, which is so much abhorred by those Ministers, at what it was, would it not be very good?  It so happens that the distillers in this country are not particularly prosperous.  At one time distilling was one of our most important industrial activities, but taxation has largely put it in the position in which it is to-day. Perhaps the Minister, who is not so infirm as some of his brethren, might persuade them that there is now an opportunity of getting that £185,000, or, at least of stabilising the duty at what it was prior to the introduction of the Supplementary Budget.  In passing, may I say, as I said on a former occasion in this House, that I have no interest whatever, in any of the firms that are engaged in distilling in this country.  There is a lesson to <Col N="55" /> be learned from that particular duty: the lesson of imposing taxation and of not being able to collect the revenue anticipated.</P>
    <P>The Minister, apparently, has secured the support of his Party for this Budget.  The results are there for everybody to see.  The employment returns are the test, and not only the employment returns but the very facts which the Minister produced in his Budget statement.  The position is that we have now got a dead-weight debt of £54,000,000.  That is a nice legacy the Government are leaving to their successors. It is an unfortunate legacy but, what is worse, it is possible that some other political humbugs may come along and take the same line that the Government took in their time and say: &ldquo;Let us promise the people to spend more money and, if we get the opportunity of doing so, we can leave it to our successors to pay the debts when they arise.&rdquo;  That is a bad policy.  It is the policy that has been responsible for the economic disasters of the last 20 years.  We are pursuing it here now, but we ought to correct it in time.  We have the opportunity of doing so now and, in a time of emergency, when we are advising everybody how they should behave themselves, we should give the example to the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a good Budget.  In my opinion it cannot be described as a good Budget except by those who were expecting to have to pay increased taxation, and who were prepared to do so if the necessity arose.  The Budget is not a good one, particularly from the point of view that it makes legal provision for a reduction of the services which provided work for our people by a sum of £911,000.  It makes legal provision for the cutting down of housing grants by £250,000, of the grants hitherto provided for the improvement of our land by £170,000, of the grants previously provided for new works by £120,000, and of other grants previously provided under the different Estimates for the promotion of useful and necessary works.  Because of these reductions we cannot subscribe to the claim <Col N="56" /> that this is a good Budget, and further because that policy is going to add to the present number of the unemployed. It can, of course, be said that it is not a bad Budget in the sense that there is nothing so bad but that it could be worse.  Speaking in this House on the 29th April, 1932, the Taoiseach, when dealing with the question of unemployment and of his desire to seek and provide a solution for it, the greatest problem of all, is reported to have said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to repeat what I said outside.  I said that, looking around the world and trying to understand what were the causes of unemployment in different countries, I came to the conclusion that there was less reason for unemployment in this country than in any country of which I know.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He is now sitting behind his Minister for Finance who, to-day, was responsible for the introduction of a Budget which, in my opinion, is going to increase the existing number of our unemployed people.  In the same debate, the Taoiseach spoke of the methods which he proposed to adopt for the solution of the unemployment problem.  He said that if the problem could not be solved under the existing system he would, if necessary, go outside the system.  His exact words were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be that under the present system we cannot do the full work we would like to do, but we are going to try.  I am going to say this, that if I try within the system as it stands and fail, then I will try to go outside the system, and I will go to the country and ask them to support me to go outside the system.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach to-day say that he has made anything in the nature of an inroad on the solution of this problem? Does he still contend, after being such a long period in office, that he has made any attempt in the direction of finding a solution for it under the existing system?  If he has come to the conclusion that he cannot solve the unemployment problem within the system, is he going to go outside the system, as he promised he would do, <Col N="57" /> within a reasonable time to find a solution for the existing position.  These are pertinent questions which I think should be answered during this debate. There will be further occasions for elaborating this whole question on the Financial Resolutions.  I hope that the Taoiseach will play his part in the discussions on this Budget and say where he now stands in regard to the solution of unemployment, the greatest problem that confronts the country to-day as well as the Government which is responsible for its solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his Budget statement that he was providing an additional sum of money for the agricultural community in order to enable them to get artificial manures and to increase agricultural production.  He is making a concession of £100,000, which is described as a subsidy for that purpose in the Budget statement, but in the next page of his statement he tells the country that he is going to secure that sum by taking it out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and out of the fund provided for the payment of unemployment assistance&mdash;from those for whom the Government so far have been unable to provide work, so that it is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very interesting, but not a very convincing, comparison in justification of his attempt to rob the Road Fund of a sum of £150,000, to help balance his Budget. He has admitted that he is prepared to do that&mdash;it is to his credit that he has admitted it&mdash;rather than impose increased taxation, and, to that extent, I agree with his decision.  But, in making an attempt to defend the robbery of the Road Fund he made what seems to me to be this rather extraordinary and unconvincing comparison:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from this I might add that there is no more justification for appropriating the proceeds of taxation on motor vehicles for road improvement than there is, say, for appropriating the proceeds of the <Col N="58" /> excise duty on beer to the improvement of public-houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This question of the Road Fund could, I suggest, form the subject of a very interesting debate at an ordinary debating society meeting.  We all know that the taxation raised by means of the Road Fund is for the purpose of improving the roads that have been constructed at great public expense. Surely the Minister does not suggest that public-houses have been built at the public expense.  The moneys that go into the Road Fund have been paid by road users and the owners of motor vehicles, and should be utilised for the purpose of improving the roads that motor users and the travelling public generally make use of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The travelling public do-not make the same use of publichouses that they do of our public roads.  To say the least of it, I do not think that the comparison is a very convincing one.  Undoubtedly, the moneyed people of the country&mdash;with the exception of a few super-taxpayers with incomes of over £20,000 a year, who will have to pay a little more&mdash;that is, the taxpayers generally who have money to pay taxes, over and above what they require for the maintenance of themselves and their dependents, will welcome this Budget, as it does not provide for increased taxation.</P>
      <P>I gladly accept the concession which the Minister has given in this Budget to the small brewers.  It is going to provide a longer life for the small concerns, and, therefore, it will maintain in useful and well paid employment about 1,000 persons.  To that extent, I welcome the concession and thank the Minister for having met the people concerned, particularly those who are dependent on these concerns for their livelihood.</P>

      <P>Well, for example, A.B. has been in the habit of subscribing £13 10s. per annum to a certain charity.  At the suggestion of the organisers of the charity he signs a covenant to pay the charity £20 a year for seven years or until his death, if earlier.  A.B. then pays annually £20, less income-tax at 6/6 in the £, (viz. £6 10s.) to the charity; i.e. he continues to disburse £13 10s. per annum as before.  The charity, on the ground of statutory exemption, claims repayment from the revenue of the £6 10s. income-tax deducted by A.B., and the later claims a deduction of £20 in calculating his income for surtax purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this is a case in which the Minister says that he must get something out of that £20.  A man gives £20, or £13 10s., but this will simply mean that the subscription to the charities concerned will be reduced and that the man, instead of giving £20, will only give £13 10s.</P>

      <P>Yes. The practice has <Col N="66" /> been for those members of the Bar who were able to afford it to give a fairly substantial subscription each year and numbers of the members of the Bar, taking a chance on their income continuing&mdash;which is rather a chance having regard to the Minister's depredations here&mdash;decided to covenant that they would give the same particular subscription for, I think, seven years.  I understand that this particular provision is really aimed at that, in order to prevent the Bar Benevolent Fund from getting the same income they would otherwise have got were it not for this provision.</P>

      <P>The debate will go on for a long time if it is going to be pursued on those lines.  It can go on for a long time but it is important that we should know what we are doing. We are going to extract by this Financial Resolution a sum of £13,000 from the charities of this country.  Has any democratic country in Europe been brought so low that it has to contribute to the balance of its Budget by searching the coffers of the charities of the country which it is supposed to govern?  This is the poor man's Government. This is the Government filled with solicitude for the poor.  Does Deputy Tom Kelly believe that it is desirable to take £13,000 from the charities of this country in order to balance the Budget?  He ought to intervene and tell us.  You can cloak this, as the Revenue Commissioners can always cloak everything, with a thousand discourses on the complicated income-tax code but the net result of it is that this Resolution will operate to collect £13,000 per annum from the charities of this country.  Is there any Deputy in this House who considers that a desirable way to balance the Budget, because, if there is, I challenge the Deputy to say so.  Is there a single Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches who will get up now and have the courage to say that he thinks this £13,000 should be taken from the charities in Ireland?  I defy any single one to get up and say that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given him one illustration of a case in which I personally am interested. I want to give him another and to find out from him if this particular provision will cover it because I think it will.  There is a conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in which I am interested.  Arrangements have been made, where a number of individuals have been in the habit some years past of giving an annual subscription to this particular conference, to see if they would covenant in the way that has been so far legalised by the law of this country to continue their annual subscriptions to the same amount over the necessary period of seven years. Members were prepared to do that. The position which this conference was faced with was that it had very little means at its disposal other than the subscriptions of the particular persons to whom I allude.  A number of these persons would have very serious difficulties in continuing their subscriptions at all.  The result would be that the conference in question would lose a considerable portion of its income by reason of the many calls that are upon the subscribers.  It was thought that if they could be induced to stabilise their subscriptions they would know what would be the extreme limit of their commitments, they would know where they stood, and the conference in question would benefit a little by this remission of tax that was given. The position appears to be this: That the poor who are visited by this particular conference are going to have that amount of money which we have saved taken away from them and dispensed in other wild-cat schemes by the Government.  So that, not alone does this particular impost&mdash;because that is <Col N="69" /> what it is&mdash;affect the benevolent society of the Bar but it appears to me&mdash;and I want an answer from the Minister&mdash;to affect the various conferences and the Central Council of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>

If these gentlemen wish to covenant to pay £20 a year or £30, let them continue to pay it but why should the mere fact that they covenant to pay a subscription draw 6s. 6d. in the £ from the taxpayer out of revenue?  That is what is happening.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon talks about the democratic man.  The democratic man, the man with the small income, cannot afford to covenant, while the man with the large income can afford it and can tie himself up for seven years, knowing that he has his investments and that the money is bound to come in because he has a definite and regular income.  A poor man cannot afford to do that, and he gives out of his income proportionately a great deal more than the rich man, as a general rule.  Here, however, is a case where those who can afford it are covenanting to pay certain subscriptions and, in doing so, are mulcting the taxpayer to the tune of 6s. 6d. in the £ I think that is not proper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest against the implications of the Minister's statement.  It would appear from what he has said that it is only the rich man who can afford to covenant. In my personal experience of the cases I have spoken of, it is by no means the rich man who is covenanting.  It is the man of comparatively small means, with perhaps a hazardous future in a professional career, who has covenanted and who has taken the risk, knowing that he will be under an obligation to pay a fairly small sum for a number of years but, at the same time, knowing that, by entering into the covenant, he will benefit the charity he wishes to benefit and that it will entail no further call upon himself. I think it is not right that the implication of the Minister's statement, that it is only the rich man who can afford to covenant, should go out. That is not so, in my own personal experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> The people who want to give a certain proportion of their meagre incomes, who feel that the only way they can do something themselves is&mdash;to revert to the case I mentioned&mdash; to give a small annual subscription to a society, can take upon themselves the liability of covenanting for a number of years.  That covenant is not a very serious or very vital covenant because, if they get into difficulties or if they die, it can be withdrawn at certain stages, but the point I want to make is that the people who are doing that are mostly people with small incomes, and it is incorrect to say that the only people who can enter into a covenant of this kind are people with large incomes.  That is not the position at all, and I reiterate that the people who covenant to do this are people of goodwill towards the poor of this city, who are prepared to make a sacrifice for a charity in the knowledge that, while they are covenanting to give a small subscription over a number of years, so long as they are able to do so, so long as they are alive, they know that the effect of the covenant is to benefit the charity, if you like, at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister should look back over the usual procedure, which is that, when we get shocking proposals placed before us, we characterise them as shocking from the very first.  This now is clear that, whatever the details of these proposals are, either certain charities are going to lose £13,000 a year, or the people who continue to give these charities the support they are giving them at present are to be taxed to the extent of an additional £13,000 a year.  If the charities, due to the action of individuals or some such reason, lose only £3,000, the people who continue to support them will be taxed to the extent of £10,000 extra for giving the support they are giving, but the loss will fall either on the charities or on those who support the charities in a systematic way, and it is certainly a valuable thing for charities to know that, over a certain period, they are going to have a certain income, that part of their income is secured.  That is why I say this is a shocking proposal.</P>

The Minister tried to draw a distinction between the poorer man and the richer man, but the poorer man's subscription, such as mine, is of an irregular nature.  Sometimes it comes and sometimes it does not, but the income which the Minister is getting at is the income which the charities can count on as a reasonable certainty for a number of years.

I have done it, not contributing money of my own but getting it from my neighbours.  I must say that I found no more charitable neighbour than the present Minister for Finance but, goodness knows, it is hard enough to raise money for charity.  Every penny you can get is very welcome.  Very frequently you find that you cannot get money to relieve the urgent distress <Col N="75" /> with which you are confronted.  In these circumstances, knowing that to be true, how on earth can we elect to take £13,000 from the charities that are struggling at present?

      <P>Have they not all the experience that contributors are cutting down their contributions in this time of stress and difficulty?  It is very hard for the individual contributor to a large charity to envisage the individual cases that have to be relieved. Do we realise that what is really going to happen is that this £13,000 is going to be collected from the individuals relieved by the charity?  It is going to be collected in sixpences and eight-pences from people who are receiving relief from the charity.  The woman who was receiving 5/- is going to receive only 4/8 and the family receiving 2/- in respect of each child will get only 1/9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have that experience on boards of health.  When our estimate is reduced by the county council, a general slash is made.  We are told that we must cut down the estimate by, say £8,000, in order to prevent a rise in the rates.  What are we driven to do?  We take up the relief lists and we say that a woman who was getting 5/- will in future only get 4/8.  We try to spread out the cut in the estimate over all the relief cases so as to make a reduction in each case.  Have we all gone daft that we contemplate balancing the Budget by taking 2d. and 3d. from each recipient of charity, the destitute poor, in cases of this kind? Surely the Minister is not going to set himself up as such a purist in the revenue law that his soul is seared by the spectacle of a loop-hole in the revenue law which allows an unfortunate recipient of charity to receive 2d. or 3d. that should go to the Exchequer?  That is a ridiculous <Col N="76" /> position.  His purist's soul revolts at the idea of the twopences going astray and he is going to pursue them into these destitute homes and bring them back where they belong-to the Exchequer. That is a ludicrous position to allow yourself to be driven into.  If the case were put to us that there were some gentlemen making a family covenant whereby they escaped liability for income-tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is put to me that the income-tax law has to be modified to deal with such people the Minister will have my sympathy but that is a very different thing.  Let us try to be human in our legislation.  Surely we see a distinction between that type of legislation and a reasonable and human desire not to collect revenue from charity?  What matter, if we put the telescope to the blind eye in regard to a trivial leak in our revenue laws if, as a result, some unfortunate person happens to receive 2d. or 3d. more in his allowance from charitable funds.  Is it not an infinitely more valuable use of the money than to rake it into the Exchequer to satisfy the vigilance of the Revenue Commissioners?  I do not blame the Revenue Commissioners for putting up this cod proposal but I do blame the responsible Minister for coming in here and making a cod of himself by sponsoring it before Dáil Eireann.  Every responsible trustee and public servant frequently finds himself in the position that his duty obliges him to stress the letter of the law, no matter how grotesque it may be.  That is what the Minister is there for, to distinguish between the letter of the law and the true interpretation of it.  Does anybody suggest that the true interpretation of the income-tax law is that we should pursue the twopences and three pences that are distributed in charity and bring them back into the Exchequer so that the revenue may be complete?  The Minister says that there is time to consider this matter and to talk of it between now and the Finance Bill.  Think.</P>

      <P>I might not have as much interest in the St. Vincent de Paul Society or have as long a connection with it, although my connection with it has been fairly long, but, as far as I know the facts, that society is not interested in covenanted subscriptions. There are a few societies which have made a practice of securing subscriptions by this method, and in the last two or three years that practice has grown at a very rapid rate.  It is a method I do not like.  It is not a fair method.  It is the rich man's method of escaping surtax.  He is generous if you like; he undoubtedly gives a subscription but he also gets relief to the extent of one-third of his subscription at the expense of somebody else.  Let him give £20 if he wants to give it.  I should not like to prevent anybody from being generous towards charity.  I have examined this myself and I take full personal responsibility in the matter. There is no question of 2d. 4d. or 6d., as far as I know.</P>

      <P>This law has been in existence for a long time.  So far as I am aware not a dozen of St. Vincent de Paul subscribers have covenanted to do anything in this way.  It is not that type of person who does it. Deputy Costello may know somebody, but it is not that type of person who does it.  I can give an example.  Take a taxpayer whose income is about <Col N="78" /> £3,500 per annum and who has covenanted in the usual form to pay annually to a certain charity such sum as, after deduction of income-tax, will leave £300.  He furnishes the charity with a certificate that he has paid £444 8s. 11d., less income-tax at 6/6 in the £ amounting to £144 8s. 11d.  The charity reclaims this latter sum from the revenue.  The taxpayer saves almost £43 in surtax.  The total cost to the State is therefore approximately £187.  In the last few years that type of person is becoming alive to this fact, and if we do not put some limit to it, in years to come&mdash;I will be dead and gone and will not be Minister for Finance&mdash;it will amount to a sum that should not be taken from the State. I think it is not a just proposition that that should continue.  Personally, interested as I am to a modest extent in charities and charitable objects and societies, I think it is not a thing that ought to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister says, it would appear to me that there is a simple method of avoiding that.  I certainly was under the impression&mdash;probably erroneously &mdash; that when a covenant of this kind was entered into with a charity to continue a subscription for a certain number of years, the entire benefit of that particular remission of tax went entirely to the charity and nobody else.  It is on that basis that most people sign a covenant of that kind.  So far as they had it in their power, their entire intention was that the remission of tax should go direct to the charity.  The Minister says that some surtax payers can get some sort of relief.  If that is so, he should bring in a provision that, as long as the charity gets the benefit of this arrangement, then nobody else is entitled to get it, and then I will support the Minister.  I am not asking for any remission for any income taxpayer or surtax payer or any other sort of taxpayer in respect of a covenant of this kind.  The only thing that I have any knowledge of in practice is the case where people who give subscriptions covenant to continue the subscriptions in the belief that any remission that is lawfully due in <Col N="79" /> respect of the moneys covered by that covenant will go directly to the charity and nobody else.  If the Minister wants to change the law in respect of surtax payers I withdraw the objection; but let him have the law in such a way that the charity gets it.  If nobody else but the charity gets it, then I cannot see how the Minister can make the indignant case he has made.  He is really drawing a red herring across the matter.  The substance of it is that charities were getting the relief provided for in this section which it is proposed to repeal.  The majority of those who entered into such a covenant &mdash;certainly I was, in so far as I have entered into any covenant&mdash;were of the opinion that anything that accrued by way of remission of tax went directly to the charity and nobody else. Personally, I have got no relief and it never occurred to me to get any relief. If the Minister thinks the surtax payers get something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You can use it any time you like.  I am arguing on behalf of charities and not on behalf of taxpayers. I want that to be made clear. I want to repudiate the case made by the Minister for this provision.  So far as he has made any case whatever, it is that some class of taxpayer will benefit.  I understand that he confines it to the class of taxpayer who pays surtax.  That is the only basis on which he has purported to justify the repeal of Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1922.  I am prepared to facilitate, and I believe everybody in the House will be prepared to facilitate the Minister in seeing that no taxpayer&mdash;income-tax payer or surtax payer or anybody else &mdash;gets any benefit by way of remission of tax for his charitable donations.  If that is accepted by the Minister, then his entire case falls, if he has no other justification for this.  Accepting the proposition I have made to him that nobody wants the income-tax payers or the surtax payers to get any benefit, what is the case for this?  I have heard none.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922, is to prevent the avoidance of payment of surtax by members of private companies.  The section provides that if a reasonable proportion of the profits of the year is not distributed in dividends, the whole of the income of the company may, in certain circumstances, be treated as income of the members for the purposes of surtax. <Col N="83" /> The section as it stands applies to any company which, amongst other conditions, has since 5th April, 1914, been registered under the Companies Acts.  There is no reason for, and there are good reasons against, restricting the application of the section to companies registered since 5th April, 1914, and the Resolution proposes, accordingly, to apply the section to all companies otherwise within its scope without regard to the date of registration.</P>

      <P>Under the Finance Act of 1932, Section 22, as amended by reference No. 4 in the Second Schedule to the Finance (Customs and Excise Duties) Act, 1933, by the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 121) Order, 1937, and by subsequent Acts, a customs duty known as package duty was imposed on every imported package which contained the following articles, viz.: insecticides, disinfectants, verminicides, vermicides and fungicides, subject to the concession that no minimum rate applied in the case of packages containing goods produced in the United Kingdom or in the Dominion of Canada.  The proposal is to replace the package duty on insecticides, disinfectants, verminicides, vermicides and fungicides, by a similar duty on any article (not being a single substantially pure chemical element or compound) which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is ordinarily used as a disinfectant, insecticide, verminicide, vermicide or <Col N="107" /> fungicide, and which is suitable for such use either without any process of preparation or on the mere addition of water.  The whole idea is to vary certain of these duties.</P>

    <P>(a)  as if the said annuity or other interest, as of its actual amount, had been provided by the deceased, or</P>

    <P>(4)  That for the purpose of Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1894, the deceased shall be deemed to have had an interest in any property included, by virtue of this Resolution (when given statutory effect), in the property passing on the death of the deceased.</P>

      <P>The scheme takes many forms; but the underlying principle can be shown in the following simple example:&mdash;A makes a gift of £5,000 to his son B, who lends it back to A at 4 per cent. interest.  B takes out an insurance policy on A's life and pays the premiums out of the interest he receives from A.  In those circumstances two results follow, viz., (1) the policy money is not chargeable to estate duty on A's death because by means of the device B and not A had provided the policy; and (2) the £5,000 which, by reason of the artificial loan transaction, A owes to B, is deductible <Col N="113" /> when calculating the amount of A's estate for estate duty purposes. Resolution No. 11 is designed to defeat the first result and to cause the policy money to be aggregated with the other property passing on the deceased's death.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That in this Resolution the expression &ldquo;the principal sub-section&rdquo; means sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, as amended by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924).</P>
      <P>(2)  That in the case of any person dying on or after the 8th day of May, 1940, the exemption from estate duty applicable by virtue of the principal sub-section in respect of settled movable property situate outside the State shall not apply in respect of any such property passing on such death where, at the date when the disposition under which the property passes took effect (whether that date is the 8th day of May, 1940, or a date, whether before or after the passing of the Act giving statutory effect to this Resolution, before or after the 8th day of May, 1940), the disponer was domiciled in the State or in the area now comprised in the State or where the said disposition was made, directly or indirectly, on behalf of or at the expense of or out of funds provided by a person who at the said date was domiciled as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>(3)  That notwithstanding the provisions contained in the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution, the exemption from estate duty applicable by virtue of the principal sub-section in respect of settled movable property situate outside the State shall be deemed to apply in relation to the death of the disponer (but not in relation to any other death) where:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the disponer dies domiciled outside the State, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the disposition constitutes an immediate gift <i>inter vivos</i> made by the disponer within three years of his death or constitutes a gift <Col N="117" /> (whenever made) of property of which <i>bona fide</i> possession and enjoyment was not immediately assumed by the donee and thence-forward retained to the entire exclusion of the disponer or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise, and</P>
    <P>(c)  estate duty would, having regard to the provisions contained in the said foregoing paragraph, be chargeable on the death of the disponer.</P>
    <P>This Resolution aims at defeating a device for the avoidance of estate duty in respect of settled movable property situated abroad.  The device involves the creation of a foreign trust, that is to say, an external trust instead of an Irish one.  In normal circumstances, a man domiciled in Éire wishing to settle his property, whether such property is situated at home or is situated abroad, would appoint Irish trustees as trustees of the settlement and would have the settlement drawn up in such a way that it would be subject to the jurisdiction of our courts. For example, A who is domiciled in Éire has movable property (e.g., securities) situated abroad.  He wishes to settle that property on himself for life, then on his son B for B's life, and then on B's children absolutely. He appoints resident trustees in Éire and arranges that the work in connection with the trust shall be done in this country.  In those circumstances estate duty would be payable to our Exchequer on the death of A and also on the death of B.  Now, on the other hand, such estate duty would not be payable to us if A, instead of creating an Éire settlement, had appointed foreign trustees (e.g., foreign bankers), had transferred his securities to them and had ordered that all the work connected with the management of the trust funds should be performed abroad, so that the settlement should be a foreign settlement not subject to the jurisdiction of our courts.</P>

      <P>A case might occur in which a hospital had got a grant unconditionally before the Act of 1933 was passed.  It is proposed to put in here &ldquo;after the passing of this Act&rdquo;. The operation of this section comes under Sections 2, 3 and 4.  This would be what is called an assisted hospital. As the Bill is drawn that is the term that is applied to a hospital that joins the bed bureau.  The objection to that particular description is that there are to my own personal knowledge two hospitals in Dublin, one of which has received no funds whatever from the Hospital or Sweepstakes Fund, and the other received an unconditional grant some eight or nine years ago. Both of these hospitals might be agreeable to participate in the bed bureau scheme.  It is advisable that that should be as extensive as possible.  I can conceive a case in which the hospitals would object to being left out of it, but they cannot come in under this scheme without submitting to all these conditions which are regarded as being objectionable to put it as mildly as possible, or while they would be willing to tender cooperation and give information to facilitate the medical profession and the poor in connection with information <Col N="120" /> and accommodation at their disposal, it is impossible for them to consider the sub-section as it stands.  I have had no direct contact with either of the two of them on that point, but I can see that they would object to coming in and taking the disadvantages that are proposed under Sections 2, 3 and 4.  It would be unreasonable to expect the hospital which came in voluntarily to submit to such a thing as a complaint&mdash;a single complaint&mdash;more especially when that complaint did not emanate from the Advisory Committee.  The purpose of the amendment is to avoid imposing a condition which was not imposed at the time of the receipt of the grant and in the next place to extend and widen as far as possible the number of hospitals that would participate in the bed bureau scheme.</P>

      <P>The objection I have to this amendment is this:&mdash;the Hospitals Commission, so to speak, had certain powers under the 1933 Act in respect of hospitals which obtained grants before 1933.  Now Section 6 of this Bill retains the powers that were given under the 1933 Act.  I am advised that it is necessary to oppose that amendment because if I accepted it, it would mean that the Hospitals Commission would not have all the powers they have already.  That is the only objection to it.  I do not see how any hospitals are being brought in compulsorily.  Under amendment No. 5 that I have down any hospital that gets a grant can contract out; that is quite sufficient.  If I accept the amendment it would mean that the Hospitals Commission would lose the power they have in regard to buildings and fittings.  I am advised that that is the position.</P>

      <P>There is nothing at all in that section or in these two subsections here, assuming that they were <Col N="121" /> going to stand, which would limit the powers of the Hospitals Commission or the Minister when he gets those powers in respect of any of these hospitals.  It would limit him in respect of a hospital that was receiving no money, but not in respect of any hospital that is receiving it, because the Act of 1933 lays down what are the hospitals that are subject to this inspection.  The Act of 1933 sets out first of all in Section 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall, by order, establish a commission which shall be styled the &lsquo;Hospitals Commission&rsquo; and shall consist of not less than three ordinary members...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (6) it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every member of the Hospitals Commission may visit all or any of the premises of any hospital or nursing organisation which shall have participated in any sweepstakes promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and so on.  Sub-section (6) of Section 14 of the Act of 1933 brings in the Hospitals Commission in respect of that, and the Minister and the Hospitals Commission still hold the power to inspect.  The amendment does not cut out that power.  The proposal of the amendment is &ldquo;after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  So far as this particular amendment is concerned it is only dealing with bed bureaux.</P>

      <P>I am not objecting to that.  What I am objecting to are the two dates, &ldquo;1930 to 1932,&rdquo; because <Col N="122" /> grants that were received up to 1932 had no conditions attached to them. A hospital may have got a grant under that.  That hospital may desire &mdash;I believe they all desire&mdash;to come into the bed bureau scheme, but it may not come in because of the conditions attached.  If a hospital comes in now under the scheme, it is required to nominate a person in order to take part in the scheme.  Once a hospital comes into that scheme it will have to give not only the benefit of whatever accommodation, and so on, that it has, but it will be committed to all the disadvantages that flow from the control that is going to be exercised either by the advisory committee or the Hospitals Commission, or by the Minister.  That is the objection.  In view of all that, is there any particular reason for keeping out a hospital?</P>

      <P>My only difficulty in the matter is this: whether, by accepting this amendment, I would be cutting out the powers which the Hospitals Commission already has of going in and inspecting.  There has been no objection to that in the past. I know the hospital the Deputy has in mind.  There never has been any objection to the Hospitals Commission going in and inspecting the books, fittings and so on.  If the acceptance of the amendment would not affect the powers which the Hospitals Commission already has, of being able to go in and inspect, I would be quite prepared to meet him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to do that.  Under the Bill as it stands, a hospital can only take part in a bed bureau scheme by placing itself in the same position as an assisted hospital. There is one hospital that has not come in at all, but it is more than likely that, if the bed bureau scheme is going to be a success, that hospital would like to be in.  I see no means <Col N="123" /> of getting it in unless it is prepared to submit, like the other hospitals, to inspections and all the rest.  At present that hospital is not subject to inspection.  It is getting no benefit, and is, therefore, entitled to object to inspection.  So far as the working of this scheme is concerned, I can conceive a situation in which that hospital would not like to be out of it.  That is the sum and substance of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite get the Minister's point.  There is a proposal in the Bill to define an assisted hospital.  It is proposed in the amendment to delete paragraph (a) of Section 1, and to amend paragraph (b) by putting in people who have received grants &ldquo;after the passing of this Act&rdquo;. The Minister is afraid that if he accepts the amendment he may deprive himself of the new power that he is taking in Section 6.  Section 6 relates to Section 14 of the old Act in which an assisted hospital is not defined.  The latter provides that every member of the Hospitals Commission may visit the premises of any hospital which has participated in any sweepstake promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932, or under the 1933 Act.  Can the Minister think of any hospital that would not come under that, whether it is defined as an assisted hospital or not? Does not that provision cover every hospital?  If there is any possibility of doubt about this, I suggest to the Minister that it can be cleared up by dropping from sub-section (2) of Section 6 of this measure the words &ldquo;in relation to every assisted hospital&rdquo;. That, I think, would give the Minister everything he wants.  I do not see how the Minister would be depriving himself of the powers given under another Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one hospital which got a grant unconditionally from 1930 to 1932.  That hospital I believe is willing to take part in this bed bureau scheme.  Paragraph (a) of Section 1 speaks of &ldquo;any hospital which has participated in any sweepstake promoted under Public Charitable Hospitals <Col N="124" /> Acts, 1930 to 1932&rdquo;.  The only participation, so far as this hospital is concerned, was that a grant was given to it without conditions.  Naturally, there is an objection on the part of the management of this hospital to be brought in by reason of something that was granted unconditionally.  If the Minister were prepared to amend sub-section (1) by saying &ldquo;any hospital which has participated in any sweepstake promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Act, 1933&rdquo;, and were to leave out the other Acts referred to, that, I think, would meet the point.  Paragraph (b) of the section might be amended by adding the words &ldquo;from the passing of this Act&rdquo;. I think the hospitals could not complain if we put conditions on them to that extent.  By doing that we could not, I think, be said to be legislating retrospectively, and would be making it easier for all concerned to reach accommodation.</P>

      <P>The point I wish to make is that sub-section (6) of Section 14 covers every hospital.  I believe it does, and that the Minister need not have brought in this amendment.  It would not weaken the section to leave it out.  What I want the Minister to do is this: In the old Act the Hospitals Commission have power to inspect; I want the Minister to have that power, and if he says, &ldquo;the Minister may exercise any or all of the powers specified in sub-section (6) of Section 14,&rdquo; he gets everything he wants.</P>

      <P>When that amendment was put down, I understood it was going a certain distance to meet the case we had put up, but I saw the insuperable objection to it&mdash;that it was not an invitation to anybody to join, whereas I understand the Minister's desire ought to be to get hospitals in.  As far as the hospitals themselves are concerned, an undesirable situation might arise in which somebody in some part of the country would ask: &ldquo;Is that hospital one which is attached to the bureau?&rdquo;  and receive the reply: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  From that, some consequence or disability might flow, and it might be under a stigma because it was not.  I am sure that is not the desire.  I should prefer that the hospital bureau be of the sort that it would be open to every hospital to join it, but that a hospital would not subject itself to the penalties and inspections unless it desired to do so. If it is going to give something for nothing, I do not see why it should not be acceptable.</P>

      <P>This is possibly extending the matter further, but I think it is relevant.  I understand that the Minister gave a promise on the last occasion, and that that promise pretty definitely applied to the whole of the matters objected to in the Bill.  He was going to have this matter of complaints refer only to hospitals which under the Act accepted subvention from the Hospitals Sweepstakes.  If that was meant&mdash;and I understand it was&mdash; surely amendment No. 5 does not help us, as the Minister would keep in as a definition of an &ldquo;assisted hospital&rdquo; what is there already, and that is retrospective. <Col N="126" /> Then, when you come to Section 4, regarding complaints, they refer to &ldquo;assisted hospitals&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 5 excludes them from the bureau, and simply says you shall not include in the bureau amongst the hospitals any hospital to which no grant has been made out of the Hospitals Trust Fund after the passing of the Act.</P>

The Minister refers to amendment No. 5, but there is no reference there to &ldquo;assisted hospitals.&rdquo; It concerns the bed bureau.  Cannot a hospital join the bed bureau without being an assisted hospital?  It can, obviously, because the hospital may join the bed bureau without getting assistance.  It may be anxious to do so, and the Hospitals Commission and the <Col N="128" /> advisory committee may be anxious that a hospital not getting any assistance should join it.  I put it to the Minister that there is nothing whatsoever in this Bill which applies the definition &ldquo;assisted hospital&rdquo; as he now says it is his intention to apply it. In fact, if he put the words &ldquo;any hospital which participates or which shall participate,&rdquo; it would be all right. But he says that he does not want to include hospitals that have participated up to now.  Can we not make that clear?  My reason for asking that question is that it seems to be absolutely clear that the Minister's definition does not include what he means.  I think that, if the Minister were to make his meaning clear, we could have absolute agreement on that point.</P>

      <P>Under the Act of 1933, the Minister has powers in regard to all hospitals that are being assisted. Now, the plan is to extend those powers, and those powers only, to somebody authorised by the Minister. I suggest, therefore, that if there is just a transfer of the straight powers as expressed in the Public Hospitals Act of 1933, a deletion of paragraph (a) of Section 1 of this Bill might meet the Minister's requirements.  However, if that should not meet his requirements, then, perhaps, the Minister might produce, on the Report Stage, a substitute for paragraph (a), clearly manifesting the will of the House in regard to hospitals that may accept grants hereafter&mdash;that they shall come within the scope of the Bill that we are at present discussing.  There is no need for anybody to apprehend a trap being laid in this case, because I think we are all in substantial agreement.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the Minister cannot bring forward an amendment that would put definitely into the Bill what he has just now expressed.  Would it meet his views if, in regard to Section 6, we were to have something to the effect that all the powers now enjoyed by the Hospitals Commission shall be enjoyed by the Minister; and would he then bring in an amendment, in connection with Section 1, making it quite clear that &ldquo;an assisted hospital&rdquo; does not mean, for the purposes of this Bill, any <Col N="130" /> hospital that received a grant before the passing of this Bill, and also making it quite clear, on Section 6, that he is taking for the Minister powers that already exist, and thus get over his difficulty about the words, &ldquo;assisted hospital&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this matter <Col N="131" /> from the point of view of the hospitals. Certain of these hospitals may be willing to forego a very substantial grant for what they consider to be a principle, and also because they are in favour of non-interference, and yet, because they are willing to co-operate in the working of this bureau, they are to be subjected to all these conditions. Is that reasonable?  I think it may be taken for granted that a hospital that refuses a grant of £500,000, or whatever the sum may be, must have substantial grounds for refusing such a grant, and I think that they should not be subjected to all these conditions, merely because they are willing to co-operate in this scheme.  I think that the Minister should look into the matter from the point of view of these hospitals.</P>

If we were to make exceptions, I do not see how you can possibly operate such a system as this.  In any case, they will know the regulations before they go in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, that is a new point.  The present amendment that we are discussing is in relation to paragraph (a).  I think that the point referred to by the Minister would arise on his own amendment, No. 5.  We are all agreed as to what we want to do, and that is with regard to the definition <Col N="132" /> of what is &ldquo;an assisted hospital&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, a hospital that has taken a grant after the passing of this Bill into law.  Our difference is that we say that paragraph (a) does more than that, and the Minister says that it does not do more than that.  Is not that our difference?</P>

Have words lost their meaning? &ldquo;Each of the following hospitals shall be an assisted hospital for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;  There is no obscurity in that sentence.  We have three categories of hospitals liable to that description&mdash;category (a)&mdash;any hospital which has participated in any sweepstake promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts.  Now, hospital X applied for and got £10,000 in 1934.  Is not that an assisted hospital for the purposes of this Act, even though it notifies the Minister that it will never take another grant under any of these Acts?  I would ask the Minister either to strike that paragraph out or add to that paragraph the word &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo;&mdash;making it read: &ldquo;any hospital which has participated in any sweepstake promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932, or under the Public Hospitals Act, 1933 (No. 18 of 1933) after the passing of this Act.&rdquo; Either thing will meet the proposal of the leader of the Opposition&mdash;strike the paragraph out or make it apply only to participation after the passing of this Act.</P>

I put it to the Minister that if he takes that out no irretrievable damage is done.  He can put it back on the Report Stage if he finds that the Bill will not stand without it, but, surely, if he takes that out and deletes the words referred to by Deputy McGilligan in Section 6, the Minister has all he wants.  Will the Minister put in the words: &ldquo;any hospital which has participated in any sweepstake promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932, or under the Public Hospitals Act, 1933 (No. 18 of 1933), after the passing of this Act&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And may the regulations not be changed?  There is one point I had not noticed before.  The Minister has undoubtedly cause to be doubtful as to whether sub-section (2) of Section 6 carries him all the way he wants to go by reference to the other Act.  I think that can be met by a simple amendment.  If the Minister's amendments are put in, it goes very nearly the whole way with what is sought to be achieved by the amendment we are discussing, with this exception&mdash;it is possible to contemplate a hospital which will not take grants because it does not want to get in under the onerous sections of this measure and yet would like to facilitate the establishment of a bed bureau system for the purpose of providing information.  The moment it gets into the bed bureau system it definitely then becomes subject to the complaints section.  It seems to me to be a little bit odd.  I think that was a draftsman's device, but it is a device which has <Col N="134" /> landed us in that rather peculiar position. I can understand that if you are going to take funds from the Hospitals Trust Fund you are going to be subject to inquiry and complaints, but I am speaking&mdash;and Deputy Cosgrave is speaking&mdash;of the hospitals which will not take grants but which would like to join in the bed bureau system to provide information, but would not want to get into the bed bureau system if it means they are subject to the complaints.</P>

    <P>I think we can take these three amendments together.  Amendment No. 3 will ensure, with amendment No. 5, that the Bill will only enable a bureau to be established in relation to hospitals which receive grants after the passing of the Act.

      <P>Amendment No. 5 is very important, and in regard to the viewpoint with which I am concerned, there is very little difference between it and amendment No. 1.  I would not be satisfied that this amendment should pass the Dáil unless there were certain reservations, certain safeguards, to put it in its lowest terms, I should say a verbal assurance from the Minister, the nature of which I shall indicate later.  With your permission, Sir, I should like to quote from an interview given to the <i>Irish Independent</i> on May 6th by a high medical authority in Dublin.  At the beginning of this interview it is stated that the Ministerial amendments to the Public <Col N="137" /> Hospitals (Amendment) Bill do not meet the hospitals objections.  Further down it states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As far as I understand the situation, not one voluntary hospital will work any scheme which provides any opportunity for State control directly or indirectly.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will not tolerate control which would be detrimental not only to the hospitals, but to the whole Dublin School of Medicine.  That is something which should not be lost sight of.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It further states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;State control could lead to imperfections in the training of medical students, and, therefore, impair the future efficiency of the profession as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister realise that if what this esteemed gentleman states has official support from the voluntary hospitals, the victims will be the sick poor of Dublin who have been victims for so long of the inefficiency of the administrative and governing authorities of the voluntary hospitals on the one hand, and of the complacency of the Government on the other, in hoping that this problem would eventually solve itself?  If it is true that the voluntary hospitals are not prepared to co-operate in the working of this measure, and are given a chance of backing out at this stage, does the Minister not realise that the voluntary hospitals will become private institutions instead of semi-private institutions as they are at present, and that the suffering poor will suffer on?  Does he realise that if the voluntary hospitals take advantage of the loophole it so generously provides, the net result of all these years of messing about with the hospitals problem, all these years of flirtation with and wooing of the voluntary hospitals by the Local Government Department, and all these years of abortive negotiations between the Government and the voluntary hospitals, and between the voluntary hospitals themselves, will be, firstly, to decrease to an alarming degree the few beds available for the poor at present, and secondly, to waste irrevocably the hundreds of thousands <Col N="138" /> of Hospitals Trust funds already showered on these hospitals?  The point that strikes me in connection with the rather sharp controversy which has been going on for some time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will give me an opportunity, Sir, I will relate what I am saying to the amendment.  I have already quoted the views of a high medical authority in Dublin who interprets the various Government amendments as State control, and has indicated that if these amendments are carried, the voluntary hospitals will not support the bed bureau scheme.  I am developing the point, that as a result of that the whole effect of this Bill will be negatived, and I think I am quite in order in referring to these points at this stage.  I do not wish to criticise severely the voluntary hospitals, but I should like to know why the voluntary hospitals resent even the minimum degree of State control, and why the voluntary hospitals are so much afraid of what they consider to be State interference.</P>
      <P>I had thought I would be quite in order in referring to something which has been stated over and over again in connection with this measure&mdash; namely, that the hospitals were in danger of becoming subject to State supervision.  I should like to be informed by any Deputy if he seriously believes that the medical profession as a whole accept that the glory of the Dublin medical schools would be in any way dimmed by the direct or indirect supervision by the State over the admission of patients into these voluntary hospitals.</P>

However, I am quite content to abide by your ruling, and I will be satisfied by asking the Minister if he will give the House an assurance that, in the event of the voluntary hospitals withdrawing from the bed bureau scheme, in such a manner as to make its effective working impossible, he will take immediate steps to establish a State hospital.  It is only under those circumstances that I could consider supporting this amendment and, if that undertaking is given, I shall readily withdraw my opposition to it.</P>

We discussed on Second Reading a Bill in which the main purpose of the bureau was to provide information, and we now have an amendment which makes the main purpose one of facilitating, and the providing of information the secondary purpose.  I do not know what the Minister means by &ldquo;facilitating&rdquo;.  I presume that it means something more, by reason both of the necessity which the Minister found for putting it in and the place it occupies in the amendment, namely, as the first of the two <Col N="140" /> limbs.  It is that which governs the second, and not the second which governs the first.  The &ldquo;facilitating&rdquo; rules the giving of information&mdash;not the giving of information which rules the &ldquo;facilitating.&rdquo;  I must assume, therefore, that the Minister has a great deal more in his mind than was originally in the Bill, and I want to know what it is.</P>

      <P>There is nothing more in it than is in the amendment. It is designed to clarify the position as to the purpose of the bed bureau.  It is intended that it should obtain the information, and that that information, when obtained, should be at the disposal of medical practitioners and others, so that they may ascertain where they can be facilitated when they ring up this bed bureau.  There is nothing more in it.</P>

      <P>With all respect then I do not see what is the necessity of the amendment at all. Providing information and having it at the disposal of the people who wanted it had been already covered by the Bill. That was obviously already in the Bill. Now the Minister puts in as the principal portion of the amendment, the facilitating.  If what the Minister intends as the main purpose of the Bill is the providing of information, and to see that that information is disseminated to the proper quarters, then the two limbs of the amendment should be reversed so that it will be quite clear that the providing of the information is the principal thing and that the second, namely, the facilitating, has reference, as the Minister has now said, to the information and nothing else. The Minister says it clarifies.  My objection is that it does the very opposite because it puts in here a vague phrase that could mean anything.  It could mean grave interference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vague in the sense that it could mean anything. It is not limited, by any means, to giving information; on the contrary, it <Col N="141" /> is far wider than that and, if the bureau functions, it might mean serious interference with the hospitals.  I think if the Minister will think it over he will see that that is obvious.  Surely it is not designed to do anything but to give information?  There are two distinct things.</P>

      <P>Surely the purpose of giving the information which the bed-bureau will supply will be to facilitate practitioners in securing the admission of patients?  If that is not the purpose of giving such information I do not know what the purpose is.  I should like to emphasise this point.  If the hospitals withdraw to such an extent as to create an acute shortage of beds, the information provided for practitioners would merely mean that there were no beds available.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether he has considered that possibility.</P>

      <P>In regard to what Deputy Hannigan has said, I have hopes that when the Bill is passed we shall have the co-operation of hospitals. I do not think that it is going to serve any purpose whatever at this Stage to make threats, either veiled or otherwise. I have seen what some doctor has written in the paper, but, on the other hand, I have met the members of the Medical Union and we have got a fair amount of accommodation from them. I think the spirit is there to co-operate. I should not like at this stage to say that there is no alternative to this being done.  I do not think that is the way to get co-operation.  With regard to what Deputy O'Sullivan has in mind, that will be governed by the regulations. The phrase is simple enough. There is nothing sinister behind it. There is no intention of anybody inspecting hospitals for any purpose except to see that beds are available.</P>

      <P>A very important point arises in connection with this amendment and I would be grateful to the Minister if he could meet me on it, because I believe it would remove a very grave objection that has arisen in the minds of certain interested parties.  The amendment, if incorporated, will cause the sub-section to read as follows: &ldquo;The Minister may by regulations prescribe the manner in which any bureau established under this section shall be carried on and such regulations may, for the purposes thereof, define the duties of the governing <Col N="145" /> body or of any person taking part in the management of any of the hospitals concerned including, in particular, duties in regard to the admission of patients to such hospital...&rdquo;  The Minister's object is to enable himself to make regulations with regard only to the admission of patients to the hospital and to the demanding of information as to the accommodation available in the hospital.  Under the section, as it would stand if amended, he is entitled to define the duties of any person taking part in the management of any of the hospitals concerned and, in particular, duties in regard to the admission of such patients.  I ask him to delete the words in lines 45 and 46 &ldquo;including, in particular, duties&rdquo;, so that his power would relate exclusively to matters arising from the admission of patients to the hospital and the furnishing of returns.</P>
      <P>It might appear that the words which I ask him to delete do not extend the scope of his powers beyond that.  But I put it to the Minister that any court would read these words as implying that he had the right to make regulations in regard to any matters, but especially in regard to matters of admission and the requisitioning of information as to the accommodation. It is certain that the deletion of the words which I would like to have deleted will not weaken the section for his purpose, and, though in fact it may not improve it from my point of view, I believe it will, and I have good opinion of a legal kind to support my own that the deletion of the words would materially improve it and remove the danger which interested parties greatly apprehend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was kind enough to mention this matter to me beforehand.  I have been looking into the matter, and I think this is governed by the phrase, &ldquo;for the purposes thereof,&rdquo; namely, setting up a bureau.  I think that in that general way it governs the rest of the sub-section. You might have such a position as this.  Regulations might have to be made to look up records or see what the records were, or the number <Col N="146" /> of patients in the hospital at the particular time.  I am afraid that you might confine this too much if you do not leave something there to make general regulations for the purposes set out in the section, which are really relating to these particular duties here.  I do not think there is very much in it, and if the Deputy will leave it over until the Report Stage, I will see if it can be done.  Perhaps it can be done with safety.  The Deputy knows what the purpose is, and if it can be done with safety without limiting this power, which really is the particular power, I would be prepared to meet the Deputy's point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged.  It is difficult in choosing a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> to avoid being extravagant, but it is hard to think of an obvious case at the moment.  The Minister, however, will realise that if he has power to make regulations in regard to the admission of patients and the furnishing of information, those words would clearly give him the right to make any regulations which a court would hold were ancillary or vital to the admission of patients to the hospital. But if you widen the scope, the court might reasonably hold that the Legislature did not widen the scope without reason; that they must have meant something, and they would not inquire, as the Minister knows better than I do, into what was in our minds. They would simply read the Act as it stands, and assume that we had not put words into the Act which were not, in fact, necessary.  Therefore, if the Minister, between this and the Report Stage, finds that it does not make any difference, I ask him to interpret it in my favour.</P>

    <P>(1)  Where a complaint is made to <Col N="151" /> the advisory committee that any person was unreasonably refused admission as an intern patient to an assisted hospital or that the treatment of any person admitted as an intern patient to an assisted hospital was unreasonably delayed, the advisory committee shall consider such complaint and the grounds thereof and if they are of opinion that such complaint appears to be well founded and of sufficiently serious character to warrant their so doing report thereon to the Minister who may, if in his discretion he so thinks proper, cause an inquiry to be held in relation to such complaint and may appoint a person to hold such inquiry.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to place the entire responsibility on the advisory committee for dealing with complaints in connection with non-compliance with the regulations.  The section as drawn indicated the general trend of this Bill before the amendments came along, and it had all the appearance of one dealing with those Union hospitals worked under the Medical Charities Act.  It gave all power into the hands of the Minister, and placed him in a position to receive complaints from all quarters.  That is not desirable.  What is the purpose of this Bill?  Is it for the purpose of finding accommodation for doctors' patients who want to get into hospitals, for the poor, and so on?  If so, then those who are going to work the Bill are the persons upon whom responsibility should lie, more than on the Department of Local Government and the Minister.  Assuming that a complaint is made, the advisory committee will consider it.  No one wants to have a single complaint in the administration of this Bill, but where there would be non-compliance generally with the regulations, and with the principle of providing beds, that should afford scope for investigation, but not for complaints such as obtained under the old regulations where a workhouse patient could demand and get a sworn inquiry.  I am sure that is not intended here.  If this Bill is to be a success at all it will require the cordial co-operation of the hospitals, the advisory com mittees and others and it should be their <Col N="152" /> responsibility to deal with complaints. If the occasion arises and if a committee is satisfied that any of the hospitals are not doing their duty, then it is a question of having an inquiry held. That should not be a single decision. I am not ruling out a particular case in a matter of that sort.</P>

      <P>The next amendment, No. 14, will meet the Deputy's point to some extent.  Taking the Minister out for the time being, if a complaint is made to the Hospitals Commission they consult the advisory committee, and any rare case that may occur&mdash; and I hope there will be no case&mdash;can be reported to the Minister.  90 per cent. of the cases will be satisfactorily dealt with by the committee.  If there is still a feeling that there is something more in the complaint, and that it should be investigated by some people who are not interested one way or the other, I suggest, in the interests of the advisory committee, that it should not be investigated by them if the Act is to work smoothly and effectively.  You want somebody who can stand between the Minister and this body, and that is why I put in the Hospitals Commission if a complaint is made in any rare case that may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has more or less crystallised my objection. Assuming that the hospitals are in a class by themselves, and this seeks to inspect and to control them, they will have two masters under the new dispensation, the Minister and the Hospitals Commission.  I looked up the personnel of the Hospitals Commission. It changes occasionally.  It is a peculiar situation to have an alternating body almost in a supervisory capacity.  It is inadvisable to draw comparisons, but some of the advisory committees set up by the hospitals will be much more likely to be responsible bodies than the Hospitals Commission. They have experience of the administration of hospitals, and will be interested in making the bureau scheme a success.  They will be representative of the various institutions that have been responsible for treating a very large number of the poor for the last 20 or 30 years.  Why should they <Col N="153" /> be placed in an inferior position, and not be allowed to exercise not only the direction in which the bureau should be run but to pronounce whether it is a success?  It is very hard to see why they should not be allowed to do so, unless we want to see the country regimented in such a way that nobody but the nominees of the Minister or the Government, as the case may be, will be in a responsible position.  It is very undesirable to have the governing committees of ten or 12 hospitals in the City of Dublin in this position.  They have administered these hospitals, they know their needs, and have much greater experience in these matters than the Minister, his predecessor, or his predecessor's predecessors, or any officials in the Department.</P>
      <P>Why should not those who have been so long associated with the management of the hospitals have this responsibility?  The complaint is made to the Hospitals' Commission.  I see no reason why it should not go from them to the advisory committee to be dealt with.  I am sure the Minister does not desire to have this whole business so regimented that those concerned must always be looking either to the Hospitals' Commission or to the Customs House.  I am sure that his desire is to get the co-operation of the representatives of the various hospitals in having the necessary beds available when required. Why should not the committee responsible for running the hospitals consider the complaints?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that a great deal of valuable work has been done by the hospital committees, but it will be freely admitted that there have been complaints &mdash;and numerous complaints&mdash;with regard to the hospitals.  I am on a public board which frequently receives complaints with regard to the hospitals.  I fail to see why there should be any objection to the personnel of the Hospitals' Commission&mdash;why there should be any reason to doubt its ability to function because there are not frequent changes in its personnel. It is interesting to note that in the case of many hospitals the governors never <Col N="154" /> change.  The only birds of passage are the representatives of the corporation, and they do not enjoy the same privileges as the governors, and may not vote.  Virtually, their only function at the meetings is to criticise or praise.</P>

      <P>There are two sides to this question.  This bed bureau is being set up to provide accommodation for poor persons.  This advisory committee will be mainly constituted of medical men.  A poor person would, if this committee had to dispose of his complaint, say that there was no use in going there because the doctors would not admit they were wrong&mdash;a remark they would apply to another profession in more disparaging form.  I think it would be much better that there should be some body with which the advisory committee could consult or which would consult with them, so that when a poor person made a complaint, the whole blame would not be thrown on persons who would be solely representative of the hospitals.  The complaints would arise in respect of a hospital or hospitals.  I do not think that it would be in the interest of the hospitals that a committee representing them should have the sole right to dispose of these complaints.  Even if there were no foundation for the complaints, the people concerned would say that they had little hope of getting redress when they had to go before a body solely representing the hospitals.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposal is that the Hospitals' Commission should be the body to receive the complaint.  On receipt of the complaint, they would consult with the Advisory Committee and pass on the complaint, if they approved, to the Minister.  The Minister would then hold an inquiry.</P>

      <P>The Hospitals' Commission will receive the complaint and they may make up their own minds. Then, they will take it to the Advisory Committee and, with the assent of the Advisory Committee or contrary to their wishes, they can carry the complaint to the Minister who would hold an inquiry.  Under Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, the Advisory Committee is the body which would receive and adjudicate upon the complaint.  If they think that the complaint is well-founded, they will cause an inquiry to be held.  Under amendment No. 15, also by Deputy Cosgrave, the Advisory Committee would receive the complaint and, if satisfied in respect of it, they would report to the Minister and he would cause an inquiry to be held.  On the question as to who should be put in the forefront to receive the complaint, we have three bodies before us.  That question does not matter very much.  The question that does matter is who should have the voice as to whether or not the complaint is of sufficient substance to be brought to the Minister.  I understood the Minister to say, in connection with the previous amendment, that he understood the medical view was that they would prefer the Hospitals' Commission to the Advisory Committee.</P>

      <P>I can understand that.  I could imagine the medical profession accepting the Hospitals' Commission in preference to the Advisory Committee originally proposed under Section 3, because the Minister had a considerable say in matters under that section.  Now that we have, under the amendment which has been passed, a fairly free body, there is something to be said for having the Advisory Committee given something more in the way of decision than the Hospitals' Commission. Would it not be possible to have the Advisory Committee put in the forefront for the purpose of receiving complaints?  They would, if necessary, consult with the Hospitals Commission, and in the background would be the Minister who would hold the inquiry.  It is a question of securing the goodwill of the profession by giving the people who will be representative a little bit more say in connection with these complaints than they will have under this proposal. There is probably not a great deal in the matter.</P>

      <P>(2)  Such person shall be a Judge of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court or a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in connection with the person who would be appointed to hold an inquiry.  These are, of course, voluntary institutions.  They are not in the same position as bodies that are under the control of, under the supervision of, or requiring the sanction of the Minister. An inquiry is held into a complaint made in connection with the administration of this bureau.  It is a complaint, let us say, against the <i>bona fides</i> of any one of these institutions which are associated with one another in putting up a bed bureau.  It is a very serious thing for a hospital.  It may not, on its face, appear to be very important, but one must consider that no other organisations in the country have been so long and so favourably connected with the administration of charity, charity in its most acceptable form, with none of the disadvantages attached to its dispensation.  This system has been operating over so many decades, one might say centuries.  To put those people into the position of being one of the State-aided institutions of the country is unreasonable. <Col N="158" /> To that extent and to ensure that there will be no miscarriage of justice and that there will be perfectly fair treatment for all, I put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any justification for appointing a judge or anybody like that to hold this inquiry.  The inquiry will be established to ascertain certain facts, whether a person was refused admission as an intern patient to an assisted hospital, or whether there was delay of an unreasonable kind in the treatment of a person admitted.  There cannot be much difficulty in elucidating those facts or in assessing the evidence.  Even when the inquiry is held there is no power to inflict any punishment.  It may be contemplated that the Minister afterwards might say that he would not give a grant, or that perhaps he would restrict a grant if the case were a very bad one, but there is nothing in the Bill indicating that after an inquiry is held he can inflict any penalty.</P>
      <P>I imagine that the usual way of carrying out this type of inquiry would be through a medical inspector from the Department.  That is what I have in mind&mdash;a man in touch with the medical profession, with the hospitals, a man who would understand the working of the hospitals and who could well appreciate why there might be delays in the matter of admission or for the purpose of treatment; a man who could understand why a doctor at a particular time would think it advisable that there would be some delay.  What I have in mind is that if such a case arose we might have one of the medical inspectors who would be attached to the Department.  That might be the very best thing in the interests of the medical profession and the hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put his finger on the futility of the section. He mentioned that he can stop the grant.  In other words, he is going to interfere still more with the poor and with the dispensation of hospital treatment rather than with the complaint made in connection with the hospital. You cannot fine those people.  The majority of them are giving voluntary service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what is the use of it, simply dragging people into the Press?  To my mind this is an absolutely futile section.  Who is going to hold the inquiry?  The Minister said it was his intention to appoint a medical inspector.  I presume he would do so, but the present Minister will not be there for all time, and this legislation will be there until it is repealed.  Again, the Minister's Department has not been associated with voluntary hospitals as such except during the last few years, and then only to a minor extent.  His associations and experiences are entirely in another direction.  I regard this as an effort to bring regimentation where it can do nothing and where, if it were to attempt to do anything, it would be defeating itself and making itself a laughing-stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's point against the amendment appears to be based on the fact that there are only two matters which would come within the ambit of an inquiry such as is contemplated, complaint as to delay in treatment, or refusal of admission. Of course, that is so, but we all have experiences of inquiries, and we know that inquiries of the kind on which this is modelled have a habit of wandering over a variety of entirely irrelevant topics, perhaps very remotely related to the subject under inquiry.  I imagine that this class of inquiry is peculiarly prone to that type of thing. If a person complains of unreasonable delay in treatment, necessarily there will be a certain amount of direct or indirect accusation against medical people, against the nurses, the staff or the administration of the hospital, and these matters will give rise to very diffuse discussions unless there is someone there to control the discussions, someone trained to keep matters within the ambit of the terms of reference.  If there is not such a person, I am afraid that sort of thing will be very likely to occur, and may cause very serious injury to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Under the section as it is drafted the person who will be holding the inquiry will have very wide powers indeed.  Some of Deputy Cosgrave's subsequent amendments are designed to keep these wide powers within strictly legal limits.  As the section stands, a person who refuses to answer any questions, however irrelevant, however wrong or inadmissible from the point of view of the law of evidence, will be considered guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine.  The question of what is or is not relevant would be a simple matter, but what I anticipate is just what happens in all these inquiries.</P>
    <P>That inquiry is made a platform, a sounding board from which is broadcast a variety of entirely irrelevant complaints against all and sundry.  You have a person, say, appointed by the Minister who does not want the charge made against him that he did not want to let everybody have a fair hearing, and the result is that the inquiry is diffuse, and ranges over entirely irrelevant aspects.  In the course of that inquiry damage may be done to particular individuals and professional reputations may suffer. While the inquiry may result in completely disproving the charges made, there is the fact that the mud being thrown very often sticks, and the particular person involved in the charges will have no proper means of redress. It was to meet that that this amendment was put down, so that we should have there some independent person who has had some training in the conduct of inquiries and the laws of evidence.  The object of the amendment is to secure that such a person should be appointed to hold the inquiry.  Deputy Cosgrave did not put this amendment down in the interests of the legal profession or anything of that kind.  It is put down merely for the sake of seeing that the person who will be appointed to hold the inquiry has the necessary training so as to see that the issues are strictly confined to the subject matter under that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Costello, I just want to say <Col N="161" /> that those medical inspectors have experience of these inquiries.  From time to time a question will arise, and it has arisen in England before two judges there, and before one in this country, that certain persons were privileged.  The question is the privilege a doctor may claim as to his patient being treated for a particular disease; that there was more or less a privacy about it, and when questions like that arise a medical man is much better qualified to deal with it than anybody else.  I do not see what objection there could be to a medical inspector carrying out such an inquiry.  He has had experience of carrying out these inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must see the importance of this amendment.  The sub-section provides for a prosecution in the event of a witness refusing to answer any question.  The questions are very wide.  The person holding the inquiry has power to summon a witness and examine him on oath, and where he considers the document in the power or control of such witness to be necessary for the purpose of such inquiry, he has power to require such witness to produce such document. Then under sub-section (4) we have it that a person, &ldquo;being duly summoned to attend as a witness at an inquiry,&rdquo; and failing to attend, such person shall be guilty of an offence.  Any question, relevant or irrelevant, whether admissible or inadmissible, whether covered by privilege or not covered by privilege, the witness can be made to answer, and if he fails to produce a document he is liable to a criminal prosecution.  The object of this amendment is to make it possible that at subsequent proceedings the defence will be open to the person to say that the question was not a proper one to be put to him, and he can give the legal grounds for that.</P>
      <P>I think it is a reasonable amendment. It will not hamper the inquiry in any way, and I think that the Minister's reply to it has been entirely inadequate.  The person holding an inquiry should not have a discretion to say whether or not a document is or is not privileged.  I think that is so well known and established that it only needs to be stated.  In reference to certain matters, to say that the person conducting an inquiry should have a discretion is, I think, wholly wrong and inadequate.  I hope the Minister will not say that it will have to be left to the discretion of somebody to say whether or not a prosecution should take place, because that would pass all patience.  I think this amendment is reasonable and necessary for the protection of individuals coming to an inquiry to make their case.</P>

      <P>This will not prevent him from doing that.  The only point is that, under the section as it stands, a person must produce every document privileged or not, relevant or irrelevant.  The object of this is that every person appearing with a document should be able to submit to the person holding the inquiry that he ought not to be made put that document in evidence because of privilege, or for other particular reason.  It will be then for the person holding the inquiry to rule on that.  If the person refuses to produce the document he can be prosecuted, and can then make the defence that the document is subject to legal and lawful privilege.  At the moment, he has no defence, even in the case of the most sacred documents, documents which are covered by the most exclusive and well known privilege.  If a document is privileged, it ought not be subject to production at the request of a person who may not possibly understand the vital nature of it.</P>

If he is wrong he will have to produce it and the inquiry can go on.  If he is right he ought never have been prosecuted or ordered to produce the document. If the person holding the inquiry rules in a certain way he may get the document. If he rules in another way he may not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Such inquiry shall be held in public and any person interested in or who considers that his interests are likely to be affected by such enquiry shall be entitled to be present and to be heard by Solicitor or by Solicitor and Counsel and to produce witnesses and tender evidence.</P>
      <P>(5)  The report of the person appointed to hold an inquiry under this section shall be published and such person shall not in his report or otherwise make findings or comments on any person whose interests may be thereby prejudicially affected unless such person shall prior to the making of such report have been given an adequate opportunity of being heard in his defence.</P>
      <P>This proposes to insert two additional sub-sections, one of which is to ensure that if a person's interests are likely to be affected during the course of an inquiry, he will have an opportunity to appear there and be represented by counsel or solicitor, and to produce witnesses and tender evidence.  The other portion of the amendment is to ensure also certain rights, in order to give a person who would be likely to be prejudicially affected an opportunity of being heard in his defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>This section was intended as much in the interests of the institutions as in the interests of the people who make complaints.  It might not be advisable, in some instances, to have a public inquiry.  In the case of some complaints, it might only be a matter of a simple visit to a hospital. It might be quite possible that a visit to a hospital would suffice, and, even where evidence was taken, the institutions themselves might not desire that that evidence should be published.  The <Col N="169" /> practice has always been, with regard to such inquiries held by the Department, that counsel and solicitors very often represent the parties concerned, and there is no reason why that practice should not obtain still.  In the case of an inquiry that is about to be held, the parties interested are notified and allowed to have their representatives there.  That has been the practice in connection with almost all cases of such inquiries.  The second matter with which Deputy Cosgrave is concerned is this question of making the reports public.  Now, the practice with regard to all these inquiries in the Department is that the reports are regarded as confidential and it is a matter for the Minister to decide whether these reports should be published or not.</P>
      <P>That is the practice that it is proposed to follow.  Again, apart from that, the institution concerned might not desire to have publication.  For instance, if a complaint were made and, on investigation, that complaint were found to be completely unfounded, it might not be desirable to publish the report because, if you do publish it, even though there was no substance in the complaint, some opinion may hang on in the minds of some people to the effect that there must have been something in the complaint, and such people may be inclined to take the matter from the complainant's point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister's argument is, that if an inquiry is ordered on some complaint, and the complaint turns out to be of a rather futile type and with no substance <Col N="170" /> in it, if you make the report public, some odium may hang around as a result of that complaint, but surely the best way of avoiding frivolous and futile complaints would be to publish one or two of these reports? I think it would keep the Minister on the <i>qui vive</i> in this matter of whether he should have an inquiry or not.  The only alternative is not to have publication at all, but supposing it gets around that complaints have been made, that an inquiry has been held, and that no report has been published, surely all kinds of rumour will gather around in such a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I quite agree that rumours very often do much more harm in a case like that than if you were to publish the report, but surely what would be done in a case of that sort would be to publish the findings. On the other hand, if the complaint that was made the subject of an inquiry was found to be frivolous or unfounded&mdash;although it might not have appeared to be frivolous on its face when made&mdash;it might not be desirable to publish the report.  The point is that you cannot devise a rule or section that would apply to every inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just my complaint against most of the things that have been done by this Government since they came into office&mdash;that they will make rules and regulations of every kind dealing with everybody, which cannot be departed from, but that the utmost latitude must be allowed to themselves, their Departments and their officials.  Here is a case which involves only one or two matters: (1) whether or not you undertook to provide a bed and refused it, and (2) whether or not you left a patient there in respect of whom treatment was unreasonably delayed.  I do not know of any medical officer in this country at any time allowing that to happen, and, to my mind, there could not be anything more objectionable in connection with legislation in this House.  I cannot understand how the Minister's own medical officers did not object to this. I consider that it is a slur on the medical profession.  I am only arguing <Col N="171" /> in connection with the case of a bed which, according to the records, is shown to be available and which, when the patient goes there, is not available. According to the Minister's own regulations here, he can examine on oath. That, in common terminology, means a sworn inquiry.  If the results of such an inquiry are not going to be published, people will say that there must have been good cause for the complaint, but the Minister, in his excess of generosity, does not like to expose these people in the case of frivolous complaints. I hold that that is not fair to any of the hospitals, and I think that this section should be taken out altogether.</P>

Let the advisory committee say whether the inquiry should be held in public or not, and whether the report should be published.  There is nothing else involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that he does not know how he can penalise one of these institutions if a report from the person holding the inquiry was found to be against the institution.  In other words, if the institution was at fault, he cannot penalise the institution.  Under the sub-section a witness at an inquiry shall be deemed guilty of an offence if, after being duly summoned to attend as a witness, he fails to attend.  I can conceive the case of a surgeon engaged in an operation.  He is liable to a penalty for not attending.  Any person who, being in attendance as a witness at such inquiry, refuses to take an oath, produce a document, or answer a question where required so to do by the holder of such inquiry, is liable to a penalty.  A person objecting to, or being unable to attend, or, at his own discretion, not answering a question <Col N="173" /> renders himself liable to a penalty, and the hospital, which is the subject of the inquiry, is not liable to any penalty.</P>
      <P>The real point with regard to this is that it is an indignity.  If an inquiry is an inquiry to discover something, is it necessary to impose penalties such as this in order to get evidence?  This assumes all the characteristics of a sworn inquiry under the old Poor Law system, as it was known.  You have a suspicion that they will not answer, and you are satisfied that it is necessary to impose a penalty in order to get documents submitted or a question answered.  A question might be put to a surgeon as to the nature of an operation he performed.  If the person holding the inquiry is to have more power than a judge, surely he would be entitled to ask that question.  Would not the surgeon be perfectly entitled to tell him that it was not right to answer such a question, that it was none of his business, and he could add, even without being offensive, that it was an impertinence to ask that question.</P>

      <P>Would it not be to the interest of the hospital to ensure that every person who is summoned as a witness should appear in a case of this sort, where it is a complaint against a hospital in respect of one of two things: either not providing a bed when, according to the records, a bed is available&mdash;which to my mind is ridiculous&mdash;or, secondly, that a person's treatment was unreasonably delayed? <Col N="174" /> Is it conceivable that in either one of those cases the hospital itself would not be at pains to send in witnesses?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This section, even as amended now, gives authority to the Hospitals Commission to appoint any officer to inspect a hospital, and also gives the Minister authority to appoint any officer to inspect a hospital.  The amendment proposes to add &ldquo;but nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorise the Minister or the Hospitals Commission to interfere with the administration or control of the hospital by the governing body or management, or in particular to interfere with the medical, surgical or nursing treatment of any patient.&rdquo;  As far as the Public Hospitals Act, 1933. <Col N="177" /> is concerned, whatever powers the Minister has there, or the Hospitals Commission has there, it is now proposed to give that power to an official of either of them.  This is no limitation of the power of the Minister in his administration of the Act, nor of the Hospitals Commission, but it is inserted with a view to ensuring noninterference to the hospitals, as far as words go.</P>

Section 14 (6) is quite clear as to the powers of the Hospitals Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of performing his duties under this Act every member of the Hospitals Commission may visit all or any of the premises of any hospital or nursing organisation which shall have participated in any sweepstakes promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932, or under this Act, or which shall have applied for a grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund under Section 24 hereof or of any institution under the control of or assisted by local authorities and shall be entitled to inspect and examine such premises and the fittings and equipment thereof, and shall also be entitled to call for and be furnished with full information in relation to the management and the financial position of any hospital or nursing organisation and to see and examine all accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the governing body of such hospital or nursing organisation <Col N="178" /> and also all or any books and other documents containing any record of such receipts and expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It opens with the phrase: &ldquo;For the purposes of performing his duties,&rdquo; and I think the duties of a member of the commission under the Act are set out in Section 17.  That section opens with the words: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Hospitals Commission to do the following things...&rdquo; and I presume that that is what is referred to in sub-section (6) of Section 14.  Then follows a long section setting out the duties of the Hospitals Commission. There are five paragraphs setting out the various functions, and surely they are very wide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, or an officer of the Minister, only comes in here in relation to Section 25 when grants are being made.  Sub-section (5) sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister makes under this section a grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, he shall specify the purposes for which such grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such grant such conditions... provided, however, that no conditions shall be attached to the receipt of any such grant in any way relating to the appointment, dismissal or control of the staff of any hospital or nursing organisation.</P>

      <P>When that Act was passed its administration was restricted to a member of the Hospitals Commission. There are the chairman and probably five others, and each and every one of those can go at any time he likes into any hospital, inspect it and see whether various matters satisfy him or the commission.  The Minister, under the same Act, took power to make grants and he restricted himself so as not to interfere with the medical or surgical staff.  Now we are getting an extension of the power given to the Hospitals Commission.  The appointment of an officer of the Hospitals Commission and of the members of the commission are two very different things, as the appointment of an officer <Col N="179" /> of the Minister is very different from the appointment of the Minister.  I put down an amendment here setting out in black and white the other side of the bargain.  This is only a bargain on the part of one person.  The Minister first got his Act of 1933, and we now find that he wants more power, and we find that he wants more power for the Hospitals Commission.  There are two bodies now which can carry out these inspections, and not only two bodies, but any officer of the two bodies.  I have put down a very simple amendment that nothing shall be deemed to authorise the Minister or the Commission to interfere with the administration or control of a hospital.  Does the Minister wish to do that?</P>

We want to keep them within the limits of what they are to do.  Is it intended to interfere with the governing body?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to this extent. The Minister is now getting the powers that the Hospitals Commission previously exercised.  In his definition of assisted hospitals, the Minister is taking these powers in relation to hospitals that have accepted grants prior to the passing of this Bill.  To that extent the Bill is operating retrospectively. I would suggest that the Minister should look into this question of assisted hospitals and that he should cut out the four or five words in that phrase in relation to assisted hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned on the last occasion I was speaking on this Bill.  The Bill makes very inadequate provision for our housing needs.  I was anxious that the Minister should make some statement about the housing position and how people were to carry on.  I referred to houses that were being put up for that section of the community which require houses most.  That is a very good thing, but there are other aspects of the housing problem which have not been dealt with at all.  The Government, presumably, are finding it difficult to impose any additional taxation.  But finance is needed to assist people to buy their own houses. I should like to point out to the Minister that that is not being provided for in this Bill.  It certainly was provided in the past under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I do not know if the Minister objects to houses being provided in that way.  He will probably say that it is up to the people concerned to provide the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister some of the difficulties with regard to the building of houses in Dublin at present.  I do not know how far the Minister would agree with the statement that the older sections of the city are falling faster than new houses are being provided.  That can be seen from the difficulty that the Dublin Corporation have in condemning house-purchase?  Why could not the because there are no other houses into which the people can go.  Another aspect of the problem is that the Government have raised the cost of <Col N="187" /> housing by imposing duties on imported materials.  That may be all right from the point of view of the promotion of Irish industries, but it militates seriously against the building of houses by raising the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into details, but wish merely to mention some points and objections.  I consider that the Minister might very well have taken pity on people who want houses. Does the Minister consider it irrelevant to mention that there are no grants provided under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act?  I want to show how closely the housing question is allied to that.  I do not wish to raise a debate on the housing question generally, but to refer to a number of specific matters.  Has the Minister anything to say about the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, or is he going to provide any finances to enable that Act to continue?  Another matter to which I draw his attention concerns the duties charged on building materials. These duties, and increased wages, raise the cost of housing.  The whole question calls for sympathetic consideration of a Housing Bill. Grants for houses built in urban areas are not mentioned in the Bill, while grants are being given to agricultural labourers in rural areas.  It would seem as if the Minister was eager to produce a Bill about housing that would reduce the supply of houses to the minimum.  I suggest that this Bill, as a contribution to the housing problem, is most disappointing.  In fact, <Col N="188" /> I wonder that he has not had the hardihood to suggest that in present conditions building ought to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress the point raised by Deputy Dockrell with regard to the provision of grants for houses in urban areas.  As the Minister is aware, wages, costings, purchase of sites and other adjuncts to housing in urban areas are much higher than in rural areas.  Having regard to the very limited capacity of urban areas to deal with housing needs, the Minister should realise the importance of giving grants. He is probably aware of the distress which has attended the exclusion of urban areas from such grants during the past 12 months.  I am secretary of a public utility society, and I am aware of a case where a market gardener who erected a house was excluded from the grant because of the time limit.  I appeal to the Minister to consider giving grants for houses again, more particularly as urban councils, owing to the present financial stringency, are unable to deal with housing in the same way as boards of health in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how far the Minister will go in providing for those who come into the category of &ldquo;agricultural labourers&rdquo; or, as I think they might be more fittingly described, &ldquo;rural workers,&rdquo; how far he can go towards providing facilities for that deserving class, which is suffering greater difficulties than ordinary agricultural labourers.  Boards of health have extended very considerably their operations in non-municipal schemes, and the only fly in the ointment is that they have to fix rents that are beyond the capacity of the people for whom these houses were intended to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the appeal made by other Deputies that grants should be given in urban areas and that they should be retrospective. The Minister sanctioned the setting up of a Housing Commission last year.  It is dragging on for a long time.  I am sure it has secured useful information from evidence given before it by those who have a good knowledge of the housing question in urban as well as rural areas.  For those who have a good knowledge of the problem, it was merely a waste of time, for everybody knew a year ago, before the setting up of this commission of inquiry, as they know now, that the housing problem is merely a problem of finance. It takes different forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Brasier spoke of the problem from the point of view of grants.  Deputy Hickey spoke from the point of view of Small-Dwellings-Act loans, and house-purchase loans.  The Minister, when dealing with his annual Bill last year in which all urban areas were excepted from the grants, said it was represented to him that far more important than grants were house-purchase facilities.  I agree with that.  We have a new Minister for Local Government now and why does he not consider that aspect of the problem?  Both the question of housing grants and the question of house-purchase facilities are important. The Minister for Finance paid himself a tribute to-day&mdash;a tribute that I think was justified&mdash;in saying that he departed from orthodox methods in housing when he was Minister for Local Government and that he had achieved a substantial success.  With that I agree, but, towards the close of his career as Minister for Local Government, he adopted a policy which the present Minister is perpetuating&mdash; a policy of curtailing the grants for house-building in the only place in which any house building worth talking about is to be done&mdash;the urban areas.  He cut these grants out.  I know the cases of several builders in Dublin who had their houses almost plastered and painted and they were <Col N="191" /> cut out of these grants because they were a few days behind the 1st April last year.  They lost £45 a house in that way.</P>
    <P>The money stringency that followed was, to a large extent, due to Government policy and I hope I shall be in order in tracing the development of that.  The money stringency set in and no purchase facilities were available. The Minister is aware that his predecessor, in his first burst of house building enthusiasm, left the Small Dwellings Act to be administered by the local authorities in the way in which it was passed by this House&mdash;namely, that it was at the discretion of the local authorities to provide house-purchase accommodation up to 90 per cent. of the market value of houses up to £1,000.  The first knock house-building got came a couple of years ago when the Local Government Department circularised the local authorities that they should not grant a loan of more than 70 per cent. on the security of the market value of a house but that they could grant up to 85 per cent. provided collateral security could be found.  The Minister knew well that collateral security could not, as a rule, be found.  In exceptional cases, it was found but, as a general business proposition, it could not be found.  That direction cut down the operation of the Small Dwellings Act to the few cases where house-purchasers could provide 30 per cent. of the market value of their houses.  That gave the first knock to house-building in the urban areas. At that time, British insurance companies operating in this country, and operating largely in the City of Dublin, were lending money for house-purchase to the extent of 85 per cent. of the market value.  Why should not the Government assist in the only way they will assist house building by helping house-purchase?  Why could not the Government, within the last two or three years, authorise&mdash;they were not asked to provide the money&mdash;the same facilities for house-purchase that British insurance companies were giving here?</P>
    <P>In face of all that, is it not a farce to set up a commission of inquiry into <Col N="192" /> house-building?  It is money, and nothing but money, that is required for house-building.  The way to promote house-building is not to give money to the builder.  The builder who cannot build houses and put them on the market is not fit to be there.  Let him get out of the way.  The builder wants no subsidy except a bit of a grant.  That has the effect, in competition, of reducing the price of houses, but the important thing is to provide house purchase facilities on reasonable terms.  I mean by that that the weekly or annual outgoings should be amounts which the people who are looking for houses will be able to pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey says that they want 3,000 houses in Cork City.  We want about 25,000 houses in Dublin.  Through the housing policy of the Local Government Department, house-building has been held up in Dublin.  How has it been held up?  Subsidies were given by the Government for the housing of the working classes.  The subsidy was standardised in the case of slum clearances at two-thirds of the cost of building cottages or flats.  That two-thirds was fixed when the cost of building a cottage was £450, and the cost of building a flat £500.  Costs have since gone up.  The all-in cost of building a cottage now is about £600.  I am speaking of pre-war and not present-day costs.  The cost of putting up flats went, in some cases, over £1,000.  I think I would be underestimating if I put it at £850.  But, did the Government subsidy go up accordingly?  No. Their subsidy is two-thirds of the £450 for a cottage, and £500 for a flat.  The extra amount over that standardised subsidy has to be met either out of increased rents for the workers or out of increased rates.</P>
    <P>A charge on the rates of Dublin had to be made, with the inevitable result that it destroyed the credit of the Dublin Corporation; it destroyed our borrowing power.  When we went on the market and floated a loan for £1,500,000 to finance contracts that we had already signed and sealed with contractors who were building houses for the working classes, we could not get the money, and we are in that <Col N="193" /> position to-day because we asked the Government to pay the two-thirds of the present-day costs, and they refused. We had to go on the rates, and the higher the rates went the less was our security for borrowing, and our credit went down.  In the midst of all this, we have the farce of holding an inquiry in connection with housing.  An inquiry into the circumstances connected with the building trade in Dublin has been going on for the last year and a half.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He does, but if there are not purchase facilities offered it matters very little whether it is continued or not.  The heart of the whole problem is the question of purchase facilities. The grant was £45 for each house. What good is it to a man if he builds a dozen or two dozen houses, getting a grant of £45 for each, when he has not a buyer for each house?  I am putting that aspect of the matter to the Minister as a builder who has built many houses, hoping that conditions would improve, and as one who kept on his workmen rather than sack them. I am only one of dozens in that position in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would like to serve the building trade and to encourage it&mdash;I have no doubt he would. I will give him my opinion of one way in which he can serve and promote house building.  Any man with a practical knowledge of house building and house selling will tell him the same. What you should do is provide loans for intending house purchasers to enable them to purchase their houses.  If you do that you will help to solve the problem, provided that a continuance of the war does not interfere with the supply of materials.  I do not think there are any materials that we are short of now <Col N="194" /> or that we may be short of in the future, materials for which we are depending on foreign countries, if we except timber.  There are good stocks of timber here at the moment and we could do a lot of building before we would be short of timber.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to promote house building and that is to encourage the sale of houses.  The builders will not erect houses if they have little prospect of selling them.  That is the whole problem and there is no use in carrying on with the pretence of a little subsidy here and there or the holding of inquiries.  I want to know if the Minister is prepared to make any suggestion in that connection.  In reply to a question put to him by Deputy Hickey the Minister said they will sanction loans for small dwellings if the urban authorities get the money. Will the Minister sanction anything higher than 70 per cent. of the market value of the houses?  I would like to hear the Minister's answer to that.  Will he sanction loans earmarked for house purchase and direct local authorities to administer those loans in their respective areas?  Will he lend the money from the Local Loans Fund or otherwise provide it?</P>
    <P>In the course of the Budget statement we heard of all that is going out towards unemployment insurance, all that is being done to help the unemployed. Surely some attempt ought to be made to wipe out unemployment and not keep it eternally alive as a feature of our national life.  You want houses, and why not build them? That is one way to solve the unemployment problem.  You should create work, and here is one way in which you can do it.  Every Minister here talks around the subject instead of talking definitely to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that is what I have been doing.  I suggested to the Minister that one could assume that he and the Government were anxious, through the renewal of these Acts, to promote house building.  I was just dealing with a matter of which I have some little experience, and that is, the giving of grants and extending them to the urban areas.  I hold that they should be extended to the urban areas and the withholding of them from the urban areas and the giving of them to the rural areas means substantially withdrawing them altogether.  Comparatively little house building is done <Col N="196" /> in the rural areas as compared with the urban areas.  If the Minister is serious about helping house building, he should extend those grants to the urban areas. I take it that the Minister and his Government are anxious to promote house building, but I suggest that this will have very little effect in the direction of encouraging house building. What will have the real effect on house building is the provision of loans for house purchase.  There is only one way in which that can be done at the present time and that is through the Local Loans Fund or through facilities afforded by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, controls the Local Loans Fund.  Is he prepared to tell the House and, through the House, the country that the Government is anxious for the extension of house building and for two reasons: (1) to build the houses, and (2) to provide work and help to reduce unemployment?  Is the Government prepared to do that?  I take it the Minister is prepared to agree that three-fifths of the house building done in the last ten years was done by private speculators and the houses afterwards sold in the market.  But the sources which financed house purchase have dried up since the war.  Will the Minister say that he, through his Department and through the Local Loans Fund, will provide the machinery to buy the houses when they are built? The Minister must be aware that there are thousands of people prepared to put down anything up to £200 as a cash payment to buy a house.  The whole trouble is to raise the balance of the money.  But there can be no loss whatever to the Government, for this is a sound business transaction.  Will the Government provide money, making the local authorities responsible for its repayment?  As far as the local loans are concerned, it will be money lent on the credit of the local authority. Will the Minister provide that money and give loan facilities over, say, a 25-year period at a rate of interest that will cover the interest the Government themselves pay, plus the cost of administration? His Department knows the rate at which this will work out. <Col N="197" /> If he is prepared to say he will give the money for house purchase I can assure him that house building will start in the morning.  At present there is no other source in the country to provide finances for house building.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister are only deceiving the public in introducing Bills like this if they are not prepared to make available the money for house purchase.  Without that, house building cannot go on.  Deputy Dockrell has a large, long and varied experience of this matter from a different angle from what I have, and he will corroborate what I am saying.  So will any builder, and any man or woman of experience in this city, and in other places in the country.  There are large numbers of people who could put down £50, £100 or £200 for the purchase of a house.  If they could borrow the balance and have the repayment spread over a sufficiently long period, say 20 or 25 years, the repayments would not fall too heavily on them. When a young couple are getting married they have to provide furniture, and they have a thousand and one other calls on them, and they want something in reserve as well for unexpected demands.  They cannot afford to repay the loan by way of a high annuity.  That is why this matter is of some importance.  Private resources will go on financing loans to be repaid in 10 or 15 years at a high rate of interest.  Some insurance companies will give the loan for a longer period, but these require the borrower to take out an insurance policy.  There are lots of other charges, and when these are all added together they fall too heavily on the people who are prepared to purchase these houses.  If the Minister is prepared to face up to this problem, let him tell us what he is going to do about the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does matter.  If the Government carries on the pretence <Col N="198" /> that by giving a few loans in the rural part of the country they are helping house building, let me tell them they are doing nothing of the kind, because they are cutting out the urban areas, where house building is required and where house building was being carried through until the Government stopped it by its action.  It is a vain pretence to say that housing grants in the urban areas are not helping house building, because practically no house building is being done there.  If the Government are genuine about helping house building, they will promote or provide a fund for house purchase, and if they do that they will not be engaging in a shady transaction; they will be doing business on sound lines.</P>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, well aware that no losses to speak of did accrue from the millions of pounds lent under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I am not dealing only with the Small Dwellings Act from the point of view of loans, but as an alternative to the Act and an alternative to the question of grants.  If the Minister is really anxious about promoting house building let him provide the money and so help the people to buy their houses.  If he does not do so let him cut out the whole pretence and not proceed with this Bill at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join my voice in protesting against the penalisation of the urban dwellers.  If I remember rightly when the urban dwellers were first excluded there was a compensatory section inserted which was intended to enable the landlords in cities and other places to do repairs to property provided that such property was not likely to be included in a slum clearance.  I think that was an experiment on the part of the Housing Department of the Government.  As one who is interested in housing from the municipal angle, I think the experiment was worth trying. But the Department and the Minister should have satisfied themselves that the experiment was not to be utilised to exclude the urban dwellers.  It has been pointed out by previous speakers that the real effectiveness of housing grants can only be <Col N="199" /> found in the urban areas because it is there that the demand is urgent and the greatest need for housing exists.  It was not doing much good to give these people housing grants some time ago and then withdraw that concession. What I am saying now is, perhaps, not entirely relevant to the Bill but nevertheless the Small Dwellings Act can scarcely be kept out of consideration when dealing with this measure because the grant was the basis on which the loans were advanced.  In the absence of the grant no local authority would advance any thing by way of loan.  It seems now that the people of the cities are going to be deprived of the grant and loan and they have to go into competition with the slum dwellers.  That is to say, those people who are prepared to do something for themselves are being forced into the market and put on the same footing with the people in the slum areas with which the local authorities are trying to deal.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Government can advance any justification for refusing to do under the existing Act what had been done up to the time that it was passed.  Grants were then given, under certain conditions, for houses to city dwellers as well as to rural dwellers.  Under the present Act a line of demarcation was drawn, so that people living in one part of a county borough can get grants for houses, while those on the other side cannot. Why should citizens be penalised in that way?  If that rule was introduced as a kind of experiment, I think it can be said that it has now pretty well exhausted itself, and that the old practice ought to be resorted to whereby all city and rural dwellers can qualify for those grants.  The Minister, I think, cannot put forward any reasonable case for this continued exclusion of urban dwellers from the provisions of the present Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to bring to the Minister's notice two or three cases of hardship that have come to my notice.  The individuals concerned are in very humble circumstances. Certificates were issued by the appointed officer for the erection of <Col N="200" /> houses for them.  In two of those cases, when the houses were erected, it was discovered, on application being made for the grant, that the houses had been erected inside the area controlled by the town commissioners.  The result was that the certificates were cancelled, and that the whole liability for the erection of the houses fell on working men who, as I have said, are in very humble circumstances.  I realise that, as a general rule, it is not possible to legislate for hard cases, but I put it to the Minister that in this measure he should seek some way of making reparation to the individuals concerned.  The present position is one that is liable to a certain amount of misconception.  In areas controlled by town commissioners reconstruction grants are available for private persons, and naturally the presumption would be that the same facilities would apply in the case of people getting new houses erected.  Persons getting new houses built are not, of course, in most cases familiar with the distinctions made in different Acts of Parliament.  At any rate, I hope the Minister, in the cases I have brought to his notice, will find some means of providing in this measure a subsidy or grant for people in the difficult position I have referred to.</P>

      <P>When I moved the Second Reading of this Bill last week, I was of the opinion that, as it simply proposes to continue the 1939 Act, it would be passed through all stages in the twenty minutes that were available.  I knew that every member of the House was aware of the purpose of the Bill&mdash;to continue for another twelve months the Act that has been in operation.  I can quite understand the point that was raised by Deputy Murphy, but apart from that we have had a sort of roving discussion over the whole question of housing.  I do not know why that should be.  This surely is not a measure on which to have a general discussion on housing.  The Small Dwellings Act, I understand, was for the purpose of encouraging private building.  The Act was not being very much availed of. The building grants for houses in urban areas ceased on the 1st April, 1939.  I <Col N="201" /> was not the Minister in charge of this Department at that time, but I learn that the position was that at that period by far the greater number of houses that were being reconstructed and built throughout the country were situated in the rural areas.  In the time of my predecessor, that is to say between 1932 and 1939, 53,000 houses were built and reconstructed by private persons and public utility societies. Some people may complain that the progress made has not been sufficient, but, at any rate, there was a big effort to solve the problem that was there, and considerable progress was made. At the time that the grants were stopped for urban areas, the position was that 84 per cent. of them were going to the county boroughs, and to the county borough of Dun Laoghaire, and the remainder to the urban areas. The urban areas were not as one can see availing to any great extent of those grants.  The Department reconsidered the matter, and at the time that it was decided to leave the urban areas out they felt, consequent on the information that they had from their inspectors, that in very many cases the grants that were intended for the people who were getting the houses were not going into their hands at all, but into the hands of the builders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cases mentioned by Deputy Murphy, I can understand that, no matter what Act you are operating, you are almost certain to come against hard cases.  I do not know if any means can be found for dealing with the cases he has mentioned.  They seem to be cases of great hardship, and all that I can say is that I will look into the matter.  Deputy Dockrell raised some questions about housing costs.  These are questions which, I think, should be addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or to the Minister for Supplies.  I imagine that Deputy Belton could have informed the Deputy with regard to housing costs in Dublin.  So far as contracts are concerned, the tenders for houses received by Dublin Corporation before Christmas were at lower figures than those submitted in 1937.  The Dublin Corporation find that the tenders which they are now receiving <Col N="202" /> are, on the average, only about 10 per cent. higher than the contract figures accepted in 1936 and 1937.  I do not know what was happening then. Deputy Belton may be able to speak on that.  I do not know whether there was a ring at that time or not.  Certainly, on the figures, the competition does not seem to have been very keen.  What I do know is that in regard to the contracts for flats, which were advertised by the Dublin Corporation a few weeks ago, the competition to obtain them has been very keen.  It is all very well for Deputies to say that we should go ahead with house purchase.  I know, of course, that if there is plenty of money available, and if you are in a position to dish it out, you can get almost anything done.  At the same time I do not know if that would be the best way to approach this question.</P>
    <P>I did not expect that we would have a debate of this kind on this Bill.  It is all very well for Deputy Belton to say that the Housing Commission we set up was just window dressing, or words to that effect.  Whatever the Deputy may think, I am quite satisfied that there was a necessity for the setting up of a commission of inquiry on housing.  The report of the commission will be available in a short time, and we are likely to get from it valuable data which will enable us to deal with the urgent problem that exists in our cities and towns.  The most urgent problem we have to face is that of slum clearance&mdash;to get the people out of the slums.  We are doing that work as fast as we can.  I think it can be said for the Dublin Corporation that it has done more than its share in that respect.  We will give any encouragement we can on that most urgent city problem.</P>
