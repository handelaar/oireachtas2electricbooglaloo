      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether the actuarial examination into the Civil Service Superannuation Acts has been completed, and, if so, whether it is intended to publish the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. As regards the second part, it is not at this stage possible to indicate whether the report will be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been held up.  It was only in the preliminary stages when the war broke out and then, owing to staff requirements, the work was left aside and it has not been gone on with since then.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that a number of men who have joined the Army for the duration of the emergency and who previously were <Col N="824" /> plotholders under the Allotments Acts have been deprived of their holdings by reason of the fact that they have joined the Army, even though they are able to arrange for the care and work of the plot by other members of the family, and that considerable loss and hardship is occasioned to their families; and if he will take steps to secure that plotholders who have joined the Army will not be thus penalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any persons who were plotholders have been deprived of their plots by reason of the fact that they have joined the Army.  If the Deputy sends me particulars of any such cases I will make inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact.  Will the Minister say whether arrangements will be made that where men have joined the Army who held plots and who can get their families to carry them on, they will be allowed to retain these plots?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will see what can be done.  Under the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act, 1934, it is only unemployed persons who come within the terms of the Act.  I am afraid that the interpretation which will be put on that is that persons in the Army will not be eligible.  However, there should be some way of getting the matter dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that men who have joined the Army and who have had plots ought not to be deprived of them?  If we could get that admission, I think there would be very little difficulty in settling the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to go that far unless there is some unforeseen obstacle in the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that such men have also been deprived of implements and free manures and seeds that used to be supplied to <Col N="825" /> them; that some of them are halfway through the work on their plots; that they are now going to be deprived of advantages which the Government gave them by the passing of this Act; and will he see that the seeds, manures, and use of the implements are not withdrawn from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.  Of course it will be primarily for the local authorities to make those inquiries, but I will have the matter looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority have been notified by some Government Department that the free seeds, manures, and implements can no longer be given to these men, and the local authority have had to notify the plotholders to that effect.  I join with Deputy Mulcahy in asking the Minister to see that no injustice is done to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed Deputy Mulcahy that I shall look into the matter.  I am prepared to consider the matter sympathetically, but I am afraid that, as the law stands, there is the difficulty I referred to.  If necessary, perhaps the law can be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister also inquire into the allegation that when a certain man joined the Army recently a blind pension of 6/- was withdrawn from his wife?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Senior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether the dependents of the victims of the recent Pearse Street fire will be covered, because it is based upon the disaster in Pearse Street that this matter is now being raised, and will he take into consideration that disaster and make the pension scheme, or whatever compensation he proposes, retrospective so as to include the widows of those who lost their lives in the Pearse Street fire?</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state in what way secondary school teachers who join the Defence Forces for the emergency are affected in respect of (1) salaries, (2) increments, and (3) pensions, by reason of their absence on military service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic portion of a secondary teacher's salary is paid by the manager of the school in which he is employed and the incremental portion by the Department.  If a teacher joins the Defence Forces the payment of basic salary, or portion of it, to him during his absence, and the provision of a substitute, are matters for private arrangement between the teacher and his manager.  No payment of incremental salary is made to a teacher who joins the Defence Forces during the period of his absence from his teaching duties, and this absence does not count as service for increments or for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arrangement does not apply to teachers who are members of the Local Security Force and who may be called upon to serve in the Local Defence Force during an emergency; full credit for such service will be <Col N="829" /> given for incremental salary and pension purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made any estimate of what a secondary school teacher, who has answered the Government's call to increase the Defence Forces at the present time, will lose, therefore, as a result of his answering that call, by way of increment alone, apart altogether from the retrogression in his rate of full pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging, as the Deputy will see, from the answer to a later question, the number of teachers involved is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, even with the small number of teachers who may have joined, if, say, a teacher of 27 years of age, having five years' service, joins the Defence Forces and the emergency continues for two years, by the time he has reached his maximum he will have lost £288 as a result of his giving national service in response to the Government's call, and that if the emergency lasts three years he will have lost £414 as a result of his service?  Does the Minister consider that that is in accordance with the spirit of the appeal made by the Government to the country as a whole or to individual employers throughout the country generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, nobody is in a position to say how long this emergency is likely to last.  It may continue for a very long period. Secondary teachers are being treated, as regards enlistment in the Army, in the same way as other public servants. These teachers possess specialised qualifications for the important work in which they are engaged, and the absence of a substantial number of them for a protracted period from their schools might seriously affect the efficiency of the work in these schools. Every facility is afforded to these teachers to assist in the work of the Local Security Force and similar organisations.  The Department is aware that a number of men secondary <Col N="830" /> teachers hold responsible positions as leaders in the Local Security Force, and some of these have been granted facilities, with the approval of the Department, to attend special courses of military training to fit them for the positions they occupy.  This arrangement enables these teachers to render valuable service in the present emergency, without causing undue disturbance or disorganisation in their teaching duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, when the appeal was made by the Government to the young men of the country to join the Defence Forces, there was no intention at all that the Local Security Force would be a military force, and that it was only after several weeks' discussion of that matter that the Local Security Force was so organised that some members would be able to give military service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear to the Deputy and the House that so far as the treatment of teachers, in whatever category they may be, is concerned, in connection with enlistment in the Army or in the Local Security Force, regard has to be had to the position of other public servants, and as far as possible, I think, the Government's intention is that they should be all treated alike and that one particular section should not appear to get concessions which others do not get.</P>

      <P>I am unable to state the number of male secondary school teachers at present unemployed.  The records of the Department show that the number of such teachers in employment has been increasing annually.  The Department has, however, no information regarding the number of persons who obtain university qualifications with a view to taking up the profession of secondary teaching, and I am, therefore, not in a position to say to what extent, if any, the supply of such teachers exceeds the demand.  The following figures give the numbers of men secondary teachers in employment in recent years:&mdash;1934/35&mdash;1,375; 1935/36&mdash;1,401; 1936/37&mdash;1,417; 1937/38 &mdash;1,447; 1938/39&mdash;1,476.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £3,099,181 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Coordination of Defensive Measures; for Expenses in connection with the trial and detention of certain persons (No. 28 of 1939, No. 1 of 1940 and No. 16 of 1940); for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 15 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid <Col N="839" /> Precautions Act, 1939 (No. 21 of 1939); and for Reserve Medical Supplies for Civilian Hospitals.</P>
    <P>In moving this Supplementary Estimate I regret that it was not possible to give the House more time for its consideration.  It was not possible to do so, as circumstances over which I had no control necessitated the Estimate being moved urgently.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for the Army Vote, 1940-41, totalling £3,099,181, is necessitated (1) by the expansion of the Army; (2) by the employment of a larger number of civilians; (3) by higher expenditure on ordinary stores; (4) by increased deliveries of warlike stores; (5) by additional equipment required for A.R.P. services; (6) by the increased cost of miscellaneous services consequent on the development of the Army; and (7) by a special provision to purchase medical supplies to provide for civilian casualties in the case of air raids.</P>
    <P>The revised figures include the direct cost of the recently formed Construction Corps.</P>
    <P>There is a new item of £66,000 for reserve medical supplies to provide for civilian casualties in the event of air raids.</P>
    <P>The net increases under the seven headings outlined are, therefore, briefly as follows: pay and allowances of the Army (including Reserve), £1,869,661; pay and allowances of civilians, £99,502; ordinary stores, £316,504; warlike stores, £502,997; A.R.P., £217,388; miscellaneous services, £27,129; reserve medical supplies, £66,000; total net supplementary, £3,099,181.</P>
    <P>In introducing the annual Estimate, it was stated that our capital commitments in respect of military and naval stores totalled on 31st March, 1940, approximately £3,385,251, that payments on foot of those commitments were approximately £727,815, and that against the outstanding liabilities we were providing in the Estimate a sum of £460,651.  These figures must now be <Col N="840" /> revised.  Our capital commitments in respect of such stores up to 31st October, 1940, now total £4,157,475 and payments against them total £1,077,740, leaving an outstanding liability of £3,079,735.  Due to the fact that deliveries of such stores have been and are expected to be greater than was anticipated when the annual Estimate was introduced, we are providing in this Estimate against capital liabilities the sum of £963,648 instead of the £460,651 originally taken.  Should deliveries between now and the end of the year be greater than we anticipate, or should the expansion of the Army proceed at a greater pace than we expect at present, a further supplementary may be necessary before 31st March, 1941.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have had some different policy to announce than the one announced yesterday, as his statement then was to the effect that he empowered a Deputy to compile a list of persons to be employed at certain work.  It was to give the Minister the opportunity of telling the House what action he proposes to take now that I mentioned it, he having, apparently, seen the error of his ways.  If he does not propose to do that I can deal with it on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather anxious to hear what Deputy Hurley had to say respecting the facts and figures that he proposed to produce here to-day.  I <Col N="841" /> will take this opportunity to explain the position that arose.  In the first place, I wish to say that it is not a principle of mine to secure employment for individuals in the manner in which employment was secured for individuals on this occasion.  On this particular occasion I was informed on the Friday afternoon in question that a certain number of workmen were required to undertake work of a constructive character within the precincts of a military post.  I have had a considerable amount of difficulty in dealing with cases of workmen employed in posts, who were found to have given information to bodies to whom they should not have given it.  I have had anonymous letters in respect of those employed in posts, I have had letters written over the names of individuals, and I have had police reports in this respect: and I have had to take action by having such suspected individuals removed from the precincts of these barracks.  It is very necessary that persons who are employed in these posts should be at least trustworthy people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Friday on which I was suddenly asked to find something like 100 workers&mdash;between 70 and 100; I am not quite sure of the figures&mdash;I had to look around to see where those people could be secured.  As I mentioned yesterday, the labour exchange is not concerned as to whether they can be trusted within the precincts of a barracks or not; they are concerned mainly with other aspects of the case.  In every case I have sought to have people employed through the medium of labour exchanges.  On this occasion, because of the shortness of the notice, I began to ask myself where I was to secure this information.I thought of several people but, knowing that Deputy O'Sullivan was very closely and actively connected with the Local Security Force, I asked my secretary to get in touch with the police and see if they could get in touch with him.  They were successful in getting in touch with Deputy O'Sullivan.  Deputy O'Sullivan was given the instructions which I gave to my private secretary and which were to the effect that these <Col N="842" /> men should comply with the ordinary regulations in respect to being registered at the employment exchange, that they should be people who would be regarded as being trustworthy, that they should be members of the Local Security Force or men who had given national service in the past.</P>
    <P>The circumstances were such as I have described.  I was also told that the reason for the urgency of this work was due to the fact that members of the forces were living in conditions in Haulbowline which were not suitable and which would have to be remedied at the first possible moment.  I was assured that an estimate had been secured in respect to the time in which the work could be completed and that the time given was not sooner than the 31st March.  The Army authorities were gravely concerned regarding that, and said that they could not wait so long, that the premises would have to be put into proper living condition in a very much shorter time, and it was then proposed that they should do the work by direct labour.  I am glad to say that the work is practically complete, although I think it is only about a month or two since it was commenced.The men who were employed have in every sense given satisfaction, according to the engineering authorities, and the work has been carried out even more expeditiously than they themselves anticipated.  They write that down, possibly, to the enthusiasm of the men because of their connections with the national defence forces and because they entered into the completion of the work in that spirit.</P>
    <P>The complexion that Deputy Hurley is endeavouring to place on this is an unfair one.  I want to assure the House that, as far as I am concerned &mdash;and I am sure the House will not suspect me of doing other than I am stating&mdash;on every occasion that it has been possible to provide work for individuals who have given national service, irrespective of the political party to which they have belonged, I have done so and I will continue to do so&mdash;always provided, other things being equal, that their conditions are such as entitle them to work and that they are <Col N="843" /> registered in the ordinary way at the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to Deputy O'Sullivan. I have asked him if he carried out the instructions as they were passed to him by my secretary.  He assures me that he conveyed those instructions exactly as he received them, not to the secretary of a Fianna Fáil Cumann but to the secretary of the Old I.R.A. Association in Cork which, I understand, is composed of every phase of political opinion in the country.</P>

      <P>I gave figures yesterday as to where the men were employed from.  If they are disputed, I am prepared to hear them being disputed, but the fact remains that Deputy O'Sullivan himself, who did this work in the same spirit as I asked him to do it in and that was as a Local Security Force officer, assures me that he does not know the name of one individual who has been employed on this scheme, and that his interest in it was merely the interest that he should have taken, on a request from me, to secure from the two groups mentioned the people asked for.</P>

      <P>Even putting the best possible complexion upon the Minister's defence, I think it is a very poor one, and one which I hope the House will not have to listen to from any other Minister.  He has given himself all the credit he possibly could, given himself a character from Deputy O'Sullivan, a character from the engineer who had a job to do which he gave him to do, given himself a character from the men employed on that job; and, having covered himself with all these testimonials, he says that his responsibility has ended.  The whole thing is most unsavoury, taken in the <Col N="844" /> light of everything that has transpired in connection with this Army administration.It is probably the most objectionable of all the different administrations of the Government that we have had to review.  Last week, or the week before, we had an apology from the head of the Government, that the responsibility for not being able to have more arms was not the Government's&mdash;that it was not their fault.  One would imagine that it was to a group of children the Government was speaking.  Whose fault is it?  Who is charged by this House and by the country with the responsibility for having the Army in a proper condition?  The Government, of course.  It did not get its responsibility yesterday or two years ago.  It got it eight years ago.  It was trusted then and it has failed, on its own statements, in its job.  In these circumstances, of course, it is a mockery to discuss the Minister's statement on this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is introduced to-day with a very brief and cursory statement by the Minister for Defence.  However, as we all know, the material of this Estimate was laid before the Defence Conference, and I am obliged to say that any information we wanted was given to us; but it is important to add this, because it is something that I am afraid this House and the country sometimes loses sight of: there is not in this country a national Government, and the duties of the constituent parts of the Defence Conference must be borne in mind if the nature of the work done there, and the extent of this House's delegation of its duty, is to be appreciated.  The Defence Conference consists of two elements, one composed of the Government and the other of the Opposition Parties in this House for a restricted purpose: consultation and advice in regard to matters of defence.  It is the duty of the Government to define policy.  They are the elected Government of the country.  They command a clear majority of this House.  No matter of policy is relevant to the proceedings of the Defence Conference. The duty of the Opposition, and this <Col N="845" /> duty the Opposition have discharged, on that conference is to consult and advise with the Government on matters concerning defence within the four corners of Government policy.  It is neither the right nor the duty of the Opposition to define that policy or to control that policy.  It is important to remember that it is not within the power of the Opposition to define or control that policy.  We went into this arrangement with our eyes open, knowing the ambit of our function and prepared to do our best within that ambit, and so far, I think, useful work has been done, but the usefulness of that work would be gravely jeopardised if all sides did not keep before their minds the fact that the limits of our co-operation are clearly defined by the limits of a policy which we of the Opposition have had no hand in forming and no responsibility for putting into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I do not believe that it is practical politics, in a time of emergency approximating to a state of war, to discuss in detail our defence arrangements in the public forum. There might be many matters which could profitably be discussed arising out of defence if times were normal. The advantages of discretion in existing circumstances, however, in my opinion, far out-weigh whatever advantages might result from a full and comprehensive discussion at the present time. Now I believe, Sir, although my views on Government policy are pretty well known, and they are known not to coincide with that Government policy, that the limited measure of co-operation which has been proceeding has a very material value, and I believe that, so long as we can make it continue, we are doing a service for this country. But there is no use concealing that I, in common with every member of this House, listened with consternation to the tale that was told here about what happened at Haulbowline.  I listened with regret to the comments of the Minister for Defence upon it.  I could understand any man committing an error of judgment.  I could understand any man, in an hour of emergency, precipitately adopting a course of action without due reflection as to how <Col N="846" /> that course of action would appear to other persons.  I could see myself, if I were pressed in difficult conditions, taking measures while what was foremost in my mind was the safety of the State and the preventing of sabotage, or some other deplorable incident, from the actions of ill-intentioned persons: I could conceive myself taking steps in that situation which, examined a month or six weeks later, would be open to the gravest possible misinterpretation; but if such circumstances did transpire I would feel it incumbent on me to say publicly: &ldquo;I admit, looking at the course of action I adopted with the best intentions in the world (1) that it was open to the gravest possible misinterpretations in the country, and (2) were it accepted as a regular or justifiable proceeding in the situation I have outlined, it might constitute a precedent which would be wholly undesirable from the point of view of the public service and the public life of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think if an approach of that kind were made to this situation, the Government would not find a captious desire in any part of this House to create unjustifiable suspicions, but if the Minister gets up and says: &ldquo;I have no apology to make to the House for doing it: I did it for the purpose of securing the service of certain types of persons on the ground of their national record, and I think it was a proper procedure to pursue,&rdquo; then all I can say is, I do not think it was.  I think it was a very improper procedure to pursue.I think there were plenty of persons in whose discretion and in whose detachment confidence could be placed other than members of the Minister's Party from 120 miles distant in West Cork.  How, in the name of Providence, any man, however well-intentioned, and I have no reason to believe that Deputy O'Sullivan is anything but well-intentioned, living 120 miles away, could have intimate knowledge of the background and activities of the residents of Cobh, surpasses me to understand.I live almost as near to Cobh as Deputy O'Sullivan, and I live in the County Mayo, and I do not know the name or address, the background or history or antecedents or the current of <Col N="847" /> activities of any single individual in Cobh.  Possibly, Deputy O'Sullivan knows a little more than that, but he cannot know very much more.  To suggest that, out of all the responsible persons in the Cobh area, he was the only person to whom this task could be committed seems to me to be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Now, there will be those who will say that it might be very much better to leave this matter between Deputy Hurley and the Minister.  If I believed it was in the interests of this country to precipitate a gross public scandal at the present time, of a character envisaged by the Minister's statement yesterday, I think I would perhaps have concurred in that view, but I do not think it is in the interests of the country to do that.  If it has got to be done, then it has got to be done, and we have got to take the consequences.</P>
    <P>I would very much sooner see an explanation vouchsafed to the House which would carry conviction to every side of the House that, while there might have been an error of judgment, and imprudence, perhaps, this is not one emerging incident of a considered policy of corrupt interference with the proper procedure for the appointment of public servants.  If conviction of that cannot be carried to all sides of the House, we have to face the other thing and meet it as best we can, but it would be a very grave misfortune, in my opinion, if that has to be done, and it is for that reason that I have intervened at this stage, firstly, to emphasise the limits of the cooperation which the Defence Conference enables us and requires us to give to the Government, and, secondly, to emphasise what appears to me the serious gravity of the possibilities of misunderstanding throughout the country which may result from the version of the Haulbowline incident given by Deputy Hurley and the comment made upon it by the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>Inside the stockade of rifles and other armaments for which this Vote is expected to pay, we <Col N="848" /> have here an Irish Parliament, and I think that some kind of a common voice ought to go from that Parliament in regard to this Estimate.  This Parliament here is an expression of the electorate's votes; it is built up here to look after the general interests of the people.  It has serious responsibilities and serious duties, and in so far as the principal duty which has attracted its attention, or which has been referred to it by the Government in this emergency, is concerned, I think it is doing its best to discharge it and to shoulder its responsibilities in the best possible way.</P>
      <P>A very large number of voices in this House are sent to inform, guide and direct the Government in its policy.  It might be a little inconvenient and it might not be very helpful if all these voices were raised to-day to inform, guide and instruct the Government in the realms of foreign affairs and defence; but outside foreign affairs and defence, and because of the reaction of foreign affairs and defence on the country, some of the other responsibilities that fall on Deputies are very seriously increased, and up to the present because of circumstances which we all appreciate, the voices which inform and direct Parliament have not had an opportunity of looking after, to the extent to which they perhaps ought to be looked after, the other duties and responsibilities which, in the general interests of the people, fall on Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary, in view of the estimate of the state of affairs made by the Government, and in view of the appeal made by the Government, to build up our defence forces in the way in which they are being built up and to pay for that building up.  There are very many people who will consider £3,000,000 odd a big extra bill for the Army.  That is a matter over which the people, in the present circumstances of the country, have no control, and it would be unfortunate if the men in the Army or those persons who, in voluntary and other ways, are giving assistance in the strengthening of the country from a defence point of view at present, should be made to feel that <Col N="849" /> they were in any way a financial blister on the country.  I think we ought to make it clear that this money is necessary to support the machinery which the Government is building up for the country's defence and that if it is realised that more money is necessary, more money will have to be found.</P>
    <P>The appeal I should like to go from Parliament to our Defence Forces, our Local Security Force and everybody who has a hand in building up our defences is that they should expend all their energies in working to complete our defensive organisation and should realise that every day is important.We appreciate very much the enormous amount of work which has been thrown not only upon the senior Army officers but upon the senior Army officers in handling the work of increasing the Army to its present strength.  A very substantial number of young men, new men, have been brought into the Army.  They have had to be organised and trained, and only somebody who is in close touch with, or has had some experience of, Army work, will realise the amount of work which has had to be done in a loyal, devoted and efficient way by a large number of both senior and junior officers.  The same applies to the Guards throughout the whole country in the service they render in holding out the hand of guidance and assistance to the young men who have come forward to organise and work the Local Security Force.  We appreciate all the work that has been done in that way and we appreciate the work done by people connected with A.R.P. and first-aid services, but I should like to call out to them that there is a time factor in their work, perhaps related, but not necessarily related, to defence, and it is in its relation to other matters that I would call on them to speed up their work.</P>
    <P>The number of men in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; section alone of the Local Security Force is something like 90,000.  These men are not only soldiers but citizens, and in so far as Parliament has to be guided on economic, political and social work inside the country, they have not only their rights but their duties to watch <Col N="850" /> in the present situation and to help in the present situation by action, advice and public speaking.  There is a danger that, just at the present stage of building up our Defence Forces, the exercise of our rights and our duties to discuss public policy may have a detrimental effect on the consolidation of men, who have varying opinions on economic matters, or on incidental aspects of policy into an armed force that will stand solidly shoulder to shoulder against any danger and in pursuit of the policy dictated by the Parliament here.  Discussion of economic, social and political matters here cannot indefinitely be deferred.  Serious as they are, every day of the present emergency that passes, with the reaction of outside events on us, increases the necessity for thought and, therefore, increases the necessity for discussion of these matters.</P>
    <P>I should like to feel that Parliament as a whole, in passing this Estimate, appeals, in the first place, to the men and women connected with our defensive and first-aid services throughout the country to speed up their work and to perfect their organisation, so that we may know that such forces as are standing there are standing ready to be operated at any time in connection with any emergency; but that as they are standing so solidly and so clearly as soldiers and workers in a defence section, that solidarity and strength will not be in any way injured by differences of opinion on other matters, because what we want the armed forces of the country to protect is the sovereignty of our Parliament here.</P>
    <P>What we want our Parliament for is an exchange of ideas and opinions, illuminated by the exercise of that reason and intelligence given to all of us.  In that fashion, we shall find the best way out of our difficulties.  The best way will not be a way with which everybody will agree.  But it will be the way which would be chosen, after free discussion on Irish public platforms and in an Irish Parliament, by men and women who were shouldering their duties and responsibilities and thinking about their country's problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> I want to say, again, that this money is necessary for the purpose for which it is asked, that we appreciate the way in which the country has risen to build up our Defence Forces, that we appreciate, particularly, the action of the men who are bearing the major share of responsibility and that we appeal to them to realise that they are there to protect the sovereignty of the Irish Parliament and that, in that Parliament, various views will be expressed in discussing the important matters which have to be discussed and that we do hope that, in the same ready and intelligent spirit in which they have come to build up the Defence Forces, they will come to understand that the expression of varying views on particular subjects here is not undermining the Irish Parliament but building it up and that it can only be built up, and do the work which an Irish Parliament should do for its people if there is that expression of opinion here.  The more serious the dangers, the more must Parliament be alive to all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I listened with some interest to Deputy Mulcahy and I am rather at a loss to know at what he was driving.  He spoke about dangers, about rights and duties and about people undermining the loyalty of the members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke of the danger of talk by some people weakening the loyalty of the Defence Forces.  I do not suggest that the Deputy was referring to me, but I want to say that amongst no element in the country is loyalty greater than amongst the working classes.  No element has fought harder or with more determination for the freedom of the country than the working classes.  That loyalty is there still.  I want, however, to urge upon the House and upon the Government that economic defence and security is just as important as military defence and security.  What I am worrying about is the fact that while <Col N="852" /> we have so many men in the Defence Forces, we have, at the same time, so many thousands idle who should be producing goods and wealth for the country.  I have great respect for any man who is ready to make sacrifices for the country.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to the Gárda force and, from my experience, I think that that would be a model force for any country.  They have stood up against certain influences and have done their duty manfully, without fear or favour.  So long as we have such a force, we are fairly safe.  I am not so happy at all about the economic position.  While I am agreeing to the expenditure on the Army, I think that we should also be in a position to find money for the economic interests of the country, to safeguard our people and keep them from the poverty line, on which many of them are.  That is a danger.  It is hard to expect much loyalty from a man who does not know where to find his breakfast and who is up against a desperate problem of poverty.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the case of a man who joined the Army recently in Cork and who had been unemployed for some time.  He has six children and he was receiving 19/- in assistance, while his wife was receiving 6/- as a blind pension.  The family were, therefore, receiving 25/- and were paying 4/- per week of that for rent.  The moment that man joined the Army the 6/- blind pension was taken from his wife.  In addition, 1/9 was deducted from his allowance when his eldest boy reached 16 years of age a short time ago.  I want to impress on the Government that if they want people to defend the country they must give them something to defend.  They must be given some hope for the future.  In the war against the British Empire, the civil war and the economic war, the working classes stood up to the test 100 per cent.  They never murmured while the struggles were on and, even if they had gone farther, they would not have murmured.I should like the Government to take notice of that because I am afraid there is too much complacency and too much indifference regarding the position of large masses of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> Of our population of 2,968,000, there are only 1,339,000 over 14 years of age usefully occupied.  That number includes messenger boys drawing from 7/6 to 10/- per week, and the poor little girls who are only on part-time in some of our factories.  While we have 137,000 old age pensioners, we have over 120,000 unemployed.  In view of that number who are on the border line of starvation, we have 2,500 persons who, after paying income-tax and surtax, amounting to £515,000, have still between them a net income of over £8,500,000.  I say with a full sense of responsibility that, while that position prevails, we cannot have that economic security and that loyalty amongst the masses of the people which we wish to have.  So much for that.  I hope the Government will take heed of what I have said.</P>
    <P>I want to put a few questions on the Estimate before us.  I should like to know how many gas masks we have. Did the Minister receive any tenders for the making of these gas masks from any Irish firm?  Were the prices quoted by an Irish firm lower than those quoted by the firm who has supplied the masks?  Was a second price quoted for these masks by an Irish firm since the first tender and, if so, was it cheaper than the first?  Is the Minister aware that machinery was put in and workers trained to make these gas masks in this country?  I should also like to know from the Minister when the last order was placed for those gas masks.  Further, I want to know the name of the firm which supplied them; I want to know whether they have a local agent in this country and, if so, who he is and what commission is being paid to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of items here of which I should like the Minister to give some explanation.Before I come to them, I should like to ask whether the Minister is prepared to tell the House and the country <Col N="854" /> what is the position of the Army at the moment.  How far has it got with regard to the defence of this country? How far has it got with regard to the buying of aeroplanes, guns, and so on?  Under sub-head A (1) a sum is provided for military education for officers abroad.  Is that for the current year or last year?  Are there some officers of this State abroad at the moment?  Sub-head A (3) deals with the expenses of equitation teams at horse shows.  That was apparently for last year?  I did not know that the jumping team was abroad last year at all.  Sub-head G refers to lodging, subsistence and other allowances.  There is an additional sum required for lodging, fuel and light and children's allowances, and subsistence allowance.  I should like the Minister to tell us what that is?  What I am getting at is this; when a war is on or when the country is preparing for war everybody is asked to have a hush-hush policy, but when the war is over the scandals are exposed, everybody impeaches everybody else, and asks how those things were permitted to occur.  We have only to throw our minds back to 20 or 25 years ago to the scandals in Great Britain with regard to the running of the last war.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to relate sub-heads I and J.  Sub-head I refers to the conveyance of stores, etc.; an additional sum of £6,880 is required for the conveyance of military stores.  Sub-head J deals with mechanical transport; an additional sum is required for the purchase, hire and maintenance of mechanical transport, £180,897.  The total under the two sub-heads is roughly £187,000.  Now, if we are buying mechanical transport and equipment, surely that transport is for the purpose of the conveyance of stores for the Army?  I should like, therefore, to have an explanation from the Minister as to what is the meaning of the two sums.  Could not the sum of £6,880 be dispensed with?  Surely the sum of £180,897 for mechanical transport is sufficient to carry military stores from Donegal to Cork altogether?  I take it that the stores are all being transported by mechanical transport.  I should like to hear from the Minister how he justifies that sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Sub-head M deals with clothing and equipment, and the additional sum required is £438,495.  I am not saying that that sum is not required, but what I should like the House and the country to be assured on is that this money is being economically spent, first of all with regard to the giving out of those contracts, and secondly, that very active and stringent steps are being taken to see that the best is got for this money.  Again, one has only to throw back one's mind to 20 or 25 years ago to see the scandals that took place in matters of this kind.  Under sub-head K, provisions and allowances in lieu, the additional sum required is £415,041.  That seems to me a very substantial sum to be given out in the way of allowances, because appeals are being made every week to the public in general with regard to the condition of supplies in the State, and as the Army is not actually at war I do not see why some of those stringencies which it is endeavoured to impose on the civilian population would not be applied to the Army.  I do not think they should be any less patriotic in that regard, at least when they are not on actual service.  If they were at war, and having to endure all the suffering involved in war, I would not raise a matter of this kind.  Even in the European war, we know what took place.  We know there were endless millions' worth of food wasted out of pure recklessness arising out of administration.  I should like the Minister to see to it that, while those men are reasonably well fed, they will not waste food while other people are in want, and while everybody is being asked to make sacrifices with regard to the consumption of food.  We had a speech, I think on Sunday last, from the Taoiseach telling the people that the condition of this country may become graver and graver.  I take that warning as being accurate, and if it applies to the public generally I think it should also apply to the Army.</P>
    <P>Sub-head CC refers to reserve medical supplies for civilian hospitals, and the note to that sub-head reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of recovering this <Col N="856" /> expenditure from the local authority, etc., concerned is under consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell the House and the country if these supplies have been already purchased.  Are they in the hands of local authorities?  If not, is he procuring them, and is he transmitting them to the local authorities to be retained as an emergency supply?  I would like to hear from him also in regard to this sum of £66,000 in the Estimate for reserve medical supplies for civilian hospitals; how it is going to be administered; what check he will have upon it; whether it is to be recovered; whether it comes out of direct taxation or out of the local authorities in rates, I think close watch should be kept on that item to see that with regard to purchase and distribution there is no waste or loss.  Where medical supplies are being transmitted into the hands of medical officers, are they in charge and are they being properly stored so that any that is on hands over a considerable time will not go to loss?</P>
    <P>There is a sum of £6,000,000 in the Estimate for this year and I think it is only right, seeing the sacrifices the people are being asked to make to contribute this money, that the House should see that scrupulous care is taken by the Minister.  He has got now an assistant Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary and I think rigid supervision should be applied to the administration by his Department of that £6,000,000.  The county would have been aghast some years ago if such a sum had been proposed to it. I am not saying it is being badly spent now at all.  On the contrary.  I only want to see that if money is taken from the people the last penny of it is well spent and that none of it goes to loss.  It is a natural thing always when a huge organisation like an army is got together that the disposition is to waste and to be extravagant.  There are hundreds of people in this country carrying on business on a restricted supply of petrol.  They are not able to carry on their normal business owing to the restrictions in petrol.  I hope the Minister will see that with regard <Col N="857" /> to the Army there is no reckless running about of mechanical transport or wastage of petrol.  The same thing applies to food and clothing.  I suppose it is hardly fair to ask the Minister to tell the House and the country how far he has actually got with regard to effective equipment for the protection of this country.  We have a considerable Army now and I am sure the country is anxious to know if that considerable Army is in a position to give an account of itself should the occasion arise either in the immediate or distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a Supplementary Estimate for a sum such as this is a sad commentary on the sanity of the world.  If the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, a couple of years ago had introduced an Estimate such as this in order to provide houses for the working classes or similar worthy object he would have been told that we could not afford such a thing.  I am not saying we can afford this £3,000,000 either but I suppose it will be paid in some way, somehow.It must be.  On that point I would like to say a little more on the lines of Deputy McMenamin's closing words on the question of economy. One knows from previous experience that in times of war and similar times it is extremely easy for waste to develop in an army.  Things are very easily come by.  The case is made that such and such is urgently necessary and supply is fairly easy.  There is a tendency to waste.  There is another question.  I would like to know if the Minister has any arrangements in the various commands for an officer particularly to look into that aspect of the matter and also to look into the question of salvage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one item on the actual Estimate that I wish to refer to and that is P.1.  I take it that amongst the additional equipment to be purchased will be further supplies of steel helmets.  I know they are extremely difficult to get at the moment.  We know, for instance, that even to-day there are wardens in Great Britain who <Col N="858" /> are carrying out their duties without steel helmets and, therefore, we cannot expect to have supplies here. Possibly, in due course, they will be forthcoming, and what I am anxious to know from the Minister is, if he is able to secure supplies sufficient for his requirements, if there is any surplus, will it be available to industrial concerns who require such helmets for their emergency people, roof watchers and people in charge of fire fighting who, up to this, have not been able to get the necessary steel helmets?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is very difficult to discuss this Estimate thoroughly at the present time having regard to all the international implications of national defence.  I think personally that it would have been desirable to have had this debate in a secret session of the House.  I feel that there are many points upon which many members of this House would like to criticise our system of national defence, but it is not possible or perhaps desirable to do so in a public session.  I feel disinclined to add anything to the criticism of the Minister with regard to the employment of civilians at Haulbowline, but I would like to ask the Minister is it not possible to recruit labour within the Army for such work?  Is it not possible to find within the Defence Forces 100 men capable of carrying out ordinary construction work?  If it is not possible to do so, I feel that there must be something seriously wrong in Army administration because in times of national emergency it would always be necessary for the Army to carry out construction work.  Therefore, in a time such as this, when we are not actually involved in a serious emergency, there should be no difficulty whatever in finding within the ordinary Defence Forces a sufficient number of men to carry out this work.  The Minister has stated that the arrangements which he made for the recruiting of these men were necessary because the ordinary channels of employment, that is, the employment of men through the labour exchange, could not be used, because it was necessary that men employed in conjunction with the Army <Col N="859" /> should be men who could be relied upon.  Yet he has admitted that the Deputy who engaged these men did not even know their names.  Therefore, the precaution which he claims that he took was very inadequate.  I would suggest to the Minister that in all such cases it should be his policy to recruit men for such work from within the Defence Force.</P>
      <P>I would like to add to what other Deputies have said in regard to the urgent need for strict economy in all branches of Army administration. Everybody knows how easy it is to waste and squander money and material within a huge army.  In a time such as this I think the Minister should set up within each branch of the Army a special department to ensure the strictest possible economy. I am not satisfied that everything that it is possible to do is being done to ensure the satisfactory defences of this country from what I can observe as an ordinary individual, but I feel that matters of this kind should not be discussed in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this Estimate.  I want to assure the Minister and the House that I did not want to make any political capital out of the position in Haulbowline but I wanted to correct what I believe was a grievous wrong, a wrong committed by a State Department. This matter was brought to my notice by letters I received from men in Cobh complaining about the way labour was recruited for a State Department job. I got a number of letters and I thought it was about time to investigate the matter.  I went to Cobh on two occasions in order to ascertain if there was any truth in the allegations that the work in Haulbowline was being dispensed by a certain political organisation.If the Minister thinks there is any great distinction between the old I.R.A. and Fianna Fáil so far as Cork is concerned, then he is very innocent. I do not know who the secretary of the Fianna Fáil organisation is, but I know that the chairman of the old I.R.A. is also chairman of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="860" /> organisation, so that the two terms are synonymous so far as Cork is concerned.</P>
      <P>However, that is not the point. When I approached the people in the labour exchange I discovered that there had not been an application to the labour exchange for men and that they had no knowledge there of how the men were recruited.  The Minister has told us how the men were recruited &mdash;that Deputy O'Sullivan got instructions to recruit them.  But the Minister has not explained why Deputy O'Sullivan was asked to recruit them, considering the fact that he is not a Deputy for the constituency and also considering the fact that he had nothing to do with the Security Force in that area.  Deputy O'Sullivan definitely handed over his function to a local man who has been very active in the Fianna Fáil organisation.  He happens to be an old I.R.A. man, I understand. I do not know the man at all, but at any rate he was the person who was recruiting the labour in Haulbowline.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he was informed on Friday that men were wanted on Monday.  I suggest that he was not taken quite so suddenly as that.  This work in Haulbowline is work that is usually done by the Board of Works and in the ordinary way it would be done by the Board of Works people; but the Department of Defence wanted the thing done expeditiously and they decided to take the matter into their own hands.  Surely the Minister is not going to tell us that the recruitment of labour was one of the things discussed when they decided to take over this work themselves?  He gave as a reason why he asked Deputy O'Sullivan to recruit the men in Haulbowline that they had to be at work on Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said that he has considerable difficulty with men working at military posts.  Haulbowline, in the strict sense of the word, is not a military post.  It is an island on which is situated one very important industry, concerned with iron and steel, and there are people of various nationalities employed there.  There is also an oil refinery there, and there are families living on the island.  In the <Col N="861" /> ordinary sense of the word, it is not a military post, but, granted that it is so regarded, surely if the Minister was forced to rush men over on the Monday one would think the proper way would be to get the men through the ordinary State machinery.  There is a labour exchange at Cobh in which 266 men were registered as unemployed.  There are Guards in Cobh who most likely know every one of the 266 men on the list and, if there was a doubt about any of these men, was it not quite an easy matter to refer the names to the Guards and ask them whether there were people on the list who would be likely to commit acts detrimental to the State if they got employment in Haulbowline?  But he took this way of doing it, and it is a way that savours definitely of political favouritism&mdash;and I say that very advisedly.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated certain qualifications which the men working in Haulbowline should possess.  For one thing, they should be registered at the local labour exchange.  I suggest that there were men employed, and they are still employed, at Haulbowline who were never registered at the local labour exchange.  He also said they should belong to the Local Security Force.  I have letters here from men who belong to the Local Security Force and who were registered at the labour exchange, but that was not sufficient qualification, apparently, because they were not able to get this note or chit from the local Fianna Fáil man who had the giving of those notes.  I think the Minister was written to by the members of the Local Security Force in Cóbh with regard to the scandal that went on there in connection with the employment of men. I think I am right in saying that the Local Security Force protested to the Minister as well as to the Guards.</P>
    <P>Does it not all show that, despite the innocence of the Minister, there was a definite political bias exercised in the recruitment of those men?  The figures the Minister gave me yesterday with regard to the number of men registered as unemployed in the local labour exchange in mid-October and mid-November show a difference of only 12. <Col N="862" /> There were 266 unemployed in mid-October and there were 12 less in mid-November, although he tells us there were up to 70 men employed at Haulbowline.He also told us the work was practically completed.  Again he displays very childish innocence if he believes that.  This work will not be completed before next Easter, and in the meantime there is work going on there under good conditions and good wages.</P>
    <P>There is in this Estimate an amount of £225,220 to be spent on maintenance and minor works.  I want to get from the Minister or the Taoiseach a guarantee that the same system of recruiting labour will not be employed in the spending of the £225,220.  As well as that, I think there should be a public inquiry into this affair in Haulbowline so that the people will know exactly the method in which a State Department engages in order, as I said, definitely to carry out political propaganda for their own Party.  I want a guarantee that such methods will not be employed again.  The facts were so amazing that I could hardly believe them when I first heard of the conditions there, but the Minister has confirmed my worst suspicions and there is no word of regret and no hint of amendment as regards the future conduct of the Minister.  If that disposition is to be continued, I am afraid the public in Cobh and in the south will be rather alarmed. Apparently it does not matter about being registered at the labour exchange or being in a trades union; if you are not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party you will not get employment, and God knows employment is scarce enough at the present time.</P>
    <P>As to the other items in the Army Estimate, I have no objection to offer, and the Party I associate with has no objection to offer.  If these things are necessary for the defence of the country, and if it is essential to see that the men in the Army are properly clothed, fed and housed, then we have no objection to the spending of this money.  It is a remarkable fact that money can be found for purposes like those but, as Deputy Hickey pointed <Col N="863" /> out, money cannot be found for other probably more necessary purposes.  It certainly is as necessary to defend people from hunger, starvation and poverty as to defend their lives from an invader or an enemy.</P>

      <P>There is just one comparatively small point on which I should like the Minister to give us some information.  If he is not in a position to give it now, I shall not press the matter.  The point has reference to the Construction Corps.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the policy behind that corps or is what has happened up to date merely an experiment?  Is it the intention of the Government to extend that corps throughout the country or to keep it confined to Dublin?  Further, I should like if the Minister would tell us whether the Government are satisfied with the experiment up to date, whether they are satisfied that the men are acquitting themselves in a satisfactory manner?  Arising out of that, there is another point on which I should like to get some information. There may be very good reason for the present position but it is not apparent either to me or to a great number of the unemployed who may eventually be brought into this corps.  The rate of pay is fixed at 1/- per day.  It does seem, as I say, on the face of it rather strange&mdash;I grant there may be good reason for it&mdash;that men who are recruited for all practical purposes in the same way as ordinary soldiers, and who are taken into the Construction Corps to do constructive work, work which is largely of a navvy character, are given only 1/- per day while the ordinary soldier from the day he joins as a raw recruit gets 2/- per day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be fairer to the Taoiseach that he should hear my views before he speaks himself.My views are very emphatically these.  If an episode like the Haulbowline employment episode, on a big scale, can occur, and, having occurred, is accidentally found out by a member of the Opposition; if when that member of an Opposition Party comes here and complains, the only answer he gets from the Minister is to the effect that: &ldquo;I did it; I did it because I am determined to employ nobody but a person who has a national record and the manner in which I shall find out reliable men with a national record is through the instrumentality of one of my own back benchers&rdquo;; and if having made that statement, and having taken 24 hours to reconsider it, he comes back here on the following day to repeat that, then all I can say to the Government is that there can be neither unity, harmony, trust nor confidence in an administration that is run on such lines.  The best way to examine the position of everybody concerned is to put oneself in another's place.  Deputy Dillon endeavoured to put himself in <Col N="865" /> the position of a Minister faced with urgent work, requiring a great number of men, requiring the services of men whose loyalty would be unquestioned. Faced with that situation as an urgent matter, he said he could understand the Minister going to a 'phone and speaking to one of his own back-benchers in this way: &ldquo;Look here, will you get the men&rdquo;?  But having done that, and seeing the shock it had given to every Deputy in Parliament, the least one would expect from that Minister would be to come before Parliament and say: &ldquo;Look here, I did that with the best intentions in the world but now that I am faced with it, I am prepared to admit that it was not the best way of doing it&rdquo;.  We did not get anything of the kind from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not get any explanation.  We did not get any apology.  We got a brazen-faced attempt to put a non-Party complexion on it.  The explanation was: &ldquo;I passed it along to a Deputy who went to the secretary of the old I.R.A. in Cork, a non-Party body.&rdquo;  A non-Party body, moryah! The Minister is not as simple as he would like us to believe.  The Minister knows better than I do that the Old I.R.A. in Cork is 99.9 per cent.  Fianna Fáil.  What happened?  The Minister was not born yesterday.  He was a prominent figure in the old Volunteer movement.  He was a prominent figure in the split and the civil war that followed.The Volunteers split up.  Half of them went into the National Army. Half of them opposed the National Army.  A very tiny minority remained neutral.  The Old I.R.A. was formed mainly out of one section.  The Army Comrades' Association was formed out of those who had gone into the national Army.  The Army Comrades' Association was banned by the Government. The other body carried on.  Are we to take it that that is a non-Party body, particularly when the instrument, the conduit pipe that is to get men from that organisation to do work paid for out of public funds is a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party?  If we were to believe that the head of the Government and the whole of the Government approved of that precedent as a proper <Col N="866" /> and clean non-Party way of giving employment out of public funds, then all I can say is that the Council of Tammany Hall in its worst days would be like a Sodality meeting compared to a meeting of the Government in this country.</P>
    <P>Let us face up to what we are to expect.A Government Minister comes to Parliament and in an emergency asks for money for defence purposes. He wants all the taxpayers together to put up that money.  Without opposition, without criticism, all Parties support that Government in getting the money.  Having got the money, they bring up one of their own back benchers and say: &ldquo;There is a job going for 200 men in such-and-such a place; you draw up a list and whatever men are on your list will be employed.&rdquo; We are told that that Deputy went to an organisation&mdash;the Old I.R.A.&mdash;and the secretary of the Old I.R.A. organisation put forward so many of the men.  We were told that so many of these men came from that Deputy's constituency, not the constituency in which the men were required, but from the individual Deputy's constituency, and that the addresses given were local addresses.  The Minister apparently sees nothing irregular, he sees nothing to be challenged, he sees nothing in that procedure that would justify the terms of grave corruption.  He apparently sees nothing in that procedure to be inquired into with the very fullness of the authority of Parliament behind it.  He merely states the facts. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I did that because I am determined that only men with national records will be employed on such works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean by a national record?  Does he mean a man who soldiered in the Volunteers before there was any division, or does he mean a man who soldiered in the Volunteers before the division of 20 years ago and who took either one or the other side after the division?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.  Do not misrepresent me.  You are going a long way towards doing it, but do not do it entirely.  I made it clear that the people I wanted to see put on this type of work should be recruited from either the Old I.R.A. or the Local Security Force.  There was no question of age, good, bad or indifferent in that, except that I presume the majority of the Local Security Force are young men&mdash;the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Section anyhow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to his presumption.  I am entitled to my opinion.  I am entitled even to interpret, when I am speaking, statements made by the Minister.  The Minister's agent went to the secretary of the Old I.R.A. and asked him to put up the men.  To be a member of the Old I.R.A. a man had to be an active soldier 20 years ago and the boy who was ten years of age, say, 20 years ago would be 30 years now and in that category would be ruled out.  There may be men under 30 in the Local Security Force.  If the Minister wanted people from the Local Security Force, had he not enough machinery in the parish of Cobh, in the constituency of East Cork, to get the men he wanted, without going to another constituency and to a Deputy of his own Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the Minister's intentions were, I will say this and give him credit for it&mdash;his intentions were nothing like as bad as the appearance of his actions.  I believe that.  I believe that the one appalling mistake the Minister has made and the mistake that is an offence to Parliament, to <Col N="868" /> everybody sitting opposite him and, possibly, to a great many sitting beside him, is his unwise attempt to brazen the whole thing out.  If the thing is to be brazened out by a Minister, then we have to accept it as normal procedure.If the Minister's line to-day and last night is to be accepted, then it is a normal line, it is a justifiable line, it is a defendable line that can be applied to all work and any Government Department.  I put it to the Government as reasonable men: could you expect a Parliament made up of political Parties to vote money continuously, freely, without criticism, without opposition on the condition that, when that money has been voted in that spirit, then the Minister, the political head of one Department, will merely turn to one of his back-benchers and say: &ldquo;So much money has been voted; you take on the job of finding the workmen; anybody you O.K. is O.K. with me&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The present state of Parliament, of opposing Parties pulling together in an emergency behind certain objects, could not continue for one minute if the line adopted by the Minister meets with the approval of the Government. The amount of cohesion and pulling together that the country enjoys at the moment would not last over the weekend if the line of policy laid down by the Minister has the approval of Parliament.  I, myself, as one individual would do my utmost to burst any unity that is there at the moment if that unity is to be the cloak for political patronage and for employment out of public funds of only one side, or through the machinery of only one side.  I believe, as I said before, that the only mistake the Minister has made was in thinking that it was his duty to defend whatever was done.  We can understand the head of a Department standing over anything that was right or wrong provided the result of that stand was not that a precedent was being established and that Parliament was not being asked to swallow as normal a most abnormal, unsavoury procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated when the Deputy was about to speak, I think <Col N="869" /> it would be right that I should intervene for a few moments in this debate. I should like to say from the Government side some of the things which have been said from the side of the Opposition in regard to the services which are being rendered to the State and the nation at the present time both by Army officers, who have had a tremendous amount of extra work placed upon them, and also by the young people and the older people of the country who have with one accord come forward voluntarily to offer their services at great personal sacrifice.  I think it is a matter of great congratulation for us all that that should be so, and I think that anybody who has seen the relative unanimity with which this very heavy Vote has been passed by the House will also realise that so far as every Party and every individual in the House are concerned, they are all of one mind, and that is that no matter what the sacrifices that may have to be borne, these sacrifices will be borne if it is quite clear that the safety of the country and the nation demands it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement, indicated that we may have much heavier burdens even than that involved in this Vote to bear before this war is through. Compared with the sacrifices that other countries are making, this&mdash;and, let us hope, the other sacrifices we may have to make&mdash;will not be great by comparison, but they are going to be very heavy for our community, and the reason that this Estimate is not considerably heavier is because it has not been possible yet to get certain equipment which we want and which we are hoping to get.  We have not given up hope in that regard because it is our duty to see that the man-power which we have got will be supported by all the mechanical equipment which modern science makes available for it. As you know, we are not a manufacturing nation and, therefore, it is not an easy thing for us, under the present circumstances, to get all the equipment we would like.  Even under the circumstances obtaining immediately before the war it was not possible to get all the equipment we would like to get, <Col N="870" /> because at the time we wanted the equipment all the other people were wanting it too, and the producing nations were, each one of them, producing for themselves, and it became impossible to get in time the equipment that we would require.  There is another factor in that, too, and that is, of course, that if you get it too long in anticipation, the equipment is likely to be obsolescent or obsolete by the time it is required, and therefore, in cases of preparation of this sort, there is always a desire on the part of everybody to wait until the last possible moment in order that the money they spend on the equipment will be spent in the very best way.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, we can congratulate ourselves here in the Parliament.  There is no one on these benches, I am sure, who does not realise, equally with those on the Opposition Benches, how difficult it is to carry on our work under these conditions and what an amount of restraint it puts upon everybody. We all chafe under that restraint from time to time.  I will admit that the Opposition are more likely to chafe under it than the Government, normally, but I would like to assure the members of the Opposition that if they find, from time to time, that it is hard to keep silent, in order not, by anything they might say or do, to do harm, it is equally difficult, from time to time, for the members of the Government.  There are things that they would dearly like to say, too, about which they have to put a certain gate of prudence before their lips.</P>
    <P>Now, if I pass away from that I should like to refer to what is really only an incident&mdash;important, I admit, and I am not going to make light of it at all.  I was surprised to hear it, and let us examine it from two points of view: first of all, with regard to the particular thing&mdash;I am talking now of the Haulbowline affair&mdash;first of all, with regard to the thing itself, is it suggested from any side of the House that in that particular case there has been corruption?  That is number one. Has it been examined in order to see if, in fact&mdash;I am talking now about this thing in itself as a single, isolated, <Col N="871" /> individual matter&mdash;to see if, in fact, those who are employed are all of one Party?  That suggestion has been thrown out in some of the speeches, but I wonder is it true?  I feel perfectly certain that it is not true, and I should like to know whether there is an allegation to the effect that there was corruption or, in fact, with regard to that affair, those who were employed are all belonging to our Party?</P>

      <P>Well, the Deputy may believe that it is correct, but he will know that I am not for a moment suggesting that he is telling a falsehood if I say that I doubt it.  As you know, it is not easy, with regard to 100 people, to examine and find out in any definite way what their political opinions are.  But I should be willing to lay a wager that the Deputy is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Does the Deputy suggest that it was done deliberately, that it was done by the Minister, and was a case of political corruption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I do not suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear.  I only want to be clear about these things.  Now, there is the question of the case itself, and the Minister has explained clearly the circumstances <Col N="872" /> under which he took the action which he said he took: namely, that there was urgency and that he went the most direct way about the matter.  We hear a lot about cutting red tape and all sorts of things when the Government is asked to do things, and the Minister went a very direct way about it, but I am quite ready to admit the case that has been made by Deputy O'Higgins and some of the other speakers, and that is that it is open, obviously, to abuse.  I think all of us are long enough in political life to know that it could be abused and that if a political Party did in fact use that particular method of recruitment and used it&mdash;to use the term &ldquo;patronage&rdquo;&mdash;as political patronage to certain people, it would be a matter of grave public anxiety.  It is a good suggestion of the Deputy that each Party in the House should try to see things as the others see it, and there is no doubt that if you look at it from the point of view of suspicion and from the point of view of saying: &ldquo;Very well, political Parties are all the same; they will try to do their utmost to get as many followers as they can and to do as many good things as they can for their followers,&rdquo; then, of course, there is no doubt that it is open to abuse.</P>
      <P>Now, what has been the practice? You ask the Government, what has been the Government policy generally with regard to this matter of employment?I think that we ourselves strongly objected to that practice as we thought it had been operated by our predecessors&mdash;very strongly objected&mdash;and that, as a matter of fact, when we came into office, one of the things we did was to issue instructions that, so far as public employment was concerned, the names would be taken from the labour exchange and that preference would be given in accordance with the need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is the proper way, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was, and it remains Government policy as far as policy is concerned.  But what happens with regard to private employers? When private employers want to use <Col N="873" /> the labour exchange they get names and pick out those most suitable for their work.  When names come along for Government employment, naturally the same thing happens, because it is not always the most needy person will be really suitable for the job.  For instance, it might be found that the most needy person for the work of a smith was a carpenter and, therefore, you have to give it to the most needy smith.  If there is any question as to what is the general policy of the Government with regard to employment, that is the policy, and that is the method which will be continued to be employed, namely, going to the exchanges to get the names of men and in accordance with their needs, if suitable, employing them.  The Minister in this case had a particular job.  He found that it was very important, as those employed in military works got a certain amount of inside information, that they should be people on whom he could absolutely depend, because he had examples, apparently, brought to his notice where people who were employed on work of that kind were not dependable.  He wanted to get these people quickly.  The Deputy was a person from whom the Minister could get reliable information, on which he could depend on getting people who would be trustworthy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  I am telling you what the Minister said he did.  He got these people selected on the basis of trustworthiness and on the basis of getting them speedily. Whatever may be the necessity for it, and without viewing the immediate case, and the absolute necessity for resorting to something of the sort, I say very definitely, that we could not expect the Opposition to agree with us in that procedure.  I do not think there need be any more about it.  I understand there is no suggestion of corruption or unfair influence or of a desire on the part of the Administration to give employment to one particular section, except in so far as to try to <Col N="874" /> give it to people who can be depended upon to do work for which they were required quickly and to do it well.  I hope there is no misunderstanding with regard to what the Government policy is.  If you want to do work and to get it done quickly one of the ways is to get someone you know on the spot who can be depended upon, if you are not able to do it yourself.  I admit that there are all the dangers suggested if that was operated for a considerable time.  There is no doubt about that.  I fear if I were a member of the Opposition and if it were suggested that that method was going to be employed, I would have to object to it too.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other matters dealt with in the Estimate it represents a very heavy sum.  It does not by any means, I am afraid, indicate at all the ultimate burdens which we will have to bear, but it is something to know that the peoples' representatives recognise what these burdens ultimately will mean, and they are prepared in the name of the people to meet these burdens.  There is another matter I might deal with now.  I have often dealt with it myself when in Opposition.It is one of the sad things about the modern social order, as we have it, that you can get for military defence purposes people to bear burdens which they are not prepared to bear in order to deal with some of our social evils.</P>

      <P>They are not on the same lines, and even though I did think, before I had to try to solve the problem, that it was a fair comparison, in fact it is not a fair comparison.  The people will have ultimately to bear the burden.  Do not imagine that everything is finished when this Vote is passed.  The burden of all this will have to be borne ultimately by the people.  Someone must pay for it and they will pay in some way or another. There is a definite thing to be done with the money, something that you know will achieve its object.  The <Col N="875" /> moment you try to use a similar method to end social evils you find that you introduce other evils.</P>

      <P>In this case we have got the people prepared to bear these burdens, but they are going to be effective.  In so far as money will be able to be used for that purpose definitely it will secure it.  If people were to ask me: &ldquo;Are you going to save this nation with that money?  Are you going completely to remove the menaces with that money?  Are you going to bring this country peacefully through the crisis with this money?&rdquo; I would have to answer &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;.  All I can say is that definitely we are trying to do it, and the purpose of getting this money is to put ourselves in the best possible position to defend ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because the other members of the House and the people of the country as a whole approach it in that light that we have got the readiness and the willingness to bear these burdens, heavy though they are going to <Col N="877" /> be.  When we come round next April to the task of providing the money which will be necessary in order to meet this expenditure&mdash;it will have to come out of the pockets of the individuals in the country and out of their savings&mdash;we will realise how heavy these burdens are.  We are not going to get rid of these burdens by borrowing; there is no simple and easy way to get rid of them.  In voting this money, the House is prepared definitely, on behalf of the people, to support the measures that will have to be taken next April in order to make that sum available, and I am very glad, as the head of the Government, to see that there has been no hesitation in voting the money.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has made a brave effort this evening to put a face on the Haulbowline affair but, of course, it is obvious to anybody, after listening to the speech of the Minister for Defence last night, that the Taoiseach was set an impossible job to-day.  The Taoiseach has said that there has been co-operation by all Parties in this House and outside this House in the one objective of trying to ward off the menace to this country's independence and to safeguard it from any danger which may threaten it, and that, in an endeavour to achieve that task, there has been very generous co-operation by all Parties.  Let us say frankly that measures have been passed through this House in the past 12 months which, in other circumstances, would have been subjected to very critical examination and which would have produced here the bitterest possible opposition on the part of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and, probably, the Independent Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, realising the menace which was facing this country and desiring to present a united front to all possible invaders, every Party in the House for the time being put aside its keenest political differences and co-operated very generously with the Government in an endeavour to ensure that a spirit of co-operation and cordiality would be the characteristics of our defence policy during the crisis. For that, nobody wants thanks.  Those <Col N="878" /> who co-operated certainly do not want thanks, but they want their point of view to be understood and appreciated, and it is not decent, much less thankful, for the Government, offered co-operation of that kind in very generous measure, to come along and try to put over on the House and on the other Parties in the House the disreputable intrigue that was resorted to at Haulbowline.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to discuss this matter in its details; I am concerned only with the decencies of Parliament and the decencies of public life, which transcend all other considerations. Whether 100 or 200 people get work or do not get work is a small thing relatively, compared to the inspiring of confidence in Parliament and to imbuing in the people a recognition of the fact that Parliament will never descend, and a Government Party will never descend, to procedure such as has been adopted at Haulbowline. Even an attempt to justify the details of the case does not stand one minute's examination.  It was said that it was the desire of the Minister and of the Department of Defence to get certain people to do this important work.  Let us see for a moment what the work was.  It was merely the erecting of accommodation.  There was no military equipment on the site where the work was being done.  It might be alleged that there were certain boats in the vicinity, but surely to heavens our defence policy is such that we can protect such craft as we have from the possible attacks of a carpenter with a hammer or a saw, or of a labourer with a shovel.  There was no military equipment whatever on this site and no danger of any military equipment being stolen from it.  Let that be clear.</P>
    <P>Even assuming that there were articles of value, from a military point of view, surely it was possible, as Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, to arrange that such persons as were to be employed on the job would be of a kind in whom trust could be placed. What in the name of heavens have we a Gárda Síochána force for?  Did they see or hear anything?  Did they know anybody?  At one time we were told that they were the eyes and ears <Col N="879" /> of the State and the guardians of its security.  What was the difficulty, if it was desired to get key men with national records, in still retaining the labour exchange method of recruitment, but requiring the applicants to present, with their unemployment cards, a certificate from the Guards that the men recruited were perfectly safe from a national point of view and not calculated to damage or pilfer military property?  Surely that was an easy way, and it does not require a very fertile imagination to resort to a device of that kind in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The work at Haulbowline is the same as that being done at much more important military centres in the country.  If the Department of Defence have any special work to do at the Curragh Camp, they can recruit the staff through the local labour exchange, though the Curragh Camp, as everybody knows, is a well-equipped military arsenal.  But when it comes to putting up accommodation only on a site where there is no military equipment at Haulbowline, we find an entirely different procedure.  I do not think it can be justified and nothing that the Taoiseach has said&mdash;brave and all though his effort was&mdash;has convinced me that he does not in his heart know that the procedure was one he could not defend for a moment.  I shudder to think what we would have heard from the Taoiseach if he were on these benches.  The normal method of recruitment is through the labour exchange. That is a perfectly fair method, and nothing has been said in the course of this debate to show that the circumstances at Haulbowline justified any departure from the well-tried and universally accepted method of recruiting people for public works.</P>
    <P>When you throw that procedure overboard and put into the hands of a Deputy of the Government Party the right to offer employment or to refuse employment to persons on public works at Haulbowline, you are guilty, in my opinion, of a highly improper procedure, and when it is sought to give that procedure the imprimatur of a Government Department it seems to <Col N="880" /> me that the Government have drifted very sadly from a correct appreciation of the part which it ought to play in a matter of this kind.  It would be bad enough if the Minister were the person who was placing these people in employment.  At least there would be some merit in the Minister being responsible, inasmuch as we could make him responsible to this House for his actions, but when an individual Deputy, with no responsibility to the House, is selected for the recruiting of staff for public works of this kind, it surely is a very grave departure from the rectitude which one is entitled to expect in Governmental matters and in public works schemes of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have not one word of complaint to say against the Deputy in question. In my opinion, he was unwise to take on such a disreputable task.  The question at issue is not how he used his power.  The question at issue is that the Minister betrayed his real trust and functions in giving over to that Deputy the right to say who was and who was not going to get employment on public works.  Now, if the Fianna Fáil Party want to place in employment in Cobh or anywhere else their unemployed supporters, they are quite welcome to do it, but they should not put them into employment on money raised out of the pockets of people who do not agree with the Fianna Fáil Party.  If the Government Party want to start works for the purpose of providing for their unemployed people, these moneys should come out of the Party funds, and not out of the Department of Defence Estimate.  This Estimate is not a Fianna Fáil Party Estimate.  It is a national Estimate, and the money that is being raised under this Estimate is coming out of the pockets of Fianna Fáil people, if you like, but also out of the pockets of people who support the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, and every other Party throughout the country.  To attempt, therefore, to depart from the normal procedure of recruiting staff for a public works scheme of this kind, and to hand over the employment of staff on work of that kind to a Deputy of the Government Party is an entirely discreditable procedure.  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Is it <Col N="881" /> alleged that there was corruption?&rdquo; That is not the point at issue.  We should, in ordering matters of this kind, make sure that it could never be said that it was open to corruption, and this thing is definitely open to corruption, and open to the exercise of all kinds of political nepotism, and well the Taoiseach knows it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details of the case.  I think the Taoiseach would have been well advised this evening, and so would his colleague the Minister for Defence have been well advised to recognise that in the hurry of trying to get staff for this work, if, in fact, there was any real hurry&mdash;in any case let that be the varnish&mdash;&ldquo;that certain steps were taken which on more mature consideration we realise ought not to have been taken, that a mistake was made, and that as complaint has been made about the procedure adopted we do not intend to repeat the practice, and so far as we can do it we will adjust whatever wrong has been done.&rdquo;  If the Taoiseach had done that this evening, I think public opinion would have much more confidence in the Government, and in parliamentary institutions, generally.  The Taoiseach this evening got up merely to make a whitewashing speech: trying to whitewash the Minister for Defence who took the decision in this case, whereas the whole circumstances clearly demanded a recognition on the part of the Government that a mistake had been made, and a frank declaration that such a procedure would not be resorted to again.</P>
    <P>I put it even now to the Government that the decencies of public administration demand that there should be an acknowledgement of the fact that a mistake was made.  We ought to have, before this debate concludes, a definite assurance on behalf of the Government that this procedure will not be repeated in any other instance, and that, so far as it is possible to do so now, an effort will be made to remedy the very legitimate grievances which Deputy Hurley has undoubtedly shown to exist because of the unusual and disreputable method adopted of employing staff at Haulbowline.  I <Col N="882" /> hope that even yet the Government will give us that assurance and get away from this very sordid incident, which, as Deputy O'Higgins has rightly said, has done more than anything else in recent months to disturb the magnificent unity which has been demonstrated in this House and outside the House during the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Defence who deals with A.R.P. matters is unavoidably absent from the House at the moment, I want to reply briefly to a couple of questions that were raised about A.R.P.  I think it was Deputy Hickey who asked about gas masks, the price we had to pay for them, and from whom they were procured.  I can give the Deputy some of the information he has asked for.  In 1937 and 1938, we made efforts to get gas masks made in the country. Preliminary negotiations were entered on with several companies with regard to them.  In September 1938, we found that we had no gas masks in the country.  A number were ordered in September 1938.  They came along at the rate of 2/4 per mask.  They had been ordered from the British Home Office.  In October, 1939, after the outbreak of war, the Government decided that we should increase our stock by over 50 per cent.  Inquiries were made from the British Home Office as to whether they could supply this additional 50 per cent.  They said they could not complete the order then. Failing to get a supply from the British Home Office or elsewhere, further inquiries were made, and it was found that it was possible to get gas masks from a private manufacturing concern in England.  It is the well-known manufacturing organisation of Gormans.The additional 50 per cent. gas masks were procured from Gormans. Their Dublin agent is Medical Gases Ltd.  At that time a firm in the City of Dublin had some machinery in for the manufacture of one portion of a gas mask.  That was purely a speculation on their part.  In September or October, 1939, they had this machinery in hands.  In the June or July of this year the Government decided that they <Col N="883" /> would increase the stock of gas masks by doubling the amount they had in October, 1939.  Let me say that prior to 1939, from the preliminary inquiries that we had made, we found that gas masks would have been dearer to produce here: that is to say, they would have cost more than the 2/4 at which we had been getting them, but they would not be so dear as the price we had to pay for one lot from Gormans. This lot was purchased at 3/6.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the situation <Col N="884" /> was that in October, 1939, additional gas masks had to be purchased. They could not be purchased from the British Home Office and could not be manufactured here.  They had to be got, and they were purchased.  Then an additional lot was purchased in August, 1940, at the original price of 2/4 each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to finish this matter.  If the Parliamentary Secretary, who has now arrived, knows any more, he can give the details to the Deputy.  In August, 1940, we got an additional supply, representing 100 per cent. of what we had before that date.  At that time, inquiries were made as to whether they could be manufactured in the country and it was found that the machinery which had been laid in had been sold, and that even if it were there, there would be difficulty in getting materials, so that this lot was purchased from the British Home Office at the rate of 2/4 apiece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was also raised as to whether we had a sufficient number of steel helmets to meet our own requirements and also to supply the fire-fighting units organised by industrial firms.  There is a certain number of helmets in the A.R.P. service and we have been adding to that number pretty rapidly of late.  In the A.R.P. service at the moment, there are not sufficient helmets to enable us to give them to ordinary industrial firms for their fire-fighting services, but measures have been taken to endeavour <Col N="885" /> to secure a supply, and we think there is a chance of securing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were negotiations in progress in relation to the making of respirators in Ireland.  The Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was very insistent to me that we should try to have these respirators manufactured in Ireland, and certain proposals were made to me in relation to their manufacture here.  A number of firms were concerned in the production of the various parts of the respirator.  The Dunlop people in Cork were to make the face-piece, and I think that in Nenagh and somewhere here in Dublin it was proposed to make one portion of the respirator case.  While these proposals were made to us, apart from the machinery available here in Ireland already to stamp out the tin portion of the respirator, there was not really any machinery for the production of the complete respirator.  The price did compare reasonably well with the price at which we were purchasing in England, but there were difficulties of inspection.In purchasing the respirators in England, we had a guarantee from the British Home Office that each respirator was thoroughly tested.  We could not get that guarantee from the firm which proposed to go into production here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you get that guarantee in respect of the respirators which you got from the private firm in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a Home Office guarantee with any respirator made by any firm in England.  With the delay in getting men trained, the possibility of my getting into trouble for having certain men sent across to England for training&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no fear of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and the fact that it would be rather a costly and difficult process to secure that we had satisfactory gas masks, when I examined it thoroughly, it did not look to me to <Col N="886" /> be a reasonably economic proposition, and I turned it down because on the basis of the economy we would effect by purchasing in England as against the employment given here and the cost of it, we would not be justified in buying the stuff here, I thought.  Again, there was a much more vital factor: I was not satisfied that we could, in the time at our disposal, secure a properly-tested and reliable respirator. That was the main factor in the matter. The Minister made some references to helmets.  I do not know to what his references related, but we really have, from the point of view of pure theory and organisation, a better air-raid precaution service in Dublin than there is in any city of its size in England. Originally, we intended to have 2,700 wardens and helmets were provided for all these.  As a result of various discussions and examination of the situation as the organisation progressed, we decided to have 4,500 wardens and helmets have been provided for these wardens, now.  Helmets have been provided also for the fire-fighting services, and we have somewhere about 7,000 helmets extra which are being used for men who are concerned with emergency communications, etc., so that as far as the general equipment of wardens is concerned, we are reasonably well equipped.  I think we have a very good organisation.</P>
      <P>As I have the opportunity, I should like to say again, as I said before in the House, that I am amazed at the good citizenship of the numberless people who are connected with the A.R.P. organisation in this city.  I have been connected with volunteer organisations and have seen unselfish national service given in this country, and the work being done and the sacrifices being made by the air-raid wardens in Dublin are comparable with any work ever carried out in this country. That refers to Dublin.  I should like the Deputy for Cork City to move a little in pushing forward the organisation in Cork City.</P>

      <P>Previous to February, 1940, you had got quotations from firms in Ireland as to the price at which they would deliver gas-masks.  Evidently, on that occasion you wrote that you were not placing any orders at that time. <Col N="887" /> When did we get the last consignment of gas masks?  Was it later than September of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">

      <P>In September of this year, it was stated in the Seanad&mdash;I do not know whether by the Minister or not&mdash;that they were going to get in 500,000 gas masks.  Why were not local firms given an opportunity of making these gas masks?  It is not a question of inspection.  A lot of comment is being made by Irish firms who had machinery installed and workers trained to do this work.  From September, 1939, until September, 1940, they were waiting for orders for these gas masks and then they found they were obtained from England.  It is now stated that it was more costly to get them from England than to have them made in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>We ordered an extra 500,000 gas masks last September.  We had hoped to do with the original 500,000, but the Government could not face up to the responsibility of distributing respirators only in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.  It was, therefore, decided to buy an extra 500,000 respirators.  The people who originally proposed to make respirators in this country wanted a definite order for 1,000,000 respirators before they set up the machinery.  In the interests of the public and in order to get thoroughly-tested respirators, I bought where I could depend upon them.  I also acted in the interests of economy, because I got the stuff more cheaply there than I could get it here, even considering the amount of labour that might be employed here.  I considered that it was more economic to buy what I did buy than to have them made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Deputy's statement that machinery had been installed and workers trained, machinery had not been installed.  Portion of a gas mask is of very simple construction and could be made in Nenagh, but that is only portion.  It would not have been very difficult to make the stuff if the machinery had been installed, but it <Col N="888" /> had not been installed.  The training of the operatives would not have been a tremendous job, either, but I could not incur risks regarding the training of the inspectors or the assurance that we were getting an actual fool-proof respirator.  I could not risk getting a faulty article and, therefore, I bought in the best and, in my opinion, the cheapest market.</P>

I should like to know if all the contracts for supply of clothing to the Defence Forces and Local Security Corps, so far as that Corps has been supplied with uniform up to the present, have been given to Irish firms, and whether it is true that there has been no complaint as to the carrying out of these contracts.  I want to know whether the firms who have secured the contracts are themselves carrying out the work, or whether any portion of the contracts is being sublet to other firms.  I want to know whether the firms concerned in the carrying out of the contracts for supply of clothing are under the close and constant supervision, so far as their premises are concerned, of the factory inspectors under the Department of Industry and Commerce, and whether the firms concerned are subject to the fair wages clause in regard to Government contracts.  I want an assurance on these points because complaints have been made to me that some of the work is being carried out&mdash;especially in this city&mdash;in premises that would, probably, be open to criticism, from the point of view of the inspectors of factories and workshops.I have not made any inspection of these places, but I should like to have an assurance on these points from the Minister.</P>

      <P>There is not much use in splitting hairs.  The fact is that I had to secure a number of men in a certain short period.  Deputy Hurley may make any counter statements he wishes but I am stating facts.  When I say that I was given a certain time to secure these workers, I am stating what I know to be a fact.  Deputy Hurley may tell me that that statement is not correct, that he knows that there was plenty of time to secure these workers.  I am dealing only with the statements made to me on the occasion.I am not going to defend my action in securing these men through the medium of a Deputy of this House. I do not think that the Government would stand for that policy for a second, but I was dealing with a particular situation on the occasion.  It may be true that I could have gone to the Garda barracks or to some other source for the men.  I had to ask myself where I could secure these men and the source I thought of was that to which I went&mdash;Deputy O'Sullivan, who is resident in Cork City.  I got in touch with Deputy O'Sullivan through the medium of the Gárda barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I got in touch with him through the medium of the Gárda barracks I must confess that it had not occurred to me that that was the source to which I might have gone to secure those individuals.  I am frankly confessing <Col N="890" /> that, and in view of the very strong statements that have been made here in the House with a great degree of warmth, I want to say that, knowing the necessity there is for getting individuals upon whom the military can rely, it will be my practice in future to go to the Gárda barracks to secure those workers, however undesirable the Guards themselves may think that to be.  Those suggestions have come from representatives here in the House and I am going to adopt them.  If I appear to have defended the action that I took, I want to make it clear now that what I was defending myself against was the charge of being a racketeer which was made by Deputy Hurley, and which I resented and resented strongly.  I did not in any single way regard this matter from any other point of view than that which I expressed to my secretary when I asked him to convey to Deputy O'Sullivan the means by which I wanted those men recruited and the type of individual that I wanted recruited.</P>
    <P>In respect of the Army proper, I want to say that the general report which I have received in regard to the morale of the very large number of men which goes to make up the Army of to-day has been first class.  I am told that the incidence of crime is very much less now in proportion to what it was formerly, that is, before it was necessary to recruit this very large Army that we have to-day.  I should also like to say that the men, from the officers right down to the latest private, have entered into the spirit of making themselves into highly-efficient and highly-capable soldiers, and that they have not spared themselves in any way in regard to the manceuvres in which they have had to participate throughout the summer and late into the autumn.  Many of them have had to undergo what might reasonably be described as active service conditions.  They have been out for very long periods, six weeks at a time, living in bivouac, sleeping there during the hours of night, rising in the early hours of the morning and pushing ahead to some other point, under conditions that may be described as those which would be likely to arise in circumstances of warlike <Col N="891" /> activity in this country.  Every man in the Army is equipped with some weapon.  It is true that we have not all the weapons we would desire to have, but I can assure the House that every individual soldier in the Army is possessed of some piece of equipment with which he can take part in the defence of the freedom and integrity of this country.  The officers who have recently come in, the temporary officers, are being put through courses of instruction which will make them efficient and capable of handling their men.  The N.C.O.s are being similarly dealt with.  The rankers are being made into efficient and well-disciplined soldiers, and if those men never have to go into service&mdash;as we all hope they will never have to go into service against any enemy&mdash;they will have gained tremendously in having become disciplined soldiers who will probably make very much more efficient citizens than if this emergency had never arisen and they had never received this type of training.</P>
    <P>There were several questions asked by various Deputies in the course of the debate.  Deputy McMenamin asked for some information in respect of sub-head I.  He referred to the figure of £6,880 under this sub-head, which is for the conveyance of stores by train. These are stores which ordinarily would not be sent by motor transport.  He also referred to the figure&mdash;no doubt other people will also have noticed it too&mdash;of £550 under sub-head A.3, expenses of equitation teams at horse shows.  That sum represents amounts due for past shows, and not for any recent show.  The figure of £415,000 under sub-head K. represents only the cost of provisions for extra troops.  The ration scale is strictly adhered to, and I can assure the Deputy that the question of waste, while it may be likely to arise here and there, is being very strictly watched, and wherever it is found to exist it is got after immediately.In regard to the £66,000 under sub-head CC. for reserve medical supplies, those are supplies which we are holding as against supplies which we feel should have been in the hands of <Col N="892" /> various local authorities, but which were not secured.  We have gone out of our way to secure these, and hold them in case of emergency.  If an emergency arises, or perhaps before that, they will be passed on to the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Benson mentioned the question of steel helmets.  Unfortunately, at the moment we cannot say that we have any great reserve of those which we could hand over to private concerns such as he has suggested.  We will continue to make an effort to secure as many of that type of headgear as possible, but whether it is possible to secure sufficient to supply private concerns is very doubtful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked some questions about the Construction Corps. The Construction Corps, of course, was established mainly for the purpose of providing training for young men between the ages of 18 and 25.  Our desire was to build these young fellows up, to feed them well and to make them capable of undertaking hard work.  At the present moment, while we have not secured a battalion&mdash;a battalion represents, I think, about 800 men&mdash;we have got well over 500, and from the reports which I am receiving from the officers in charge everything appears to be very satisfactory.  Those who joined in the early stages, who have received their initial training, are now being introduced, probably for the first time, to work of a not too strenuous character.  The whole idea behind the training is to move forward gradually in such a way that there will be nothing in the nature of undue strain put upon any of these young fellows who, up to the time they joined this Corps, were quite unfitted for hard manual labour.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the questions which were put by Deputies. I do not think there is anything I can add to what I have already said in respect to the Army.  We will continue to recruit until we get the number which is the maximum to which we are allowed to go and, if possible, we will make arrangements, by releasing some of these trained soldiers, to get in more recruits in order to get a greater number of the citizens of this country <Col N="893" /> trained and disciplined and made ready for any possible emergency that may be likely to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the great hardship inflicted on applicants for unemployment assistance in receipt of small pensions attributable to military service or superannuation from trade union funds by the rigidity of the existing means test, this House requests the Government to submit to it proposals for exempting from the means calculation any income not exceeding 20/- per week possessed by an applicant otherwise qualified to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that while we are discussing this motion we will have our minds free from all thoughts of parties, political or otherwise.  I am trying to put before the Minister some of the many reasons for doing something in this matter.  I may mention there are three classes of applicants for unemployment assistance that I have in mind: Men who are in receipt of pensions from the Irish Government; men who are in receipt of military pensions from the British Government or from the American Army or Navy, as the case may be, and men who are in receipt of superannuation allowance from their different trades unions.  I want to say that, first of all, I am dealing with our own people who are in receipt of small pensions, and I have in mind men who have families of six, seven and eight children, and I have in mind one or two men who have even as many as ten children.The maximum amount that they receive from unemployment assistance is 23/-, that is, for the cities, and 14/- for the country towns.  Some of those men have got pensions varying from 8/- to anything up to 12/- or 13/-.  For the first 1/- out of that 8/-, 10/- or 13/-, as the case may be, that he has, there is 1/- not counted.  The remaining amount is deducted from his unemployment benefit.  We have also the cases of <Col N="895" /> men in receipt of pensions from the British Government, and we have one or two men in my own city who have a pension from the American Government.They are rather small pensions, but since they have got them they have married and settled down in life and have families.  I know of cases where men have been offered 1/- a week and they have refused to continue signing at the labour exchange for it.</P>
    <P>There is a double disadvantage. There is such a thing as work on relief schemes throughout the year, and when men are recruited from the labour exchange the men who are drawing the greatest amount from the labour exchange are the men who are employed. You will find that the man who may have eight or nine children, who has 8/- or 9/- pension from this State or the British Government, is only drawing 10/- or 12/- from the labour exchange, and you will find that he is never considered for employment because he is not drawing the big amount, up to 23/-, from the unemployment assistance fund.  Then we have the very regrettable position&mdash;it is somewhat different to the others&mdash;of the man who is in receipt of superannuation from his trade union, superannuation for which he has paid dearly, having contributed possibly over a period of 30 or 35 years.  When he reaches 60 years of age he is superannuated, not being considered fit for active participation in the labour market.  If he is in receipt of 6/- or 10/- from his organisation, that amount is deducted from the benefit he will receive through the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>I hope in the discussion of this matter that no Deputy will regard it from the point of view of taking any political advantage from it.  These cases that we are setting out to remedy are very exceptional cases.  Last year there was brought to my notice the case of a man in Dublin who took part in the fight for freedom in 1916, who was, in fact, engaged in the attack on Dublin Castle.  That man had a big family but they settled down eventually and then he and his wife were left together.  He was receiving 13/6 by way of unemployment assistance.  He <Col N="896" /> was then awarded a pension.  This necessitated a visit to the labour exchange and there he discovered that all he would be entitled to get in the way of assistance, by reason of the pension award, was 6d. a week.  That is actually on the records of the labour exchange.  That man never went to the trouble of collecting the 6d. a week.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a number of cases in the Cork area where men became entitled to unemployment assistance of only 2/- a week by reason of the fact that the pensions they had been awarded for military service were taken into consideration in the course of the means test.  I should like to quote one other case.  It is the case of a man with ten children.  He was in receipt of a pension of 12/- a week from the British Government and he is drawing 11/- from the labour exchange in Cork.  The labour exchange officials have instructions that, when they are sending men out on relief schemes, the men drawing the greatest amount of unemployment assistance are to be sent out first.  The man in this case is not given an opportunity of doing work on relief schemes until all the others on the list are employed.</P>
    <P>One could quote many cases pointing to the disadvantages in the case of men of that type when the means test is applied.  I could instance cases from Midleton, Fermoy and Mallow where individuals have pensions of 12/-, 13/- and 14/- a week from the British Government.They are not registered in the labour exchange because they find that no purpose is served by registering.They are not entitled to be sent out on relief schemes when they are not drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>We have this fact to bear in mind, that the benefit itself is rather meagre, altogether inadequate at a time like the present.  People find that the food that could be bought for 23/- six or seven years ago could not be bought to-day for 40/-.  We really believe that where men are in receipt of pensions, granted to them for what they did in the fight for the freedom of this country, there should not be a means test applied and it is with a view to getting agreement on that that we have mentioned <Col N="897" /> the sum of 20/-.  If we are prepared to give money towards military defence we should also be prepared to help the men who have done so much to bring about freedom in this country and we can help them materially by relieving them of this means test.  I hope every Deputy, irrespective of Party, will give this motion the support that it so richly deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  Deputy Hickey has explained its purposes very clearly.  Nobody can claim that even the maximum amount which is allowed under the Unemployment Assistance Act is sufficient for a man with a wife and five children.  The amount in the cities is 23/- and outside the cities it is only 14/-.  That meagre sum is supposed to keep a man and his wife and five children in good health.  Nobody can say that at the present time such a sum is in any way adequate.  Definitely there is hardship inflicted on people who are in receipt of pensions attributable to military service or superannuation from trade union funds when these pensions are taken into account in the means test.  Taking such pensions into account really amounts to a process of levelling down instead of levelling up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that the means test applies all round, but I think a case can be made for the people who are entitled to pensions in Éire, given by the Irish Government, or British pensions.There are some very pathetic cases among the Irishmen who have done their part in the fight for the freedom of this country.  Unfortunately, many of them find themselves denied the right of employment, the right to support their wives and families.  Surely such men are entitled to some consideration for the service they have rendered the country.  It is a curious anomaly that in the cases where pensions have been awarded for military service, the amount of the pension is taken into account when the means test is applied.  Surely that pension should be looked upon as a tribute from the nation, as something untouchable so far as any calculation in regard to means is concerned.  I have heard of cases of very severe hardship caused <Col N="898" /> by the means test.  As Deputy Hickey pointed out, it is a double-edged weapon, because it also deprives the recipient of a pension of any chance of getting employment on relief works, which are a pretty common feature of our whole social structure.</P>
    <P>I think this motion is very opportune because, together with the increasing cost of living, the question of tackling the amount given for unemployment assistance must engage the attention of the Government.  Nobody can say that the maximum amounts of 23/- and 14/- for the cities and the rural areas, which have been in operation under this Act for a number of years, are adequate.  They were regarded, I maintain, as bearing some relation to the cost of living at that time, but they do not in any way bear any relation to the cost of living now.  There is no denying that fact.</P>
    <P>While this may not strictly be in accordance with the terms of the motion, I should like to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the whole position of people who are receiving unemployment assistance must be reviewed in the light of existing circumstances.  I think one of the first things that could be done, and it should not cause any great difficulty to the Government, is that people who have deservedly become entitled to pensions should not have such pensions taken into account when they are in the unfortunate position of having to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The terms of the motion are very modest.  It stipulates an amount of 20/- which should not be taken into account in the means test.  I think that is reasonable.  I hope the Minister will favourably consider the motion and enquire into the possibility of implementing its terms.  I think the House will have done a good day's work if it can succeed in persuading the Minister to do that.  The motion is a very simple one.  It is one that does not require any flights of oratory to commend it to any reasonable man, and I know the Minister is a reasonable man.  He is a man who understands the position of the unfortunate unemployed who have to exist on these very meagre and miserable amounts.  As the motion is a <Col N="899" /> reasonable one, I put it to the Minister that the Government should be agreeable to prepare and submit the necessary proposal to the House.  I second the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reservation to that effect here but, just to make sure, I shall read from the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This House requests the Government to submit to it proposals for exempting from the means calculation any income not exceeding 20/- per week possessed by an applicant otherwise qualified to receive unemployment assistance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not read the whole of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell you what the sponsors of this motion are asking the Government to submit to the House.  It does not matter how speciously they may dress up that request.  It does not matter whether they wrap the green flag around it and talk about Army pensions or trade union superannuations as a sort of sugar to coat the pill.  In fact, what this motion contains is a request to submit to the House proposals for exempting from the means calculation any income not exceeding 20/- per week. What is the present position?  That first of all, no person can receive a qualification certificate who has a reasonable, assured income&mdash;I think that would be a fair interpretation of the terms of the statute&mdash;not exceeding £39 per annum in certain areas, or £52 per annum in the county boroughs or in the borough of Dun Laoghaire.  The proposal contained in this motion would at once wipe away that limitation, because if we are to exclude from the calculation means, the first 20/- per <Col N="900" /> week of an assured income which a person enjoys, we immediately have to add that £52 per annum to the £52 qualification limit in respect of residents in the county boroughs and the borough of Dun Laoghaire and to the £39 qualification limit in respect of persons resident outside these borough areas.  We should then find that a person who had means not exceeding £104 per year in the county boroughs and the associated borough, or £91 a year in a rural area, would receive a qualification certificate which would entitle him to draw unemployment assistance&mdash;unemployment assistance which would be paid to him as a result of taxation which would inevitably and unavoidably have to be levied upon the agricultural labourer whose income, when he was at work, would not exceed 30/- per week and who, upon that 30/- per week would have to support himself and his family.</P>
      <P>I think the mere recital of that fact shows how ill-considered this motion is, that we should immediately say that in certain circumstances a person living in a rural area who has means to the extent of £91 per annum, if by any chance these means were to be diminished, would be entitled to draw unemployment assistance.  I put it this way; if his means were to fall below £91 per annum and if he happened to be unemployed and have no other source of income, and his family were large enough, he would be entitled to draw unemployment assistance, and this in a country whose primary industry finds it difficult to pay 30/- a week to the agricultural labourer. That is what is in the motion.</P>
      <P>Now, one might say the question of raising the exemption limit for means might still have some justification if we were to come to the conclusion that it would be possible for the community as a whole to support men who were unable to find work on a higher level than the community does at the moment.  If there is anything to be said for that, it certainly is not said in this motion.  Deputy Hickey asked me to have regard to the first part of the motion, to the preamble.  Here is what the preamble says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in view of the great hardship inflicted on applicants for <Col N="901" /> unemployment assistance in receipt of small pensions attributable to military service or superannuation from trade union funds by the rigidity of the existing means test, this House requests the Government to submit to it proposals for exempting from the means calculation any income not exceeding 20/- per week possessed by an applicant otherwise qualified to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Now consider what we do find as the justification for this request that we should raise the exemption limit?  That there are people who are in receipt of an assured income, people who have an income which is not dependent at the moment, and in their present circumstances, upon their own toil and their own exertions, that they derive this income in the form of a pension or in the form of superannuation.  In either case it is quite clear that whether they get an income in the form of a pension or in the form of superannuation, at any rate it is a much steadier income, a much more reliable income, a much more assured income than the majority of the people have who have to earn their bread from day to day and who have no pension or no superannuation to support or help them to fight the battle of life.  What we are asked here is this: that, out of consideration for the case of those people who are in receipt of an assured income, we should proceed to impose at once a burden on the community which would, I believe, increase by perhaps some 25 or 30 per cent., or even more, the present cost of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to the motion that we are now discussing. Now the beauty of that particular motion is this: that, for once, those who have put down a motion of this <Col N="902" /> type on the Order Paper have seen the conclusion to which they would inevitably be driven if their premises were to be accepted.  They have realised that if you were to propose to exempt the income enjoyed as a pension by any individual in this State from the calculation of means, you would inevitably, out of sheer natural justice, be compelled to extend to the rest of the population the consideration extended to the pensioner.  But, of course, if you did that, then, by reason of the mentality behind this motion the State would be in no better position than it is at present, because in due course we should have the hard case of the pensioner trotted out again, only instead of it being a pensioner who has, say, £52 a year, it would now be that of a pensioner who had £104 a year. Again, we should have Deputy Hickey and Deputy Hurley pointing out to the House the sad plight of these poor men who have a pension of £104 a year and who yet, when they go to the labour exchange, cannot draw unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A motion would then be put down saying: &ldquo;In view of the great hardship inflicted on applicants for unemployment assistance in receipt of small pensions attributable to military service or superannuation from trade union funds by the rigidity of the existing means test, this House requests the Government to submit to it proposals for exempting from the means calculation any income not exceeding 40/- per week,&rdquo; because we should have to have exemptions in respect of 40/- a week in order to deal with the case of a pensioner who did happen to have £104 per annum.  And so we go round in that sort of vicious circle.  Every time a concession was made ostensibly to meet the case which is made in this motion, we would widen the circle of injustice.  When we had exempted £52 from the calculation of means, we should then be told about the case of the poor man who had £104 of a pension and so on, and we should have to go round the whole vicious circle again.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even, as has been known, when it has become necessary to increase the rate of income tax.  It is only then that this question of taxation and the burden upon the Exchequer becomes of any importance to certain persons in this House.  But it is of importance in this connection, because, if we were to accept this motion, the inevitable consequence would be an increase in the burden of taxation.  An increase in the burden of taxation to benefit whom?  Not to benefit the man who lives from hand to mouth day after day, the man who has no other resources except his own strength and such opportunities for employment such as may offer, the <Col N="904" /> man who, if he has not any job, cannot look forward to any money whatever coming into the house. We are to do this to benefit the person who has some assurance that, however great his need may be, there is going to be something coming into the household to enable him to meet it.  If he happens to be a person who enjoys an Army pension, that pension is already being provided for him by the State.  It it is of such an amount, as Deputy Hickey said, as to disqualify him from receiving unemployment assistance, surely that person is in a very much better position than another who may be, perhaps, his next door neighbour and who does not even get 15/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because that £39 per year would be over and above what they can earn for themselves and, as I say, the generality of persons in that position in our rural areas are rightly regarded by themselves and by their neighbours as being much more comfortably circumstanced than the majority of people.  Of course, they might not attain the Deputy's high standards in this matter, but I am thinking of the ordinary common level of the people, and I do say that so far as the majority of the people of this country are concerned, people with that pension per annum are sometimes looked upon with envy, and the Deputy knows that.  He knows it as well as I do, but his proposal is to single out these men and, over and above the assured income which they enjoy, whether from the State or from their trade unions, give them privileges which are denied to the rest of the community.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not think that, according to any canon of democracy or of fair play or of equity that I ever heard of, a proposal of that sort could be justified, yet that is the proposal contained here.  <i>(Interruptions.)</i> I must protest, Sir, at the manner in which the sponsors of this motion are treating the House.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying, Sir, that we had to understand the basis of the Unemployment Assistance Act and the fundamental theory that underlies it, and that is that the State is only entitled to take part of the earnings of its citizens to relieve the less fortunate sections of the community if those sections are in want, and that imposes upon the State the duty of determining what is the extent to which that assistance can be provided.  It has, first of all, to set up a norm and say that, where a person has an assured income in excess of a certain figure, he will <i>ipso facto</i> be taken to be not in such need that the State would be justified in coming to another person, perhaps only a little better circumstanced than the first, and saying: &ldquo;You must contribute to the support of your neighbour.&rdquo;Accordingly, the only way in which that can be done is, as I have said, by fixing some limit of means so that a person who possesses anything over and above it will not be entitled to receive unemployment assistance.  That limit has been fixed, as I already told the House, at £52 per annum in respect of those who live in the county boroughs. <Col N="907" /> and the borough of Dun Laoghaire, and £39 per annum in respect of those who live outside those areas.  Now, it does not matter in what form the income accrues to the person: whether it comes to him as a pension, whether it comes to him in the form of profits, whether it comes to him as income from investments, or whether it comes to him as a result of his savings&mdash;any person who has that assured income, according to our statutes, is not qualified to receive unemployment assistance.  I submit that the House must have regard to that fact, and that it cannot say&mdash;and that is what this motion does ask us to do &mdash;that any person who has an assured income is going to be treated in exactly the same way as we would treat a person who has nothing whatsoever to fall back upon; and that a man who is already deriving an income from the State in the form of a pension, or deriving an income from an investment in his trade union superannuation fund, is going to be treated differently from the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, if you were once to accept that principle you could not stand there.  You would have to say that the man who, instead of contributing to his trade union funds in order to provide for his old age, invested his savings in Savings Certificates and ultimately in, say, National Loan or Corporation Stock, would have to be put in exactly the same category as the man who makes an investment in a superannuation fund, and you could not limit it, having gone even as far as that&mdash;having gone to the stage in which you say &ldquo;We are going to disregard any income which may have been derived from an investment in National Loan, in Government Stocks or Corporation Stocks&rdquo;&mdash;having gone to that extent you could not stop there, because then the plea would be raised immediately &ldquo;Oh, any man who puts his money into an Irish industry is rendering as great service to the community as the man who invested his money in Government Stocks or Corporation Stocks or who put it into a trade union superannuation fund.&rdquo;  Therefore the man who had made an investment in an ordinary business undertaking and who, as <Col N="908" /> a result of that investment, was drawing an income of £52 per year, would be entitled to receive a qualification certificate along with the rest, and, if the burden of his dependants was such, would be entitled to draw unemployment assistance.  Where were we going to stop?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position would be precisely as is stated in the motion. I have said that the one thing that distinguishes this motion from preceding motions of the type which have been on the Order Paper is that its sponsors, at any rate on this occasion, have been able to draw the logical conclusion from their premises: that once you proceed to exempt one section of the community from the means test in a greater or lesser degree, then you will have to exempt all sections of the community in the same degree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that, as I say, was ultimately going to impose a much greater burden on the community than it at present has to bear in respect of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>That is what the result of this motion, if we accept it, is going to be.  We have an Agricultural Wages Board on which there are representatives of farmers and agricultural workers.  Having met and searchingly considered the position, they found that the highest level which they were justified in fixing as the basic agricultural wage, whether for a single man or a married man, was 30/- a week.  If this motion were to be carried, exempting the first 20/- per week in calculating the rate of unemployment assistance which applicants might be entitled to, the first result of that exemption would be this, that a person who was in receipt of an income of almost £91 a year&mdash;again I must emphasise this, an assured income&mdash; might in certain circumstances be entitled to draw unemployment assistance.  Perhaps I should make the figure of £91, £89 or £90 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make any difference, because the real kernel of my argument is this, that you could have living in a country area a person who, without raising a finger, could have an assured income of £90 a year, and he, if his dependents were numerous enough, would be entitled to unemployment assistance, if not working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this motion he could.  He would be entitled, if not working, to unemployment assistance, whereas the Agricultural Wages Board, having considered the position of our agricultural industry, the burdens it has to contend with, and the competition it has to meet, has said that the highest rate it could set up, with justice to all concerned, as a basic wage for agriculture, was only 30/- a week.  Accordingly, we would be in this position, that we would have an agricultural labourer, working 56 hours a week, earning £78 a year, and have side by side with him, or in the next house or cottage, another worker with an assured income of £90 a year, who would be entitled under the terms of the motion to draw unemployment benefit.  I think the motion ill-considered, I think it unjustifiable, and I think the House should reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <P>It is rather deplorable that a Minister, who is Minister for Industry and Commerce, and who, by virtue of holding that office, is responsible mainly for dealing with unemployment and for conditions of employment, should have displayed on this motion, and in the circumstances of the present day, a flippant, fantastic, and nonsensical attitude right through his speech.  The Minister never thought it worth his while to deal with the motion.  He talked the most fantastic nonsense and made the most absurd statements I ever heard in this House, and goodness knows that is saying something.  It was typical of the Minister's attitude in this House, particularly in regard to unemployment. The Minister convinced the House of one thing, that notwithstanding the <Col N="910" /> fact that he is in office as Minister for Industry and Commerce for a considerable time, and that this motion has been on the Order Paper for a considerable time, he is not conversant with the most elementary figures relating either to the means test or to the payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>So that he may not commit the same mistake again in this House, I suggest that when the Official Report of his speech is available, he should submit it to some of the principal officials in the Employment Division of his Department and get them to correct it.  It is deplorable that the Minister should display such ignorance on such an important matter, and that he should seek to cloak that ignorance by the flippant and cynical attitude he adopted.  He talked of people with an assured income.  We were told that some of the unemployed, who have an assured income of as low as two shillings a week, are people to be envied, and envied even by those in constant employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was talking all the time of people with assured incomes of £104, £92 and £90 a year, and I say he was deliberately trying to mislead the House.  He never once referred to the lower incomes of persons having £10, £12, £14 and £16 a year, which is of no advantage to them in relation either to getting unemployment assistance or employment.It is a decided disadvantage.The Minister spoke all the time as if the people concerned were in receipt of at least £52 in county boroughs and of not less than £39 in rural areas.  The Minister knows that that has no relation to the facts.  Is he aware that because certain men have pensions, either from the Irish Government or from the British Government, in respect of military service, of 4/-, 5/-, 6/- or 7/- a week, they do not bother to sign at the labour exchanges because there is no possible chance of getting employment on Government schemes when so many people are signing who have not even 4/- a week?  Is <Col N="911" /> the Minister aware that because they are in receipt of small pensions, for the greater part of the year these pensions are not only their assured income, as he calls it, but their sole income?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister turn his attention to that aspect of the problem? Would he try to make himself conversant with those facts before coming in, in the cynical way he has done, to lecture people here in the House who not only know the conditions laid down by the State for the granting of unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefit and so on, but who are much more conversant than the Minister himself with regard to the actual conditions under which these people are trying to carry on.  I have found it said, in relation to certain people in this House, that when they are put into certain positions one does not expect them to know their job immediately.They have got to learn their job.  But when one comes in here and has to listen to a certain Minister of State who has held Ministerial office for almost ten years, one is forced to realise, if one is to take their speeches for what they are worth at all, that they know less about their particular jobs than they did nearly ten years ago, and then one begins to lose all hope that any inroads are going to be made upon this great problem of unemployment.The Minister sees fit to be flippant about it&mdash;flippant about the problem that is facing us to-day.  Notwithstanding the fact that almost 27,000 men have gone out of ordinary civil life into the Army since the crisis began, our figures to-day show 107,000 unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation, the burden that unemployment assistance has put upon the people, is undoubtedly a burden, but I am not going to follow the Minister in the line he took&mdash;though, if I did, I could say quite a lot upon the problem of work or maintenance, and maintenance was not measured by the Minister in shillings per week at that time. Taxation is a great burden on the taxpayers of this country, and it is a greater burden to-day than ever it was, because of the other burdens that we are compelled, through the circumstances in which we live to-day, to <Col N="912" /> place on the people.  Does the Minister think that he is helping the people to relieve themselves of that burden, or of any part of it, by the way in which he spoke this afternoon?  Does he think that he is going to get applied to this great problem that help, assistance and co-operation from every part of the House that is being given in relation to the other great problem facing the country?  Has the Minister yet realised that, even with all he may do, granted that he gives of his very best to this problem, he alone, or even the Government alone, are not going to solve it?</P>
    <P>It is a great burden, and let me tell the Minister that a great part of this burden on the people, through the payment of unemployment assistance, was put upon them by the present Government themselves deliberately, and a great part of the money was paid and is being paid, not for economic reasons but for political reasons.  Unemployment assistance is being extended to people for whom it was never intended and for whom it was never claimed. That is, perhaps, the first time that that has been said in this House.</P>

When you make a law, you have to make it of a general character and, in the very nature of things, quite a large number of people benefit who were never intended to benefit.  If the Deputy can point out classes who are receiving unemployment benefit without necessity, he is doing a very great service of which we would be very glad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the Taoiseach need not appeal to me at all for that information.  He can get it from the Department, and the Department have proved that conclusively over the past few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach let me finish?  They have proved it in this way: after paying unemployment assistance for a certain length of time, they began issuing period Orders and they assumed that people were at work, whether they were at work or not, and those period orders covered periods which lengthened from year to year, until the position to-day is that they are assumed to be at work for roughly nine months of the year, and for the other three months they are assumed to be unemployed.  The Taoiseach may take that as a little evidence of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I am prepared to fight here as hard as any man in this House for such assistance as can possibly be given by the State to the man who is genuinely unemployed and who cannot <Col N="914" /> get work.  I am not standing here and do not stand, either inside or outside the House, for the man who is not in need of assistance or who can get work and will not accept it.  That is a stand I have always taken and, unfortunately, I have had to speak more often than any other member of this House, and certainly over a longer period in the House, on this question of unemployment.That is the position.  The Minister may consider it useful, but I do not consider it useful, to come here and talk, as the Minister has talked, about £104 or £91 or £52 a year.</P>
    <P>The real problem sought to be met by this motion is the problem of the man who has a few shillings a week either as an ex-British Army pensioner or an ex-National Army pensioner or a few shillings a week from a friendly society or a trade union.  Let me assure the Minister that, in actual practice, far from that few shillings a week being an advantage to a particular man, it is a decided disadvantage.By virtue of the fact that he is in receipt of that, he is the last man in any labour exchange who will be sent out to work on any scheme started under Government auspices.</P>

      <P>It must be, by virtue of the regulations.  Does not the Minister himself know that if there are a number of married men with dependents on a list, the men with the most dependents and the men in receipt of the highest amount of assistance must be sent out first?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the position is that there are so many men with dependents signing at the labour exchange that, except in very rare schemes or in very large schemes where a large number of men are employed, the men with a few shillings a week are never reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt for a moment.  I am sure the Deputy would like to know the position in that regard. <Col N="915" /> It is quite true that, in the beginning, the work on relief schemes was rather strictly confined, if I might put it so, to those who were assumed to be in receipt of allowances in unemployment assistance at the higher rate&mdash;to those at the top of the list. But the position since is that, to meet representations which have been made, the Office of Public Works has adopted a scheme by which, in all urban road schemes and in many rural road schemes, each batch of workers is replaced by another until all the recipients of unemployment assistance&mdash; except those entitled to very small weekly amounts&mdash;are given a turn under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, that proves my case conclusively.  By virtue of the fact that they are in receipt of a small pension they are necessarily in receipt of the smallest amount of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy was talking of men with 4/- per week.  That is approximately £10 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little more elastic than the Minister, as I said from 4/- to 7/- or 8/- a week.  I am not confining it to that.  I am saying that those are the people who are most concerned.The Minister should remember that the number of people with means, coming up to the figures that he mentioned, who are claiming or receiving unemployment assistance, is so infinitesimal as not to be worth talking about.  Let me assure him&mdash;and this is not said for the purpose of making any point other than stating a fact&mdash; that we have here hundreds, if not a few thousand men, in the position of not being even registered at the unemployment exchanges, first because they are not entitled to assistance, or, if they are, the amount is only 1/-, 2/- or 3/-.  They are put in that position because of the operation of this means test.  I do not want to be personal on this, but I do want to say that I have to complain of the Minister's approach to any motion introduced in this House dealing with unemployment.  I have <Col N="916" /> had to make the same complaint in regard to the Minister's predecessor. The Minister's approach to the motion was not helpful, either from his own point of view or from the Government point of view.  It was not a helpful way to approach a problem such as this.</P>
      <P>I know it is easy to say&mdash;it has been said very often in this House both by speakers for the present Government and for the previous Government&mdash;that motions dealing with unemployment are introduced merely for vote catching and political purposes.  Now, that is not so.  Deputies who live in small country towns, as well as those representing cities, have day after day the unpleasant experience of people coming to them and asking them if there is any chance of getting a job, for a recommendation and so on.  Some of the finest types of men we have in the country are obliged to do that. Through no fault of their own they are unable to get work.  I am sure the Minister and the Taoiseach will admit that, when the rates of unemployment assistance were originally fixed, no one would think of contending that these were anything more than the minimum which this country could afford.  Since then the purchasing power of these weekly amounts has been reduced by anything from 25 to 50 per cent.  I do not think any one will deny that. The position of those unemployed people is a terribly hard and difficult one.  If they were not helped out by the good citizens who, in various organisations, devote themselves to charitable work, their position would be a desperate one.  I know that many of them walk ten and 12 miles a day after signing in the labour exchange for the purpose of catching rabbits, so as to try to supplement the small amounts they are receiving.  If they did not do that their position would be an appalling one.  The position is so grave that it would be criminal for me or for any other member of the House to approach this problem on any other line than a serious line, or to deal with it in any way other than with a genuine desire to help to have the problem, if not solved, at least relieved in so far as the Government and this House can do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>When listening to the verbal fireworks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce this evening one found it very difficult to remain patient, because of all the unnecessary things he introduced when speaking to the motion.  He talked about men drawing £104 a year, of others having an assured income of £94 and of people with money to invest in industry, in National Loan and in corporation stock.  I think that, when speaking to the motion, I made myself perfectly clear.  I had three classes of people in mind.  The first, men who had given service to this country and who are getting small pensions; secondly, men who had served in the British Army and had gone through the last Great War who are getting pensions of 10/-, 15/-, or 18/-, a week, and, thirdly, some few people who have small pensions from the American Army or Navy.</P>
      <P>None of these has an assured income, except the small weekly amounts which I have referred to.  What I had in mind was that this means test should not be applied to people whose income does not exceed 20/- a week.  I think one would not be going too far in saying that it was not honest for the Minister, on a motion of this kind, to bring in the cases that he did, people with incomes of £94 a year or £104 a year.  The people I had in mind are unemployed.  They have no visible means except a small military pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another class I had in mind is that composed of men who had been members of a trade union ever since they were apprentices, covering a period of say, 30 or 40 years.  They were superannuated out of their trade union at the age of 60, and may be getting 10/- or 8/- a week.  When they sign at the labour exchange, with the exception of about 1/-, the remainder of their superannuation is taken into account. In their case I stressed the point that during all the years they were members of a trade union they had paid their weekly contributions so as to ensure that when they retired they would have this superannuation.  I fail to see why the Minister should have rambled off and dealt with people who, as he said, have money to invest <Col N="918" /> in war loans, corporation stock and industries.  The Minister thinks that it would be a terrible thing to concede what we are asking in this motion. What I am at a loss to know is this: why is it that it is only in the case of the unemployed and the workers generally that this means test is so rigidly applied?  It is nothing new to hear of men having big pensions running into three figures.  It does not matter what their assured incomes are.  They are able to become directors of companies, or they may have thousands of pounds invested in National Loan or in Government stocks.  What about a means test in their case?</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about taxation. I am quite conscious as to who is paying taxation.  If the Minister will look up the official figure published by his own Department, he will find that the people who are supposed to be paying taxation, super-tax, corporation profits tax, and so on, are just as wealthy to-day as they were ten years ago. Why?  I am going to suggest that it is because they have so much money in war loans and in corporation stocks that it all ultimately comes back to them again.  I do not claim to have any superior knowledge of the affairs of the country, but I regret that the Minister, because of the responsible position he holds, should have treated this motion in the flippant way he did.</P>
    <P>It was not a helpful way to face up to it, or to the case of people who are very hard pressed.  I think they should have been shown some consideration. I hope no one will take it that there is any political tinge about this motion.  I quoted the cases of men with big families who have only 10/- or 12/- a week pension from this Government as ex-I.R.A. men, as well as the cases of British ex-service men who went through the last war.  They have since settled down here.  Many of them are rearing big families and all they have is a pension of 10/- or 12/- a week.  They have been unemployed for a number of years.  The Minister taunted me and said that I do not understand what unemployment assistance means.  I claim to know more about it than the <Col N="919" /> Minister does, and for this reason: that when unemployment assistance was introduced there were very few people without some visible means as compared with the present time.  They were then employed and had stamps to fall back upon.  There are hundreds and thousands of men who have not got stamps to their credit for years, and they are generally unemployed, and very often they are even thrown off the list of recipients of unemployment assistance because of their failure to get employment, because they are not genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the Minister that those men who had that pension of 10/- a week and who were in receipt of 11/- a week from the labour exchange to support a wife and five or more children are scarcely ever called on for relief work for the reason that the labour exchanges have orders that the men who are to be sent on relief work are the men drawing the largest amount from the labour exchange.  I know of an ex-I.R.A. man in the City of Dublin who was offered 6d. a week for himself and his wife because he drew a pension of something like 13/- or 14/- and he and his wife were getting 13/6 from the labour exchange, and he was to sign six days a week for that. I know men in Cork who are expected to walk to the labour exchange and stand in a queue to sign six days a week for 2/- a week&mdash;ex-I.R.A. men and British ex-service men.  Their pensions are 14/- or 12/- a week and all they can draw is 2/-, with the result that they have refused to register, and they are not registered, and are consequently handicapped in getting relief work.  In the case of a man who entered a trade union years ago and paid a certain amount all through the years in order to get a small sum of superannuation, the amount he draws should not count against him, if, at the age of 60 or 58, he is unemployed and he should not be deprived of whatever he can get from the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>I have put these points to the Minister and to the House, and I hope the House will look on it as applying only <Col N="920" /> to men who are unemployed and who are in receipt of these military pensions.It is not fair to talk about the man in the country with the assured income.  The Minister says that if he has £52 a year, he can get the other £40, and still qualify for unemployment assistance.  Does the Minister not know that the man with £1 a week in the city cannot qualify at all for unemployment assistance, and that the man with 14/- a week in a country town will not get anything at all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy would enable him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy's motion were passed, he could have 20/- a week in a country town and 14/- on top of it. That is all his income could be to keep a wife and five or more children.  If he were in the city all he could have is 20/- and 23/- for himself, his wife and five children.  That is only when he is unemployed.  The sufferings of the unemployed are too serious to be trifled with, and the Minister was alarmed at the irresponsible way the community was being treated by people like me.  I wonder are they, and I wonder if the Minister has such concern for the community as I have. Who are the community?  Are not our 108,000 people on the live register part of the community as well as the people paying super-tax and excess profits tax?  I wonder which of the two are more worthy of consideration?  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that speeches of this kind are very dangerous, if people should come to read them.  I am not talking lightly of what I know to be the position in the country. There is too much smugness, too much complacency, about the position of the unemployed and their dependents, and I am afraid that, some fine day, we shall wake up and find out where we are.  We will then know who talked sense in this House and who showed indifference towards the community.  I hope the House will agree to the motion in the spirit in which I have moved it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Being of opinion that the time is overdue for formulating proposals for the abolition of unemployment and for giving effect to the undertaking in the Constitution that all citizens may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, Dáil Eireann requests the Government towards that end to appoint a representative committee <Col N="923" /> to ascertain the cause and incidence of unemployment within industry and agriculture, its reactions on the physical well-being and morale of the people and to make recommendations within six months from the date of its appointment for the absorption in useful employment at adequate remuneration of all workers able to follow useful occupations.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear at the outset that while this motion deals with a matter which has been the subject of much political controversy, and has been selected for the application of various political and economic remedies, I move the motion in no partisan spirit.  I move it solely with the desire to focus the attention of the House on the necessity for facing up to its responsibilities in regard to this grave problem of unemployment and its widespread repercussions on large numbers of our people.  Anybody who takes the trouble to examine our unemployment problem to-day, or who is in touch with the large masses of unemployed people, can scarcely fail to appreciate the magnitude of that problem.  Indeed, the more one studies it the more it becomes apparent that it is almost impossible to exaggerate its seriousness.  When the Constitution was going through this House we had a grandiose declaration in Article 45 to the effect that it was one of the directive principles of the State's social policy to ensure that the citizens, all of whom men and women equally have a right to an adequate means of livelihood, may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs; so that in 1938, when the Constitution was being enacted by this House, it was then declared to be the constitutional objective of the Government and of the State to endeavour to ensure that all citizens would be given an opportunity of making provision for their needs by following their various occupations. But when we compare the grandiose declaration contained in that Constitution with the bitter truth that there are to-day 110,000 unemployed registered <Col N="924" /> at the employment exchanges, that there are many thousands of persons only partially employed, and that approximately 100,000 people are dependent upon the miserable pittances which they receive in the form of home assistance, we get a truly ironic commentary on the seriousness of our intentions when we embodied Article 45 in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, as I said, to exaggerate the magnitude of our unemployment problem to-day, or even to picture comprehensively the destitution which is being suffered by tens of thousands of our citizens who are condemned to involuntary idleness.  We have that picture, in so far as we can measure it by figures, represented by 110,000 persons registered at the employment exchanges, but we can never really get a picture of the misery and suffering which large numbers of our people have to endure because they are compelled to live in almost constant idleness.  It has always appeared to me to be a most criminal form of waste to have men and women idle at any time, but it is unjustifiable and indefensible waste to have 110,000 men and women idle in a country which is still inadequately developed, while there are abundant opportunities for work in industry and agriculture, and while the national estate as represented by public amenities falls far short of the standard in many other European countries.  We must, of course, as a civilised community feed and clothe our unemployed people, since they are denied the opportunity to work, so that every unemployed man and woman who are denied the opportunity to work must get the food and clothing they require from the common pool of national productivity. If they contribute nothing to that pool then they must be sustained out of other people's contributions to the pool, and the economic effect of that, surely, is that not only are they reducing the quantity of available goods in the pool but they are reducing the standard of living for those whose earnings make that pool possible. Every unemployed man or woman, therefore, not only is compelled to tolerate a low standard of life for himself <Col N="925" /> or herself, but by reason of the fact that they are kept in a condition of idleness they incidentally, under our social system, in effect drag down the standard of living even for those who are employed.</P>
    <P>But unemployment has an even more serious effect than mere economic waste.  Unemployment brings in its train poverty and destitution for those who are its victims.  Accompanying unemployment in this and every other country is an appalling amount of malnutrition.The reports of county medical officers of health in this country disclose very serious malnutrition on the part of large sections of the community to-day.  We fill our hospitals to-day very largely because of the fact that we keep our people idle, and we fill our county homes with people who have become the flotsam and jetsam of the strange system of society in which we live.  But over and above all those considerations, over and above considerations of waste, poverty and malnutrition, we are setting up for ourselves here, by our refusal to face up to the gravity of that problem, an underdeveloped and physically weak nation as the price which we are apparently prepared to pay for our failure to deal with that problem.  In so far as we are attempting to relieve the sufferings of our unemployed people, none will deny that the effort is indeed a puny one.</P>
    <P>If we take the country in general as being represented by towns with a population of not more than 7,000, we find that the maximum rate of unemployment assistance benefit is 14/- per week.  That is the pittance upon which, in 1940, an unemployed man with his wife and five children is expected to live.  Fancy trying to provide the necessities of life, including rent and fuel and clothes and food, on an income of 14/- per week, having regard to the prices of commodities to-day.  That family, in those circumstances is, therefore, compelled to try to eke out an existence on an income of 2/- per head per week.  When that is analysed further, we find that it provides the family with the sum of three farthings on which to obtain a meal.  That, therefore, represents our attempt to implement <Col N="926" /> Article 45 of the Constitution. That represents our approach to an endeavour to implement that particular Article.</P>
    <P>I say that the continuance of an unemployment problem on such a gigantic scale in this small and relatively undeveloped country is not merely a challenge to our statesmanship but a challenge to our present Parliamentary institutions.  We had, of course, declarations by the Taoiseach that if the problem of unemployment could not be solved within the existing system he was prepared to go outside that system.Those are brave words which the Taoiseach permits himself on occasions, but unfortunately he fails sadly to implement them when the occasion on which they are delivered has passed.  Occasionally, we get from the present Minister for Supplies declarations in somewhat similar terms, all indicating that although he may talk bravely he is prepared to act supinely.  But whether we take the declarations of the Taoiseach or the declarations of the Minister for Supplies we get no indication whatever that the Government has any intention of departing from the present Micawber-like economic policy which has given us 110,000 unemployed, and is keeping them there&mdash;a figure which Governmental ineptitude will probably increase in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is said rather tritely, but I think rather truthfully, that the remedy for unemployment is work, and here, I suppose, we ought to ask ourselves whether, in fact, there is any work for our people to do.  One has only got to pose that question to be able to answer it by a long catalogue of very useful national works which could be undertaken, not merely for the enrichment of the community, not merely for the enrichment of the national estate, but for the creation of sources of work and sources of wealth which would go far towards raising the standard of life in this country.  I should like to pass over such schemes of work as are at present offered by the Board of Works as a mere palliative for the endemic poverty which exists in many places throughout the country and to point instead to <Col N="927" /> those larger schemes of work which are in the nature of capital works of a reproductive kind and upon which the expenditure of money would in the course of time yield a substantial national income.</P>
    <P>The first of these items may well be said to be housing.  Notwithstanding the magnificent effort of recent years to rid the country of the town slum and the rain-soaked mud cabin, there are still tens of thousands of houses needed so as properly to house our people, and the conditions under which many of our citizens are compelled to live to-day are a reproach to both our Constitution and our vaunted Christianity.In the realm of house building a vast amount of work still requires to be done, but although we have people living in slums and in rain-soaked mud cabins, although we have 10,500 building trade workers idle&mdash;and the number would be larger were it not for the fact that they are able to find employment in Britain which they cannot get here &mdash;we still have a situation whereby, so far as the building trade operatives are concerned, they cannot obtain work while those living in slums and rain-soaked cabins cannot get decent housing.  Is there any reason why there should be so complete a divorce between the creative art of the building trade worker on the one hand and the social needs of the people on the other hand, or is it impossible for the State to apply its talents and its resources to harnessing the ability of one to the needs of the other and in that way tackle our housing problem with much more zeal even than that displayed in recent years?</P>
    <P>We pass from that to the question of afforestation.  The one striking fact in that sphere is that this is the most timber-denuded country in Europe, with a lesser percentage of its land under timber than any other country in Europe.  If it pays other countries to plant timber, if it pays other countries to cultivate State forests, it surely ought to pay a country like this to do the same, but we appear to have inherited all our views on forestry from people who have no sympathy <Col N="928" /> with the forestry policy in this country.  Apparently we were content in the past to see this country used as a vast grass ranch for the purpose of producing bullocks and men and women for export.  In the field of afforestation a vast amount of work requires to be done, and that work, if undertaken comprehensively and pushed with energy, would, it is estimated, provide regular employment for close on 40,000 people per year. For some reason that has never been obvious to me one Government after another treats the afforestation problem as if it were something to be brushed aside, and as if nobody had a right to expect more trees than grow at present to inhabit the earth of this country.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in respect of mineral development our resources, so far as they exist in a merchantable way, have been neglected.  Recent efforts, I know, have been made in certain directions by private individuals to exploit certain mineral deposits throughout the country, and when one enlists the assistance and sympathy of the Department of Industry and Commerce on that matter one is told that the matter is one for private enterprise in the first instance, and that the Minister will be interested in seeing how they get on.  But everybody knows that, having regard to the somewhat chequered financial history of mineral development in this country, few private investors are likely to speculate their money in mineral development in this country because it involves at the outset quite considerable risks and the expenditure of quite a considerable sum of capital without any return.  That work, in my view&mdash; and the facts prove it&mdash;can only be undertaken by the State, but it should be undertaken by the State unless we are to continue to allow our mineral resources to lie dormant without making any effort whatever to exploit these resources for the provision of wealth for the country and employment for its people.</P>
    <P>Land drainage is, of course, another matter where a vast amount of work requires to be done.  It is appallingly true that we pay very little real attention <Col N="929" /> to land drainage or land reclamation in this country.  We appear to accept the fact that there is a certain proportion of the land of this country which as been flooded for many years, and, because it has been flooded for many years, there is no reason why that condition of affairs should not continue.</P>
    <P>If we take work under these four heads&mdash;housing, afforestation, mineral development and land drainage, I think it will have to be admitted that the expenditure of money by the State on schemes of work of the kinds indicated would in the course of time give a substantial return.  There are other schemes of work which might be mentioned, but I want to distinguish between capital works which will return an income to the State and other schemes of work such as water and sewerage schemes, the provision of baths, the building of new roads, and the maintenance of cemeteries, which might well be done to enrich the national estate, but in respect of which there is no real return in the form of annual income such as is available in the case of capital works.</P>
    <P>If we pass from the industrial position to the agricultural position the outstanding fact that strikes one on an examination of agricultural statistics relating to this country is that our agricultural productivity shows practically no increase over the past fifty years.  It may be true, of course, that we are growing beet now that we did not grow fifty years ago, but we are doing it at the expense of other crops.  It is true we are increasing the acreage under wheat, but we are doing that at the expense of other crops as well.  But, taking agricultural productivity as a whole, an examination of official statistics will show that our agricultural productivity is really stagnant, that there is no evidence of growth or expansion and, apparently, no policy to encourage an expansion which has long taken place in other countries in Europe and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>If one thing more than another strikes one in respect of agriculture, it is the fact that we are probably neglecting more than ever to nourish <Col N="930" /> the land, neglecting to fertilise and manure the land, and to-day, in carrying out a policy of intensified tillage on the one hand, while neglecting the necessity for fertilising the land on the other hand, we are probably taking out of the land much more nourishment than we are putting back into it. There again a vigorous agricultural policy would intensify agricultural production and, by attention to such problems as the fertilising of land, we could in the course of time ensure even greater productivity from such of our land as is under cultivation.</P>
    <P>The outstanding fact remains that out of approximately 12,000,000 acres of arable land we do not cultivate more than 3,000,000 acres.  Nobody can, in the face of these facts, contend that there is any shortage of work to be done by the 110,000 unemployed people in this country and, if we have that large mass of unemployed people, on the one hand, with an abundance of work for them to do, on the other hand, what is the reason we cannot harness their energies to the tasks to be done, why can we not put them into employment, give them an opportunity of earning a decent livelihood, give them an opportunity of adding to the pool of national productivity and drawing from that pool against their own credits in it, instead of their being kept from the additions made to that pool by perhaps their more fortunate brethren?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated this evening, in the course of the debate on the Army Estimate, that you could get money for military and war purposes, but you could not get money for social services.  Maybe it is harder to get money for social services; maybe the mentality of our people is such that they do not realise the necessity of organising the nation to eliminate the criminal waste which exists to-day; but, if hunger in this country were an infectious disease, if it did not merely confine its depredations to poor, unemployed people, if rich and wealthy people could be inoculated with it as an infectious disease, we would very quickly raise money for social services and for the provision of work, and we could raise it with the same ease as <Col N="931" /> we can raise it to-day for the purchase of guns and ammunition.  There has been no real public appreciation of the value of an organised, planned economic system in this country.</P>
    <P>If there is a difficulty about raising money for the purpose of social schemes, then there is need for a complete reorganisation of our entire economy.  There should not be any real difficulty in getting money.  We used to think at one time&mdash;and so did other countries&mdash;that there was such a thing as a scarcity of money, as if money were a commodity that had to be mined, as if it were a commodity that you might be lucky to find or you might not be lucky to find.  But most of the countries in Europe, certainly some of the biggest, have been able to discover that there is no such thing as a shortage of money, and all our difficulties in this country come back to the one basic fact, that, because of our adherence to our present financial methods, we have tens of thousands of people idle, tens of thousands of people available to do work, the work available to be done, yet no means of linking them together.  I suggest that the Taoiseach, notwithstanding what I fear is a deep-rooted prejudice against interfering with our present financial methods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, I do not know <Col N="932" /> then what has delayed the implementation of the famous plan.  But, of course, everybody knows that our financial methods are probably the most conservative in Europe, much more conservative than the financial methods of the neighbour that we copy, the neighbour at whose financial shrine we worship, because even that neighbour has been compelled long since to abandon her conceptions of orthodox finance as understood in the financial circles of that country.  But we continue to follow those methods slavishly &mdash;the Taoiseach will not deny that.</P>
      <P>When banks issue pound notes in this country they back the note issue with British securities, and British securities mean to-day as they always meant&mdash;but they mean it more so to-day&mdash;what Britain owes, not what Britain has.  You could buy 3 per cent. British victory bonds, £100 worth of them, and put the £100 worth of British victory bonds or defence bonds or any other type of British Government bonds you like in against the issue of £100 worth of Irish bank notes.  That is the guarantee, the anchorage, for our £100 note issue.</P>
      <P>British securities mean, not what Britain has, but what Britain owes, maybe to Britons, but also maybe to anybody in any part of the world. These bonds at one time had a very considerable value.  They may have that value even to-day, but what does it avail us?  If, at the end of this war, Britain happens to lose, we may find our note issue backed by bonds which maybe as useless as the German mark and the Austrian crown were after the last war.  But Britain now, though it was once the citadel of orthodox finance, does not believe in even backing her own notes with anybody else's securities.  Britain is now diluting her note cover, and has been for a considerable period.  Britain is to-day issuing credit upon credit, and the only backing the credits have is in the nature of bombing planes, guns and fighter planes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take up even a respectable British daily paper you will find many financial editors, by the sheer logic of events, being compelled to admit that the system of backing note issue by the <Col N="933" /> rarest commodity in the world, gold, probably has not as much to commend it as backing notes by the more creative security, labour.  Recently the London <i>Times</i> wrote an article on the subject of how other European countries were dealing with the problem and, with the indulgence of the House, I will quote the article, because it is a most instructive one.  The leading article in the London <i>Times</i> on the 12th October said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many people have been puzzled to understand how the Nazi Government, succeeding to a bankrupt German treasury, have been able, without any noticeable damage to the internal value of the currency, to set to work millions of unemployed and to build up armaments and reserves of war material on a colossal scale, besides carrying out a grandiose programme of public works.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The achievement has been so surprising that for a long time outside critics were inclined to regard it as a case of optical delusion, the result of conjuring tricks by Dr. Schacht which would fade away to give place to another collapse....  As time went on, and these expectations, like similar predictions in the case of Russia, obstinately refused to be realised, opinion began to swing to the opposite extreme.  An uneasy suspicion became current that the Nazis had discovered ways of making something out of nothing and that the rest of the world would do well to imitate them....  It is of course absurd to belittle what has been done in Germany.  There is nothing &lsquo;fictitious&rsquo;... about the enormous increase both in production and in productive capacity or, as we know to our cost, about German armaments and reserves of war supplies.  In military matters up to some months ago the French General Staff enjoyed a prestige similar to that of our own authorities in finance and business.  They, and the whole Allied cause along with them, have paid a cruel penalty for their failure to adjust their thinking to the changed conditions.  A hide-bound persistence in methods and doctrines which were sound enough 50 years ago may easily <Col N="934" /> prove as costly in the financial and economic field as in the field of actual war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is a declaration from a paper which always adopted an attitude of conservatism in financial matters, and always had a hide-bound conservative financial outlook, but the logic of events has apparently forced that paper, which was able to buy into its service the best orthodox financial minds in Britain, to realise that, in the changed circumstances, changed financial policies might be necessary. The <i>Times</i> is compelled to admit in the long run that the outlook on financial matters in Britain may be based on the same kind of unjustifiable enthusiasm as characterised the outlook of military folk throughout the world on the French General Staff.  I think the Taoiseach will have to realise here, as other countries have had to realise in their own sphere, that in these days much can be said for an examination of a currency and credit policy, based upon labour content rather than upon anchorage to gold or anchorage to securities of doubtful value.</P>
    <P>I think a committee of the kind which we have in mind is one which might very well examine that question, from the standpoint of utilising our financial and credit resources and our labour power for the purpose of transforming our present economic system. If other countries can, as I have said, anchor their note issue to armaments, to fighting and bombing planes, is there any reason why we ought not to anchor our financial methods and our credit system to the sound anchorage of reproductive work?  The whole question of unemployment, whether in the field of industry or agriculture, is closely related to the problem of finance.  It is because of that close relationship that I make these remarks on the subject of our present financial methods. I do suggest to the Government that there is necessity for a close and sympathetic examination of the whole question of our financial methods in relation to our economic necessities with a view to making our financial methods serve the best interests of the nation in the economic sphere.</P>
    <P>I observe from the amendment submitted <Col N="935" /> by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is apparently prepared to offer the House a commission to examine the whole question of unemployment.So far as the Minister has been induced to make even that move, it is all to the good, but I am rather suspicious about the kind of commission which the Minister has in mind.  I do not want this commission to be another banking commission, or another transport commission which will sit for years.  We may be told at the end of a prolonged period that it is not possible to issue the report until it has been considered by the Government and the various public departments affected.  The problem of unemployment, and the evils which flow from it, will not brook that kind of delay.  In our motion we sought the establishment of a representative committee to deal with an urgent problem in an urgent way, and we asked that the commission should be required to report within six months.  I fear the commission which the Minister has in mind will be charged with no such urgent task, that it will do its work in the leisurely way in which Government commissions usually function, that it will present a report some years hence, and that we shall spend another prolonged period examining the report, while in the meantime the victims of unemployment will have to suffer their hardships as gaily as they can.</P>
    <P>This whole problem of unemployment is an urgent question and a solution of it is imperative.  It will not be dealt with effectively by a leisurely committee, meeting periodically and occupying years in an examination of a problem that will not permit of that long delay.  If this problem is to be solved it must be tackled vigorously, it must be tackled comprehensively and it must be tackled by minds which are not anchored to the traditions of the past but rather have gained by experience from the mistakes of the past. If we attempt a speedy survey of the problem and the submission of proposals to deal with it, then I think we can save an ever-increasing number of people in this country from the destitution which is staring them in the <Col N="936" /> face.  We can offer them a hope of work, a hope of economic security. We can offer them an opportunity of providing for their needs such as is nominally guaranteed to them in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I move this motion not in any Party or partisan way.  I am concerned only with an endeavour to find a solution of the problem in the speediest possible way.  It is in that spirit I offer it to the House. I hope, when the Minister comes to tell us about the commission that he proposes to establish, that he will be able to say that the commission will be charged with the responsibility of applying itself vigorously and speedily to the problem of unemployment so that we can have the proposals of the commission within a reasonably short time, that just as the nation can unite in the face of external danger so also will it be able to unite in eliminating the misery and destitution which tens of thousands of our people endure, thus revealing a ray of hope which has been too long absent from the lives of many of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment to the motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; where it first appears and substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A commission should be appointed to inquire into and report upon the extent, cause, incidence, general character and other aspects of unemployment, and to make proposals in relation thereto.  Dáil Eireann requests the Government to appoint such a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put down this amendment in exactly the same spirit as Deputy Norton has addressed himself to the motion here this evening, that is, with a desire to take this important matter of unemployment, as far as it can be done, out of the regions of partisanship and political exploitation.  We have done that because we are satisfied that the more public attention is devoted to this problem, the <Col N="937" /> more we can have an impartial investigation of it, the more it will be clear that it cannot be solved by any of the facile methods which are so often advocated from Party political platforms.</P>
    <P>In speaking to my amendment and, naturally, to the resolution which is before the House, I am somewhat at a disadvantage; a disadvantage which has been created by the speech of Deputy Norton, because, whether for good or ill, in discussions here, or indeed in discussions upon any subject, I try, or without even trying, I involuntarily do stick as closely as possible to the ostensible object of the subject of the debate.  The subject which was proposed for our consideration is set out here in the terms of the motion.  Now it may have been that Deputy Norton's treatment of his resolution was somewhat altered by the fact that we have thought it advisable in the public interest to accept the principle of a commission of inquiry into the problem of unemployment.We, therefore, had perhaps a less closely knit argument in favour of the resolution than otherwise we should have had.  The Deputy covered a wide field.  Some of the statements which he made in the course of his speech rather exemplify the complexity of this particular problem and the variety of the methods which are proposed for its amelioration.  Not all of these remedies are consistent with each other.  Some of the suggested remedies, I think, would be more likely to intensify the problem and the evil than to ease it.</P>
    <P>But there are some points in Deputy Norton's speech which I think should be challenged and can be disproved by actual facts.  He has implied that there has been a neglect upon the part of the Administration to provide, where possible, employment for our people by the development of our natural resources.  In that connection, he mentioned particularly the scope which this country afforded for afforestation.  I think that a reference to the Estimates and Appropriation Accounts of this State over the past eight years&mdash;and I do not wish, by referring to that period, to decry at <Col N="938" /> all what was done under the preceding Administration; I mention it because it is the period for which this Government had particular responsibility&mdash; and a reference to the money that has been spent and to the area that has been planted, if we consider them rationally and reasonably and coolly, will show that a very great advance has been made in the development of the forestry industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Now I know there are people who would say: &ldquo;Take all the mountain sides and plant them,&rdquo; and I know that there are others who would say: &ldquo;Take all the land that appears to be waste and plant it, so that we shall have within a short period the country covered by trees.  We have endeavoured to formulate a programme which will ultimately result, in as speedy a time as possible, in all the land in this country that is available for forestry being applied to that purpose.That has been our objective.  In seeking to realise that objective, we have sought the most skilful advice available to us, not merely in this country but in Europe.  When we were launching the forestry programme we searched the world to get the best available scientific and practical advice as to the lines upon which we ought to proceed.  Those who were in charge of forestry knew that, if we could get a well-conceived plan backed by men of experience, by men who could not merely talk about forestry, who could not merely be eloquent about trees, but who had planted trees and had managed forests and whose efforts in other countries had been crowned with practical success, men in whom we could have confidence, money, at any rate, was not going to stand in the way of its development.</P>
    <P>When both those of us who are laymen and know little about this matter, and those of us who have some knowledge of it, began to discuss it with people who had been chosen because of their expertness in regard to it, we found that we had to proceed upon an orderly basis, that progress at the beginning was bound to be slow, but that it would be ever accelerating.  I say that the extent to which we have already put land in this country under <Col N="939" /> timber is a practical demonstration of the fact that, if a solution for unemployment were to be found in the wider afforestation of the country, we, at any rate, were not prepared to baulk at that.  But trees take time to mature and so does a forestry programme. Land is not easy to get in this country for forestry because men who have land and are making a living out of it, and whose opinion upon this matter is perhaps entitled to as much weight as the opinion of any publicist, consider that the land would be as productive to them and to the nation if it were utilised for the ordinary purposes of agriculture rather than for afforestation purposes.  No matter where you go in this country you will find, in relation to that matter, an unwillingness to surrender soil.  So that you had on the one hand the situation that our skilled advisers&mdash;and I think that their opinion counts in this matter for as much as the opinion of any other man &mdash;laid down an orderly programme which they said we could undertake, which they said we could carry out, and which they said would lead ultimately to success, and against that we had the necessity to convince our own people and to satisfy ourselves that land which was already being used for the purpose of maintaining this population in one way could be more usefully devoted to another purpose.  I think, therefore, that neither Deputy Norton nor any other person who is concerned with unemployment in this country can justify the allegation that we have been slow or neglectful in endeavouring to find employment for our people in the afforestation of our country.</P>
    <P>Again, the Deputy has suggested that there has been some remissness on our part in developing the minerals of this country.  The mineral resources of the Twenty-Six Counties have been under continuous survey for many years past.  In many cases, they have been intensively investigated within the past eight or ten years.  They are by no means, in my view, as extensive as is popularly believed.They are not, by modern standards, rich.  Over a prolonged period of time they could only have <Col N="940" /> been developed by withdrawing from other productive uses capital which was much more profitably employed in providing work for our people.  For many of these substances which we have there is no market available in this State.  For many of the substances which we have we could not possibly have developed a means of utilising them in this country upon any economic basis, not even upon the basis of forced labour.  This situation may change; with the inflation of costs elsewhere we may be able, if time permits, to develop some of these mineral resources, the products of some of which would have to be disposed of outside this State.  Others of them we have long intended to develop for our own use.  There were difficulties in the way.  We found our existing legislation unsatisfactory.  We were uncertain as to the extent of these resources, but in regard to some of them, particularly those which would make up for our fuel deficiencies, we hope to come to the Dáil in the near future and ask the Dáil to give us the financial authority necessary to exploit and to utilise these particular deposits.</P>
    <P>If we have not come to the Dáil before this, it is because these are matters that require a good deal of careful investigation before we can commit ourselves to a particular line of development.  Last night I was responsible for asking the Dáil to make it clear beyond doubt that the Electricity Supply Board had power to erect a peat fuel generating station at Portarlington. In the Second Reading upon the particular Bill concerned with that matter I set out the full position in regard to the development of the Clonsast Bog. What was the principal criticism that I had to face in that debate?  It was this: That a certain experiment in the utilisation of peat had been undertaken&mdash;it had been undertaken, so far as we could ensure it, under competent auspices by firms of international reputation, by people who were supposed to be experts in the particular process which was adopted&mdash;and that, unfortunately, the experiment did not turn out successfully&mdash;that it did not justify itself, I was going to say&mdash;but, if only to prove that the method was wrong, that <Col N="941" /> it was merely a will-o'-the-wisp like so many other suggestions thrown out from time to time for the development of our natural resources, that it was going to lead us astray and was a waste of national energy and national resources, I think we were justified in undertaking that experiment.  If it had been a success, a great many of our problems would have been solved.  At any rate, it was undertaken and a large amount of public money was lost. What was the result?  When I came here again with another proposal, to try to develop the peat resources of the country, which would give a great deal more employment than the afforestation of the land or the development of most of our minerals, the big criticism which I had to meet, the argument which was launched against us, was the fact that one experiment had gone wrong and that money had been lost.</P>
    <P>I am only adducing that to show that before the Government can make itself responsible for any large-scale project, no matter how attractive it might appear from the point of view of employment, and from the point of view of self-sufficiency, it should very carefully consider whether the proposal is a practical one or not.  Therefore, I do not make an apology for the fact that in relation to the development of some of our fuel resources, we have had to give a great deal of consideration as to how we would proceed and whether we would proceed at all or not.  The ordinary investigations which take place, the pioneer work which has to be gone through quietly, take a great deal of time, and even then it is sometimes difficult, as a result of the reports which one receives, to make up one's mind whether we should go ahead with a project or not.  Again, bearing in mind the scantiness of our mineral resources and the legislative obstacles in our way; bearing in mind the fact that we have already had many surveys of this country, no one can say, that if the problem of providing employment could be solved by the development of our mineral resources, we have been reluctant or even negligent in exploring that possibility.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Norton suggested what I do not think is a fact.  He said <Col N="942" /> that in his view there had been no increase in agricultural productivity for a considerable number of years.  If he means that the extent to which land is under cultivation in this country is, perhaps, not very greatly in excess of what it was some years ago, he might be right, but that simply ignores the fact that heavier crops have been taken off the land, and that agriculture has become more technically efficient, and does not require a larger area to produce more.  But let us assume that Deputy Norton's contention is right.  I think it was not sufficient to state that contention.  In a debate of this sort, where we are supposed to be dealing with employment in a practical way, and where undoubtedly he is concerned with the problem, he might have stated in broad lines what remedy he would propose for the situation.  For a considerable number of years we have been dependent upon others to consume the greater part of our agricultural products.  If they are unwilling or unable to buy our agricultural produce, can the Deputy suggest why we should increase agricultural production if, in fact, we cannot find a market for it?  Can he suggest how we can get a wider market for this expanding agricultural production which he thinks the Government has somehow failed to secure?  If we are selling in an external market we have to sell there in competition with others.  If we are going to get increased production here, quite obviously it must be production which is going to be profitable to the producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not forgotten that the Deputy was talking about what is in the pool.  Let us assume that we are proceeding upon this basis, that if a man is going to produce, so far as is known at the moment, the sole incentive he has is that he knows whatever he produces he will be able to dispose of it at a price which he regards <Col N="943" /> as being satisfactory.  There might be some other way to make the productive mechanism work&mdash;I do not know of it.  If the Deputy knows it I suggest he ought to have told the House, and allowed those who might be a little sceptical to brood upon it. Self-sufficiency never meant that we should consume here all we produce. What we mean is that we should produce enough for ourselves and export the surplus, because it is quite clear, judged by any ordinary European standard, that with our population and our country we could produce very much more food than we would be able to consume ourselves.  Getting back to the point which I was putting to Deputy Norton, that if our producers are to expand their production they must be satisfied that they are going to be able to produce profitably&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the vaunted value of the home market?  I think it is still a good market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is still a very good market, but I want to know how the Deputy would propose to stimulate that market.  I gathered that the Deputy has some proposal for that, and that, as he said, it was that we should give to the people who are not producing and to all others who are denied, perhaps, the opportunity of productive employment, a share in the pool.  Very well, there are, according to the Deputy, 107,000 people on the unemployment register.  The figure is a slight understatement; there, are 109,000.  However, of those 109,000, 42,000 are people who have come on the unemployment register since the 31st October&mdash;people who live in country districts, many of them land holders.  I suppose, if there were that strong urge to produce, which Deputy Norton suggests there would be in this country if we could only properly stimulate it, they would begin by producing enough food for themselves, and they were encouraged to produce sufficient for their own maintenance, at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are further put in a position to consume the products of other people's activity by securing unemployment assistance; but the fact that they do <Col N="944" /> get unemployment assistance upon its present scale, or upon any other scale which would satisfy the demands of the Deputy, does not mean that there would be, on the whole, an increase in the general volume of consumption.  There may be a fairer distribution of consumption as between all the elements of the population but, if you take away from one end of the scale to give to people at the other end, you are certainly not going to allow the purchasing power at the top end of the scale to remain undiminished.All these simple remedies that the Deputy has suggested&mdash;and which he thinks can readily be applied, if only there were in power in this State a Government prepared to accept them at his value of their efficacy&mdash; are not a solution for this problem.</P>
    <P>Then, the Deputy has suggested that one of the reasons for the gravity of this problem is the fact that our currency notes are backed by British bonds, and our adherence to present financial methods.  I do not know that the fact that other States in Europe have not adhered to our financial methods has been productive of any very great good for humanity in general.  I suppose it is inadvisable to particularise, but there are States in Europe&mdash;or perhaps it would be more correct to say, there were States in Europe&mdash; whose leading and most influential politicians had exactly the same outlook upon this problem as Deputy Norton has, and who had exactly the same solution for it.  That did not save them, either from the evils of unemployment or from the worse evils which have befallen them.</P>
    <P>It used to be the common cant: &ldquo;the bank of this country, the bank of that country, the makers of credit are controlling the State; if only we could get somebody to stand up to its evil agencies, there would be an end to unemployment in our particular country, and there would be prosperity and happiness for us all.&rdquo;  It was tried in some countries, and the ultimate result was to bankrupt the treasury and overthrow the nation and the State. I am not saying that there is any virtue in this or that particular financial system; I am saying that there is a great deal of virtue, in these matters, <Col N="945" /> in being prudent.  We do not need to be very great economists, nor even to be expert bankers, to realise that if your productive processes depend for their financing upon the fact that people make savings, that men are prepared to deny themselves a temporary pleasure in order to have some security and some assurance for the future.  The moment you begin to embark upon courses which, to their minds, endanger those savings, the whole basis of your productive structure begins to fall away.</P>
    <P>We have seen in other countries lavish expenditure, unjustifiable expenditure, optimistic expenditure upon this and that sort of undertaking, and all the time we have seen the standard of value in those countries gradually decline in terms of real value, until ultimately everything that the worker had saved, everything that he had got together by self denial and self discipline disappeared, and with it disappeared the character of the people.</P>

      <P>Again, on this aspect of the present situation, the Deputy suggested that some part of our ills arose from the fact that&mdash;to use his own expression, without adopting it as my own or accepting for a moment that it describes the true situation&mdash; our currency notes were backed by British bonds; and then he suggested what would happen if Britain were defeated and these notes were valueless.So far as our currency notes are concerned, and so far as the internal resources of our people are concerned, nothing would happen.  At the moment a great deal might happen if, by reason of that collapse, we were to lose one of the principal sources of our income in the form of a good customer on the other side of the water, but if to-morrow the securities in the Legal <Col N="946" /> Tender Note Fund were to be written down as worthless, the only thing would be a loss of a few million pounds to the Currency Commission.  The general economic structure would not be changed one iota, provided that our industry and British industry still remained in production.</P>

      <P>The Deputy quite forgets that, so far as the currency issue is concerned, the only thing that is done by the device of having our currency backed by legal tender is to ensure that, when an Irish farmer sells to an English buyer, both buyer and seller are talking in terms of the same real value.  Each knows what is in the other's mind, and there is no doubt about the terms of the contract.</P>

      <P>As I say, that is beside the issue.  I am sorry, Sir, if I have had to digress a bit, but it seems to me, though I would not say that Deputy Norton's speech was not germane to the motion, it did not adhere as strictly to the terms of the motion as I should have liked.  I had intended, if he had made a different sort of speech, to point out that this unemployment problem is not capable of a facile solution.  I do not think it is in the power of any body of men, no matter how expeditiously, how enthusiastically and zealously they tackled the problem, to produce a solution for it in six months, and certainly not a solution upon the lines suggested in the motion.  If this evil could be cured by a number of human beings taking counsel together for six months I do not think the problem would exist in the world to-day. <Col N="947" /> But it cannot be solved thus, because the causes of unemployment are, as must be well known to any person who has practical experience of the way the world works, diverse, and, as I have said, are very complex.  You have seasonal employment, you have unemployment which arises out of a shortage of materials, you have unemployment which arises out of accidents, out of vicissitudes, and out of the ordinary necessities, sometimes out of accountancy.You have unemployment which arises in those classes which normally meet the casual demands of industry: those who are employed as dockers, and of others who are employed in transport undertakings. Over and above all these you have fluctuations in employment which arise from fluctuations in demand and from a change in the public taste.  Take one instance.  You have unemployment in the linen trade because people are turning more and more to articles made of what is known as artificial silk fibre for the purposes of adornment.  You have unemployment growing even within the ranks of one particular industry.You have unemployment increasing, perhaps, in tobacco factories which cater for the pipe smoker, and employment increasing in the other end of the scale, in factories which cater for the cigarette smoker.  You have unemployment even in various types of amusement.You have employment in the variety theatre going down and in the cinema going up.  This all shows that this is not a simple thing that can be solved in the way that is suggested here&mdash;at least I do not think it can&mdash;and certainly not solved after six months' consideration so as to provide &ldquo;for the absorption in useful employment at adequate remuneration of all workers able to follow useful occupations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going, in that connection, to do more than mention this fact, that the motion assumes that every person who is on the unemployment register is in need of work.  It certainly assumes that all of them want work and that all of them are able to work.  It does assume that, and I suppose its sponsors would say this: that the commission would be bound to recommend, <Col N="948" /> say, useful employment for persons who were in any way physically deformed or physically deficient.  That would not be an easy job.  It would be very difficult to find out what would be the standard of adequate remuneration in that case.  Would you pay a person, say, of sub-normal intelligence the same remuneration as you would pay to a person of the most acute intelligence?</P>
    <P>It would be, accordingly, quite impossible, I think, for the Government to accept this motion.  I have mentioned the terms of it for this reason: that if the Dáil were to accept it, and if the Government acquiesced in that acceptance, the Government would be bound by the precise terms of the motion.It was because it could not accept the motion in its present form that this amendment was put down with the idea&mdash;which apparently was also in the minds of Deputy Norton and of his colleagues&mdash;that we should get a representative and authoritative inquiry undertaken by a body in whom there would be general public confidence, a body which, if we can get it, would lift this question out of the arena of political controversy.  It may not be possible so to lift it.  When we get the report there may be differences of opinion about the merits of the report and of the recommendations which may be made in it.  But, if this commission is set up and if I have any responsibility for it, it will be set up with the <i>bona fide</i> idea of having this matter authoritatively investigated, of setting before the public, the House and the Legislature all the facts that can be ascertained, and of getting, as well as that, the recommendations which a body of responsible, authoritative people feel they can make upon the facts, as they have been disclosed to them, and the facts as they have been able to ascertain them as a result of that investigation. I am not going to bind myself to any time or to bind them to work within any time limit.  I think we can get men who will approach this task with devotion, who will not allow time to be frittered away in useless discussions, but who will endeavour to get at the root of the matter so far as it <Col N="949" /> is possible for human minds to do that, and come to the Dáil, to the Oireachtas and to the country with well-considered proposals which we, in turn, should examine, and if, in the common wisdom of us all, we find them to be feasible would adopt and give effect to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having had occasion on the previous motion to take the Minister to task for his approach to that motion, I should like now to compliment him on his attitude to this motion.  I do not say that I find myself in agreement with everything the Minister has said, but he did approach it, and the problem contained in it and in the resolution, in a serious and constructive way.  I find myself in rather a difficulty regarding both the motion and the amendment.  First of all, I have to ask myself why the Government, having regard to world conditions since the outbreak of the war and what they are likely to be until the war is ended and even for a considerable time after, should choose this particular time to set up a commission to enquire into this whole question of unemployment and its solution.  I agree absolutely with one thing the Minister said.  This, he said, is not a simple thing.  Some of us have always said that we have never blinked the fact that it was one of the most difficult problems that could face any Government, one that was almost impossible of solution, and certainly very difficult even to relieve.  But we have made progress, if only to the extent that the Minister and his colleagues now realise that it is not a simple one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me, however, get back to my difficulty regarding the usefulness of a commission or a committee being set up at the moment, whether its report be received in six months, 12 months or in two years.  Up to the date of the outbreak of the war our unemployment problem was largely, if not altogether, a domestic one, to the extent that its solution, or relief, was largely in our own hands, and would be affected only to a certain extent, perhaps to a small extent, by outside <Col N="950" /> influences.  The position to-day is completely and absolutely different.  It is no longer completely within our own control and, as the war goes on, it will be still less within our power to control it.  We have to face this fact, that we are thinking of setting up a commission to inquire into a problem, and into every aspect of that problem, which is changing not only from week to week but from day to day, and to inquire into a problem which, unless we are amazingly fortunate, is going to be added to and increased for every day that the war lasts.  Do we not know, for instance, that there are men to-day in this country in comparatively good employment, working under good conditions and, in many industries, in large numbers, who, by the course of events completely outside our control, may be all thrown out of employment next week, next month or in three months' time?  Is it not quite on the cards, being determined not by us but by the course of the war, that instead of having 100,000 unemployed, we may have 200,000 unemployed before this time 12 months?</P>
    <P>I think I can say that I am probably as anxious to have this matter properly and carefully inquired into and reported upon as anybody else, but I do want seriously to ask the House whether we are doing anything useful in setting up a commission or a committee at this particular moment to inquire into this problem, or whether it would be possible for any such committee or commission, no matter how well intentioned, no matter with what devotion it may approach its task, within six or 12 months to produce a report that will be of any use?  Let us assume that it would be possible for a commission or committee to do what the motion asks, to examine this problem in all its bearings and to present a report to the Government within six months.  Within one week of the report being presented, world events may take such a course as to make the report almost valueless and change altogether the circumstances and conditions obtaining at the time when the report was drafted and when the evidence upon which it was based was collected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> I seem to be trying to throw cold water on both the motion and the amendment, but if I am, it is not merely for the sake of doing so, but because I realise, as I have always realised, that this is a great problem and a very difficult problem, and because I do not want us here deliberately to fool ourselves into believing that we are doing something practical towards solving or relieving this unemployment problem by setting up a commission in present circumstances.  I must confess that I am always very suspicious of commissions.  I think that in this House we have some reason for being suspicious because the practice&mdash;I do not say that my suspicions are well founded in this case&mdash; has been that problems, as soon as they become difficult and troublesome, are referred to a commission.  It is a very effective way of gagging the House and preventing any further references, motions or speeches in relation to the problem.  We know that problems&mdash;I will not say as important as this, but problems of a very grave nature, affecting a great part, if not all, of the country&mdash;were referred to commissions two, three, four and five years ago, and that we have never heard of them since.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of, frankly, is that facing the problem as we have to face it as it exists to-day&mdash;and with respect to Deputy Norton, I want to say that if the Minister is 100 per cent. genuine, as I believe he is, in this amendment, there is very little practical difference between it and the motion&mdash;we have, some of us, become rather tired of continually talking about this problem, year in and year out, and rather tired of reading at this period every year that the registered unemployment number 100,000, 102,000 104,000 or 106,000.  We have almost allowed ourselves to become accustomed to it and to look upon that figure as a figure that should be there, as a sort of normal figure, and are inclined to pat ourselves on the back if the figure this week is 106,000 compared with 108,000 or 104,000 for the corresponding week last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt very briefly <Col N="952" /> towards the end of his speech with various forms of unemployment, temporary and permanent, and how they arise.  That, I say with respect, is very largely what would be known as normal unemployment and displacement.What we are dealing with, and what is our big trouble, is the abnormal unemployment that undoubtedly exists.  I frankly confess that I am not in a position to put before the House at this moment, nor am I going to say that I should be able to do it in a month's time, a better way than is suggested on the paper, but I am pointing out to the House the danger of allowing ourselves to be blinded by the idea that &ldquo;unemployment is all right now as we have referred it to a commission&rdquo;.That would be dangerous enough in normal times, but in a time like this, it is still more dangerous. So far as it is humanly possible to foresee the course of world events&mdash; and, God knows, nobody can see them very far ahead&mdash;there is no question whatever that every day this war lasts, it is having its effects on the economic life of this as of every other country in the world, and as it goes on, I am afraid it is going to have greater and more progressively bad results for us and is going to affect, in a very distinct and evident way, our whole economy, employment and so on.  That is the position as I see it and I doubt if any commission or committee, set up in these circumstances and working with the best will in the world, is going to produce data upon which the Government will be able to act in the conditions which may obtain in six, 12 or 18 months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support the motion.  As I see it, the fundamental difference between it and the amendment is that whereas the motion fixes a definite time limit within which the Government must provide some form of solution of this problem, the amendment shelves the entire question by turning it over to a commission.  I do not think the Government can have any great faith in the provision by a commission of a solution of this problem, when we realise that a commission set up a short time ago to deal with agriculture, the main industry <Col N="953" /> of the country, has been discontinued by, I suppose, its own decision or the decision of the Government.  It has certainly been suspended for the duration of the emergency and, therefore, it seems to me that a commission such as this cannot do any better than the Commission on Agriculture, because I believe that the Commission on Agriculture would, in the ordinary course of events, have to deal with the same problems as those with which this commission is intended to deal.</P>
      <P>In the motion before the House it is intended to fix a definite time-limit and that time-limit would be, at least, a source of worry to our Government and cause them to devote more attention to this problem during the six months allowed.  The Minister, I agree, approached this problem in a serious manner and made a fairly plausible case for the amendment, up to a certain point.  In so far as he dealt with afforestation, I should be inclined to agree with him because I come from a county in which afforestation has been tried out and I know the difficulties with which a Government department has to contend.  I know that this problem is not a simple one, that the acquisition of land is not a simple process and that it is not at all certain that the type of land which would be devoted to afforestation would give a bigger return under timber than it would by grazing, as at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding mineral development, I am sure there are also grave difficulties.I do not think, however, that all the difficulties in regard to peat-development have been properly faced up to by the present Government.  I know that, so far as peat-development by the ordinary small holders in my constituency is concerned, the problem has not been faced up to by the Government.I know that a number of unemployed men who undertook the winning and drying of peat have found, after months of this work, that their produce is unsaleable.  That position should not have been allowed to arise. When unemployed men go to work on their own initiative and provide fuel, which is a very useful commodity, for the community in general, if there is <Col N="954" /> not other means of disposing of such produce, the State should come in and assure them a market.  If they did that, I am sure peat-development by the small holders and by the unemployed generally would be intensified in the coming years.</P>
    <P>When the Minister reached the question of food production, I think he was not on as sound a footing as he was in regard to the other suggested developments.  He said there was no market for increased food supplies but it should be apparent to him at once that if all the unemployed were in full employment, there would be an increased market within this country for an increased food supply.  He does not seem to realise how important that market might be.  Because he did not face up to that, I believe there was a weakness in his argument.  Land is, and will always remain, the biggest source of employment in this country.</P>
    <P>When we realise the number of agricultural holdings we have, when we realise the number of people who have managed to live, in some way, on small holdings, and when we realise how little employment there is on other holdings&mdash;employment which could be increased if some profitable means of marketing the produce were provided &mdash;then we must realise that there is an opportunity of solving the unemployment problem, to a great extent, through the increased development of the agricultural industry.  If, for example, on 100,000 agricultural holdings, one additional man were employed, you would have the unemployment problem practically solved.  Because of that fact, it ought to be apparent to the Government that agriculture offers the main solution of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We are taxing the agricultural population and the community in general to maintain not only the 100,000 people who are at present unemployed but also to provide other forms of relief, such as home assistance, free medical attendance and the other aids required by impoverished people.  If these people were in a position of independence, as they would be if they had permanent employment, then the agricultural <Col N="955" /> industry would be relieved of a heavy load.  Therefore, I say that it is in directing the unemployed members of our community into productive work on the land that the solution of this problem will be found.  One step in the direction of solving the problem would be to ensure that no unemployed man, either in town or country, would be without an allotment for the coming year.  That would help in some measure to increase production.  I know that an attempt has been made this year to assist agriculture and to relieve unemployment in a small way by providing grants for land improvement.  The unfortunate thing is that the ordinary man whose land requires improvement in this manner has not the necessary capital to avail of such grants.  For that reason, I believe that this scheme of land improvement should be assisted by loans to cover the half-cost of the scheme which the farmer is expected to bear.  I agree with this motion inasmuch as it would make the problem of unemployment more urgent to the Government and would compel them, if passed, to concentrate all the brains and all the intelligence which they can mobilise upon the solution of that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has wondered whether the present time is a good time for setting up a commission of this sort.  Naturally, that occurred to us too.  There is no doubt that there are features about the present unemployment which may not be lasting, but on the other hand there are certain features of our whole unemployment problem which will, I fear, remain, and which will need a solution, and it is very much better that those aspects should be considered now so that measures might be taken as speedily as possible both to relieve the situation in the present circumstances and also to meet those very difficult days, which will be just as difficult from that point of view, when this war is over.  On the whole then we think it is advisable, if an investigation of this sort is to be made, that it should be made as quickly as possible.  Now, I must confess at the start that I have very grave doubts that any investigation <Col N="956" /> which is likely to be made is going to provide us with a solution.  What it will provide, I hope, is an authoritative account to which we can point as having been given by a party or by a body which will have examined the question scientifically with no other aim but to present the facts truly, and if possible to indicate remedies.</P>
      <P>No matter how we may appear to differ by our arguments and discussions here, there is a great deal of common ground in this House with regard to the whole question of unemployment. We differ as to the practicability of certain remedies that are suggested, but fundamentally there is very little difference between us on the nature of unemployment and our duty in as far as possible to find a remedy.  Deputy Norton spoke somewhat slightingly, unnecessarily so, it seemed to me, of the Article of the Constitution which deals with this particular matter.  I think it is a very good thing for all Parties here and for the country as a whole to know that there are certain principles which have been accepted as guiding principles for our efforts in this direction.  There is no question, there can be no question here, that our aim, the aim of State policy in economic matters, must be the welfare of the whole community.  There is no question of difference between us, if we accept the general principles of the Constitution, that the aim should be so to provide, so to order things in so far as we can order them, that the individual may, through his occupation, that is through the services which he is prepared to render to the community as a whole, find the means of livelihood the means of meeting his domestic needs.  That is taken as fundamental and in any differences here we are not questioning that.  What we do question from time to time is whether or not a particular proposal will help more to put us into that position.  We differ from time to time with regard to those proposals and as to their results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money has been mentioned here.  We have put our position in regard to credit beyond even the possibility of dispute in our acceptance of the guiding principles of the Constitution by <Col N="957" /> saying that in all matters which appertain to the control of credit the dominating matter must be the welfare of the community as a whole.  I think that instead of talking slightingly of those principles we ought from time to time to appeal to them, and if they are appealed to at all, or mentioned at all by way of criticism, they ought to be mentioned by way of criticism of a particular administration that has failed in some particular way in regard to trying to give effect to those principles.Now, I have no doubt Deputy Norton would say that that is precisely the way in which he wanted to refer to this, and to state that we, who accepted those principles in the Constitution, are failing to live up to them. Well, if we have failed to live up to them it is due to the fact that we have not been able to get to the point at which those aims are secured.  It has not been through complacency on our part, or neglect of those principles. Personally, I hold those principles as strongly now as I did when I was introducing the draft Constitution here in the Dáil, and I believe, notwithstanding the differences of opinion, that we all hold those principles.  If it can be shown that in any particular way we could have taken action to make those principles good, and have not done it, then we are blameworthy, and we have to face any blame that attaches to us on that account, but I certainly am not conscious that the Government has failed to strive to get a solution of this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, I must admit, touched it only very slightly, but there were times at which we could expect that we would be reminded of our attitude towards unemployment before we came into office.  I did say and believe that because we had relatively undeveloped industries in this country we had a solution for unemployment which was not available to countries that had all their industries advanced to producing more than they required themselves.  I remember a time when there was some figure like 80,000, and I was able to show by calculation from the figures which we had in regard to the manufacture of boots, woollens, and industries of various kinds, that if we <Col N="958" /> could exclude any foreign competition, certainly during the period when the industries were being built up, we could put roughly that number of people into employment in those industries.  We proceeded along that line, and the fact is that there are in those industries, in the industries that have been established, very roughly the number that was mentioned at that particular time. If we try to examine this whole question, examine it carefully, calmly and dispassionately, without any effort to make capital for a particular view, but just examine it from the point of view of getting at the truth and getting at the best possible remedy, we will very soon convince ourselves that, with the resources which we have and making the fullest possible use of those resources, there will still be left a considerable quantity of things which we must import from outside if we are going to have here a standard of living comparable to that in adjacent countries.</P>
    <P>I believe that the more we try to develop our own resources and use all the available man power and all the available capital to do it the more are we likely to lighten our unemployment problem.  That is disputed, but we, at any rate, have proceeded along that line.  But even straining that policy to a point at which it becomes almost patent that we are not going to improve the general standard, that is pushing that policy to an extreme&mdash;and we never intended that it should be pushed to an extreme&mdash;you find that there is still a considerable quantity of goods which we must get from outside. Of course, if we get them from outside, if we neglect for the moment the credits which we have got&mdash;and they are considerable, I admit&mdash;and if in the long run we want not to diminish our general wealth but to increase it, we must be able to export sufficient to purchase these commodities.  Now, what are we to export?  The moment we study that question we naturally think of the industry which we have used for our exports in the past.  There is no doubt that we can produce from our land a great deal more than is necessary to feed our whole community, <Col N="959" /> including the unemployed, and that really it is our principal industry, the one which by nature is most fitted to be used to get the surplus for export which is necessary.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke a short time ago.  Deputy Norton said it revealed his whole mind.  If he meant by that that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is no believer in an attempt to produce here everything that it is reasonably possible to produce, I think he is wronging him.  What was clearly intended by him was to state that if we have not everything&mdash; and we have not&mdash;we must purchase those goods outside.  There are certain things for which we could get substitutes, but it would be extremely difficult to get our people to take those substitutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not obvious, if we want to feed our unemployed, to feed all our people, employed and unemployed, and seeing that we can do that from the produce of our land, that ought to be the first purpose of our land&mdash;to produce food?  But if it is also to be the means by which we are to purchase from outside the things that we want it is obvious that we ought to try to increase that unless, as it has frequently happened, the conditions are such that even when you increase production, on account of the limited demand there may be in the market, you do not get more for your produce.  But, ordinarily, we ought to try to develop our agriculture and to get the greatest possible amount from the land and, of course, if we are able to improve methods of production we will be able, so to speak, to lessen costs.  In any case, if we are going to get things from outside&mdash;and I think everybody will admit that an astonishingly large proportion of things has to <Col N="960" /> be got from outside if our present tastes continue and if we want to have here the same standards as they have in other countries&mdash;we will have to produce other things for export.  Unfortunately, we have not petrol here, and it is difficult to get substitutes for it. If we want to get the petrol which will enable us to have the conveniences that the motor-car affords, if we want to have tea, we will have to produce other things to export so as to buy these.  That is so simple that everybody agrees with it.  There is no need to make this as an argument; it is only just to point out its importance in the whole thing.  We have, therefore, to ask ourselves the question, what are we going to produce from?  Clearly from the land.  Can we get into motor-car production?  If we do, we will have to remember, to start with, that we have a limited market here at home and that we would have to work much harder and be more efficient than they are in other countries, where they have an immediate market in their own country which they can protect and look after.  They have the basal big market of their own, and in the case of the export market they can sell relatively much cheaper than we could with a small home market.  Although I think it would be a great mistake for us to lose sight of the possibilities of other industrial products being exported&mdash;I think in fact we have to try to do it&mdash;if we are going to be successful we must remember that we would have to put a great deal of labour into it; we would have to try to organise ourselves to be more efficient than they are elsewhere.  That is not going to be an easy task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what the Deputy said that there are obvious ways in which we can employ our idle people in capital reproductive works, I have been, I admit, searching for these.  If we could find them they, in addition to the ordinary industries producing the consumable commodities from day to day, would be invaluable, but I am afraid when you search you will discover you are not going to find very much.  Some have been indicated by the Deputy.  There is the old question <Col N="961" /> of afforestation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has already dealt with that and pointed out that we did not approach that problem from any conservative point of view. We tried to get the best expert advice we could, and I can say to the House that I have pushed successive Ministers to the point at which they practically went beyond anything that their Departments were prepared to agree to in order to push that programme. The latest I have heard from it is that in their opinion a programme of 10,000 acres a year is as much as can be handled economically and in the general interests.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out the difficulty that there is in securing land.  Suppose we say that the agricultural land we have in the country ought to be put out of production of, say, cattle and any other agricultural commodities which we are exporting at present and they say to us: &ldquo;But for that you have a very good external market; it is not going to be profitable to put the rest of the land under trees&rdquo;, you see what a social revolution would be required to do that unless you were to get each particular farmer to take a portion of his own farm and to plant it with trees.  But no farmer is likely to do that because, unfortunately, the return from the planting of trees does not come for a generation.</P>
    <P>We have to live, at least the individual has to live, very much in the present, and it is only the State as a whole that can look after long-term periods such as are required for afforestation. The State is trying, by pushing along the programme I have indicated, to provide for our future needs in regard to timber.  It is estimated that the 10,000 acres, when they come in rotation, will supply our requirements.There is no use in having feast and famine.  What you want is to have a continual rotation and a continual supply and to secure that a 10,000 acre programme is likely to be sufficient.  If we can get the land, and get it planted and do things in a rational way and expand our programme <Col N="962" /> where possible, we are quite willing to do it.</P>
    <P>The next thing that was mentioned, I think, was housing.  In regard to housing, we certainly cannot be accused of not trying to push the building of houses.  You have only to look around or drive in any direction through the country and you will see the results of the work that has been done in regard to housing in the last ten, 15 or 20 years.  Whether we talk of the previous Government or ours&mdash;I think the figures will show that in our time there has been a considerable increase in the number of houses built&mdash; there has been in the minds of those in authority a desire to find satisfactory housing accommodation for our people.  I admit that we are far short of what might be considered a satisfactory solution, but there again you come up against the question of what will it amount to, how much you can afford to do, how much is it economical to do?  We were building at one time at such a rate that it became questionable whether we were not actually making the production of houses much dearer for the community than it ought to be.  I think it will be found in that connection that there is a certain optimum which depends on a number of conditions so far as our country is concerned.</P>
    <P>There was at one time a general feeling that to push the building of houses much more rapidly than we were doing would mean sending up the cost and, therefore, we would be getting very much less value than we were getting for the community at the time.  But houses have to be built by skilled people, and you cannot turn the whole community into a skilled occupation overnight.  I believe that if there was, on the part of all sections of the community, a realisation of the fact that we could develop very much more than we are doing and that there would be no shortage over a long period of years, we would be able to get a better understanding on the part, for instance, of those engaged in the house-building industry, a better understanding of the conditions that are likely to <Col N="963" /> obtain in the future, and a recognition that the sort of fear that this was a flash in the pan, as it were, and would be all over in a year or two, is not well founded.  Of course, whilst building houses we have to remember that people have to be fed and clothed and they must get that material from somewhere out of the pool.  Somebody in the pool is giving it and, if we are going to keep to our principles of private property and individual rights, then these people ought to get some return.</P>
    <P>That brings me immediately to the question of money.  If I have made any blunder, it is in regarding money as of very little fundamental importance in relation to economic matters. I probably would be classed by some of the moderns in economics as one of the older school who thought directly in terms of one set of goods and services in relation to another set.  There are others who are thinking really of money as fundamental and vital.  To me money, in so far as it is of practical value, is simply a means of exchange. There was a certain basis on which we had a standard of value in the old days. There had to be some standard of value and you had an exchange in terms of cows or something else.  Money is useful inasmuch as it gives us a standard of value, and when you are exchanging one thing for another you give the value in terms of the common standard.In that way it is valuable to us. It is also useful inasmuch as if I send goods to a person I get a cheque or notes in exchange.  Whatever you get you can consider it as a commodity.  At the time I get it and when I have it in my hand, although intrinsically it is only a piece of paper, yet inasmuch as it enables me to exchange it for something else I think of it as a common commodity which I use as a means of exchange.</P>
    <P>I know that if we are going to build houses the people who build them will have to get some equivalent for their labour; they will have to get something which will enable them to buy clothes and food.  The clothes and food come from somewhere else and the <Col N="964" /> people who send us those things are entitled to get back the equivalent of them in some other form.  Money does serve that purpose and you cannot very well dispense with it.  If we are building houses that means that the builders and contractors and others have to get an equivalent for their efforts and labour.  That is a credit on somebody and somebody has to pay it back at some time.  The local community had to do it in our case and the stage was reached at which the local community found they were pledging themselves at a far greater rate than they could afford and there was a limit to the amount that could be taken out of the pool.  There was a limit to the extent to which we could go on with work of that kind because there was not an immediate return or the prospect of a return within a short time from the individuals who enjoyed the amenities of the houses.  In other words, the scheme was not able to give back immediately the amount put into it.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that Deputies on the Labour Benches should see that in dealing with this question we have no prejudice with regard to money.  We are not thinking simply of those who manage money and deal with money. We are not in any way affected by ideas of their interest.  We have no interest but the common good but we realise that what has to be given has to come somewhere out of the pool of production, or out of our past savings, and that there is no place else from which it can be obtained.  No matter what you say about public credit, you have ultimately to maintain those people who are at work.  It is said that there is a great deal of waste in people being idle.  Admitted&mdash;a tremendous waste, if you mean by &ldquo;waste&rdquo; that we would be much better off if we could put them to productive work; but that is the rub, to find work in which they will put into the pool more than they take out of it.  The difficulty is to find exactly the direction in which you will put them to work so that you can get more from the results of their labour than they have consumed in doing the work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> There is another point, that in order to put people to work you have to supply them with materials and if the result of the work is not equivalent to the value of the materials which have been used up&mdash;either in the way of instruments or raw material&mdash;and the money that has been expended on their maintenance, the question arises whether it is not better for the community just to maintain these people than to put them to work if the results of that work mean that the community is not as a whole enriched.  Again, you will find on examination that there are a number of works in respect to which you cannot say that the community is being enriched.  Take for instance land reclamation.  One of the difficulties about land reclamation is that in our conditions and circumstances it is extremely difficult to prove that the money that is spent&mdash;and when I say money I am thinking of the material wealth that is used in the doing of this work&mdash;will come back to the community in some form of equivalent value.  If not, then what you are doing is really wasting material wealth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I know there are people who would say that if you can get coal from abroad at a cheaper rate than you can produce it at home, and if you can pay for this coal with exports of agricultural produce, it is much better to produce agricultural produce and buy coal from abroad rather than to put people to produce coal at home.  There is a difference of view between myself and others who have expressed these ideas from time to time in the House.  On general principles, I would rather produce coal at home, even though it could not be proved directly and immediately that it was going to be produced more cheaply than we could buy it abroad, because I believe it would be of more lasting advantage to the country and would give us greater security and independence in times of crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember this whole question of free trade and self-development is not <Col N="966" /> a new subject.  It is a subject that has been thrashed out in various countries for generations.  There are people who hold certain strong views on this matter.  They may differ from me but if I had to make a choice I would go further even than the Minister for Industry and Commerce in these matters.  Personally I believe you will not get any solution of this problem based on the recommendations of a commission.  I do not think a commission will solve it.  I believe that a certain amount of risk has to be taken, that what you want is to decide upon policy and to pursue that policy day in, day out.  If there are going to be any results from that policy, they will then show themselves but that you can prove absolutely at the start that a particular line is going to be successful, I think is unlikely.  In regard to coal, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is pushing ahead as far as he can I have been speaking to him about it and he is pushing ahead with all possible speed to try to develop coal resources where they exist at all or where they hold any chance of being reasonably successful.</P>

There are, of course, certain difficulties and if we were more ruthless in dealing <Col N="967" /> with them we might get results more quickly.  Again in that matter I agree with those who say that we are getting to a certain point where some people might think that we are too prudent.  I think there will be mistakes, and in some cases we may be disappointed with the final results, but if we are going to face this problem we must be prepared for occasional mistakes.  We are pushing ahead as rapidly as we can.  Somebody spoke about the amount of tillage.  Certainly we have been doing everything we can to increase tillage in the country.  We have done it by giving a guaranteed price in the case of certain vital products.If it is said that the amount of tillage has not increased or that it has been increased on one side at the expense of another, I would say that what we have done is that we have increased the production of what is immediately consumable by our people as against those crops which were not immediately consumable by the people and which were exported by way of being fed to cattle which were afterwards shipped abroad.  We are using our land to produce food which is directly consumable by the people.  I believe the Deputy has about 20 minutes left to conclude the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take less than ten minutes to conclude.  What I have been trying to point out is that there are few directions in which you can say that you can employ people usefully in the sense of getting reproductive work done, meaning by that that you are going to put more into the pool than you are taking out of it.  It is suggested that there are amenities of various kinds.  There again if we want to have amenities of various types, we must pay for them in other ways.</P>
      <P>There is a limit as the Deputy will know.  It is the same, after all, for the community as it is for the family. There are certain distances beyond which we cannot go in providing special amenities.  The fundamental necessities have to be got first and you cannot encroach upon the pool too much, otherwise the necessities have to be sacrificed for the amenities. There again the pressure upon the community as a whole, the amount taken out of the pool as a whole, is so great that I doubt very much if we can at the present moment with our organisation&mdash;certainly it would want to be far better than it is at present&mdash; give ourselves what I might call the luxury of these amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is suggested that other countries have solved that problem, I doubt it very much.  It seems to me that if we want to solve that problem we would want to rid ourselves of a <Col N="969" /> lot of things which we are not prepared to sacrifice.  If we were, for instance, to ask the labouring community to do the things they are asked to do elsewhere in order to provide work, I wonder if they would not be the very first to object.  It is not so easy if a person becomes unemployed in a particular place to take him and his family somewhere else and find employment for them which they can actually do. If a carpenter is unemployed here and if you are building houses somewhere else you might say that he ought to go to that place.  It is not so easy to do that overnight.</P>

      <P>The grievance of the people.  It is to remedy that that you want them to be employed here.  I will admit that it would be less of a grievance if they had to go to Cork. The fact is that it is extremely difficult to take families and send them from one place to another.  These are the things which you will have to have if you want to have the complete and absolute remedies that are said to be found elsewhere.  You will have to say to the people: &ldquo;Here is work for you; you will have to do it at certain wages.&rdquo;  If you are prepared to take this complete power, then it is possible you will get one type of solution for it; but you are going to get it at the sacrifice of other things.  What we are trying to do is this, to get a solution of the problem which will leave us with a number of the things that we are particularly anxious we should continue to have.  But we will not do it without considerable sacrifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as we are concerned we are quite prepared to say, keeping the individual rights there, that the welfare of the whole community has to be the determining purpose of our schemes, and we are prepared to abide by the principles indicated in the Constitution both in regard to the control of credit and in regard to the right of the individual through his occupation to try to get a means of livelihood, in so far as by any human effort, without doing injustice, we are able to do it.  I do not believe for one moment that this commission which you are asking to have set up and which we are prepared to set up is going to find a solution.  It may indicate certain things, but it will be found that most of these things have <Col N="971" /> been taken cognisance of already and that Governmental action to put them into effect would be taken if there were not very serious obstacles in the way. What I do hope the commission will do is that it will give to everybody for examination an authoritative investigation of the problem and a non-partisan statement of it.  If there are different views, we may have different reports, but at any rate it cannot be said that this Party or that Party, for one reason or another, have failed to state the problem as it is and to put forward these recommendations, if those recommendations promise anything like a satisfactory solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether in view of the fact that the Transport Tribunal was established by authority of an order made by Dáil Eireann on December 7th, 1938, he will state by what authority he has declined to submit to Dáil Eireann the reports of the tribunal presented to him in August, 1939.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The warrant appointing the Transport Tribunal was issued by my Department on the 22nd December, 1938, in pursuance of a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on the 7th of that month.  The warrant of appointment of the tribunal required them to inquire into the matters mentioned in the resolution and to report thereon to me.  I am not aware that I am under any obligation to publish the tribunal's reports.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is probable, however, that the reports will be published when the consideration referred to in answers to previous Parliamentary questions has been completed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> I consider that reply was unsatisfactory under two heads.  In the first place it showed that the policy of procrastination which had been adopted in regard to the many questions tabled on the same matter on previous dates by myself and other Deputies was to be continued.But my amazement and disappointment in that regard were completely overshadowed by the expression of the Minister's doubt as to whether he was bound to present the reports of that tribunal to the House.  I think, and I hope the House will record its opinion, that any such tribunal, commission or committee of inquiry set up under the express authority of the House has an unquestionable right to have its report presented to the House which was responsible for setting it up.</P>
    <P>I suggest further that neither the Minister nor the Government, who are only the servants of this Parliament, having received that report, have got any right to withhold it from the Parliament at their pleasure.  I consider that the first function involved in the setting up of that inquiry was to bring enlightenment to the public mind upon a matter of public importance, and I believe that it is entirely out of order for the Government to sit upon this report for so long a period as they have, pending considerations of all sorts and kinds.  I believe they should at least have brought the report back here to the House and so made it available to the people of the country who are vitally concerned upon a very important national question.  It does not necessarily follow that the Government would have to implement the decisions or recommendations of the tribunal immediately they produced the report.  We have had plenty of evidence of other tribunals whose reports have been submitted and in connection with which no action was taken.  This, however, seems to be a new departure, and I believe that it is one to which the House should not lightly agree.  I believe further that we should disabuse the Minister's mind of the opinions he seems to hold as to where his duty lies in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who preceded the present Minister, in introducing the order of <Col N="973" /> the 7th December, 1938&mdash;Column 1401, Volume 73 of the Official Debates&mdash; said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would, probably, serve and fulfil my duty if I said enough to indicate that the matters set out in the motion are matters of urgent public importance.  Some time ago I received from the Great Southern Railways Company, and from the Great Northern Railway Company, representations to the effect that they have reached positions of acute financial stringency, in which they claimed that Government action for their assistance was urgently necessary, if they were to carry on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear to everybody, I think, that the company could not hope to raise, in the ordinary way, any new capital at the present time without Government assistance or Government guarantee and, in these circumstances, the Government are satisfied that a major decision on transport policy must now be taken.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is just one other quotation from the Minister's speech, in the following column, which I should like to give. It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should say that I hope the inquiry to be undertaken will be completed as soon as possible.  Certainly, it is my expectation that we should have the report of the tribunal before us when we meet after the Christmas Recess.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that was the 7th December, 1938, and the date on which we were to resume, after the Christmas Recess, was the 8th February, 1939, and, speaking on that debate, later on the same afternoon, I said that I hoped that the Minister would not unduly rush the matter and that, having regard to the overwhelming importance of the subject under discussion, it would be manifestly unfair to attempt or to hope to get a reasoned decision from the tribunal by the following 8th February.Everybody was aware of the urgency of the problem, but all were equally aware that it should not be rushed unduly.  Now, February, 1939, <Col N="974" /> passed and the two reports were eventually submitted in the month of August, 1939&mdash;I think the dates were the 4th and 11th August&mdash;and since that month of August, 1939, the month of February, 1940, has also passed, and we are now in the month of November, 1940, and there is still no sign whatever from the Minister that he is going to bring into the House and make public that report.</P>
    <P>If we contrast the present Minister's attitude in this connection with that of his predecessor, who set up the tribunal, they seem to be at variance one with the other.  The former Minister, Mr. Lemass, thought it a matter of extreme urgency, but the present Minister does not seem to be imbued with that spirit at all.  Now, what has happened since, that has made it unnecessary to pursue this matter that was visualised as being so urgent at that time by the Minister's predecessor? Has the position of the railway company improved to such an extent, or has it got out of the rut into which it was admitted it had sunk at that particular time?</P>

      <P>I understood, Sir, that this debate was taking place upon the ground that my reply to the following question was unsatisfactory:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr Keyes asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that the Transport Tribunal was established by authority of an order made by Dáil Eireann on December 7th, 1938, he will state by <Col N="975" /> what authority he has declined to submit to Dáil Eireann the reports of the tribunal presented to him in August, 1939.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understood that it was on the ground that my reply to that question was unsatisfactory that this debate is now taking place, but Deputy Keyes is now putting to me another series of questions which has no relation to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of a question on the adjournment is to elucidate and elaborate the basic question put to the Minister and the Minister's reply to that question.  It amounts to elaborated question and reply upon the facts in question. Obviously, if a tribunal has been set up to inquire into transport, the state of the transport problem does not arise.  The question that arises is the refusal&mdash;the alleged refusal&mdash;of the Minister to furnish the report of the tribunal to the House.</P>

      <P>It is with the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's reply that I am dealing, and I am submitting that my dissatisfaction was based upon certain grounds, but mainly the delay in bringing forward the report.  I was rather surprised that one ground of complaint should transcend the other, but the dissatisfaction is obviously because of the delay, and I am not satisfied that the Minister has given valid or abiding reasons for that delay.  I am asking him at this particular juncture&mdash;and if it is very unpleasant for the Minister, I shall leave it unasked&mdash;to tell us now if anything has happened in connection with the railway finances or the affairs of the railway company, since his predecessor saw fit to make this a matter of urgency, or has the industry so progressively extended since then that the present Minister can afford to leave the matter in abeyance.  I want to point out that that has not happened.</P>

      <P>To express dissatisfaction with the Minister's failure to submit the reports to Dáil Eireann is in order, and by what authority the Minister has so far declined to submit the reports.  The present state of transport does not arise, nor do the financial or other conditions of the railways.  That is the question which the tribunal was established to report on.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It is probable, however, that the reports will be published when the consideration referred to in answers to previous Parliamentary questions has been completed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am suggesting, Sir, that there is evidence there of continued procrastination and that this has been the method of side-tracking this question on at least five or six occasions.  If you rule that I am not entitled to speak on it, I must bow to your ruling, Sir, but I felt that this was really a very important matter and I wanted to know from the Minister how many times we must put this on the Order Paper?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the protest of Deputy Keyes concerning the refusal of the Minister to honour an undertaking which was given by implication, if not in very clear language, by his predecessor in office, apart altogether from the undertaking given the House on December 7th, 1938, now nearly two years ago, when the motion was moved for the establishment of the Transport Tribunal.  I know of no precedent in any other case of this kind since this House was established, where a responsible Minister refused to publish or to authorise the publication of reports of a commission.  If the Minister's predecessor did not intend to publish the reports or recommendations of a public tribunal surely he would have made that clear to the House when asking permission to establish the Transport Tribunal.  No doubt the Minister has read the case <Col N="978" /> made by his predecessor for the establishment of the tribunal and if so, I think he will not deny that it was not intended to hold up the publication of such important reports.  The proceedings of a tribunal, in view of the powers given it at the time, and to various commissions set up by this Government and also by the previous Government, have always been published.  It is a different matter altogether in the case of the establishment of Departmental Committees whose reports have, in many cases, for very good reasons not been made public.</P>
      <P>The report of this tribunal has a direct bearing on the livelihood of 25,000 railway transport workers, 15,000 shareholders, as well as the community that has to depend on the principal transport concern in this State, which is on the border of financial collapse.  I was summoned to and present at a very largely attended meeting of railway trade unions a week ago where this matter was the subject of lengthy consideration.  The principal speaker at that meeting said he had been informed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had intimated to the principal transport concern in this State, that it was not at present intended to introduce any legislation arising out of the reports of the Transport Tribunal.  I should like to know from the Minister whether any such assurance was given, and if it was given, why such an assurance was given to the principal transport concern without placing the reports of the tribunal in the possession of Deputies responsible for its establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want to be fair to the Minister in that respect.  It is, however, well known that the Minister has been in communication with the heads of the principal transport concern, and I am certain that he had, or should have, in his possession a copy of the 34-page speech which was made by the chief accountant of the railway company at a recent meeting of the Irish Railways Board.  If he accepts half of what was put before the railways <Col N="979" /> board by the chief accountant of the principal transport concern, he should be very alarmed at his responsibility for the state of affairs that exists in that concern.</P>

      <P>Any Deputy cannot express a definite opinion as to what should be done by the Minister and by a Government which has pledged itself to put the principal concern on a firm financial foundation until we get the reports.  I am fairly well acquainted with the members of the Transport Tribunal.  They were men who knew their job, although, with one exception, they were not what might be regarded as railway or transport experts.</P>
      <P>I met one of the principal members of the tribunal several months ago in this building, and also in another place, and he questioned me as to whether I thought the reports were ever likely to be published.  He offered to make a bet that they would not be published. I wonder if that bet was made with the knowledge that the Minister did not intend to publish the reports of the tribunal which contained the signature of the person who offered to make me a sporting bet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have plenty of time to-night to say anything he wishes about what has been done during the 14 months since the tribunal reported. It is 14 months since the reports were handed to the Department.  I am not quite sure if the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was Minister of that Department when the reports were handed in but, at any rate, he will not shelve responsibility or refuse to honour the obligation placed upon his shoulders by his predecessor.I presume there is continuity of policy in regard to transport if there has been any policy whatsoever decided upon on that question.  When the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke in favour of establishing the tribunal he indicated that there was a necessity for the passage of <Col N="980" /> amending legislation, but stated that the Government would like to be armed with authority from the Transport Tribunal before taking a definite decision as to the nature of the legislation.If the Minister for Industry and Commerce still believes in the right of the Parliament to help the Government to take a decision on matters of policy and if he believes as I do that it should have the right to express its views on the necessity for legislation to put the transport industry into a better position, then it is his duty to authorise the publication and circulation of the reports of the tribunal without any further unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>In the interests of this institution, I hope the Minister will hand over copies of the reports to Deputies without further delay.  I am not suggesting that he is holding up the reports merely to disoblige any Deputy who may be interested, because every Deputy is interested in the contents of the reports.  Some Deputies presume to be able to tell you what is contained in them.  I certainly do not know; I cannot say that I have any reliable information as to the contents.  I know there are two reports.  It has been suggested that the recommendations are of such a drastic nature that they might mean the abolition of the board now responsible for the management of our principal transport concern.</P>

I would state by what authority I have declined to submit to Dáil Eireann the reports of the tribunal presented to him in August, 1939.  The first thing I would like to point out is that I doubt whether that question was really conceived by Deputy Keyes in the form in which he expressed it, as it certainly conveys an impression which is very misleading.  It contains an innuendo which cannot be substantiated by anything that I have said in the House in regard to this report.  The Deputy asked me by what authority I have declined to publish the report.  I have never declined to publish the report.  I said that the report will be published in due course.</P>

I have no authority for declining.  Neither have I any obligation to publish.

      <P>It is quite obvious that the Deputy was confused.  He thought that, because this tribunal was set up by a resolution of the Dáil, it was on all fours with a Committee of the House which is <i>ipso facto</i> bound to report to the Dáil, as also is a commission set up to report to the House. But this commission was set up to report to the Minister.</P>
