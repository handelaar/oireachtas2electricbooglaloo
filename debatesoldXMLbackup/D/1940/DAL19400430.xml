The information at the disposal of the Department of Supplies does not indicate that the statement in the first part of the question represents the position, namely, that there is a shortage of imported timber for house building and consequently it has not been considered necessary to institute any special form of control of native timber.  The whole position is under constant review in the Department of Supplies.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any items of industrial production exported to Great Britain and Northern Ireland before the war which are now entirely prohibited from entry into the United Kingdom.  Since the 1st September, 1939, the United Kingdom Government has prohibited, save under licence, the import into the United Kingdom of a very long list of items.  I do not consider it practicable in reply to a question to relate that list to items of our industrial production, very many of which are very clearly affected by it.  Until recently, <Col N="1952" /> when an order was made affecting manufactures of linen or flax, the operation of the licensing system was such that the prohibitions did not interfere with our exports.  The position in regard to manufactures of linen or flax is not at the moment clear and is being investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this motion was before the House, I was referring to this question of active service and the interpretation placed on the phrase by the board.  I submit that it is a very open matter and, in fact, the Act itself does not clearly define the phrase &ldquo;active service&rdquo; as active service was understood by the men who participated in the fight for freedom.  The Act, and the board administering it, throw the onus on the applicant of proving that his statement in itself proves matters in respect of which counsel and other clever people in this country may be in doubt, that is, as to whether the phrase &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is properly interpreted by either the board or the Minister.  This question of the critical date is referred to, but, around that question, the board built up a network of queries, and they prescribe that unless an applicant actually participated in arms and was engaged in what they call a major operation, he is not qualified for a pension.  I submit that, where a man has shown general service during the period of the Anglo-Irish war and who subsequently gave service during the civil war period, that service should be accepted as general service by that applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, the other night, made the point that, under the 1924 Act, a very broad interpretation was given to &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, and I quite agree that it was a proper interpretation. All we ask is that the board, in deciding cases under the 1934 Act, should take the same line and give a broad interpretation to this term.  We <Col N="1958" /> admit, of course, that it is difficult to meet every case, but there have been very drastic and, to my mind, very unfair decisions in the cases of men who gave good service to the country, and I appeal to the Minister to request the referee and the board to adopt the interpretation which was adopted previously.  There is a great deal of red tape in connection with the procedure that is at present being carried on by the board in dealing with the claims of these men.  The applicants have to meet with many difficulties.  For instance, they are told to ask the brigade officers to submit lists of men and maps of the areas where different engagements took place.  I suggest that it is a very difficult thing to produce such maps and to give the exact location of the areas where various actions took place 23 or 24 years ago.</P>
    <P>I think the board should approach these matters in a different spirit altogether.  Too many difficulties are being placed in the way of applicants. At the same time, I realise the difficulties that the members of the board are faced with.  They are faced with thousands of applications and it is difficult to segregate the really genuine applicants from others who are applying. What I have in mind at the moment are the cases where men had good service&mdash;what we call good, general service.  The position is that the members of the board say that unless there is evidence of major conflicts and unless the particular areas are defined, the men will be disqualified. What is to happen in a case where, through no fault of the brigade officer or any other person, an action did not take place?  What is to happen in the case where there was no opportunity to enable the men in a certain area to qualify?  The board never seem to take these aspects of the situation into consideration.  Making a contrast as between the interpretation put on the Act of 1924 and the present one, I believe that it worked out satisfactorily and to the benefit of the applicants.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I would like to deal and it has relation <Col N="1959" /> to the men who applied for disability pensions.  The men who went to America or Australia or other countries did not have an opportunity of knowing that there was a time limit, and it is possible that many applications were late.  I think the Minister should allow the period to be extended in respect of these men so that their applications for disability pensions may be considered.  We have a few cases in Kerry where men were disabled in action; they are disabled at the present moment as a result of injuries received in the troubled times. They left the country and when they came back a year or two ago they were informed that their applications for pensions could not be considered. In such cases the men should be given an opportunity to apply and state their cases.  I understand that some years ago the period for application was extended. I suggest that the same thing is now possible in connection with special cases, such as those to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Another matter of importance concerns the means test.  Down in my county there are numbers of old I.R.A. men receiving small pensions. In some cases the men are in receipt of unemployment assistance, and I suggest there is very unfair discrimination in so far as the means test is concerned.  Sometimes the amount assessed against a man for the purpose of arriving at a figure for the unemployment assistance to which he would be entitled, is unreasonable.  It is very unfair to treat these men in such a fashion.  The Minister should reconsider this matter.  I think, in gratitude to these men and as a mark of the country's appreciation, they should be exempt from the means test, especially those who are in receipt of small pensions.  There should be some more equitable adjustment so that these cases can be arranged to the satisfaction of the men concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should consult with the members of the board and place these aspects of the situation before them.  I know that there are men who were called before the board <Col N="1960" /> two or three years ago and their cases have not yet been decided.  I cannot understand why men are being called before the board every other day while there are hundreds and thousands of cases remaining undecided.  Why cannot some decision be arrived at in regard to the men who were brought up two or three years ago?  Let the board decide one way or the other in regard to the men who have already been examined.  In my opinion the Minister should at once consult with the members of the board and have a review of the whole position and he should urge the board to expedite matters and arrive at some definition on the question of active service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the protests made in connection with the granting of pensions.  There has been a good deal of delay and one finds it hard to understand the reason for such delay.  In some cases one might say that not alone is there unreasonable delay, but there would appear to be actual procrastination.  Repeatedly Deputies have asked, through the medium of questions, why certain claims have been held up and they usually get what might be described as an irresponsible kind of reply indicating that the matter is under consideration and it will be expedited.  The Deputy who has just sat down talked about numbers of men who were brought before the board and whose claims were heard as far back as four years ago.  I cannot see any reason why the claims of these men should not be decided by now.  There should be some kind of definite reply sent to those people.  I have in mind a town in my constituency, the town of Enniscorthy. I think it will be admitted that, outside of Dublin, Enniscorthy was the only place where there was an actual rising in Easter Week.  To the shame of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;be it said that there are numbers of people in that town whose claims have not yet been considered. I have before me a letter from a lady who was a member of the <Col N="1961" /> Cumann na mBan at that time and who took part in the rising.  She got married some time afterwards.  Her husband is dead and she is left with five children.  She was brought before the board two years ago, but she has not heard anything about her claim since.  This lady is in a very bad way. That is not the way to treat people who took their lives in their hands in Easter Week when they went out to fight for their country.  Anybody who was familiar with Enniscorthy knows the position that obtained there in Easter Week, 1916.  A comparatively small number of people took control of the town.  They were surrounded by military and inside three or four days they were in a very precarious and dangerous position.  But they never yielded until two of their members were brought by a British officer to interview the late Patrick Pearse in Dublin.  The treatment these people are getting now is an absolute disgrace.  I suggest that something should be done at once to expedite their claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn has referred to what he considered a gross scandal in some cases so far as the men who are drawing pensions are concerned.  In a great number of cases it would be better for these men if they were getting no pension at all.  That is because of the fact that the small amount they are getting is taken into consideration when from time to time employment is being offered on relief work.  The men who took their lives in their hands and went out in the service of the country during Easter Week period and during the period of the Black and Tans and who, because of these services got a pension, should not be discriminated against in the matter of relief work.  These pensions should be ignored altogether and not taken into consideration when work is being offered.  In Enniscorthy we have a number of men who served their country in Easter Week, but because some of them got very small pensions they are not because of that given employment when relief work offers.  I have been asked to bring this matter before the Government in the <Col N="1962" /> hope they will give it their consideration. The means test should not be applicable in the case of these Army pensions.  Taking these pensions into consideration is not treating these men as they deserve to be treated.  I ask the Minister now to urge the board to have these Enniscorthy cases expedited.  These claimants deserve well of the country.  We are proud of the stand Enniscorthy took during Easter Week and also in the Black and Tan period, but it is very poor consideration these men are getting now in being treated as they are being treated.  One might go so far as to say that their claims are being ignored.  A number of them were brought up here about two or three years ago.  They were brought up prior to the elections in 1937 and 1938.  That was simply because they were wanted for work at the elections.  They have heard not a word about their claims since.  The men were merely made use of to fight these elections.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Walsh makes a contribution to this question, I think he should make one particular matter clear.  He does not seem to grasp the matter rightly.  He suggested that the neglect of the 1916 men's claims for pensions applied equally to the past as well as to the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh, when Deputy Corish was speaking, seemed to suggest that the neglect applied equally to the past and the present Government.  The Pensions Act passed by the last Government dealt with men in the National Army who had pre-truce service.  So far as the 1916 men were concerned it only dealt with the widows and dependents and men who were disabled.  When the 1932-1933 Bill was introduced it was very definitely opposed from these benches.  But when it was clear that the Bill was going to pass then the question of the men who served in <Col N="1963" /> 1916 was raised.  The question was raised that there were men who served in 1916 whose situation for many reasons was difficult.  It was urged that if men who were not in the National Army were to be pensioned for services in 1932 and 1933, the men who had service in 1916 should get some consideration.  That argument was pressed from these benches.  It was urged on the Government that the 1916 men should be included.  That contention was definitely opposed by the Minister for Defence who was handling the Bill.  But second thoughts prevailed in the Seanad and finally the 1916 men were included in the Bill.  So that in respect of that service for the granting of pensions and the delays in making the awards, the previous Government is in no way responsible and they have no responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been rather annoyed for some time past by the number of claimants coming to me asking me to hurry up a decision in the matter of their pension claims.  Having heard a statement from the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures that only men engaged in major operations will be considered in the matter of the pensions, I am at a loss to understand why so many men had been called to Dublin since that statement was made and since that decision was arrived at.  A number of those men who have come to Dublin have found it very difficult to procure their railway fare.  I know they got vouchers which entitled them to some reduction in their fares, but many of them were on the dole and they had to borrow money to make up their fares to Dublin.  That is as far back as 18 months ago, but since then they have not heard one word about their pensions claims.  I am inclined to think that there is a good deal of favouritism about these pensions.  I say that in <Col N="1964" /> all sincerity, because in connection with the recent elections I have in mind a member of the Volunteers of previous days who was engaged in an interesting operation in the South Mall in Cork.  He happened to be interested in the late elections in Cork and was canvassing for Labour.  I am aware that he was called in to a certain organisation and asked if he persisted in that canvassing did he expect to be given his pension.  I mention that now as a case in point in which an applicant for a pension was interfered with in that manner.  I know a girl who, in 1918-1919, was taken out of a certain occupation and who undertook some work of national importance. She went into a certain job at the time to do the things that were required.  But since then she has been knocked about from place to place.  She is now penniless.  Her case was mentioned by influential people, but so far no decision has been given in her case. As against that, I know of other cases where people who were no way active at all in the struggle for freedom or in the Civil War have had their pensions granted to them.  I ask the Minister to give us some definite statement here, to-day, as to the reasons for these delays.  If people are only to be given pensions within certain rules and regulations, surely it is unfair to call them up to Dublin if the rules and regulations do not entitle them to a pension.  Some 12 months ago a number of fellows met me outside the gate here.  They had come from a remote part of the County Cork and from Cork City.  They had been called up about their pensions.  I met them since and they told me that So-and-so got a pension, a man who was never known to have done any national service.  I have been asked by these people to ventilate this matter here, and to do something about their claims.  But I have not made any effort about it, because a certain procedure and certain machinery have to be gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with the system we have in operation for the granting of pensions.  Deputy John Flynn spoke about the means test.  I am sure the Deputy will realise that <Col N="1965" /> there is not much use in making an appeal to the Minister about the means test, in view of the fact that this House passed an Act under which a rigid means test is applied not only to those men who fought for their country but to others who may be in receipt of small pensions.  Take the case of a man who has been in some employment for 40 or 50 years and is now in receipt of a small pension of 5/- or 6/- a week from his trade union. That small pension is taken into consideration when he applies for unemployment assistance.  I agree with Deputy Flynn that it is unworthy of this or any other Government to apply a means test of that kind to men who may be in receipt of a small pension of 10/- or 15/- a week from a native or a foreign Government, from some organisation or from a past employer.  I am very strongly opposed to this means test because I think it is contrary to decency and justice.  In conclusion, I put it to the Minister that the utmost dissatisfaction prevails throughout the country at the manner in which pension claims are being dealt with.  It is time now that we should reach some finality on this, and have a clear statement from the Government as to what the future position of applicants for pensions is going to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Opposition should have chosen to debate this Estimate in a Party spirit, because I think each and every member of the House has experienced the same difficulty so far as pension claims are concerned.  I believe that we are all at one in our criticism of the operation of the Pensions Acts, and in wanting the hearing of claims expedited.  We are all at one, also, in thinking that too rigid an interpretation is being placed on the term &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  As a matter of fact, that term is not defined in the Act. We are all aware that a number of organisations have, for many years, been seeking to get that term defined. We are all at one as well on the question of the means test.  I cannot for the life of me understand how people who were called before the <Col N="1966" /> board two years ago have not yet received an assessment of their claims. If the present system is found to be too unwieldy, then I think that another should be devised whereby the hearing of claims would be expedited and pensions computed.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the setting up of regional committees so that certain members of the present pensions board could, so to speak, go on circuit and take evidence in different parts of the country from brigade staffs and other people likely to be able to give evidence in regard to claims.  That would obviate the necessity of bringing unfortunate men up to Dublin and of putting them to a good deal of expense in the matter of railway and hotel charges.  Deputy O'Higgins, when speaking, made what I thought was a very sound suggestion, and I put it to the Minister that he ought to give it consideration. Possibly, the suggestion could not be given effect to within the terms of the present Act, but perhaps the Minister would consider introducing amending legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will ask the Minister to keep the suggestion in mind.  It was to the effect that, in the case of men in receipt of very small pensions, the Minister might consider capitalising the pension over, say, a period of ten or 15 years and of giving the pensioner a lump sum. If that were done it would prove extremely helpful to numbers of old I.R.A. men who have received allotments of land.  At present they are not in a position to work the land, because they have no capital.  If a scheme of the kind suggested were framed and put into operation it should prove an ideal one, because it would be the means of putting numbers of old I.R.A. men in a position in which they would be able to work their allotments of land.  I also put it to the Minister that steps should be taken immediately to define the term &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  The present position <Col N="1967" /> is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst old I.R.A. men.  You have cases like this turning up that men who went out on ambushes and actually engaged the enemy have received pensions, whereas the men who were covering the retreat or were detailed on outpost duty in the same engagement have not yet received pensions.  I do not think that is altogether fair.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that &ldquo;he also serves who only stands and waits&rdquo;.  You have many old I.R.A. men in Dublin who were engaged on patrol duty, sometimes for a week, a fortnight or a month and who, while on that duty, were in constant danger of death, and yet because they did not actually engage the enemy have not been granted pensions.  I think service of that kind would offer a proper basis for the assessment of a pension. Those were men who were ready to serve.  Many of them were arrested and put in gaol, some of them for a year or more.  They sacrificed their means of livelihood and sometimes a university career because of the fact that they were members of, and were serving in, the Irish Republican Army. Yet service of that kind is not taken into consideration when assessing claims.  In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will do something about expediting the hearing of claims, of getting a definition of the term &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, and, finally, abolishing, if possible, the means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to re-echo the statements made by other members with regard to the delay that has taken place in the assessment of pensions, particularly in the case of those who have been called up for interview. That delay is inflicting very severe hardship on a number of persons who are in very poor circumstances.  I can recall the case of one man in Cork who has been waiting for six years for an assessment of his pension claim.  He is the only support of his mother and is unemployed at the moment.  Quite a number of men in my area are continually complaining of the apparent <Col N="1968" /> lack of interest shown in regard to their applications.  All those men assert that their claims are deserving of consideration.  I heartily support the suggestion made by the last speaker that regional committees should be set up with a view to expediting the hearing of the claims sent in.  Regional committees were set up in relation to another matter, and I can tell Deputies that the decision to do that was a source of the greatest convenience to applicants for pensions. Its adoption in this case is, I suggest, deserving of the best consideration by the Minister.  It would save numbers of men a great amount of expense.  I support the appeal made from all sides of the House that greater expedition should be shown in the hearing of pension claims so that men entitled to pensions would get them at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I did not intend taking part in this debate but for the fact that Deputy Mulcahy took umbrage at my truthful interjection to the effect that if there has been any delay in this matter it is as much the fault of the late Government as it is of the present Government.  Deputy Mulcahy was a member of the previous Government and some of us have very good reason to know that, when he was Minister for Defence, he was not then much concerned as to the fate of that remnant of 1916 men who were left to eke out an existence as best they could.</P>

      <P>I am aware of it as much as the Deputy himself.  I personally have always been opposed to this question of pensions.  I am one who never lodged a claim for a pension, to which I have as good a right as many people who are enjoying pensions to-day; many who were granted them during Deputy Mulcahy's period as Minister for Defence.  I contend that it is the very definite duty of this nation to compensate every individual who participated in the efforts <Col N="1969" /> that eventually succeeded in securing for this country the degree of freedom which we have.  But I do hold that it is not the right, nor is it the duty of the nation, to pension able-bodied men who gave voluntary service to the nation.  These are my views so far as pensions are concerned.  I do hold, however, that it is the very definite duty of this nation to compensate fully every single individual in this country who sacrificed his health in any way in that struggle and the dependents of those who sacrificed their lives.</P>
      <P>That brings me to another point. In the discussion of pensions and compensation, Deputy Mulcahy referred to widows and orphans.  I have a bitter experience of trying to do something for those people, and I am aware that in some cases the previous Government used the White Cross Fund for that purpose, rather than drawing it from the national purse whence it should have come.</P>

      <P>I am sure that they had very much to do with it.  I know from what direction the influence came in <Col N="1970" /> its administration&mdash;I have very good reason to know.  I am one of those who claim that it is the duty of the nation to compensate every single one of these people or their dependents, because during that period from 1916 onwards we had very large numbers in this country who took no interest and gave no assistance in the struggle, but religiously minded their own business and waxed fat on the wealth of the country while, as Deputy McCann said, young men gave up their university careers or professions or trades in order to give service to the nation. They gave that service voluntarily. Many of them never looked forward to drawing a pension for the service which they gave.  That is the reason why I claim that it is only right that these people should get something to compensate them for the period during which they gave service to the nation. I contend that the giving of pensions is altogether wrong and that it never should have been entertained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Walsh, I am not greatly enamoured of this pension scheme, because I prefer to see the people who lost relatives in the war of independence being compensated better than they have been and are being compensated.  The question of the means test has been referred to by some Deputies.  But there is another aspect of the situation having a bearing on the means test that I do not think anybody has yet referred to, and that is that, in the case of people who made claims in respect of relatives who lost their lives in the national struggle, it appears to me that the Department have established a method of assessment of their own.  In cases in which I am interested in my constituency I find that the sum of £40 a year is mentioned.  In other words, it is impossible for anyone who has made a claim under these Acts to get a gratuity if the income of that person exceeds £40 a year.  I look upon that as a great hardship on those people because £40 a year is not a very big sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have even come across cases where people in receipt of the old age pension <Col N="1971" /> have been subjected to this hardship of which I am complaining.  If the Dáil had never passed this legislation to give compensation to people who made sacrifices during the national struggle, these people to whom I am referring would have been entitled to the old age pension anyway.  I submit, therefore, that the old age pension or any such annuity should never be taken into consideration in regard to this assessment that seems to militate against the claims of a good many people down the country.  I ask the Minister to go into that particular aspect of the matter.  I believe that there should be no means limit and that anybody who lost a relative in the war of independence should be entitled to compensation, because everybody in the House knows that nothing can compensate a family for the loss of a relative.  Not alone would I advocate the increasing of this £40 a year, but I would advocate its abolition altogether.  There are not many such claims outstanding at present; as a matter of fact my information is that there are only a couple of hundred.  I suppose legislation cannot be mentioned in connection with this Estimate but, if legislation is necessary, I think that this House will do well to consider it.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the magnitude of the job of trying to get finished with these military service pensions and to get all the cases heard and awards made.  I am sure that the Minister is as anxious as anybody else to get finished with the job.  As to the definition of active service, I am just as well pleased that there is not a cut-and-dry definition.  But I put it to the Minister, as there is not a cut-and-dry definition of active service, that in defining active service the board should take into consideration the amount of service rendered by an applicant, including the personal risk that the applicant underwent during his service. I am aware that under the Act men who participated in fights with the enemy are recognised as having had active service.  But I am concerned with the men behind the lines and the <Col N="1972" /> men on outpost duty who often made such engagements possible. I am alluding to men who kept up communications, and who were often in areas in which there was intense military activity, and incurred as much personal risk as men who were actively participating in the fight.  I join my voice with other Deputies in pleading that these men should be considered, so that some recognition befitting their service should be given to those who helped in the fight, but whose service does not, at present, come under the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The question of the board going on circuit was mentioned. That question was carefully examined and was found impracticable.  Deputy Flynn referred to the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  That of course is a matter entirely for the referee.  The Deputy also raised a question about maps.  I would like to refer to that, seeing that Deputy MacEoin raised the same question on a former occasion. It was stated that the maps required by the boards would cost not less than £15.  I have gone into the matter, and I find that actually what the referee asked for was merely sketch maps, which would not involve anything more than a mere tracing of the position on ordnance survey maps.  The assessing of means or anything like that is not in my control.  That is a matter for another Department.  I think Deputy Hickey explained that.  In reply to Deputy Kissane the question that he feels so keenly about is covered by a clause in the Act, and unless the Act were amended it would be impossible to deal with pensions in any other way than they are being dealt with at present.  I am sure Deputies are well aware that three boards were operating in connection with the Pensions Acts, two being exclusively engaged with the Disability Acts of 1932 and 1937 and one exclusively with the Service Act of 1934.  It is, therefore, no more correct to assign the total cost of the three boards to the Service Act than it would be to assign the cost of the board which operated in connection with the 1923 and 1927 Acts to the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain figures were given by Deputies during the debate regarding the cost of administering the 1934 Act. It might be well to set out the actual figures.  The cost of administration of the Act up to March 31st, 1940, as far as the Pensions Vote is concerned, was £47,632.  That does not include salaries of those persons whose remuneration was borne on other Votes.  If we include the latter the total cost was £71,282. That sum in itself, of course, is not small, but its size must be viewed in relation to the problem with which it is dealing.  The assessors under the <Col N="1974" /> 1924 Act had ready at hand the records of the Army post-Truce and, to a large extent, pre-Truce, and where these records were not sufficient the assessors were able to fall back on men whose memories of events and persons were fresh.  Now the referee and the advisory committee have no such records to rely upon, but have to build up right from the foundation, and where gaps occur they had not young men with vivid memories of events to rely upon.  They had in fact to check, cross-check, and counter-check all the statements, and naturally that involves time and labour as well as expense.  There were 21,121 applications under the 1924 Act and of these only 13,537 were referred to the board.  The remaining 7,548 were dealt with by the Department.  They were clearly applications to which the Act did not apply, and as Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, &ldquo;were cases that any pay clerk would push one side&rdquo;.  The total number of applications under the 1934 Act was 59,308, and many of them&mdash;but nothing like 50 per cent. as was suggested&mdash;could be ruled out on the ground that they were 1924 Act cases with which the officials could not deal.  All these cases had, in fact, to be referred to the referee.  They could not be dealt with in the way Deputy O'Higgins suggested. According to Section 3 (3) of the 1934 Act it was necessary that they should be dealt with by the referee.</P>
    <P>The board of assessors took four years to deal with 13,537 cases referred to them, and during that period they issued 3,850 favourable reports, costing about £188,585 a year. The referee and the advisory committee have been at work just five and a half years, and have issued to date 7,082 favourable reports, costing about £208,588 a year.  In view, therefore, of the grave difficulties which beset the board from the beginning, it is suggested that their output has been creditable, and that the cost of administration has not been unduly high, but, in saying that, I must not be taken as adopting an attitude of complacency, or not appreciating the point urged by Deputies that applicants <Col N="1975" /> should know as soon as possible how their cases are going.</P>
    <P>The expediting of the work has been one of my chief preoccupations both on the former occasion when I was in the Department of Defence and since I went there as Minister.  Since last May, the work of the board has, Deputies are aware, been slowed up by the demand for certain detailed information in respect to activities in brigade areas.  In December, I had the work of the board reviewed and, in January, I urged the referee to concentrate on cases which, on their face, were not likely to succeed and to inform the applicants accordingly.  The referee and the committee have responded to these representations and, from the 31st March, 1939, to the 31st January, 1940, the referee had confirmed 10,232 non-qualifying reports, but between the latter date and the 31st March, 1940&mdash;that is a period of about two months&mdash;a further 9,136 reports have been so confirmed.  I have every hope, therefore, that the work will be so speeded up that, before this time next year, the majority of the applicants will have some idea as to how their cases are proceeding.</P>
    <P>Deputies Norton and Davin asked why a decision had not been come to on cases heard some considerable time back, and they also inquired if anything could be done to expedite decisions in the case of applicants in distress.  I have every sympathy with both sets of applicants, and I appreciate the position of Deputies to whom such complaints are made because I, myself, have had to deal with very similar problems and I have not secured any better results than the Deputies who have been complaining. From personal inquiries which I have made on this subject, I find that decisions have not been given because the evidence or verification of the evidence has not been completed and, if a decision were given without the necessary verification, the applicant's claim would be prejudiced.  I want, however, to assure Deputies that I am fully aware of the problem and, without making any definite promise as to <Col N="1976" /> results, I shall certainly do my best to see if something cannot be done to expedite decisions in such cases.  In passing, I may say, in reply to Deputy Davin, that the number of deferred cases is 3,500 and that similar remarks apply to those cases as to the other two categories to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked by Deputies Cosgrave and Norton as to what work was done in connection with the 1934 Act during the year.  During the year, 5,047 cases were heard, bringing the total so heard on the 31st March, 1940, to 19,534.  Two hundred and forty-three provisional, favourable reports were issued, and 61 appeals on such reports were dealt with.  Three hundred and ninety-one favourable reports were made, and 20 appeals made to the Minister and dealt with.  Nineteen thousand three hundred and sixty-eight provisional, unfavourable reports were confirmed by the referee and 17,729 notices were issued to applicants, while brigade committees were also so informed.  Eight thousand seven hundred and twenty-five final unfavourable reports were also made.  The number of appeals under 21 days' notice up to 31st March was 5,576.  The figure of 9,000, mentioned during the debate, arose out of a statement which I made that about one-third of the total unfavourable reports would be appealed.  As Deputies will notice, to date only 5,576 such appeals have come to hand.</P>
    <P>It was alleged during the debate that political discrimination had taken place in the hearing of applications and the making of reports.  This is an allegation which is very easy to make but exceedingly difficult to substantiate. Both referees have been judges of the Circuit Court and it is incredible that they would have been influenced by political considerations.  It is quite conceivable, of course, that, as Deputy O'Higgins said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;there are cases where applications were filled in the same house on the same evening, forwarded on the same date, similar engagements right along the line, similar length of service <Col N="1977" /> and similar hardships, where one man had got a pension and another had not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement may be quite true but the point is whether, on investigation, the person who did not get an award had his service verified in the same way as the person who did secure an award.  In all such allegations, one must make due allowance for suspicion and for a certain degree of jealousy. As regards the allegation that Party agents at election times used promises of pensions as an incentive to vote in a certain direction, I think Deputies will be quite prepared to admit that neither a Minister nor a Government can control that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;he was supported this evening by Deputy McCann&mdash; raised the question of taking discretionary power to commute small pensions by means of lump sum payments. He argued that there was a precedent for such action in the payment of a gratuity under the Disability Acts where the degree of disability in respect of wounds does not reach the minimum of 20 per cent. prescribed by the Acts for the award of pensions. Here it is necessary to distinguish between gratuities and commutation of pensions.  Under the Service Acts, there is no power to grant gratuities or to commute pensions and under the Disability Acts there is power to award gratuities, under conditions stated, but there is no power to commute pensions. The two things are, in fact, quite distinct. Commutation implies that a pension was paid or is payable while gratuity connotes that a pension will not be paid.  The whole question of commuting pensions has been considered by both the present and the previous Governments and it has also been discussed in this House.  After due consideration, neither Government has deemed it fit to take power to commute pensions.  The previous Government introduced five Bills dealing with military service pensions but under none of them did they take power to commute, although many pensions of small amounts were payable under the Acts of 1923, 1924 and 1927.  In point of fact, <Col N="1978" /> there were, under these Acts, 2,914 awards of under £1 a week&mdash;231 awards of under 5/-, 1,412 awards of between 5/- and 10/-, 647 awards of between 10/- and 15/- and 624 awards of between 15/- and 20/-.  Since 1932 we have introduced six Bills dealing with military pensions and probably for the same reasons which actuated our predecessors, we have not taken the power of commutation either.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin asked if an applicant had a right to obtain an interview with the board.  Every applicant for a service certificate has a perfect right if he so desires to appear before the board and make his case.  It can be readily understood, however, that where there are several of these applicants, living at very distant points from the city, whose forms show no possibility of securing a service certificate, these people should be informed that their service showed no claim.  It would be a hardship, a very great hardship, to bring some of these people from very distant parts of Ireland to the City of Dublin, merely to make an effort to induce the board to give them something to which they were not entitled. As I said a few moments ago, the question of the interpretation of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is one solely for the referee and the Minister has no powers whatever in respect of the interpretation placed on &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  Deputy Norton asked how much of the £109,514 mentioned in the Estimate for probable additional charges, has reference to arrears.  A sum of £91,588 is in respect of arrears.</P>
    <P>I think that on this occasion, as far as it was possible, I have gone into all questions raised by Deputies.  I can assure the House, that as far as I am concerned, I am taking a very special interest in the question of expediting the investigation of the claims of these applicants.  I certainly hope that, in the course of the coming year, there will be very large inroads made on the forms and that when we meet this time next year, while I do not expect that we shall have concluded the investigations of all pension claims, I hope we shall have arrived at the <Col N="1979" /> stage where very large numbers of people will, as some Deputies stated in the debate, have been put out of pain.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that in order to allay public disquiet and anxiety a select committee consisting of seven Deputies to be appointed by the Committee of Selection and with power to send for persons, papers and documents should be established publicly to investigate and report to the Dáil on the following matters:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The causes of the failure to defend the Magazine Fort against the raid made thereon by armed persons on the 23rd December, 1939, and</P>
      <P>(2)  The extent, if any, to which these causes are attributable to defects in the general administration of the Defence Forces or any of its branches or in the general organisation, efficiency or discipline thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been so long on the Order Paper that, I think, most of us have forgotten its terms, and some of us may have even forgotten what it refers to.  The motion refers to a raid which took place on the 23rd December last year, six long months ago, and during those six months by every trick and Parliamentary device, the Government has dodged and evaded a discussion of that particular event.  It has refused to take Parliament into its confidence and apparently has refused to allow Parliament or a Committee of Parliament, to investigate the conditions in the Army which led up to that particular catastrophe.  Moreover, having left Parliament under the impression that an Army inquiry was to be held for the information of <Col N="1980" /> Parliament, we had a secret inquiry and the evidence, the findings and results of that inquiry were withheld from Parliament.  In other words, we have every attempt by political chiefs to wrest the Army from the control of Parliament and to revive, in an official way, what can well be described as the greatest curse within the country, namely a secret Army, secretly controlled, secretly administered, with arms in its hands and not answerable to any elected body.  It is generally accepted in every democracy that the army, unlike other Government Departments, is more intimately the concern of Parliament than it is the concern of the Government.  In ordinary democratic States, it is usual and normal when a major blunder or a major disaster occurs in any of its Departments other than the army for the Department concerned itself to investigate, always on the understanding that the results of the investigation are reported to Parliament.  But in the case of the Army, unlike any other Department of State, precedent, custom and commonsense direct that when a major blunder occurs or a major disaster takes place&mdash;the Army being the Army of the people and the instrument of the Parliament&mdash;a full, searching and public inquiry be carried out, not by people within the Department, not by people wearing the uniform of that Army, but by all Parties of the Parliament of the country.  There is more necessity to adhere to the decent code in this country, in view of its history and in view of present dangers in the country, than there would be in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons why such a procedure was asked for is stated in the first line of the motion&mdash;&ldquo;to allay public anxiety and disquiet&rdquo;&mdash;to restore confidence in the Army, the shattered confidence of the people. Nothing could be better calculated to undermine public confidence than the despicable secrecy and shirking of Parliamentary investigation which has characterised the two Ministers during the last six months.  This was something which no Minister attempted to minimise, which in varying tones <Col N="1981" /> each and every Minister agreed was a disgraceful catastrophe, a major disaster, a shocking occurrence, which took place six months ago.  The shock it gave to the Minister was nothing to the reeling, staggering shock which it gave to the ordinary member of the public.  Every citizen asked what was the cause, what it was about, why it took place, what was going to occur next; and everybody wanted assurances that, whatever rottenness there may be within the machine to make such an event possible, there would be a full, searching and impartial investigation&mdash;not by those who might be associated closely with it, not by those who rightfully might be blamed for the occurrence, but by a committee appointed by the whole of Parliament, working through the ordinary machinery of Parliament, and reporting back to Parliament.</P>
    <P>The mere suggestion, the mere hint, that such procedure might be followed had, at least, the effect of temporarily restoring confidence.  The belief and the impression created in the public mind and in the minds of Deputies, that the Army inquiry was merely a preliminary and that at all events the evidence and the findings would be submitted to Parliament and to the people, temporarily restored confidence.  Then we learned, after waiting and expecting, that the result was to be suppressed, that the evidence was to be suppressed, that the findings were to be suppressed, and that the causes, if any were ascertained, were to be kept a closely-guarded secret.  Whatever sore, whatever wound, had been created in the confidence of the public on the 24th December was reopened in an aggravated form.</P>
    <P>Then, to make matters worse, to further undermine confidence, we had the long procession of victimised individuals&mdash;all victims sacrificed on the altar of Ministerial security.  Remember, there is nobody inside or outside this House, and no decent-minded man or woman, who does not regard those unfortunate officers as scapegoats&mdash; scapegoats to save the positions of one or two Ministers.  There is nobody on this side of the House or any other <Col N="1982" /> side of the House who has not agreed that, if any officer, non-commissioned officer or soldier was responsible and if the responsibility were pinned on him for what happened on the 23rd December, to ask him for his resignation, to place him on half pay, or even to dismiss him without any other penalty, would be leniency to the extent of folly.  The idea that, without fixing responsibility, without having any evidence, without bringing any charge, without going through any trial, unfortunate officers&mdash;conscientious, upright, hard working officers with wives and families depending on them&mdash;would be made walk the plank, their careers blasted, their source of income removed, not because of any fault, not because of any connection with the disaster that the Minister or anybody else dare give a name to, but merely because action had to be taken against somebody, and if it were not taken lower down it might be taken higher up, is not a course of events calculated to give anybody confidence in the Army or in the administration of the Army.</P>
    <P>There is a major disaster, a secret inquiry, a suppression of the evidence before that inquiry, a victimisation and a penalisation of individuals without any charge or without anybody having the courage to make a charge.  Then we rely merely on the power of censorship to make people presume&mdash;like the Deputy who spoke last week from the Government Benches&mdash;that suitable action had been taken against those responsible for the disaster.  The Deputy who spoke was a lawyer.  I have rarely met a lawyer who had not a high sense of justice, a kind of inherent sense of justice.  I feel that that Deputy had that sense just as much as any other lawyer, and that he made use of that particular statement in the belief that the responsibility had been pinned on these men.  Certainly, he would have cut out his tongue rather than make use of such phrases, if he thoroughly understood that no charge ever had been made, that no opportunity ever had been given to them to put up any defence, and that they had been &ldquo;turfed&rdquo; out <Col N="1983" /> of their appointments merely because somebody had to go in order to save somebody else.</P>
    <P>What is the normal procedure all over the world when an event of that magnitude occurs?  There is no Minister of Parliament who would ask in a case like that for somebody underneath him to send in his resignation. Events of this kind occur, periodically, in different countries.  If the blame can be clearly assessed, then the individual who is blameworthy suffers the penalty.  If the blame cannot be clearly assessed, then the man who is in charge of the administration of the particular branch concerned says: &ldquo;Then I must take the blame.&rdquo;  He says, in effect: &ldquo;Since there is no one underneath me on whom I can fix the blame anywhere, therefore I must take the blame myself.&rdquo;  In that way, it is the man on top who resigns and, as far as possible, the men concerned with him tender their resignations also.</P>
    <P>Here we have a departure.  Here we have the case of men&mdash;whose political injection into the Army may well have been the cause of the whole disaster&mdash;not finding people beneath them guilty, but removing people beneath them, who may or may not have been guilty, in order to create the impression that they were guilty. Let us assume, for a moment, that there is a secret inquiry&mdash;a secret military inquiry&mdash;and that it finds certain officers guilty, or that even the evidence pointed in the direction of certain officers being guilty.  Will the Minister deny, if even evidence was pointing in that direction, that a certain military law and military regulation laid it down that that individual should be sent for immediately, told of the charge against him, given an opportunity to be present throughout the inquiry, and given an opportunity to be represented at that inquiry, if he so desired?  Is it not the case here that no information was given to the individual concerned that the evidence was pointing in his direction, that no opportunity was given to him to be there, and that, <Col N="1984" /> even the officers who were to be removed from the Army, temporarily or otherwise, were not informed as to whether or not there was sufficient evidence to be formulated against any one of them?  If there was, I suggest that the Minister is following up one blunder by another.  If there was evidence against anybody, no matter how exalted that person might be, the Minister would be failing in his trust if the charge against these officers was not followed up and fully investigated.  The officers concerned should be proved guilty of the alleged offence or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Here, however, we have a number of officers, with their livelihoods gone, their good names tarnished, and with no evidence against them, and along with that we have a whole queue of humble, private soldiers, put through a definite charge, I admit, but in every case, except one, found not guilty.  We have put down a motion here for Deputies from all Parties to join together and, in accordance with the procedure laid down by this House by statute, to set up a committee of inquiry of this House to report back to Parliament.  That has been delayed for six months.  Even the discussion of it has been delayed for that time. Is not anybody entitled to ask, in such circumstances, what is the skeleton in the cupboard, or what cupboard is the skeleton in, or what is the Government either ashamed or afraid to disclose? If everything is all right, and if nothing is to be hidden from Parliament, why then should there be any objection to the setting up of the inquiry that is suggested here?  If you think that there is no necessity for such an inquiry, and if you have already found out where the fault is, then why keep it secret, and why should we be left in the position of having to take action against men&mdash;innocent men and men against whom you are afraid or ashamed to bring any charge?  Is it not right that these men should be given an opportunity of defending themselves?</P>
    <P>I suppose there are occurrences in every State that bring discredit on the State and that bring Departments of <Col N="1985" /> State under the contempt of decent people and people with a sense of fair play and with a desire for decency. In that connection, I suggest that the behaviour of the two Ministers concerned here, for the last six months, has been despicable.  Their treatment of the unfortunates under them has been contemptible.  The position that we are in at the moment, with regard to decent, conscientious, hard-working officers&mdash;family men&mdash;who have given several years' loyal and faithful service to this Parliament under two Governments, is that they are being &ldquo;turfed&rdquo; out of the Army, disgraced and discredited, although no charge has been made against them, but with the impression left in everybody's mind that they must have been, in some way, culpable for what has happened.  I say that that is a violation of ordinary decent procedure, and also a violation of what is due to a decent uniform. I suggest, however, that the harm was done outside the Army.  The events, since January last, did incalculable harm.  You have the case of men, with a devotion to duty and faith and loyalty to their duty, who would expect to be tried according to military law and regulation, if any charge were to be brought against them, being deprived of their livelihoods without any charge being brought or any opportunity being given to them to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>In this motion, we are asking the Oireachtas to appoint a committee to inquire into this whole business with a view to removing the cause of the trouble.  It was in order to do that that the motion was originally tabled.  It is moved now for that purpose but also for the purpose of seeing that justice is done to decent, honourable, able, loyal and efficient officers who have been since discredited and victimised without cause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, A Chinn Comhairle, I should like to intervene here.  I promised to make a statement <Col N="1986" /> about the raid and would like to do so at this stage.</P>
      <P>The items of Government property which were taken by the raiders were as follows:&mdash;.303 machine gun ammunition, 472,111 rounds; Thompson gun ammunition, 612,300 rounds; .45 revolver ammunition, 12 rounds; total small arms ammunition, 1,084,423 rounds; four Lee Enfield rifles, three rifle slings, three bayonets, three oil bottles, four scabbards, three pull-throughs, seven rifle magazines, one revolver, Webley pattern; and one gas mask.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of the raid were investigated by a military Court of Inquiry but before summarising the evidence taken by the court, I think it well to give some preliminary facts.</P>
      <P>The Magazine Fort is a military post within the Eastern Command area.  On the 23rd December, 1939, it was in the charge of an officer of the Ordnance Service who had held the appointment of officer in charge of the Fort since 1924.  The officer resided in married quarters within the Fort.  His duties as officer in charge, apart from the defence of the Fort, to which I shall presently refer, consisted in the receipt, storage, inspection and issue of ammunition and explosives.  To assist him in these duties he had a staff of two non-commissioned officers and four privates.</P>
      <P>As in the case of all other posts within the Eastern Command area the general responsibility for the defence of the Magazine Fort devolves upon the officer commanding the Eastern Command. In February, 1939, that officer made the officer in charge of the Fort immediately responsible to him for the defence of the Fort.  Actually, the immediate responsibility had, except for a short period in 1929 and 1930, been vested in the officer in charge of the Fort since 1924, but until February, 1939, his responsibility was directly to the officer commanding, Islandbridge Barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entrance to the Fort consists of an outer iron barred gate and an inner wooden gate with a wicket and grille. In the day-time the inner gate is kept <Col N="1987" /> open and the outer gate locked.  After nightfall, both gates are locked.  In the courtyard immediately inside and directly facing the inner gate is a sentry post known as No. 1 post.  To the right of the entrance and adjoining the inner gate is a room occupied by the military policeman on duty.  The bell push on the outer gate is connected to a bell in this room.  To the right of the policeman's room, from which it is separated by a dividing wall, is the guardroom.  Approximately 30 yards distant is a block of buildings which includes the room occupied by the fire picquet.</P>
    <P>The circumstances connected with the raid as elicited by the Court of Inquiry from the sworn evidence of the various witnesses were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The personnel at the disposal of the officer in charge of the Fort on the night of the 23rd December, 1939, for the defence of the Fort was: A guard consisting of one non-commissioned officer and six men armed with rifles and one Lewis gun; a fire picquet consisting of one non-commissioned officer and four men armed with rifles; a military policeman armed with a revolver.</P>
    <P>The Fort is not garrisoned and the guard is provided by one of the infantry units of the command area. The guard on the 23rd December, 1939, was supplied by the 7th (Dublin) Infantry Battalion, a reserve battalion which some time previously had replaced the regular battalion stationed at Portobello Barracks and had taken over its duties.  The guard was made up of a Volunteer corporal, two Class. A reserve privates, and four Volunteer privates.  In accordance with the usual practice, personnel of the battalion intended for guard duties on the 23rd December were warned for duty on the night of the 22nd, but were not assigned to their particular posts until the morning of the 23rd when, on parading, they were detailed to the various guards&mdash;the non-commissioned officers by the battalion sergeant major and the men by the orderly sergeants. The Magazine Fort guard, having been thus detailed, proceeded to the Fort by lorry.  The guard was mounted at <Col N="1988" /> 9.45 a.m. and was due for relief at the same hour on the following day.  There were two sentry posts at the Fort, so that two members of the guard were on sentry duty at a time, each period of duty being two hours.  The guard commander and the four men not on sentry duty occupied the guardroom.</P>
    <P>The fire picquet was supplied from Islandbridge Barracks.  It was drawn from personnel serving at Islandbridge Barracks or on the permanent staff of the Fort and was made up of a Volunteer sergeant, two privates of the regular force and two Volunteer privates.  The same picquet was detailed for duty for the period 22nd to 29th December and, on the 23rd December, reported for duty shortly after 1 p.m.  The picquet occupied a room known as the fire picquet room.</P>
    <P>The military policeman was detailed from the No. 2 Garrison Company, Military Police Service, Islandbridge Barracks.  He had been on duty daily at the Fort from 4 p.m. to midnight since the 18th December, returning to Islandbridge Barracks each night on completion of duty.  His period of duty was due to terminate at midnight on the 24th December.  He had done duty at the Fort intermittently for seven years&mdash;on an average on week in every nine.</P>
    <P>The following orders were issued by the officer in charge of the Fort in 1929 and were in force on the night of the raid:&mdash;(1) A scheme of defence for the Magazine Fort, (2) special order for guard commander, (3) general order for sentries, (4) orders for military police.</P>
    <P>These orders are rather detailed and I think it will be sufficient for the present, at any rate, to mention the following provisions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>After nightfall only the wicket of the inner gate should be opened for any purpose.  Before opening the wicket, either to permit anybody to leave the Fort or to answer the bell at the outer gate, the military policeman should call the guard commander and they should proceed together to the inner gate.  The policeman should, en route, switch on the lights which illuminate <Col N="1989" /> the area between the inner and outer gates and the passage way between the inner gate and front courtyard.  After the policeman had opened and passed through the wicket (accompanied by persons leaving the Fort, if such were the case) the guard commander should bolt the wicket and should not reopen it until the policeman, having admitted visitors or allowed persons to leave, had relocked the outer gate and returned.  The orders for military police provided that during the absence of the officer in charge of the Fort, nobody should be admitted to the Fort except visitors to the officer or his family, who were identified by a member of the family. There was a later instruction of 1934 from the adjutant, Islandbridge Barracks, to the officer in charge of the Fort that the latter, whenever leaving the Fort, should direct the military policeman not to admit any person in his absence.  The orders entitled &ldquo;orders for Military Police&rdquo; were, however, not amended in the light of this instruction.  Finally, the orders provided that the inner door of the guardroom should be kept locked at all times.  The guardroom in question has an outer wire door with a bolt and an inner wooden door.</P>
    <P>The sequence of events at the Magazine Fort on the night of the raid as described in the evidence taken by the court was as follows:&mdash;At about 8.15 p.m. the officer in charge of the Fort left the Fort and proceeded to the city.  To let him out, the military policeman on duty, having switched on the lights, opened half the inner gate. He did not call the guard commander. Passing through and without locking the inner gate, he opened the outer gate.  The policeman stated in evidence that this procedure, which was contrary to the orders already mentioned, was that always followed by him in letting the officer in charge of the Fort out, and that the officer did not at any time check him for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the officer present when that evidence was given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>He also stated that he <Col N="1990" /> usually opened the inner gate, instead of the wicket, for the officer in charge of the Fort and his family and for other officers because the wicket was small and the step high.  The officer in charge of the Fort confirmed in his evidence that the general practice was as stated, and that he did not check the policeman because he regarded the procedure as an act of courtesy to him. He did not, when leaving, direct the military policeman not to admit any person in his absence.</P>
      <P>Having locked the gates after the officer in charge of the Fort left, the military policeman returned to his room.  Shortly afterwards, the bell of the outer gate rang.  He went out, switched on the lights, and, on looking through the grille of the inner gate, saw that the person desiring admittance was the son of the officer in charge of the Fort.  He went out through the wicket, leaving it open behind him and admitted the visitor, then locking the gates&mdash;first, the outer and then the wicket&mdash;and switching off the lights.  He did not call the guard commander in this instance either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At about 8.35 p.m. the bell of the outer gate again rang.  Once more, without calling the guard commander, the policeman proceeded to the inner gate, switching on the lights en route.  On looking through the grille, he saw a man dressed in civilian clothes, and with a bicycle, standing at the outer gate.  He opened the wicket, according to his own statement, and went to the outer gate, leaving the wicket open.  The civilian said that he had a parcel for the officer in charge of the Fort, and the policeman replied that he himself would take it in.  As he said this, he bent down and unlocked the gate. His own evidence of the succeeding incidents is that, as he stood up, the civilian pointed a gun at his face and said: &ldquo;Stick them up.&rdquo;  He tried to push the gate shut, but failed.  He refused to put his hands up, whereupon the civilian said that if he did not, his brains would be blown out.  He then obeyed and marched through the wicket with the raider behind.  He <Col N="1991" /> made no effort to draw his revolver nor did he shout, or give any sign to the sentry because, to quote himself: &ldquo;I thought the sentry had appreciated the situation and would open fire.&rdquo;  He was marched past the sentry and, at the same time, a man in uniform of Army pattern rushed by him.  He was taken to the rear of the sentry post, where he was disarmed and then marched to the guardroom.  He noticed that by this time a number of raiders had entered.</P>
    <P>The No. 1 sentry's account of this episode differs somewhat from that of the policeman.  He states that the policeman, when going out, almost fully opened the inner gate&mdash;not the wicket.  The sentry saw him converse with the civilian, after which he opened the outer gate.  The civilian entered and then dropping the parcel, pointed what appeared to be a revolver at the policeman.  The latter shouted loudly, turned and ran towards the inner gate. The raider followed him, shouting &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.  The sentry alleges that the policeman ran past his post, saying: &ldquo;You don't leave there&rdquo;.  Just then, according to the sentry, a civilian with a revolver came up on his right and ordered him to hand over his rifle. The rifle was at the time resting on the corrugated iron breastwork as the sentry had been &ldquo;covering&rdquo; the gate. He refused to hand over the rifle and states that he tried to step back a few paces so as to be able to point it at the raider.  The latter closed with him, pointed the revolver at his throat and gave him a minute to hand over the rifle.  He then obeyed, and was marched towards the house of the officer in charge.  He saw the military policeman being marched from that direction.  When the two parties met, the policeman and sentry were marched in single file to the guardroom by two of the raiders, including the one who appeared to be the leader.</P>
    <P>The raiders entered the guardroom by opening the outer wire door.  There was a hole in the wire which enabled anyone entering to insert his hand and pull back the bolt on the inside.  The military policeman stated that they <Col N="1992" /> then pushed open the inner door, which was unlocked, rushed in, pushing their captives before them, and ordered the guard, who were sitting round the fire, to put their hands up. The guards' rifles and bayonets were in a rack near the door.  The guard commander stated that he was sitting by the fire with three of the four members of the guard not on sentry duty when a knock came at the inner door.  The fourth man had temporarily left the guardroom to attend to the cookhouse fire.</P>
    <P>The guard commander said that, on hearing the knock, he opened the door, which he confirmed was unlocked.  On seeing the two raiders, he attempted to slam the door, but it was immediately pushed open by the raiders who entered, shouting &ldquo;Hands up&rdquo;.  One of the guard unsuccessfully attempted to get his rifle, which, with those belonging to the others, was in the rack near the door.  Otherwise, the raiders' order was immediately obeyed.  The raiders took possession of the guards' rifles, ammunition and equipment.  While these incidents were taking place, another party of the raiders had gone to the fire picquet room, held up the members of the fire picquet and taken possession of their rifles and ammunition.  There was no attempt at resistance.  The time was now about 8.55 p.m.</P>
    <P>After the raiders in the guardroom had taken over and counted the rifles, the man who appeared to be the leader asked: &ldquo;Where is the other rifle?&rdquo;  The guard commander replied that the sentry on No. 2 post had it. The leader left the room, returned after a short while and ordered the guard commander to come with him and find the sentry.  The guard commander obeyed and went out with the leader and a second raider dressed in Army uniform.  The latter accompanied the guard commander to No. 2 post, on approaching which they were challenged by the sentry.  The raider ordered the guard commander to reply and to bring the sentry up.  On hearing the reply &ldquo;guard commander, it's all right&rdquo;, the sentry gave the order &ldquo;Advance, guard commander, to be <Col N="1993" /> recognised&rdquo;.  The guard commander said &ldquo;Come on down, it's all right&rdquo;, whereupon the sentry advanced at the &ldquo;on guard&rdquo; position.  When about three paces distant, the guard commander ordered &ldquo;slope your rifle&rdquo;, and the sentry obeyed.</P>
    <P>The raider in uniform then stepped forward and pointing a revolver at the sentry said: &ldquo;Hand over your rifle or I'll shoot you&rdquo;.  The sentry at first refused, but the guard commander advised him to give up his rifle, saying: &ldquo;You might as well; I'm disarmed&rdquo;, or words to that effect.  The sentry then handed over the rifle and the guard commander and he were marched back to the guardroom.  In his evidence, the guard commander stated that he made no attempt to disarm the raider while they were alone because he was confused and shocked and it did not enter his mind to do so. Shortly afterwards, the entire guard with the military policeman and the son of the officer in charge of the Fort, who had also been brought to the guardroom, were marched to the fire picquet room.</P>
    <P>The officer in charge of the Fort returned at about 9.45 p.m.  He was held up at the entrance to the Fort by the raiders and brought to the fire picquet room.  A few minutes later, a gatekeeper of the Park was also brought to the fire picquet room, suffering from head injuries inflicted by the raiders. The party in the picquet room was detained there until 10.20 p.m. approximately, and during the time of their detention, no attempt was made to organise resistance to the raiders either before or after the arrival of the officer in charge of the Fort.  During the entire period for which they were in the picquet room, they heard the sounds of lorries moving into and out of the Fort.</P>
    <P>At 10.20 p.m., the entire party, with the exception of the Park gatekeeper, were removed to &ldquo;C&rdquo; magazine from which the ammunition had been taken by the raiders.  Before they left, the leader of the raiders advised the party not to identify any of them subsequently, stating there were amongst <Col N="1994" /> them, the military, men who would tell if anyone identified them.  Shortly after 11 p.m. the officer in charge of the Fort made his way out through a ventilator with a member of the guard and proceeded to inspect the Fort.  He found that the raiders had gone, and that a relief party of troops had arrived.</P>
    <P>To explain the arrival of these troops, it is necessary to go back a little in point of time to events which were taking place elsewhere.  At 10.10 p.m. approximately, as the military policeman on duty at the upper gate of Islandbridge Barracks was opening the gate to allow an Army car to leave, he was fired on by one of a party of four armed men standing outside. After the shot was fired, the party ran away.  The military policeman closed the gate without letting the car out and went to the hut just inside, where he telephoned the orderly officer's room and reported the incident of the shooting to the orderly sergeant. While the telephone switchboard operator at the Barracks was putting this call through, he noticed the Magazine Fort indicator on the switchboard drop.  On plugging in, he found that the line to the Fort was dead.  It may be mentioned that there was no telephonic communication between the Fort and outside, other than the line connected with the switchboard at Islandbridge.</P>
    <P>At 10.20 p.m. the orderly officer (a second lieutenant of the Reserve of Officers) was informed of the shooting and proceeded at once to the gate where he received a report from the policeman on duty.  While at the gate, he also received a report from the telephone switchboard operator that telephonic communication with the Magazine Fort had failed.  The orderly officer immediately telephoned the orderly officer, Command Headquarters, Portobello Barracks, to whom he reported the shooting incident and the absence of telephonic communication with the Fort.  He was put through to the command duty officer, a captain of the regular forces, to whom he repeated his report.  The duty officer at once ordered the &ldquo;stand-to&rdquo; party <Col N="1995" /> at Portobello, consisting of one officer, two non-commissioned officers and ten men, to proceed to the Magazine Fort to investigate and report.  The party left barracks by lorry at 10.50 p.m., the officer being seated in the driver's cab and the remainder of the party in the body of the lorry.  They entered the park by the main entrance and as they turned into the road leading to the Fort the officer noticed in the beam of the headlights four civilians in a crouching position on the side of the road and about 30 yards in front of the lorry.</P>
    <P>Calling on his men to follow, he jumped out and ran towards the men shouting to them to halt.  Two halted and two ran away.  Handing over the two men who halted to his non-commissioned officers, the officer proceeded down the road and met two Volunteers who had been sent from Islandbridge Barracks to ascertain the position at the Fort.  While speaking to them the officer noticed a man in civilian dress crouching near the railings.  The man came back on being called upon to halt and on being searched was found to be in possession of two loaded revolvers and 17 rounds of ammunition. The officer brought the man back to the lorry, finding, en route, a soldier's haversack containing five fully loaded revolvers and 36 rounds of ammunition. He then proceeded to the Fort.</P>
    <P>At the house of the officer in charge of the Fort he interviewed that officer's wife, who told him that the Fort had been raided and that she did not know where the guard was. Leaving a non-commissioned officer in charge, the officer proceeded to Islandbridge Barracks with his prisoners and escort.  He placed his prisoners in the guardroom and then, at 11.45 p.m. approximately, reported by the telephone to the command duty officer, Portobello, the capture of the prisoners and the fact that the Fort had been raided. He was directed to return to the Fort and to post a new guard.  Accompanied by three officers, and with some of his own men and a party of men from Islandbridge Barracks he went to the Fort, arriving there about midnight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> Having received the report of the officer in charge of the &ldquo;stand-to&rdquo; party, the command duty officer telephoned the orderly officer, McKee Barracks, informed him of the situation and requested that the Chief of Staff be informed.  He sent a car for the command adjutant, who resided outside barracks.  The car arrived at the house at midnight.  At 1 a.m. he telephoned the acting officer commanding, Eastern Command, who resided at Howth.  That officer directed that a car be sent out for him.</P>
    <P>From this stage onwards it would be difficult to give clearly, in the form of a continuous narrative, the remaining events of the night and I propose, therefore, to deal separately with the movements of certain individuals and with certain other important incidents which occurred that night.</P>
    <P>Shortly after 11.45 p.m. the Chief of Staff was informed by the orderly officer, McKee Barracks, that the Fort had been raided.  He immediately left home for the Fort after first having arranged for the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General to be informed. He arrived at the Fort just before midnight and obtained reports from the officer in charge of the Fort and the officer in charge of the &ldquo;stand-to&rdquo; party.  He ascertained that the police had been notified, but as they had not arrived and telephonic communication with outside was not available, he proceeded to the Gárda Depôt with the Quartermaster-General, who had also arrived at the Fort.  At the depôt he spoke to the Gárda Commissioner by telephone and arrangements were made for all Gárda districts to be informed of the raid and to be directed to send out patrols to watch lorry movements. The Chief of Staff returned to the Fort at 12.30 a.m., gave instructions for the old guard and military policeman to be placed under arrest, had a discussion with the command adjutant who had arrived at the Fort at 1 a.m. went to his office at the Department of Defence where he wirelessed orders to all commands to take the greatest protective precautions for posts and ammunition and to assist the Gárdaí in the search for lorries.  He telephoned <Col N="1997" /> all commands and brigades in elaboration of the radio messages and told them that the Gárdai, who were receiving separate instructions from their own headquarters would get in touch with them.  At 1.30 a.m. he informed me of the raid by telephone and of the steps he was taking to deal with the situation.  He remained in his office until 3.30 a.m. receiving reports from the commands and brigades as to the steps taken.</P>
    <P>The command adjutant arrived at Portobello Barracks at 12.15 a.m. and was given details of the situation by the duty officer.  He proceeded immediately to Islandbridge Barracks, where, however, no additional information was available, so he went to the Magazine Fort, arriving there at 12.40 a.m.  The Chief of Staff, who was there, discussed the situation with him.  He returned to Islandbridge at 1.30 a.m. and telephoned the command duty officer who informed him that the acting officer commanding desired to get into barracks and that a military car was not immediately available.  He then proceeded to Howth in the Army car which he was using and there he met the officer commanding, and returned with him to Portobello Barracks. He went home at 4 a.m.</P>
    <P>The acting officer commanding, Eastern Command, received a telephone message from the command duty officer at 1 a.m.  He stated in evidence that the duty officer informed him that something had happened at the Magazine Fort and that they could not get into the Fort.  He directed the duty officer to send out a car for him. He waited some time and as the car had not arrived went to Howth Gárda Station where he was informed by the Superintendent that a large quantity of ammunition had been taken from the Fort.  He telephoned the duty officer, inquired why the car had not been sent and was informed that the command adjutant was on his way out. When the command adjutant arrived he received particulars of the situation from him.  On reaching barracks at 3 a.m. he made transport arrangements for any troop movements that might be required and, according to <Col N="1998" /> his own evidence, having ascertained that the Gárda authorities had taken charge of the situation, he left for home, arriving there at 4 a.m.</P>
    <P>The events in Collins Barracks, Dublin, on the night of the raid may now be related.  On that night there were on duty in Collins Barracks the following officers:&mdash;A staff officer (a commandant of the regular forces) representing the officer commanding barracks; a duty officer (a captain of the regular forces); an orderly officer (a second-lieutenant of the Volunteer force).  There was also a &ldquo;stand-to&rdquo; party consisting of two non-commissioned officers and 24 men.</P>
    <P>One of the tasks of the duty officer is to visit at least once during the night the posts at which guards are provided by the unit in Collins Barracks.  As these posts are scattered, it is necessary that the visit or visits be made by car.  About 8.30 p.m., on the 23rd December, the duty officer telephoned to the supply and transport company at Islandbridge Barracks requesting that a car should be sent immediately to Collins Barracks to enable him to visit the posts.  He was informed that the car intended for him was on other duty, but that it would he sent to Collins Barracks immediately it returned.  Sometime later, the orderly sergeant at Collins Barracks again telephoned for the car and was informed that it had not returned up to that time.  The car arrived at Islandbridge at 10 p.m. and left the transport yard for Collins Barracks at 10.10 p.m., the duty officer at Collins Barracks being informed by telephone at the same time that the car was on its way.</P>
    <P>When, however, the car reached the gate of Islandbridge Barracks the shooting incident, previously mentioned, occurred.  The car returned to the transport yard.  Shortly after, a further telephone message was received at the supply and transport office, Islandbridge Barracks, from the duty officer at Collins Barracks inquiring why the car had not arrived.  He was informed that something had happened at the gate and that the car could not <Col N="1999" /> leave for the moment.  The duty officer thereupon telephoned to the orderly officer at Islandbridge and inquired as to the non-arrival of the car at Collins Barracks.  It would appear that at this time two, if not the three, of the officers on duty in this barracks conversed with the orderly officer at Islandbridge, who informed them of the shooting incident and stated that the car had then left for Collins Barracks.  This was about 10.30 or 10.40 p.m.  The car duly arrived at Collins Barracks and, after questioning the driver as to the shooting incident, the duty officer proceeded on his round of inspection.  Some ten minutes later, the orderly officer at Islandbridge again telephoned to Collins Barracks and asked for the orderly officer there.  The latter was unable to understand the message and handed the telephone to the staff officer.  He was informed that it was desirable that the adjutant of Islandbridge Barracks&mdash;who resides in official quarters in Collins Barracks&mdash; should report to his station immediately. The staff officer was, therefore, requested to send a message to the adjutant's quarters.  After some conversation, the staff officer stated that the information regarding the shooting was too indefinite and suggested that further details should be obtained before the adjutant was sent for.</P>
    <P>According to the evidence of the orderly officer at Islandbridge, he was informed by the staff officer that none of the officers in that barracks (Collins) was going to chase married officers for him.  Shortly after, another officer in Islandbridge Barracks telephoned to the officers' mess in Collins Barracks. The call was taken by an officer who was not on duty.  He was informed of the shooting, and was requested to send to married quarters for the adjutant of Islandbridge Barracks, which he did.  The adjutant, however, was not at home.  The officer who received the telephone call reported its substance to the orderly officer and the staff officer and was informed by the last mentioned that he, the officer who reported, was taking too serious a view <Col N="2000" /> of the incident and should forget about it.</P>
    <P>About midnight the orderly officer at Islandbridge again telephoned to the orderly officer at Collins Barracks and stated that Verey lights had been seen over the Magazine Fort and requested that six men should be sent from Collins Barracks to investigate.  The orderly officer at Collins Barracks, however, thought it wise to obtain the permission of the staff officer before sending the men.  He (the orderly officer) reported the request to the staff officer, who was then in his bedroom, and was instructed to inquire from the orderly officer at Islandbridge if he had the authority of command headquarters to requisition the party.  He did so and the orderly officer at Islandbridge informed him that he had no authority to requisition the party and that he was acting on his own initiative as he thought that the Fort had been attacked.  On this being reported to the staff officer, he directed the orderly officer to inform the orderly officer at Islandbridge that the party would not be supplied.  In passing, it may be mentioned that a similar request for men was made to the orderly officer at McKee Barracks and he at once complied with the request.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, shortly before midnight, the Quartermaster-General, who resides in Collins Barracks, was informed by telephone from the Chief of Staff's residence of the raid on the Magazine Fort.  He immediately telephoned to the officers' mess in Collins Barracks and informed one of the regular officers not on duty of the raid and instructed him to get a party out at once to the Fort.  The Quartermaster-General then proceeded to the Magazine Fort.  The officer who received the telephone message informed the orderly officer of the Quarter-master-General's instructions, but the men were not sent to the Fort.</P>
    <P>The staff officer, Collins Barracks, in his evidence, maintained that he did not hear of the raid on the Fort until lunch time on the 24th December. Both he and the orderly officer, however, must have known that something <Col N="2001" /> very unusual had taken place at Islandbridge. Barracks or the Magazine Fort &mdash;more especially having regard to the Quartermaster-General's message&mdash;and it would have been a simple matter for them to have sent personnel to either place to ascertain the facts.</P>
    <P>We now come to the recovery of the stolen property.  From the 24th December onwards the search for the ammunition by the Gárda Síochána continued incessantly.  On the military side the fullest arrangements were made for any troop movements which might be necessary to aid the Gárda. It was not until the 26th December, however, that any information became available which enabled the military to be used.  As a result of information received on that day, the City of Dublin and the Wicklow-Kildare area were cordoned by the military while an intensive search was carried out by the Gárda.  This resulted in a portion of the missing ammunition being discovered. On the 28th December the military, in addition to holding the cordons, participated actively in the search, which continued until practically nine-tenths of the missing ammunition were recovered.</P>
    <P>The quantities recovered to date are:&mdash;.303 machine gun ammunition, 368,165 rounds; Thompson gun ammunition, 607,365 rounds; total small arms ammunition, 975,530 rounds; two rifles.</P>
    <P>The following quantities have not yet been recovered:&mdash;.303 machine gun ammunition, 103,946 rounds; Thompson gun ammunition, 4,935 rounds; .45 revolver ammunition, 12 rounds; total small arms ammunition, 108,893 rounds; two rifles; one revolver, one gas mask, and some small components.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the raid itself and indicated the circumstances in which it occurred, it remains to summarise for the House the causes, direct and indirect, which, from the evidence, enabled the raid to be successfully carried out, to indicate the manner in which responsibility for its success was assigned, and to state the disciplinary action which has been taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> From the facts elicited by the court of inquiry I formed the conclusion that the successful raiding of the Fort was directly attributable to the following causes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The failure of the military policeman to carry out his orders as to the precautions to be taken when opening the entrance gates to the Fort after dark, and his failure to offer any resistance to the raider who held him up or to attempt in any way to alarm the guard.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The failure of the sentry on No. 1 post to fire on the raiders in the defence of his post or to make any attempt to alarm the guard.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The failure of the guard commander to ensure that the door of the guardroom was locked and his inaction when presented with the opportunity of disarming the raider at No. 2 post.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The failure of the sentry on No. 2 post to attack the raider who attempted to disarm him.  This failure on the part of the Volunteer was largely due to the action of the guard commander who assisted in placing him in a position where he could be disarmed and advised him to hand over his rifle to the raider.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  The failure of the officer in charge of the Fort to appreciate his responsibility as such in that after he was arrested by the raiders and fully understood the situation he made no attempt to organise resistance to the raiders in an effort to retrieve the position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Indirectly responsible for the success of the raid was a spirit of laxity and a lack of observance of the orders for the defence of the Fort which had grown up over a number of years and had been permitted to go unchecked. For that position the officer in charge of the Fort, who was charged with its defence, and the officer commanding, Eastern Command, whose duty it was to ensure that the officer in charge of the Fort did not neglect his charge must be held responsible.</P>
    <P>The orders for the defence of the <Col N="2003" /> Fort were originally prepared in 1929 and remained unaltered up to the date of the raid.  With the passage of time, however, they had in many respects become considerably out of date and inapplicable.  For instance, when they were issued the guard consisted of one non-commissioned officer and nine men, thus providing for three sentries on duty at a time, whereas for many years the guard had been reduced to one non-commissioned officer and six men, which permitted of only two sentries at a time.  They also provided for a duty officer, which appointment had been unfilled since 1932.  In addition to being out of date, they contained many glaring omissions and contradictions.  Thus, while the scheme of defence provided for the employment of the fire picquet in the defence of the Fort, the duties of the picquet in this regard were not contained in fire picquet orders.  The fire picquet commander on the night of the raid stated in evidence that he had no orders to reinforce the guard in the case of attack.  At one point in the orders the military policeman was authorised to allow persons identified by the family of the officer in charge to enter after dark, whereas, elsewhere, the admission of any officer after 6 p.m. was specifically prohibited.</P>
    <P>The evidence of the officer in charge of the Fort and that of other witnesses, showed clearly that in recent years, at least, he did not appreciate his direct responsibility for the defence of the Fort.  He admitted that he carried out no systematic inspection of the guard or guardroom.  Had he done so, he must have realised that his orders were not merely imperfect, but were, for the most part, being disregarded. Thus, although it was provided in orders that the guardroom should be kept locked at all times, it transpired in evidence that there was no key for the door for a considerable time prior to the raid.  As previously stated, the wire of the outer door of the guardroom was broken, and it was possible for any person, by inserting his hand, to push back the bolt on the inside, instead of having to call a member of the guard to open the door.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> At no time did he personally supervise the changing of the guard, or inspect the guard to satisfy himself that they were familiar with their duties and the scheme of defence.</P>
    <P>The military policeman in his evidence stated that over a considerable period he did not comply with his orders regarding the procedure for the opening of the inner wooden entrance gate after dark.  Not only did he fail to summon the guard commander to close the wicket of the inner gate while the outer gate was being opened, but he habitually opened half the inner gate, instead of the wicket, to allow the officer in charge and his family to enter or leave, and left it open while he opened the outer gate. This was a decisive factor in facilitating the entry of the raiders, and the officer in charge continuously acquiesced in this vital breach of his own orders.</P>
    <P>With regard to the responsibility of the officer commanding, Eastern Command, it transpired in evidence that that officer, from the time of his appointment in June, 1935, to November, 1938, did not on any occasion inspect or visit the Magazine Fort, nor did any of his staff.  In November, 1938, however, as a result of a change in the appointment of camp commandant, Islandbridge Barracks, the question of direct responsibility for the defence of the Magazine Fort arose. As a result, the officer commanding, Eastern Command, visited the Magazine Fort in November, 1938, and verbally informed the officer in charge of the Fort that, in future, he would be held directly responsible to Eastern Command headquarters for the defence of the Fort.  In January, 1939, the officer commanding, Eastern Command, sent a staff officer to discuss with the officer in charge of the Fort certain matters arising out of the arrangements mentioned which was confirmed in writing in February, 1939. At the same time, the staff officer in question wrote for copies of the orders for the defence of the Fort.  He stated in evidence that he was satisfied as to the adequacy of the orders.  The officer commanding, Eastern Command, stated that he did not actually see the orders, but obtained a summary of their contents, <Col N="2005" /> with which he was satisfied.  It is unquestionable, however, that had the orders been carefully examined by the officer commanding, Eastern Command, and by his staff, it would have been seen that they were in many respects out of date and required considerable revision.</P>
    <P>The absence of regular inspections by the command headquarters staff was clearly instrumental in leading to the development of the serious spirit of laxity in carrying out the orders for the defence of the Fort.  A further aspect of this matter was that, while such inspections were not carried out, no instructions were issued to the battalions supplying the guards for the Fort to ensure the carrying out of the orders (such as they were).  The evidence showed that there was a very definite misunderstanding as to the responsibility of battalion and duty officers in regard to the inspection of the guards at the Fort.</P>
    <P>The officers commanding the two battalions which supplied the Fort guards in recent years both maintained in evidence that since an officer of another unit (the ordnance service) was immediately responsible for the defence of the Fort, it was not within their province to interfere in any way with his arrangements, more particularly as he was not responsible to them.</P>
    <P>In the case of one of the units, which supplied the guard up to December 5th, 1939, the Magazine Fort was omitted from the list of guard posts which the duty officer was required to visit and inspect daily.  The orders issued by the officer commanding the other unit required that the duty officer should visit all guard posts once every day and at least five posts every night.  Actually the Magazine Fort was visited by the duty officer of this unit only on seven occasions between December 6th and 23rd.  None of the visits took place at night owing to the order of the officer in charge of the Fort already mentioned, that officers were not to be admitted to the Fort after 6 p.m.  The officer commanding, Eastern Command, was, however, under the impression that the duty officers' visited the Fort as a matter of routine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> To sum up as far as the Eastern Command was concerned there was a complete absence of inspection of the Magazine Fort from the point of view of defence.  For that absence of inspection, the officer commanding, Eastern Command, must be held responsible.</P>
    <P>The incidents succeeding the raid also indicated in a number of cases failure on the part of certain officers to realise their responsibilities, and to take the action which the circumstances clearly demanded.  The following may be particularly mentioned:</P>
    <P>The acting officer commanding, Eastern Command (a colonel).  This officer was informed of the situation at his home in Howth at about 1 a.m. on the 24th December.  Owing to delay in having Army transport dispatched to his residence, he did not arrive at Command Headquarters, Portobello Barracks, until 3 a.m.  On his own evidence he took no action beyond detailing &ldquo;stand-to&rdquo; parties and arranging for transport.  As he was the senior executive officer of the command and was actually in charge at the time it is only reasonable to expect that immediately on his arrival he would have taken initial steps for the recovery of the ammunition or have sought instructions from the Chief of Staff.  He did not even visit the Magazine Fort to see the position for himself. His inaction indicated that he was indifferent to his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The staff officer, Collins Barracks (a commandant).  The forces at the disposal of this officer on the night of the raid consisted of a motor squadron of the cavalry corps, a &ldquo;stand-to&rdquo; party (two non-commissioned officers and 24 men) and the troops of the 5th Battalion in barracks.  These might have been effectively used if the situation had been properly made known to him in the initial stages.  While the information given to him may not have been of a definite nature, it might reasonably be expected that, in view of the numerous urgent messages received from Islandbridge on the night of the raid, he would have realised that something most unusual was happening. His failure to take steps to ascertain the real position showed gross indifference to his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> The orderly officer, Collins Barracks (a second lieutenant of the Volunteer Force).  This officer performed his duties in a most irresponsible manner. He made no effort to ascertain the real position at Islandbridge Barracks.  His evidence at the Court of Inquiry was regarded as inaccurate and untruthful.</P>
    <P>The proceedings and findings of the Court of Inquiry were duly considered and the following disciplinary action was decided upon:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The officer commanding, the Eastern Command, for the reason that, as such, he failed to ensure the adequate defence of the Magazine Fort, was placed on the half-pay list for a period of 12 months from 12th March, 1940.  At the end of that period, his case will be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The acting officer commanding, Eastern Command, because of his unsatisfactory conduct immediately following the raid was also placed on half-pay for a period of 12 months from 12th March, 1940, his case to be further considered at the end of that period.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The officer in charge of the Fort was informed that for culpable negligence in his duties (the details were fully stated) it was proposed to request the Government to advise the President to dismiss him from the service.  He was given an opportunity to make such representations as he thought proper within five days in relation to the proposed dismissal.  He made no such representations and for the moment he has been placed on the half-pay list.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The staff officer, Collins Barracks, was informed that in view of his conduct on the night of the raid it was not in the interests of the Service that he should retain his commission and that while his conduct would merit retirement for misconduct or inefficiency, the Minister was prepared to give him an opportunity of resigning voluntarily on the appropriate pension and to recommend to the Government to advise the President that such resignation be accepted.</P>
    <P>The orderly officer, Collins Barracks, <Col N="2008" /> was similarly informed.  As a Volunteer officer he is not entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>Five other officers were censured or admonished.</P>
    <P>In addition, as Deputies are no doubt aware, the military policeman on duty on the Magazine Fort, the guard commander and the sentry on No. 1 post were tried by general court martial in connection with the raid.</P>
    <P>The military policeman was charged with neglecting to obey orders in that on the night of the raid he opened the inner and outer gate of the Fort without the commander of the guard being present, thereby enabling armed raiders to enter the Fort, and also with neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline in that when an armed raider had gained entry to the Fort he did not use his best endeavours to prevent himself from being disarmed. He was found &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; of both charges.</P>
    <P>The corporal guard commander was charged with having been guilty of an act to the prejudice of good order and military discipline in that he counselled the sentry on No. 2 post to give up his rifle to a raider.  He was convicted and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment with hard labour.</P>
    <P>The sentry on No. 1 post was charged with having been guilty of neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline in that when an armed raider held up the military policeman on duty at the gates of the Fort, he neglected to take any steps to defend the Fort.  He was found &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; of the charge.</P>
    <P>From what I have said it will be evident that were it not for (1) the laxity displayed by the officer commanding the Eastern Command and the officer in charge of the Fort, and (2) the breaches of orders by the military personnel in the Fort, the successful raiding of the Fort could not have been accomplished.  I am satisfied that these causes of the raid cannot be attributed to defects in the general administration of the Defence Forces or any of its branches or in the general organisation, efficiency or discipline <Col N="2009" /> thereof.  I am prepared to admit that the discipline in the Magazine Fort and in Collins Barracks on the night of the raid was not what it should have been but the responsibility for this position lies with individual officers and reflects no discredit on the general behaviour of the Defence Forces whether Regular or Reserve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it desirable at this stage to refer to certain matters raised by Deputy McGilligan on the 12th March last in the course of supplementary questions arising out of my reply to his question regarding the placing of an officer on half pay.  The Deputy inquired whether the Court of Inquiry had been asked to report why the relative Defence Force Regulations had not been observed in so far as they require that a member of the forces whose character or military reputation may be affected by an inquiry should be given an opportunity of being present throughout the proceedings; of cross-examining witnesses and of producing evidence in defence of his character or military reputation. The Deputy also suggested that the court had given as one of the reasons for their failure to observe the regulations that the room in which the proceedings were held was too small to accommodate all the persons involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to the Deputy's original question, I stated that in view of the urgent military situation created by the raid, and the large number of officers and men involved, or likely to be involved <Col N="2010" /> in the inquiry, it was impracticable to relieve them all from duty for attendance throughout the inquiry. I also pointed out that it was essential that the Government should have the facts as early as possible.  Lest, however, the impression may have been created that the position of the officers against whom disciplinary action was taken was prejudiced in any way by the failure to observe the strict letter of the Regulations mentioned, I propose to indicate in detail the facts of the matter.</P>
    <P>The President of the Court of Inquiry was requested, immediately after the proceedings of the court had been submitted, to indicate why the provisions of the relative Regulations had not been observed <i>in toto.</i>  In his reply the President stated that at the outset of the proceedings, it became apparent that the military reputation of a large number of officers and soldiers would be affected by the evidence.  If the procedure prescribed by Regulations were observed <i>in toto</i>, it would have meant that a large number of persons would have been present during the hearing of the evidence of each witness and that each such person would have the right of cross-examination.  This would have been very cumbersome, and would have prolonged the proceedings unduly.  In addition it would have entailed relieving all such persons from duty for the duration of the proceedings.  A further consideration was that if even one of them were unable to attend for any reason, such as illness, the proceedings would have had to be postponed.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the court considered that the spirit and intention of the Regulations would be met by first hearing the evidence of all witnesses, and then recalling witnesses whose evidence, in the opinion of the court, affected the military reputation of any other person, the person so affected being present and afforded an opportunity of cross-examination.  This was done in every case, and each witness called before the court had ample opportunity of defending his character and military reputation.</P>
    <P>While it was agreed that in the peculiar circumstances it was impracticable <Col N="2011" /> to adhere strictly to the provisions of the Regulations, the court was re-convened for the purpose of reviewing, and, if necessary, revising its findings in the light of that fact. The court duly reviewed its findings, and reported that any portion of its original findings which adversely affected the character or military reputation of any person were based on the evidence of the person concerned; the documents handed into court; facts admitted and not in dispute, and the court's inspection of the Magazine Fort.  The court, therefore, adhered to its original findings.</P>
    <P>There was no suggestion whatever from the court that the room in which the proceedings took place was too small to accommodate all the persons involved, nor, until it was mentioned by Deputy McGilligan, had such an aspect of the matter arisen in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>As I already stated I have gone into this matter in detail merely to ensure that a false impression of the position will not exist.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, there is one aspect of the affair on which I should like to say a few words.  Nobody desires in any way to minimise the seriousness of this raid, but I think it very regrettable that certain Deputies should, in the course of various debates in this House in which the matter was mentioned, have gone to the other extreme and endeavoured to paint the blackest possible picture of the occurrence.  I think that such a course was particularly objectionable when in doing so Deputies made statements which, to say the least of them, were rash and ill-informed but at the same time of a nature calculated to create uneasiness and to disturb the public confidence.  I may quote, for instance, the following extracts from speeches made here by Deputy O'Higgins.  Speaking on the 3rd January last in the course of the debate on the Emergency Powers (Amendment) Bill, he said&mdash;the statement is reported at column 1415 of volume 78, No. 4 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" />&ldquo;I suppose in the whole history of armies since the world began there was never such a disaster as the picture of an army losing all its ammunition without as much as a blackthorn being used.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister disagree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for the Army, on the 5th March, Deputy O'Higgins is reported at column 66 of volume 79, No. 1 of the Official Debates, as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We had the dangerous state of affairs reaching its peak point at Christmas week when practically the whole ammunition reserve of the Army was passed out to people who would use it against the Army.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And at column 68:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... all the reserve of ammunition, 28 tons in weight, was loaded deliberately, slowly, and carefully in more than a dozen lorries and scattered throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact is that the Army did not lose all or nearly all of its reserve stock of ammunition.  Of the reserve stocks of small arms ammunition stored in the Fort alone, the quantity removed by the raiders was not much over 5 per cent.  If we take the stocks stored in magazines and barracks throughout the country, the quantity removed was less than 3 per cent.  I would remind Deputies that 90 per cent. of the ammunition taken has been recovered.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins also said in the course of the debate on the Emergency Powers (Amendment) Bill on the 3rd January last, column 1416 of volume 78, No. 4 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.... there was more ammunition lost in a couple of hours ... than could be bought by all the revenue which will be obtained from the revenue tax and the sugar tax put together.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the stolen ammunition was very far from the combined total of revenue and sugar taxes mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins.  The cost was approximately £4,000, while the <Col N="2013" /> revenue figures given to this House by the Minister for Finance, when introducing the Supplementary Budget in November last were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said on previous occasions, and I now repeat it, that I do not wish in any way to minimise the seriousness of the raid.  It was extremely serious, and should not have been possible.  In its own way it was a salutary lesson, because it will, I hope, effectually dispel that feeling that everything is safe and nothing can happen, a feeling which results in laxity and the disregard of routine but essential precautions.

      <P>I would have hardly thought, even though I have had some experience of the Dáil, that we would ever have such a spectacle as we had here to-night.  If the Minister for Defence was chairman of a commission that this resolution asks the House to set up, and was somebody completely apart even from the ranks of the Government Party, and that commission were to come along with a series of findings as black as those which the Minister has read, you could not expect an independent chairman of a commission to speak of that particular series of charges with such detachment as the Minister showed to-night.  He did not cause a flush or a quiver of embarrassment to spread even to his colleague, although he must have known, and must have seriously considered, they were the most definite condemnation of both himself and his colleague that anyone could make.  If the Minister had set the seal of sincerity on that speech by a particular addition, one could have said that the statement of fact, prejudiced, biased, inconclusive and bad as it is, would have some weight in the House, but there was one necessary postscript omitted.  It should have been, of course: &ldquo;After <Col N="2015" /> this, my resignation has been accepted.&rdquo;  The only difficulty about it is whether precedence in getting out should be accorded to the Minister's colleague.  It should be a matter of some scrupulosity between the two as to which should get out first, but both should get out.  Anyone who listened to that recital could not have the slightest doubt of that.  There used to be an old tale told of a Prime Minister who, when addressing his colleagues in the Cabinet, said: &ldquo;We had better hang together on a particular statement inside the Cabinet Council, lest we should all hang separately outside.&rdquo; The Minister has now decided the best way of causing public distrust of subordinates, but he has no appreciation whatever, apparently, of the repercussion of that statement on himself personally and on his colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The energy and the zeal which he displayed in going through this category of casualness, inefficiency, and irresponsibility was most illuminating. It seemed to me that his attitude was that since he himself and certain members of the Army are down, the only way he could gain a relative advantage was by pushing subordinates down further in the mire than anybody was likely to push him.  Through it all there was a complete air of detachment, and an absence of appreciation that he himself was being criticised or that his colleague was being criticised. If it is possible for two people to grow hides so armour-plated that they can behave in this way, they should teach the country how it is done, and there will then be no necessity for concrete shelters.  If they can stand the assailing that that statement puts upon them, they can stand anything, but they should surely remember that there is an army at their disposal.  Men have put their professional lives at the disposal of these people, and they are responsible for their professional faith. They should really have felt that when coming here and exposing what can only be described as a discreditable political manoeuvre to save themselves and their positions by blaming certain people who have served loyally in the <Col N="2016" /> Army, who have not been found guilty in the proper way, and who, apparently, have not even had a charge brought against them.  These men are to be sacrified to save two worthless people like these.  That is a thing this House ought not to tolerate, and I hope it will not be taken as a precedent and that nothing like this will happen again.</P>
    <P>The Minister winds up his statement by saying: &ldquo;I have found the following conclusions.&rdquo;  Right in the forefront of his conclusions, condemned as he is himself by all these findings, he passes judgment on others.  The first person on whom he passes judgment is the military policeman.  He was one of the few people who got a chance of appearing in public before a court and he was acquitted.  The second man on the Minister's roll is Sentry No. 1.  He also got a chance.  He was the second of three people who got a chance to make their case publicly in the way the regulations demanded.  He comes second in the Minister's list of those who ought to have some action taken against them.  And he was acquitted. Two out of the three in the forefront of the Minister's conclusions did get a chance to appear publicly, represented as people ought to be represented before a court martial, and both were acquitted.  Anybody else found guilty has been found guilty in some secret, hugger-mugger kind of way, found guilty by the Minister or the colleagues of the Minister.  The report to the Minister is kept secret so that the House does not know to what extent these people were allowed to defend themselves at all, how far they realised that charges would be made against them, how far charges, or even insinuations, were made against them, how far they were allowed, if they were recalled&mdash;which I doubt&mdash; to go through the ordinary run of the regulations in respect of the people who had given any evidence that had touched upon them.  It would be interesting to know whether the people sacrificed by the Minister were not complimented by certain of those who sat on the court of inquiry.  Anything done outside the charge laid against three men in open court is done in <Col N="2017" /> such a way that neither the House nor the public is going to get any knowledge of it.  Of the three brought before a court, only one person has been found guilty.  Then, this thing is so lightly passed over that we are told that only .39 of the revenue of the State was involved.  But it was a source of shame to Ministers when they spoke here on the 3rd January. The whole thing, which was such a source of shame on the 3rd January, has ended, so far as the public is concerned and so far as any public taking of evidence is concerned, with one man getting 18 months.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is not treating a serious matter in the way in which it should be treated.  The men who enlisted in the defence forces of this country are in a rather difficult position. They are, like military men in any other country, subject to two codes of discipline.  They are liable to the civil courts for anything done contrary to the civil law and, added to that, they have a disciplinary code of their own.  They know, when they enter the defence forces, that they are taking on themselves a double burden of responsibility.  So far, they have been protected by a statute of the Oireachtas.  One clause of that statute reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No charge against an officer, non-commissioned officer or private soldier shall be heard or investigated save in the presence of the accused. The accused shall have full liberty to cross-examine all witnesses called against him, and to call any witnesses in his defence and to make a statement in his defence.  If the accused shall demand that the evidence against him shall be taken on oath, the investigating officer shall cause all witnesses to be sworn before giving evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Act is evaded by the happy device of saying that no charge was brought against these men, that the Minister is taking action.  On what?  The result of the court of inquiry?  Anybody who entered the Army having behind him the fortification of that particular section knew also that there were certain regulations governing military courts&mdash;<Col N="2018" /> good regulations, in accord with natural justice and the ordinary rules as known in the courts.  One of the general rules with regard to procedure is Rule 12.  That is detailed in separate sections, all tending towards this&mdash;that if a man in the forefront of an inquiry has his military reputation or honour assailed, he is entitled to be present, to be represented, to contradict people, to cross-examine, to give evidence on his own behalf and to produce witnesses at his own discretion.  The rule goes even into more detail than that. When it appears probable, apart from any charge, that the character or military reputation of an officer or soldier will be affected, the same regulations apply and, finally, even though no charge be made and although, in the forefront of the proceedings, it might not appear probable that anything in the nature of assailing of reputation might result, if it should transpire during the sitting of a court that the character or military reputation of an officer or soldier is affected, the same regulations apply.  That is a good code.  The intention is that no officer shall be put out of the Army as the result of a charge unless given the opportunity to meet this charge, to produce witnesses, to put those who assail him on oath and cross-examine. Whether it is a court-martial or a court of inquiry, the same type of regulation holds.  The man who goes into the Army goes in with the knowledge that his professional life is protected if these rules and regulations are fairly carried out.  We know what happened on this occasion.  Only .39 of the revenue of the State was involved.  So far as the Minister is concerned, that is the conclusion he swings before the House at the end of his statement.</P>
    <P>In other words, for 1 per cent. of the national revenue you could have another raid on the Magazine Fort, and a somewhat smaller one of the same kind.  You could have the raid repeated once again, with another smaller raid, and you would find that no more than 1 per cent. of the national revenue was involved.</P>
    <P>There was a different view of the matter taken on the 3rd January. <Col N="2019" /> Four Ministers spoke in the course of the debate in this House on that occasion.  Two things emerge from a re-reading of what they said.  One is this.  People have been asked not to discuss this discreditable matter&mdash;and it was admitted by everybody to be discreditable.  We are asked not to discuss it on the grounds that an inquiry was being held, and that the House would later be supplied with the findings of that inquiry.  Secondly, right through that debate on the 3rd January, and later, next day in the Seanad, in the untterances of Ministers and the Taoiseach, there was an undercurrent that it was only subordinates were responsible, that a mere matter of routine was missed.  We had a conflict in these statements.  We were asked not to discuss the matter while the inquiry was being held, yet nearly every Minister, and the Taoiseach particularly, went out of his way to say that it was only a matter of routine, that some little bit of routine was missed.  The military policemen, Private Henry Brady and Corporal Andrew Dunne, were for it on the 3rd and 4th of January; it was a matter of routine. The two Ministers were kept carefully in the background, although that night shame was the tone that was expressed in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on the 3rd January, talked about recent events and, referring to the raid, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No doubt the question of responsibility for the recent occurrence will have ultimately to be settled by this House.  No doubt members of the House, in more quarters than one, feel very strongly in regard to that aspect of the present situation.  But that aspect of the question cannot be debated adequately to-day nor is it, in point of time, the most urgent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, later, taking up a phrase of Deputy Norton, the same Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No doubt that raid upon the Magazine Fort was a grave incident.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is the charge introduced in this phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2020" />&ldquo;But its gravity did not lie, and does not lie mainly, as Deputy Norton wished to imply, in the fact that certain laxity was indicated on the part of those who were placed in charge of the Magazine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the first stab at the subordinate&mdash;laxity on the part of those placed in charge of the Magazine.  At a later point I asked why was not some Minister sacked for it, and the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is a matter which no doubt will be discussed later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When he returned to the subject later he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever may have been our failings or our weaknesses or laxity in the last two or three months, the Dáil can always call us to account for it.  I assume that in due course the Dáil will do so, and it will be for us to satisfy the Dáil and, what is more important in my view, the country, that we were not guilty of any culpable neglect.  But that is not the immediate issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the first speaker amongst the Ministers in that debate on the Emergency Powers (Amendment) Bill, 1940. He put two things in the forefront&mdash;&ldquo;We will have to account for it in the House; there is an inquiry going on, and there will be a report as to the laxity on the part of those who were put in charge.&rdquo;  A little later, when somebody wandered in the debate, an application was made to the Ceann Comhairle to rule out certain statements on the ground that a military inquiry was proceeding and that we would have to wait until the result of the inquiry was before the House before the matter could be discussed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice was next in the field, and he said: &ldquo;Whatever blame may be attached to those who were in charge of the Magazine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and again he goes on with a statement the gist of which is that we would get a chance of discussing the matter.  &ldquo;I quite admit,&rdquo; said the Minister for Justice on that occasion, &ldquo;that this thing has happened on the most vital post in the whole service, <Col N="2021" /> and it is a shameful thing that it did happen....  We have had a shaking up that will serve us for many a long year to come.&rdquo;  That is not exactly the tone of the statement to-day, in which we were told that there was only about .39 of the national income involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, speaking the next day in the Dáil, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope that this stunt that took place in the Magazine Fort will do good to the country in the long run. I find great difficulty, owing to the great shock, in seeing any silver lining in the cloud, but if it brings home generally to the people the need for discipline&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is the tendentious matter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;if it brings home to the Army that no officer or soldier can dare for one instant to depart from the routine laid down for the guarding of posts, or other matters like that, if it brings home to the Guards throughout the country that they must be particularly active in tracing down people who might disturb the peace of the country, or tracing down arms which might be used against the people of this country, then there will be some little silver in the lining.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government did not feel that he was justified in referring to the occurrence because he &ldquo;felt precluded, while these courts of inquiry are sitting, from referring to them in any way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach took the matter further in the Seanad the next day. He opened by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not like to go into it in any detail for the same reason, that an inquiry is taking place.  The Government is, of course, responsible, and I wish to say that we share a feeling&mdash;perhaps it is too strong a word to use&mdash;of humiliation that such a thing should have happened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he talked about Lord Northcliffe's order to a motor driver whom he engaged.  Lord Northcliffe gave <Col N="2022" /> the driver full control, but he was told that if anything happened he would be sacked.  I was hoping that somebody would have noticed the expression on the faces of the two Ministers concerned when that phrase was used.  Lord Northcliffe would have sacked his driver if an accident happened, but the Taoiseach was humiliated about what happened. &ldquo;From time to time,&rdquo; the Taoiseach continued, &ldquo;these things have been done because simple routine was not followed regularly.  Suppose, for example, that you have two doors and put two men on them, and one man is to open one door and is responsible for the keys.&rdquo;  Remember, these words were spoken on the 4th January.  Those who heard what the Minister said to-night can form their own opinion as to whether there was anything premeditated about the statement of the Taoiseach on that occasion.  &ldquo;Suppose you had two doors,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and put two men on them and one man is to open one door and is responsible for the keys.  Having opened the door, he lets a man out and the moment the man leaves, he is to lock it; then the man may go to the other door and see who is there, and if the person who is there has a right to come in, he lets him in and then locks that door; that door is to be locked as soon as the man passes through.  You carry out that routine regularly, and ten men will hold the position against 1,000; you make a mistake and carelessly, through laziness, through want of appreciation of the value of the routine, you either have only one man instead of two, or one man is saving himself the trouble of locking the door after him, and leaves it open while he goes to open the other one, or any such mistake, and the whole thing is finished.&rdquo;  If that is not based on knowledge, and if it does not represent a judgment on facts that were then within the possession of the Government, then it is a very intelligent anticipation of what the Minister read here as being his judgment after he had received the evidence from the Court of Inquiry.</P>
    <P>Interrupted by a member of the Seanad on the point about the responsibility <Col N="2023" /> of the High Command, which the Senator said was the main point, the Taoiseach's reply was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to minimise it.  I think the more we realise that this was a most damaging thing, a most dangerous thing to have happened, the better for us all.  At the same time, I do not want people to take fright and to imagine that, because it did happen, everything is completely wrong and upside down in the Army.  I do not think it is at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was pointed out that that was not suggested.  Senator Dr. Rowlette intervened in this matter later and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach has, I must say, shown bad example.  He has told us that he and his Government take entire responsibility; that he will not shirk any responsibility.  The Minister for Justice last night went further. He said the responsibility might, if we liked, be put on the Minister for Defence.  To-night the Taoiseach has thought fit to throw the responsibility, in the first instance, on the subordinates furthest from the Minister for Defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from what occurred in this House and in the Seanad during those two days.  Dr. Rowlette continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be improper for us to discuss that, and I think it is unfortunate that he has taken a line which leads every one of us here to-night to the opinion that there was gross neglect of regulations, gross indiscipline, taking place in the Magazine Fort. I think that is unfortunate.  The one person responsible to the Oireachtas is the Minister for Defence, and nobody else.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 4th January a debate took place in the Seanad which was a continuation of the debate <Col N="2024" /> which took place in this House the day before, where the policy of the Government was made up of two things: to prevent any discussion of the Magazine raid and incidentally to suggest that, whoever was responsible, it certainly was not the Minister, but his subordinates. I might point out that, when that particular defence was closely questioned in the Seanad by Dr. Rowlette, the answer of the Taoiseach was that which I have just read.  The Taoiseach, interrupting, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If I may interrupt at this stage I should like to say that nothing was further from my mind.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an old trick&mdash;to inject a poison and then to complain when people say that it has been administered.  There is a withdrawal, or no attempt to explain the damage which has already been done by a statement which has been made.  The old practice was continued here.  The Taoiseach continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What I was trying to do was to give an illustration of how important it is to attend to routine, and the importance of instilling that could go back to me or to the Minister for Defence or to the Chief of the Army or anywhere else.  I have said again that we regard it as no excuse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is the whole excuse to-night.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We do not know exactly if that was the cause even, but when people are so anxious about the whole situation, I think it would be serious that anything of the kind should be said at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is about the general conduct on that night.  I intend to quote now from the speech of Dr. Rowlette on that occasion.  He made a point which was made here that, in any democratic country, the first thing which would have happened in the event of such an instance as occurred in the Phoenix Park, would be that the resignation of the Minister would go into the hands of the Chief of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the way the situation was left on the 3rd and 4th January last. It was a shameful thing, one which caused humiliation, and the cloud was <Col N="2025" /> so dark that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures could see no silver lining.  On the other hand, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures could well see that it would do a little good if the subordinates were taught a lesson, and the Taoiseach could see some value in it if the value of routine on the part of the subordinates was emphasised.  In the whole debate an attempt was made to prejudice, right from the start, even the court which was set up&mdash;to prejudice it against the subordinates.  Remember, right from the start, public notice was given, and given other than by speeches here, that the public generally regarded the people here as the people primarily responsible for what happened and the two men at the head of the Army as being the men responsible for what happened.</P>
    <P>There was a court of inquiry.  On the 21st February, Deputy MacEoin asked the Minister for Defence if it was proposed to publish the evidence. Right through the debate of the 3rd and 4th January, anyone could read&mdash; and nothing was made clearer than this&mdash;that there was a definite assurance that the Army inquiry would be reported upon and that the report would be placed before Deputies.  A question was put then and the Minister for Defence answered that it was not customary to publish the evidence and findings of military courts of inquiry. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not propose to depart from the normal procedure in this case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of cross-examination on that point, in the middle of which the Minister offered this statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court of inquiry has finished its work but the consideration of its findings has not yet been concluded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A little later, in column 1678 of the Official Debates of the 21st February, 1940, the Minister for Defence said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I might mention that the procedure followed in connection with all former courts of inquiry has been followed in this case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, as we know now&mdash;whether it <Col N="2026" /> was stated with the intention to deceive or not&mdash;was definitely false. That was a false statement made in this House&mdash;that &ldquo;the procedure followed in connection with all former courts of inquiry has been followed in this case.&rdquo;  We know to-night that the court which had been set up had to be re-convened for the purpose of saying why they had not followed the normal procedure.  When that was not known, and in answer to a question on the 21st February, the Minister for Defence committed himself to the statement that &ldquo;the procedure followed in connection with all former courts has been followed in this case.&rdquo; The Minister would have got away with that statement if the matter had been put aside.  It has been brought up again, with a result which is not creditable to the Minister.  On the 5th March, Deputy Norton asked the Minister for Defence whether the military officer who had been given notice of dismissal and the two officers who had been called upon to resign in connection with the raid had been tried by court martial or given an opportunity of defending themselves, and, if not, whether the Minister would say why they were denied the right of trial which they were willing to undergo, and whether he would arrange that such trial be afforded to them. The answer given was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The officers to whom the Deputy refers were not tried by court martial, but they were given a reasonable opportunity to make such representations as they thought proper in relation to their proposed dismissal or retirement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Magazine Fort raid has been the subject of prolonged investigation by a military court of inquiry, and the Government considers that, on the facts revealed, it is now for them to decide whether the officers involved are suitable for retention in the Forces.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was asked then when those particular representations had been made, and he replied: &ldquo;Last Thursday.&rdquo; It was pointed out then that on the Thursday referred to the officers had <Col N="2027" /> received notice of dismissal, so that, apparently, the findings of that court martial had been concluded on the Thursday, the officers had been given the opportunity to make representations on the Thursday, and the notice of dismissal had been served on them on the same day.  If the Minister worked as quickly in other matters as he did on that particular occasion, there would be but little complaint about the efficiency of his Department, or about his efficiency in connection with his Department.  He was asked later if he would reconsider the matter, so as to give the officers concerned an opportunity to defend themselves, and he said he would not.  Remember, right through the answer given to that question, there was no suggestion that these people, as was stated to-night, had been called in secondly before the court of inquiry, and that more or less the points of the evidence supposed to weigh against them had been picked out and gone over again, to see if they were given the opportunity to defend themselves, and to see if the procedure on the part of the Army were carried out in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>On 12th March I myself asked a question about two of those officers, and got the answer then that, apparently, the Government had decided was the best one to stick to in this mixed and confused situation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the urgent military situation created by the raid, and the large number of officers and men involved, or likely to be involved, in the inquiry, it was impracticable to relieve them all from duty for attendance throughout the inquiry.  Furthermore, it was essential that the Government should get at the facts as early as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Minister gives it as his opinion that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Had the court adopted any other procedure the delay would have been such as would have created justifiable public concern, and be highly pre-judical to the public service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister here has told us that an attempt was made to carry <Col N="2028" /> out the regulations in part by recalling the court, and having the evidence reviewed in the presence of the men whose position was jeopardised.  Not a word about that occurs in the answer to the question put on the 15th March; we were told that it was impracticable. I suppose that it is worth while examining this and giving particular attention to it here.</P>
    <P>There is a code with regard to the Army courts of inquiry based upon natural justice, as we know it, and as we are used to it here in all our social disputes, personal disputes, and in the courts.  If there is one thing which lies at the root of all proper administration of justice, it is that the person should know, first of all, that he is being charged with something; secondly, that he should know precisely with what he has been charged; and, thirdly, that he should be given an opportunity to confront those who charge him or those who are giving the evidence upon which the charge is based.  The ordinary way in which justice in a rough and ready way is administered in this country is that people are allowed to have those who give evidence against them subjected to a process of cross-examination, and that, ordinarily speaking, that cross-examination is conducted on oath.  I cannot imagine any situation in the courts in this country in which the courts would solemnly declare that the procedure of letting a man know the charges which were being made against him, and of giving him an opportunity to confront those who were making the charges, would be too cumbersome to be carried out in a particular instance, and that therefore the procedure should collapse, and that the courts should conduct the case almost in the absence of the accused.  But that is the excuse given here, on the 12th March for the first time, and repeated in the House to-night: that the procedure would be cumbersome.  The regulations do not allow for the setting aside of the regulations. They are made by an order issued and promulgated as Orders and Regulations Binding Courts of Inquiry. We have the situation revealed in this House that, after an inquiry was over, the court had to be reassembled and asked to record as part of its findings <Col N="2029" /> why they had not obeyed the regulations governing their own procedure. That is the lame excuse which is given in the House to-night.  I wonder&mdash;and I hope that we will be told&mdash;how many men were involved.  Supposing that the whole lot had to be brought in and given sufficient room and time to have the regulations carried out, what number of men were involved, and how many would have had to be released from duty in order to have justice done, and what would have happened if this particular crisis occurred at the time when these men were being demobilised?</P>
    <P>The Minister told us last September that we had a certain number of people standing to, and that a certain number of people had been mobilised.  Later on we were told that a number of them were being demobilised, or, at least, were in process of being removed. Could not that demobilisation have been halted in order to release these men for duty in such an emergency? What was the reaction on that occasion?  There was the question asked as to whether these men, now being demobilised, would ever again be used for the Army, although the result of the inquiry that was conducted in their absence might be that they would not be allowed to serve at all.  The Minister, on that occasion, told me&mdash;or, at least, when I asked him, he did not attempt to make any suggestion otherwise&mdash;that this putting of an officer on half-pay is not known as punishment.  There is such a thing as half-pay, but so far as I know there is no penal code in the Army that makes half-pay a punishment, and I suggest that the putting of an officer on half-pay as a punishment is a thing unknown to the Army code.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that, in regard to two officers, they have been put on a punishment that is unknown to the ordinary Army code, and that is not in accordance with any of the regulations and, in fact, a breach of the regulations, and this House is asked to accept that with the same complaisance that the Minister has shown with regard to the conduct of this inquiry for which we have asked.  It must be remembered that on the morning following <Col N="2030" /> the night of the 23rd December it was realised that the whole Government, and particularly two Ministers of the Government, were involved in what had taken place, and that what had happened was something that had embarrassed and made shamefaced the whole Government, and particularly the two Ministers concerned.  We hear that certain subordinates were alleged to be guilty of laxity, but what happened?  Certain charges were brought forward.  Charges were brought forward against, I think, four people, and I understand that the charge against one of them has been dropped.  However, that will be inquired into later.  I understand that charges were preferred against four privates and a corporal&mdash;in other words, the lowest ranks in the Army&mdash; and that there was to be a court of inquiry.</P>
    <P>When I first heard of that court of inquiry being about to be set up, I mentioned the matter in a debate here, and the Minister told us that we would be informed shortly as to the constitution of the court.  I then asked what would be the rank of those who were sitting on the court of inquiry, and also asked whether or not it would be reasonable to expect that people who were hoping to remain in the Army for the rest of their lives, sitting on such a court, would bring in any verdict that might be contrary to what Ministers would expect from them&mdash;particularly where this matter of rank was concerned.  I wonder whether or not these ranks were deliberately chosen to be a buffer between the Minister and people of higher rank and between the people of higher rank and lower rank. Was it necessary to introduce a sort of a buffer, such as the kind of people referred to by Senator Dr. Rowlette, in order to lessen the shock that might otherwise come when the corporal, the acting-corporal, and the four privates, were to be brought to a court martial, if men of much higher rank were also to be brought to court martial?  It seems that men of a higher rank are left out by the terms of reference, but the one and chief impact of this whole thing seems to be that those officers concerned would not report with <Col N="2031" /> regard to any rank higher than that of a colonel.  That, of course, left a rather welcome basis as between the people to be reported, of one rank or the other, and as between the Ministers. So it was that the Ministers were being criticised when the first impact of this court of inquiry occurred.  But it must be remembered that there is a gap between even the statement read out to-night by the Minister and the statements made by other people, who are not mentioned.  We go down to another rank in the Army, and we find that there are two or three people charged&mdash;the Minister has himself slid out of the matter&mdash;and then there is the court martial of two or three individuals, loyally-disposed so far as we know, against whom charges were brought, and who have been acquitted, and a charge brought against another individual which, we understand, has been dropped.</P>
    <P>If people are acquitted, then let them know forthwith that they are acquitted. Why should there be this discrimination between people, or between ranks?  Why, if an inquiry is to be set up, should there be this reluctance&mdash; and this definite reluctance&mdash;to bring these matters before the whole people, and allow these matters to be discussed before a properly-constituted parliamentary committee?  If such a committee were to be set up, it could question the things that have taken place, and could even question the policy of concealing matters that came out before the court martial.</P>
    <P>At the court martial, when it was dealing with the case of Corporal Andrew Dunne, a witness said that the position of the sentry would be that of standing in the light and looking into the darkness.  Who was responsible for that?  Has the Minister any duty of seeing what is the way in which sentries are placed on such an important place as the Fort?</P>

      <P>A witness in this case said that there were no regular Army members on duty that night.  In 1938, the accused&mdash;that is, Corporal Andrew Dunne, who has been found guilty&mdash;had done a month's annual training and three weeks on manoeuvres.  He was called up in September, 1939, and had not done much training since.  The sentry on duty at the No. 2 post was not 17 years of age. Who was responsible for there being no regular Army members in the Fort that night?  Who was responsible for these people, who had done a month's annual training and three weeks on <Col N="2033" /> manoeuvres, being put in charge of the Fort?  Was that anything in the nature of administration?  Had the Minister anything to do with it?  A sergeant-major, called for the defence of Henry Brady, who was acquitted, said that the first time he saw Volunteers on duty in the Fort was in September last when the guard was composed half of regular soldiers and half of Volunteers, and he said that 24 hours' continuous duty, followed by 48 hours off duty, must impose an abnormal strain on the men of the unit.  The accused himself, giving evidence, said he joined the Volunteers in 1939, did a month's training in Athlone, and was three weeks on manoeuvres; reported for duty on September 8th, and from then until October 4th he was in Longford learning how to slope arms.  That is the gentleman somebody put in charge of the Fort that night&mdash;a man who was, after four weeks' annual training and three weeks on manoeuvres, learning how to slope arms.  Who was responsible? Has the Minister anything to do with it?</P>
      <P>I suggest, Sir, that much that has been said indicates clearly that there is a duty on this House, and that duty is to agree to this resolution calling for an inquiry, and in the forefront the matter to be investigated is the extent to which this failure to defend the Magazine Fort is attributable to defects in the general administration of the defence forces.  This country owes a duty to the Army.  It is one of the things, if there is anything in this country, on which there ought to be a national policy, and that national policy should include two things: one is that the Army should know that it will be supported and that its code will be carried out, and the second is that if men enlist in the defence forces of this country and get into trouble, they will be tried in accordance with the conditions under which they were induced to enlist.  Both have been broken in connection with these men.</P>

      <P>I propose to address myself to this motion with your permission, Sir.  I hope that I may be permitted to continue without these attempts on the part of members of the Opposition to waste the time of the House.  I was saying that the speeches which have been made on this motion might make even the most sanguine of us despair of the future of this country.  When I first learned of this episode which is now under discussion, I will not conceal from the House, and I did not conceal from the House, that I took a very grave view of the situation.  I thought it was a portent, an indication that there were forces in existence here which might endanger, not merely the future of the State, but the future of our whole people.  I felt that it was a matter that warranted the most searching investigation, and the most serious consideration of the Government, and I said so.  I thought that even those who, by their opposition, often factiously expressed here, had made the task of the Government over a series of years much more difficult than it might have been, would have seen in this not an opportunity to try to make political capital out of a grave and serious event, but an opportunity when all Parties in the House might come and might take counsel together to see what were the best means to prevent a repetition of such an outrage, and what steps we might take to deal with the menace to the State which that occurrence showed to be in existence here.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that this was a matter which warranted our serious consideration.  I think it is a matter which ought to be approached with open minds.  It is a matter where we should have tried to divest ourselves of all idea of shabby partisanship. It is a matter to which we here, as the great council of the nation, ought to have addressed ourselves with the utmost sincerity of which we are capable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How has this motion been put to us here to-night?  First of all, the occurrence itself has been exaggerated, and exaggerated not in order to make people properly concerned about it, but rather to prejudice the Government in dealing with it.  Any time this occurrence has been referred to in the House, it has been referred to most extravagantly.  Deputy O'Higgins, as the Minister for Defence pointed out, went so far as to say that all our reserve stores of ammunition had been stolen.  The Minister, in order to substantiate the charge that this matter had been exaggerated&mdash; and exaggerated, as I have said, not in order to impress the gravity of the occurrence upon the House, but simply in order that the utmost political capital might be made out of it&mdash; pointed out that, so far from all our <Col N="2036" /> reserves of ammunition having been stolen, in fact the amount now missing was infinitesimal.  Deputy McGilligan twists that statement into this, that the Minister for Defence had endeavoured to defend himself and the Government&mdash;which is, of course, responsible for the Army&mdash;by saying that, after all, the thing did not matter because only 39 per cent. of our reserve had been taken.  Whether it was 39, or even a smaller fraction than that, of our store, I should still regard the incident as one which warranted our most serious attention, and that, as the Minister for Defence has told us, is the attitude of the Government.</P>
    <P>Again, take the speech which Deputy O'Higgins made here this evening.  In moving his motion, he said&mdash;and it is merely the straw which shows the mentality which the Opposition have expressed in their speeches&mdash;that this incident had occurred over six months ago and that, during that period, the Government had endeavoured to burke discussion.  The fact of the matter is that it is just over four months since the incident occurred, that the House has had very long adjournments in the interval and that on occasions when we were ready to take this motion, members of the Opposition were not prepared to speak on it.</P>

      <P>What is the next weapon?  Blatant misrepresentation of the position in which the Minister for Defence stands in relation to the Army.  The case for the motion has been based upon a most extraordinary principle.  We have heard from Deputy O'Higgins, and we had it repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by Deputy McGilligan, that the Minister for Defence has been guilty of victimising his subordinates.  I do not think the Minister for Defence wears even a lance-corporal's stripe, let alone a general's epaulettes.  He is not in command of the Army.  He is a civilian like the rest of us in this House, and there is no member of the Army who is subordinate to any one of us.  He is here to serve the State, and the whole basis of this attack has been that the Minister for Defence was, in some way, a generalissimo who was singling out for punishment subordinate members of a corps of which he was the head.</P>

It was &ldquo;subordinates&rdquo; all the time; that was the word dragged in in order again that this matter might be misrepresented, and that they might create a demand outside for a political victim, and not for an investigation.  A victim for sacrifice is what the Opposition want, and not a fair investigation into this matter at all.  A fair investigation into this episode has already been made, but it is not to act on the result of that investigation, it is not to improve the discipline of the Army, it is not to ensure that steps will be taken to prevent a recurrence of the incident that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy O'Higgins want, but merely a scapegoat out of <Col N="2039" /> whom they can make political capital.

      <P>Take the absurd statement made by Deputy McGilligan. He read an extract from a newspaper account of the trial.  There it was disclosed that, apparently because of the manner in which the door was lighted &mdash;and it is difficult to see how it could be lighted in any way other than by having, as I assume there is and was, a light over the door&mdash;whoever happened to be at the door and to be <Col N="2040" /> between that light and the outer gate would have been illuminated, and, of course, the person standing beyond the outer gate would have been in darkness.  Deputy McGilligan said: &ldquo;Was not the Minister for Defence responsible for that?&rdquo;  Leaving that, he went on to talk about the boy of 16 or 17 who happened to be posted on guard that night.  Does Deputy McGilligan imply that it is part of the Ministerial duty to go around and inspect every barracks and every light in every barracks to see that, for the purpose of defence, that each particular light is properly positioned and that each particular post is properly illuminated; or is he to go along and ask every private in the Army what his age is; or is he to go around and see every commanding officer and say to him that such privates or other men in his personnel are to be placed at such and such posts?  Is not that the full implication of everything Deputy McGilligan said here, that it is the personal responsibility of the Minister for Defence to be the O.C. of the Army?</P>
      <P>The fact is, of course, that the Army is divided into separate commands, and the head of each command is the particular individual who is responsible for the management of the personnel entrusted to him.  It is his duty to see that the job is done properly, and to ensure that persons who are not fitted to be posted on guard duty will not be posted on guard duty. The individual who is responsible is supposed to be sufficiently versed in the arts of war and in his profession as a soldier to know whether or not a sentry upon any particular post is placed more or less in danger because of arrangements which may be made for lighting that post.  How is the Minister for Defence to be held responsible for that sort of thing?  And yet that is the basis upon which Deputy McGilligan's charge was laid against the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence is an ordinary civilian holding responsibility to this House for the general administration of the Army, but not for a particular episode like the one under discussion, <Col N="2041" /> which is, of course, the concern of the Army and those who are the responsible officers in the Army. Do not those of us who are familiar with the history of the past 18 years know that, in fact, the whole of the Army Act has been so devised as to make it quite certain that, in relation to executive command, the Minister for Defence has got very little to do, and that position&mdash;let not the Opposition forget it&mdash;was brought about here as the result of a commission which found that the Minister for Defence had much too much to do with the ordinary management of the Army?</P>
    <P>If there are defects in the relationship which exists between the Minister for Defence and the Army, if the Minister for one reason or another is thought not to be in a position sufficiently to influence the manner in which the commanding officers of the Army do their duty, that is traceable more than anything else to the Act which was passed here after the 1924 mutiny.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has said is a reflection on the Chair.  Take the other case that was made; take the other ground upon which this motion has been based.  One of the facts which emerged from the statement made by the Minister for Defence is that a court of inquiry was established to inquire into the circumstances and to ascertain exactly and precisely what happened on that night.  This court of inquiry, consisting of senior officers of the Army, reported to the Minister that certain things which ought to have been done on that night, certain precautions which should have been taken and certain steps which should have been taken were, in fact, neglected or were not taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The court of inquiry arrived at certain findings, and disciplinary action was taken against a number of officers.  In addition a number of men who were concerned with the incidents which led up to the invasion of the Fort and the seizure of the ammunition were tried by court martial and two of them were acquitted.  Why were they acquitted? They were acquitted because the court took the view that, in fact, those men had not been properly posted on guard that night; and that those men had not had read out to them the orders for the defence of the fort.  Whose responsibility was that?  That responsibility lay with one of the officers, with the commander of the fort, in connection with whom, as the Minister for Defence has stated here, it is proposed that the Government should advise the President to take certain action; in other words, to dismiss him from the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about sentry No. 1 and the military policeman.  He said that they were acquitted and one other man was found guilty by court martial.  They were acquitted on the ground that the officer in charge of the Fort had not done his duty in ensuring that these mon were properly posted and that they were properly charged with their duties upon that night and, of course, as the investigation disclosed, upon nights preceding that.</P>
      <P>Let me get back to another point. It has been charged here that the real gravamen of the attack which has been levelled against the Minister for Defence and the Government is that this court of inquiry was not a fair court. Suggestions have been made that the regulations have not been complied with.  It was said that men were put on trial, and they were given no opportunity to defend themselves.  That is a complete misrepresentation, even of the functions of the court of inquiry. The functions of the court of inquiry were not to try men in respect of charges, but to find facts, so that the Minister for Defence might act upon the facts as this court of inquiry ascertained them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence was fully entitled to act without further ado upon the facts when they had been ascertained by an impartial and equitable tribunal for this reason: It is upon the advice and recommendation of the Government that every officer in the Army holds his commission.  The Government has in respect of every officer holding a commission in the Forces of this State to take upon itself the responsibility of advising the President to grant that commission.  If as a result of the facts that are brought to its notice by the member of the Government who is specifically charged with that obligation, the Government finds that an officer because of a charge of negligence proved against him, or for some other reason, is no longer worthy to hold his commission, then the Government is perfectly entitled to advise the President to withdraw that commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> What happened in this case? A court of inquiry was set up to ascertain facts.  Of whom did the court consist?  Of the comrades and brother officers of the officers concerned, men who served with them during 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923, and who have served with them ever since; men who were the comrades of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy.  And it is their honour that is impugned here in this House.  The charge that is being made here is that the Minister for Defence did play on the fears of these officers, or the hopes of these officers &mdash;that on the one hand they would be victimised, or on the other that they would be rewarded, if they set themselves to find scapegoats who would save the faces of the Minister for Defence and the members of the Government.  That is the charge made here to-night by Deputy McGilligan, that these men did, in fact, become the slayers of their own brothers in order that they might curry favour with the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise the point that the Court of Inquiry was set up to ascertain facts, and that if anything arose from the findings, action might be taken against those who were responsible.  The court made such a report to the Minister for Defence that he was compelled, in order that the indiscipline and laxity which was exhibited on that night might not again occur, to take action which, if it erred at all, erred on the side of mercy.  Now, Sir, I cannot understand the attitude and the inconsistency with which the Opposition approached this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said at the beginning that a grave and serious disaster has occurred, affecting the Army; that in other countries, when such a grave and serious disaster has occurred, a Parliamentary inquiry is at once held.  He said that this was the gravest disaster that had overtaken the forces of this country.  Now, in the same speech in which he used these words, he talks about these officers in regard to whom the court of inquiry which was constituted, and constituted not, mind you, of civil servants, not outsiders, not political supporters of the Minister for Defence, but a court of inquiry constituted of officers of proved service, of high rank&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would have been much shorter if Deputy Mulcahy had not interrupted.  I have pointed out that Deputy O'Higgins held that this was the gravest disaster that has overtaken us since 1922, but that when the court of inquiry find who was responsible for these occurrences, and when the Minister for Defence has to act upon their findings, then Deputy O'Higgins comes along here and talks about the officers responsible for this occurrence as if they were knights in shining armour without reproach, long-serving, unselfish, zealous, patriotic officers.  At the end of his speech I thought he was about to suggest that we ought to form some order of merit in this country, and that those officers who were concerned in this raid should be suitably decorated by the House.</P>

      <P>Early in January, referring to this occurrence, the Taoiseach spoke of it as a disgraceful humiliation under which the country was reeling.  That was the result of the raid on the Magazine Fort.  Tomorrow any man with a sense of decency can refer to the disgraceful humiliation piled on this country by the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  You have a Minister in an Irish Parliament, greedy of time, anxious for more time in order to pour buckets of mud on the men who wore Ireland's uniform, trying to absorb the last minutes of the debate in implying to the Deputies and to the public outside that the court of inquiry had found certain officers guilty of culpability, or negligence, or anything else, in connection with the raid on the Magazine Fort.  But the findings and the evidence and the whole procedure of the court of inquiry has been kept secret and suppressed. <Col N="2047" /> If the Minister were uttering truths, why not circulate that report of the court of inquiry and satisfy us that there was evidence against any officer?  The result of the whole thing is that it was a secret inquiry; that no findings were published, and that no charge was made against any officer.  The whole hysteria of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-night was pointing the finger at others so as to keep attention away from his own Benches.  This was a despicable, discreditable attempt to slander and belittle the names of decent men who wore a clean uniform long before he came in with his belated attempts to tarnish that uniform. The officers of the Army, our comrades in the past, are honourable men. If the Minister can find one of these officers guilty in any way in connection with what happened on the 23rd December last, why suppress the report? I asked the Minister for Defence had any charge been made against any officer, and he refused to answer my question.  I ask the head of the Government now to say if any charge has been made against any officer except the charges made solely by the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>

One of them read out a whole litany of suggestions against different soldiers and different officers.  Any person not familiar with what happened in the last few months, and listening to the Minister for Defence, would believe that there was a clear case of guilt against three or four N.C.O.s and men, and four or five officers.  We find that three of them were placed on trial, and that two of them&mdash;of the N.C.O.s and men&mdash;were found not guilty.  We find that no officer was placed on trial, that no charge was made against any officer, but that four or five of them were found guilty.  Officers were found guilty in the absence of evidence, in the absence of charge, in the absence of trial, and the findings, suggestions and recommendations of the court of inquiry are suppressed.  Why?  I say that the findings of the court of inquiry were suppressed because the findings of the court of inquiry pointed higher up than to any man in uniform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main object of the Bill is to provide for the establishment and maintenance of hospital bureaus for the purpose of facilitating the admission to hospitals of persons who require hospital treatment.  The Bill is of general application, but it may be assumed that the establishment of a hospital bureau will be confined to Dublin where the public voluntary hospitals provide general and special treatment.  The provision of a hospital bureau for the Dublin centre first arose when the hospitalisation scheme recommended by the Hospitals Commission was under consideration.  That scheme contemplates provision for the treatment of poor persons in four major general hospitals with an increase of approximately 600 beds.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the establishment of a bureau for that purpose were fully discussed with the representatives of the hospitals.  Agreement was reached in regard to the functions and duties of the bureau and the management thereof.  The representatives of the hospitals considered that it would not function in advance of the additional accommodation which would be necessary in the four hospitals for the treatment of poor persons.</P>
      <P>It was intended that the bureau then contemplated would be under the control of a body composed of representatives of the hospitals and of certain local bodies in the City and County of Dublin.  As the bed complement of the voluntary hospitals would not permit of hospital treatment for the large number of poor persons who receive hospital treatment in St. Kevin's Hospital, which is under the control of the Dublin Board of Assistance, it is not considered expedient at present to establish a bureau controlled by representatives of the voluntary hospitals and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally agreed that difficulties are encountered by the medical profession in Dublin in getting hospital treatment for some emergency or acute cases.  A hospital bureau would serve a very useful purpose if it helped to facilitate the admission of such cases. Its activities should operate to the <Col N="2053" /> mutual advantage of the voluntary hospitals, the medical profession and people requiring hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>A good deal of consideration has been given to the form which a hospital bureau should take.  It might have been desirable to locate it in one of the large voluntary hospitals but there is scarcely sufficient co-operation on matters affecting hospital management amongst the hospitals in Dublin to warrant such a course.  The course suggested in the Bill was decided upon as being the most likely to afford the facilities in connection with admissions to hospitals that are so necessary at present and at the same time involve little additional annual expenditure.</P>
    <P>A considerable proportion of the patients in the Dublin general hospitals for years past has received free treatment.  The Bill does not propose to interfere in any way with the manner of admission of free patients to these hospitals.  It is evident, however, that there are many persons who are in urgent need of treatment in a hospital who cannot secure admission under present conditions, and have to rely upon medical care given under unsuitable conditions in the home.  In such cases it is hoped a hospital bureau will be an advantage.</P>
    <P>I need not enter at this stage into the detailed working of a hospital bureau.  The present arrangement is in the nature of an experiment and its success will depend largely on the co-operation afforded by the representatives of the voluntary hospitals.  Regulations governing the administration of a bureau will be made in pursuance of Section 2 of the Bill after consultation with the Advisory Committee. Hospital bureaus are in operation in a few large centres of population in other countries where the voluntary hospitals provide the main hospital service for the public, and have proved to be advantageous for the hospitals and for patients as well as the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill makes provision for the investigation of complaints arising out of the refusal to admit persons on whose behalf arrangements for hospital treatment have been made <Col N="2054" /> by the hospitals bureau, or on the ground that treatment was unreasonably delayed.  It is not expected that such complaints will often arise, but the powers conferred are regarded as essential in the public interest, and they will, it is believed, moreover prove to be a useful protection of the voluntary hospitals.  Such a measure of general supervision as is contemplated need not, and is not intended to, interfere with the ordinary rights of the hospitals to control their internal management.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter of importance which is concerned with the extension of the exercise of powers of inspection of hospitals and the furnishing of information bearing on their financial position.  The Public Hospitals Act, 1933, gave certain powers in this respect to the Hospitals Commission, but during the consideration of that Bill it was never contemplated that there would be made such heavy demands on the Hospitals Trust Fund as have been made by the voluntary hospitals to meet expenditure in excess of income in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>As the extent of the hospital deficits still continues to show an upward trend, the present position must be regarded as serious.  There should, therefore, be close co-operation between the voluntary hospitals and the Hospitals Commission in matter affecting the internal economy of the hospitals.  As regards the position of the Minister in relation to voluntary hospitals, the Act of 1933 imposes definite obligations on him with the object of securing that grants are properly applied. The exercise of such powers by the Minister is distinct from the duties to be discharged under the Act by the Hospitals Commission, and the experience gained since the passing of the Act of 1933 shows that it is necessary to have the powers sought in Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to amend Section 12 of the Act of 1933 which governs the application of the proportion of the proceeds of the sale of tickets in a sweepstake towards meeting expenses of promoting the sweepstake.  In present <Col N="2055" /> conditions it must be assumed that any future sweepstakes would not receive support outside the country to the extent that has prevailed in the past.  In that event a specified proportion of the proceeds which would be payable to the promoter would be difficult to determine.  It has accordingly been decided to remove the limit of 7 per centum in the Act of 1933, and to rely upon the maximum percentage of 30 per centum of the proceeds of the sale of tickets in a sweepstake which can be made applicable to meeting expenses generally, other than tickets, commissions, prizes, or other remuneration given in relation to the sale of tickets.  There will be power to fix a lesser percentage if the Minister for Justice so decides.</P>
    <P>There is also an amendment of the Act passed here last year, that made provision for a reserve fund to be built up.  That reserve fund was created for the purpose of meeting the emergency, and it is not considered that it will apply any longer.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I do not think it is necessary to make any case for the setting up of the hospital bureau. That necessity is admitted on all sides. The Hospitals Commission in their reports from time to time have stressed the necessity for such a bureau.  We had petitions from social organisations in the city, stressing the necessity for a bureau, and recently some reference was made to it at an inquest, by the coroner, when he hoped that such a thing could not happen if there was such an organisation there as the bureau.  This is intended as a temporary arrangement.  At the time the agreement was arrived at between the four principal voluntary hospitals in the city, it was believed that such a bureau as we had in mind could not operate until the increased beds were provided.  I admit that the Bill in its provisions is rather wide, and on the Committee Stage we can get it down to narrower limits, and to more specified terms.  It was also brought to my notice that the retrospective provisions in this Bill do not give the hospitals the opportunity, so to speak, to contract out.  That may be a fair <Col N="2056" /> position to put forward, and I am quite prepared to concede that, so far as the retrospective provisions in the Bill are concerned, they can be changed on the Committee Stage, to give the hospitals the opportunity of saying whether or not they will come into the bureau system.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the regulations that may be made by the Minister under the Bill.  I do not know if it will be possible on the Committee Stage to set out anything like the exact regulations that are in mind, but it may be possible to give some general indication of the lines these regulations are to follow.  However, the regulations will be made after consultation with the Advisory Committee.  If the words &ldquo;impose duties&rdquo; in Section 2 are considered as some sort of dictation, we can get some other words and set forth what they should be.</P>
    <P>In Section 3 it is not intended that the Minister shall appoint representatives of the hospitals without consultation with anyone.  What is intended is, that representatives of the general and special hospitals in the city should be appointed by their own organisations, and by their own hospitals and approved by the Minister.  If there is any doubt about that I am quite prepared on the Committee Stage, to make it perfectly clear that the hospitals themselves shall appoint their representatives and submit them for approval.  This provision has been construed in some way as an attempt to interfere with the internal organisation of the hospitals in such a way that the Minister will appoint representatives of the hospitals over the heads of the hospitals authorities.  That is not the intention.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4, which deals with complaints, the intention, which can be made clear on Committee Stage, is that if a complaint be made to the Minister he will refer it to the Hospitals Commission in charge of the bureau.  The Hospitals Commission will consult with the advisory committee of the bureau.  In the ordinary way, the complaint would be dealt with in this manner.  If the case were one of gross seriousness, the Hospitals Commission could refer it to the Minister <Col N="2057" /> for the purpose of holding an inquiry, as contemplated by the section. That, again, can be changed to allow the complaints to be made to the Hospitals Commission in the first instance.  As it is, if they come through the Minister, he will refer them to the Hospitals Commission. The Hospitals Commission will have to consult with the advisory committee, representing the hospitals, and, if they are satisfied that the complaint is of a serious character, it can be referred to the Minister for the holding of an inquiry, if he considers this course necessary.  As I have indicated, those cases will, probably, be very rare indeed. I should have mentioned that the regulations will be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>I know I shall be asked why this arrangement was not got by consultation with the hospital authorities.  The setting up of this bureau has been pressed forward as a very urgent matter.  My predecessor succeeded in two years in getting agreement with four voluntary hospitals regarding some form of bureau.  If I set out to secure agreement with the 27 institutions with which I should have to deal, and if it took my predecessor two years to secure agreement with four voluntary hospitals, how long it would take me is a simple matter of proportion, though it might not apply in that way.</P>

      <P>Certain agreements have, from time to time, to be brought about between the hospitals and the Department.  I assume that the hospitals are standing on their rights, or what they conceive to be their rights, but I know that, in the case of one particular hospital, I have been striving since I went into the Department to secure agreement, and I have not been able to secure it.  I am as far away from it now as I ever was.  The agreement I sought was quite acceptable to the other hospitals.  It may be said that these moneys are not the moneys of the taxpayers.  They were originally State-sanctioned moneys and, <Col N="2058" /> under the Act of 1933, certain duties were imposed on the Minister in order to protect the interests of the poor and facilitate their medical treatment.  I am not setting out here to attack any hospital.  They have done admirable work and are doing admirable work, and the intention is to have as little interference on the part of the Department with them as possible.  Whatever powers have been taken in this Bill relate to duties imposed upon me, and are considered necessary.  I think that the hospitals have nothing to fear from these powers.  I have seen a number of letters in the Press, and the writers seemed to be under the impression that much wider powers were being taken than it is the intention to take in this Bill.  I believe that, when the Bill becomes law and when this organisation is set up, it will be more a protection to the hospitals against frivolous complaints than anything else. It will protect the hospitals against unfounded and frivolous charges. There is no desire to interfere with the hospitals more than is considered absolutely necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Minister's statement might be regarded as a fair statement, but we have to consider it in relation to the provisions of the Bill.  Scarcely any measure introduced in this House in recent years has given rise to so much misgiving and so much regret&mdash;I shall not say condemnation, though that may have been expressed&mdash;as this Bill. Reading the Bill carefully, one comes to the conclusion that if only small powers are required and are to be exercised, it would have been difficult to put the provisions in a more exhaustive form than they are set out in this Bill.  The Minister relieves the mind of the Dáil to some extent regarding the respect due to contracts by saying that the retrospective clauses of the Bill are not going to be imposed. I should have preferred the Minister to say that an agreement once entered into would not be altered eight or ten years afterwards by an Act of this Legislature without the consent of both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section 1 of the first section <Col N="2059" /> of the Bill there is a clause which would bring in a hospital in the City of Dublin getting a subscription from a local authority.  I have no authority to speak on behalf of that hospital, nor have I been asked to do so.  I understand, however, that there is one hospital in the city which does not participate in the Sweepstakes, and does not intend to do so.  Surely, it is not the Minister's intention to bring that hospital within the scope of his examination, or that of the Hospitals Commission.  The Minister probably intended to mention that, but he omitted to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Section 1 is concerned, no outstanding matter falls to be settled if these two matters receive attention.  I now come to what the Minister calls the principal section of the measure.  What the operative section of the Bill is depends very much on the standpoint from which one regards the Bill.  Taking this particular section, the Minister mentioned that it had taken his predecessor two years to get accommodation with the four voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin.  If my recollection is correct that agreement was entered into in 1938.  It may have taken two years to get it, but it has not been put into operation yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, if ever there was a case in which the active and cordial co-operation of the bodies concerned is required it is in this case?  Looking over the history of this city and county, for a lifetime, it will be seen that there has been no addition to the bed accommodation of the hospitals during that period.  I think the Minister would require a microscope to find a vacant bed in any one of these hospitals. However, during that period the population of the city has increased. It has practically doubled while the bed accommodation of the hospitals remains the same as it was 40 or 50 years ago.  We are seeking now to find out where the vacant beds are in the hospitals.  It is seven years since <Col N="2060" /> the 1933 Bill was passed.  If we were in a critical frame of mind we could say: &ldquo;Well, the contribution of the Ministry towards providing extra beds has not been distinguished by any great success during those seven years.&rdquo;  If, however, this bureau is to be a success, it requires the active and cordial co-operation of the hospitals. To my mind, a condition necessary to secure that end would be that whatever body would be set up would be the principal body in connection with this business.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should amend the Bill so as to let the committee of management be the bureau. Let the committee make its own regulations subject to the concurrence or approval of the Minister.  Put the responsibility, as far as possible, on those who are finding the accommodation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should have prefaced my remarks on this measure by saying that there is a difference of opinion between the Minister and, I think, most Deputies on this side of the House regarding policy in this matter. The Minister wants to have inspection and control, to some extent at any rate, of hospital accommodation in the country.  Our view, for what it is worth, is that it would be better to leave that in the hands of those who have been accustomed to the manage ment and control of hospitals for a long period of years and without whom hospital accommodation in this country would have been very meagre.  It was they, or their predecessors in title, who provided whatever accommodation or treatment there is.  This system has worked, I am glad to hear the Minister say, in a satisfactory manner for a long period.  Unfortunately, by reason of the change in the value of money it was impossible to continue that system without some help, and the Legislature agreed to afford means of help to those hospitals. To our mind, it would have been better if they had been given an opportunity of doing it.  Certainly it would appear from what the Minister said that these seven, eight or ten years have not been distinguished by any big advance in the accommodation that is available.  We appear now to <Col N="2061" /> be concerning ourselves more with the regulation of what there is than with the major problem of increasing accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is an uneasy feeling that this measure, in respect to Sections 2 and 3, divorces the hospitals from the control they exercised and the administration they practised during that long period.  Section 3, to my mind, is about as ambiguous a section as it would be possible to introduce into a Bill.  The Minister, in the course of his statement, said that it was the intention to allow hospitals to select the personnel of the advisory committee. Would the Minister consider, in that connection, that while he takes steps to ensure that whatever duties devolve upon him are implemented in the legislation, the duties or obligations he imposes upon others are of much less dynamic character?  They are advisory.  After all, they are to be the people who will work the Bill. The more help one would give them in carrying out their duties, the more authority one would give them, the less need for examining how they will do their work.  In this case, surely the Minister had not in mind the possibility that he has got to examine the names of each of the persons nominated by each of the hospitals, approve of six, and send back three and say: &ldquo;Let us have other nominations in respect of them&rdquo;? Surely that is not his intention?  When he says, &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister,&rdquo; he surely means that the approval will come as a matter of course?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be unfortunate if objection were taken to any of the names submitted.  Whatever may be said in respect to the medical profession, I think there is a certain <i>esprit de corps</i> amongst the <Col N="2062" /> members of the profession.  In all professions there is an <i>esprit de corps</i>, but in no profession will it be found to exist to such a high degree as in the medical profession.  If doctors or even members of the board of management were nominated, I think it would be a mistake to have any power in the hands of the Minister to reject that nomination.  Assuming that the Minister was going to operate the section in the case of the City of Dublin, and that each of the clinical hospitals is to have a nomination, there would be nine or ten nominations coming from them, together with probably three from the maternity hospitals and three from the children's hospitals. That would be 15 in all.  If the Minister were to nominate five, there would be a total of 20&mdash;a very large committee&mdash;one would say, almost too large.  We would have no objection, ordinarily speaking, to the Minister putting in five of his own nominations, but somebody ought to consider whether it is advisable, even if they take the power to add five, that he should add them at all, and whether he would not put the responsibility entirely on the representatives of the hospitals to find the means of getting the information required and of operating to the satisfaction of everybody.</P>
      <P>There is a clause there in sub-section (3) of Section 3 in which the term of office of the members of the committee appointed under the section may be reviewed.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may revoke at any time the appointment of such committee or any member thereof, or alter the constitution of such a committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that, taking the long view, a situation might happen in which such a power would be required.  I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to have more confidence in the committee at the start and not press that particular power.  Much depends upon the <i>bona fides</i> of everybody in connection with this matter.  We have evidence of the <i>bona fides</i> of these boards of hospital management&mdash; governing bodies, or the bodies that are covered by that particular term. After all it is they who have, with <Col N="2063" /> their surgical and medical efforts, been able to provide whatever accommodation we have had and which the people have enjoyed and which the hospitals generally, from the modest employee to the most distinguished surgeon or physician, have always taken pleasure in being able to give to help the sick poor.</P>
    <P>Section 4, as it is drawn, is an objectionable section, and the impression that has grown generally through the various persons or bodies who have considered it is that there is a desire on the part of the Department here to place these hospitals in the same position as the hospitals administered under the Minister's Department under the Medical Charities Act.  My own impression is that that is not the intention, but we are not concerned here with the intention so much as with the words before us, as these are going to stand after we have passed away.  As that section stands, one would come to the conclusion that the Minister will sit in his office awaiting the receipt of complaints and that he will make up his mind about having sworn inquiries into all the complaints one after another.  It would be well to have that section considered in the light of the responsibility that is going to be placed on the advisory committee which will be responsible for the bureau.  That committee, in my opinion, ought to hear the complaint in the first instance and ought to investigate it.  If it is satisfied that a cause for complaint does lie&mdash;presumably the cause of complaint would not be a single individual one, or the committee would be kept busy&mdash;there would be no objection on the part of any hospital to having a matter of that sort investigated. As the section is drawn now, however, there is scarcely a governing body in Dublin which would not be under the impression that any cause of complaint is likely to occasion a sworn inquiry.</P>
    <P>Going along down the section, one finds in sub-section (4):&mdash;</P>
    <P>If any person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  being duly summoned to attend as a witness at an inquiry <Col N="2064" /> under this section, fails to attend, or,</P>
    <P>(b)  being in attendance as a witness at such inquiry, refuses to take an oath, produce a document, or answer a question where required so to do by the holder of such inquiry,</P>
    <P>such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds.</P>
    <P>I wonder if that is necessary at all. Under another Act that the Minister has introduced here in connection with the Saint Laurence O'Toole Hospital, we have provision for the holding of an inquiry into the value of land and in that case there is no penalty for not answering, nor is it contemplated that there would be a refusal to answer.  No matter how generously one might view it, there is implied in this section a suspicion on the part of the Department that complaints will be made and that action must be taken in connection with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the power of the purse in these cases.  Although he has that power, even that must be exercised with some restraint.  After all, if he withholds money from a hospital, it is those who are going to take advantage of whatever treatment and accommodation is provided who will ultimately be the sufferers.  One is faced, then, with the problem as to whether it is likely that there should be such contumacy on the part of those who would attend an inquiry of that sort, and as to whether they would be so objectionable or difficult.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 5, it should not be in the measure at all.  If the Minister were to come in and say that it was necessary, and necessary in a hurry, there would be no objection. One would imagine that Section 5 would have been placed either at the beginning or at the end, but it has been sandwiched in between the bureau on the one hand, and the power the Minister is going to take for himself on the other hand.  It looks as if it should be after that.  I am sure that such an able man as the Minister&mdash;and I will pay him the compliment of saying that there is no more able member <Col N="2065" /> of the Government than he&mdash;would agree that it is inconceivable that it should be sandwiched.  It is quite true that the Act of 1933 put certain disadvantages on the Minister.  The Minister took these duties on, and it has taken seven years to discover that he has no means of carrying them out.  Although there is a Hospitals Commission, empowered and authorised to do certain things, they have not done them.  I put it to the Minister as a business proposition that, so far as these hospitals are concerned, they have two masters&mdash;the Hospitals Commission on the one hand, and the Minister on the other hand&mdash;and that that is an unsatisfactory procedure.  It ought to be either one or the other.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be an easy way out for himself if he divested himself of the duties that he so lightly imposed on himself seven years ago. He should leave them to the Hospitals Commission, and let him have a body which will be empowered under the Act to do its duties.  Its personnel, and so on, can be arranged.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which should not be received nor dealt with in this House in a controversial spirit.  Unfortunately, as drawn, it has excited the suspicions of very large numbers of people.  It is a Bill which is regarded with suspicion by practically everybody who has had any experience of hospitals management, or of duties in a hospital, or of anything of that sort. That is an unfortunate beginning.  It would be a matter of very great satisfaction to all those who have so well served the public in this country for so long, that a situation of this kind be resolved with good will and good faith and that there should not linger in anybody's mind the impression that, year after year, an effort is being made to bring more and more under control a big organisation such as that.</P>
    <P>Examining it from the point of view of what is at the disposal of the Minister and his Department, surely we must admit that if this Bill were to be carried out from its beginning to its end in accordance with the tone that distinguishes the measure and the tone that distinguishes the potential father of this measure&mdash;that is the Act of <Col N="2066" /> 1933&mdash;the Minister would require to set up a far bigger section to do that sort of work.  That is not the intention, I am sure, but as the matter stands there is a possibility that, sooner or later, it may happen.  I think that, at any rate, something should be done in this direction if any more satisfactory results are to be achieved than have been achieved up to this.  If there is one thing to which people object, I think it is this business of too much examination, too much inspection, too much investigation, and all that sort of thing.  I can imagine these hospitals being examined, inspected, and so on, by officials, just when very important work was in hand, and I can quite imagine how unreasonable it would be to expect these people to answer such questions in the midst of such important work.  I think that if that section is put in, every member of this House would get at least five or six complaints of one kind or another every day, or at least every week, from various people who have some cause of complaint, or think they have a cause of complaint, about these hospitals. Surely, in view of what the Minister told us in his opening statement, to the effect that it is not intended to put this thing through in its present form, he is setting up difficulties for himself and for his successors, as well as for his Department and the administration of his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, in the course of his statement, that he had had difficulties with regard to one hospital.  Well, in my experience of over 20 years, I can say that there is hardly a Department of State with which I did not have difficulties, and very great difficulties&mdash;both in and out of office.  Naturally, in any such case there would be difficulties, and in this connection there are very great difficulties, one of which, and perhaps the greatest of which, is brought about, I think, by the fact that the hospitals concerned have not been able to balance their accounts, and since they have not been able to balance their accounts, have not been able to bring their equipment up to the standard to which they would like <Col N="2067" /> to bring it.  Is it not inevitable, therefore, in the circumstances, that those deficits of which the Minister complained&mdash;arising from the Minister's and his predecessor's apprehension as to the rising cost&mdash;would be gradually rising even as the costs rise?  It might be said that certain economies could be arrived at.  That would be all right if economies could be achieved, but I think that I might be permitted to say that if any economies were to be achieved, they should be achieved in the case of the Ministry itself.</P>
    <P>It is certainly not to be wondered at that with rising prices of equipment and with equipment not being at all up to the proper standard, the balance sheets of the hospitals concerned should not have been right.  On that point, also, we have never had any statement from the Minister as to the policy of the Government in this connection. One might almost sense an objection on the part of those responsible for distributing this, as to saying whether the Ministry or the Hospitals' Commission is responsible for the spending of this money.  Whether or not the information we get is entirely different from that which the Minister and his Department get, I think it must be admitted that the cost of the equipment of these hospitals has increased, and also that there is a greater variety of such equipment necessary.</P>
    <P>Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see a measure of this sort receiving the unanimous support of a House such as this.  It is rather unfortunate that there should be a difference of opinion as to the matter of the administration of hospitals generally.  Our view is that the more these hospitals are kept in a voluntary or self-supporting and autonomous position, the better.  The other Bill that we had&mdash;although this is a successor of the Bill of 1856&mdash;showed a desire on the part of the Ministry to get and to keep control, but control of this kind is going to mean practically 25 per cent. of an increase in the cost of local government, without increasing in any way the efficiency or <Col N="2068" /> usefulness of the hospitals.  I suggest to the Minister an entire recasting of Sections 2 and 3, and an alteration of Section 4, which would make it less objectionable than it is in its present form.  I should also suggest that, in so far as Section 6 is concerned, the Minister should reconsider the proposal there with regard to hospitals, and that the major responsibility should be put, in the case of any obstruction or interference, on the hospital immediately concerned.  I think that the Minister should reconsider his view in regard to the regulations, to the effect that they should be made subject to his concurrence, and I think that the Minister would have the cordial co-operation of the hospitals and their staffs in the working out of this problem, difficult as it is, if he would give attention to these particular points that I have mentioned.  I am sure we all realise that the problem requires the co-operation of everybody, if it is to be made a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether to address my remarks to the Bill or to the Minister's statement, because the Minister's statement is very different from the Bill; but I think that, in the interests of harmony, I should deal with the Minister's statement.  If I were to deal with the Bill, as it stands, I think that parliamentary regulations would very soon force me to sit down, but I think that that would be merely giving expression to the ordinary views of the normal doctor, even of the normal doctor who has given a certain percentage of his time gratuitously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, we had the Minister's statement which was, to say the least, reassuring.  If we were to read the Bill or to be presented with the Bill as it stands, without any reassurance, we would understand why we have lived through as hectic a week in medical circles as any of us ever experienced. It is only 48 hours ago since some of us believed that we were within a few days of seeing the medical and surgical staffs having to walk out of their hospitals.  Words must be read and understood according to the dictionary meaning, and if the words <Col N="2069" /> in this Bill meant anything they meant that within the Bill there was a serious attempt by the Department of Local Government to take all the voluntary hospitals under their control and supervision to the same extent as the rate-aided hospitals and to make the surgeons and physicians and other doctors of those hospitals as much subordinates under the control and direction of the Minister's officers as are the salaried medical officers throughout the country.  That is the clear and the simple meaning of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, this Bill was introduced here on the Second Reading by the Minister, who has beyond measure the gift of disarming people who are before him and, possibly, has the gift of understanding to a very great degree the genuine anxiety of others.  I must say, whether he has information or whether he has merely sensed the position, that, if not all certainly very many of the objectionable features in the Bill as it stands, which were the subject of discussion and which gave rise to such disquiet in the past week, have been dealt with by the Minister in his opening statement, and if he puts into print for the Committee Stage the assurances which he has given here to-day, then I think the Bill will be, on the whole, acceptable, certainly far more acceptable than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Everybody is put in a difficulty over this Bill.  There are two things in the Bill which, I think, everyone wants, namely, a bureau or some machinery for providing facilities for the expeditious entry of the genuine case into hospital and, secondly, the provision of facilities for the re-establishment of the Sweep.  The old doctors, centuries ago, discovered the trick of putting distasteful things inside a very palatable coating.  It looks as if the modern lawyers have tumbled to the trick but have reversed the procedure.  They supply palatable things that everyone of us wants in the most distasteful and objectionable coating.  The Minister's speech went a very long way towards stripping off that distasteful coating. I would ask the Minister to remember this, that assurances given across the <Col N="2070" /> floor of this House are very acceptable and when we secure assurances of that kind they are appreciated by us.</P>
    <P>If we were carrying out a Bill such as this in contact with the Minister opposite in the future, we would be satisfied with the assurances given without having it in black and white, but, remember, the assurances matter only to us.  It is the written word that is going to matter afterwards and, actually, the implementation of the Bill will not be carried out by any Minister; it will be carried out by hordes of civil servants to whom the written word is the gospel.  Nothing else matters.  Whatever assurances the Minister is prepared to give, he should devise ways and means of putting them into print for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with hospitals that began centuries ago as encampments on the side of the Liffey, where good women and skilled men took in those that were sick and ailing in order to treat them gratuitously and prevent their illnesses from spreading to the general body of the community.  They had no grand buildings and no sweepstake funds behind them.  They had no facilities for training, merely the desire to do good.  Not only had the patients to be treated, but the institution had to be managed, the moneys to keep the institution going had to be collected, and all the work had to be done by the same staff.  That was the beginning of our Dublin hospitals.  They grew and grew down through the ages and they reached a degree of efficiency that they attracted from all over the world people who were anxious to absorb medical knowledge and to go back to their own countries to treat their own people in the way that Irish doctors were treating their people.  They came here to learn and they went back trained and perfected.  And all the time the work was done voluntarily, gratuitously, inspired by the desire to serve.  Conditions and circumstances came about when, with the increasing cost of commodities, those staffs and managerial boards were unable to keep going out of their own resources and they had to look elsewhere for financial help.  Even the Government and <Col N="2071" /> the State were unable to come to their financial aid.  Even the taxpayer, with his millions, could not face the task that had been faced and borne by the hospitals themselves and, perhaps the greatest God-send that any of us has ever seen coming into this country, in the form of the Hospitals' Trust, the sweepstake came along to solve the difficulty and to meet the burden. Later on it was considered wise that a Government Department should take control and act as middlemen for the moneys and, as trustees, to have certain supervisory control.  There should be no confusion between hospitals benefiting out of such funds and hospitals benefiting out of the rates and the taxes.  These hospitals, after the sweepstake funds came to their assistance, are just as much voluntary hospitals, staffed by voluntary staffs, as they were ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>It may be that every one of us has his own peculiarities, that some of us are unnecessarily &ldquo;touchy&rdquo; on some points and others on other points; but still, if we have to live together in the same house, each of us has to make allowances for the peculiarities of the other.  What we all want to see, as a result of this Bill, is greater efficiency and increased harmony.  There must be trust, not only between the hospitals' staffs and the Government Department, but between the Government Department and the hospitals' staffs.  It cannot be all give one way and all take the other way.  The Minister is entitled to come here and complain that it took him two years to reach an agreement with one hospital.  The representative of the hospital is equally entitled to complain that it took him two years to reach agreement with the Minister, and every one of us could be left to judge on which side the fault lay.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to implement this Bill, presumably, through a committee representative of the hospitals. If he is, the representatives should be elected or appointed by the hospitals. If they are elected by the hospitals, then that is either going to be a committee or it is not, and if the elected representatives of the hospitals are to <Col N="2072" /> be a committee, then waive the right of approval, because the right of approval includes the right of disapproval, and there would be nothing but a deadlock if the Minister were going to say: &ldquo;Although you elected such-and-such a person, I will not have him.&rdquo;  If that were to be the position, the right of election means nothing.  I would be able to support this Bill with a certain amount of enthusiasm, and certainly with a great degree of hope, if incorporated in the Bill were all the assurances given to us by the Minister to-day, and I hope that when we approach the Committee Stage, the Bill will be drastically altered so as to include those assurances.</P>

      <P>Personally, I am very glad the Minister has agreed to meet some of the objections raised.  I have personal experience, as a patient and as a visitor, of various hospitals in Dublin, and I can certainly say for the constituency I represent that we have no difficulty whatever.  The poorest patient from the county, at the latest hour at night, can get all the skill that medical science can give him. We were never refused a bed at any hour of the day or night for any of our urgent cases.  The Minister has pointed out that this is only a temporary Bill.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of it because I believe it is required in the City of Dublin, but I notice that the Minister is giving authority for a continuation of the sweepstakes, which I understood was matter for the Minister for Justice. Deputy O'Higgins mentioned that that was a pleasure to everybody.  It may be a pleasure to those in receipt of the fabulous salaries, including Deputies and Senators, but it is not a pleasure to those who were in receipt of salaries of 30/- a week, who, if they worked overtime for six days and also on Sundays, received £3 10s. 0d. a week, and whose letters complaining of these wages are censored in the Press.  The Press were threatened by the Hospitals Commission that if these letters were published all advertisements would be withdrawn from the daily papers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that before the Minister gives his sanction he should make some arrangement to stop this scandal, and that instead of <Col N="2074" /> giving out these fabulous sums, if there is to be only £3 10s. a week for the employee, a lesser percentage should go to the directors and the larger sum to the hospital.  I think I am in order in raising my voice in protest against the continuation of this scandal.  I am sure the Minister knows about the complaints, and I am sure that if he has the power he will try to remedy the situation.  Probably with the ventilation which the matter has got, those things which happened in the past may not happen in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister came to an agreement as to certain conditions which he wanted in regard to inquiries into frivolous complaints about the hospitals. I am sure that an hospital would prefer to have the frivolous complaints than to have the Minister's Department holding inquiries.  There is no confidence reposed by public men in the medical section of the Minister's Department in respect of the holding of inquiries into complaints.  In the time of the Minister's predecessor a medical member of his staff held an inquiry into a complaint made by a poor man as to ill-treatment of his two children as a result of which ill-treatment the children died.  While the ill-treatment was admitted, and while evidence was given by the staff that the children were taken out of their beds and, while suffering from diphtheria, beaten and marched into a room, the Minister's medical section held that that was not one of the reasons for their deaths.  It is no wonder that religious orders and others in Dublin object to the Minister having the right of holding an inquiry into complaints about an institution. We have had bitter experience of his so-called inquiries.  I ask the Minister to use the power he is being given in this Bill to remove the scandal that I suggest exists in relation to the Sweepstakes employees in Dublin.  If he does that, he will have done a good day's work not alone for his Department but for the Sweeps in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to what I might call the two speeches of <Col N="2075" /> the Minister, one, the official description of the Bill&mdash;and that I will deal with afterwards&mdash;and the other, the opinions of the Minister, and the two were completely different.  It is to the Minister I would like to address myself in what I am going to say, not to his Department through the Minister. This Bill as it stands is an outrage. Although, like Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy O'Higgins, I was relieved by the Minister's personal statement, I cannot get away from the necessity of asking myself why this Bill was ever put before the House.  We are to have another Bill, but I must say a few words on this Bill, because it betrays the spirit behind the policy of the Department, and the type of mind that is to operate the new Bill.  For that reason when asking the Minister to implement&mdash;and I have not the slightest doubt that he will&mdash;all that he has promised on the Committee Stage, I would also ask him to put down definitely what is meant, because, as I gather, the Bill in all the sections that he mentioned does not at all say what the Minister means. If I were asked what I would disagree and agree with in the Bill, I would disagree with Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4; so far as I understand Section 5, I have nothing against it; I would disagree with Section 6; I do not know precisely what Section 7 means&mdash;it is a line and a half&mdash;and I have not the slightest objection to the definition clause at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a difficulty.  We have two Bills before the House, or, at least, what should have been put into two Bills.  If there was any urgency it might have been about Section 5, in connection with the Sweeps.  The Minister must know perfectly well that had he come to the House, as was pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, and asked us in the space of a couple of parliamentary days to give him a one-clause Bill, such as we have in Section 5, he would have got it without any discussion.  Instead of that particular thing about which there might have been universal agreement, barring a certain amount of criticism such as we have heard before from Deputy Everett, what do we find?  In <Col N="2076" /> with that we have, not a Bill that affects politics in the slightest, but a Bill that I regard as one of the most controversial and the most objectionable that could have been brought before this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister pleads urgency.  Perhaps the Minister does not remember, but sitting beside him is a Parliamentary Secretary who may remember that there was a Hospitals Bill, of which this is an amendment, introduced in 1933, and the plea was urgency.  Urgency for what?  To allow the Hospitals Sweep money to be spent on the hospitals.  That was in 1933.  We perceive the remarkable urgency that followed that measure!  What has happened the spending?  Where are the beds in Dublin that were to be provided as the result of the Sweep money?  What has become of the urgency about which we heard so much in 1933?  I would like to point out to the Minister, as I felt it incumbent on me to point out in 1933, that this is not public money.  It never was public money.  It was the money of the hospitals, always intended by this House for the hospitals, and very unwisely, I think, in the 1933 Act there was an incursion made quite unnecessarily into the whole principle of voluntarism so far as hospitals are concerned.  So much was that the case that one of the supporters of the Minister, whom we are glad to see back from foreign parts, got up and said that the voluntary principle is dead.  That was the excuse for the Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>You will inevitably have in any Government Department a certain tendency.  I am not now referring to the particular individuals who run the Local Government Department, but I say it is the tendency of any bureaucracy to increase its grip more and more on every possible institution in the State.  I hope that the Bill, as we are going to see it on the Committee Stage, will not permit that to happen as much as this Bill threatens.  I suggest that the Minister should exercise some care in regard to the way in which this legislation is going to be administered.  It is not what the Minister tells us is intended that <Col N="2077" /> matters.  I put it to him that this Bill is a warning to him, and that he should be most careful to put in black and white what precisely his intentions are and what the limits of these intentions are.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Bill that was introduced a couple of days ago, and we are now debating the Second Reading. What was the intention before this Bill was drafted?  Am I right in saying that it is to apply to Dublin for the moment?  I gather that that is so.  Before the Bill was drafted and put before the House, was there a consultation with the various parties interested, with the people vitally interested in the voluntary principle&mdash; the ecclesiastical authorities, the managements and staffs of hospitals and the general practitioners?  Was there any conference with them before the Bill was launched on the House? Apparently not.  If not, I have grave fears with regard to the operation of this measure, because you have the gripping hand of bureaucracy that will increase more and more, and paralyse the voluntary efforts of any institution once the opportunity is offered.</P>
    <P>That is not applied particularly to the Local Government Department. That Department may or may not be worse than other Departments.  It does not apply to this country alone. I say that is the general modern tendency of Government Departments as a whole, and it ought to be our duty to try to limit that.  I know the immediate advantages that may be pointed out.  You will have accounts more neatly kept; you will have more frequent reports.  That reminds me that there once was a business house in Dublin.  A man with a tremendous knowledge of keeping accounts was brought in to manage it, and ultimately the staff were so busy keeping accounts that they had not time to sell their wares.  That is what you will have if you allow the Local Government Department to interfere too much with the doctors.</P>
    <P>I suggest that you are going to inflict real hardship on the patients in order to keep control of these institutions and to see that everything is <Col N="2078" /> worked out according to the desire, not of those who have personal experience of the running of hospitals and who are interested in the work and anxious to advance their science, but in accordance with the ideas of those who are accustomed to run civil service institutions and to account for practically every halfpenny, and spend days in doing so.</P>
    <P>It is because I fear that is the spirit behind the whole thing that I cannot look on this proposal with any confidence.  I have been consulted by nobody, I am giving my personal views, views that I expressed even on the 1933 Act.  It is because I fear the spirit that will operate whatever Bill we pass that I have not looked forward with the same confidence to the important&mdash; and I admit they are important&mdash; amendments that have been promised us by the Minister.  This is largely an experiment, and in order to allow the Government to make up their minds on this matter&mdash;to experiment&mdash;they caused an intense anxiety, apparently an unnecessary anxiety, because the Minister is prepared to water down the most objectionable sections in this particular Bill, and when I say that, that means practically every section except Section 5.  Still, for the sake of that experiment and in order to have the power, on paper at any rate, to deal with complaints that would be very rare, he has introduced here what causes the most intense anxiety to everybody who has the welfare of the hospitals at heart.  The Minister himself said that these complaints would be undoubtedly very rare.  Now the Department that we are asked to trust is the Department that put the original Bill up to the Minister.  Therefore we must ask him to put things down rigidly in black and white.  We dealt with Clause 1.  The Minister said something else was meant by that than what we have before us.  I gather that that section is not going to be retrospective in any respect.  Therefore Section 1 should be remodelled.</P>

Is every hospital in Dublin to have a representative or must a number of hospitals combine to have one representative so as to secure a small committee?</P>

      <P>Well, at any rate that will be changed, not as radically as I would like, but an important change is promised by the Minister. Section 4 will be remodelled.  Then what is left of the original intention of the Department, except, as displayed in this Bill, the desire to interfere with the voluntary system?  That is a desire that has been expressed on several <Col N="2080" /> occasions in this House.  When last speaking on this subject six or seven years ago, the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health who is now elevated to a more important position, said he did not know what I was talking about when I spoke of the voluntary principle.  I was asked by Deputies what was I talking about and one Deputy said that &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; only applied to national schools, another Deputy said the voluntary principle is dead.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department, as far as it can, is killing the voluntary system.  That is my objection to the spirit displayed in the original Bill.  Regulations seem to be the main thing.  When are beds to be provided?  The poor of Dublin, of which we have heard a lot from the Minister, have paramount needs, and when they ask for beds they get local government regulations.  If there was an urgency in 1933, why has no headway been made in the City of Dublin between that day and this?  The reason is the intolerable interference on every possible occasion by governmental Departments.  I am not now voicing my own opinion merely.  There was recently circulated to members of this House a letter which enclosed a letter from the late Archbishop of Dublin.  I propose to read out merely the first sentence of that letter as showing the anxiety felt as late as last May by a man who was intensely interested in this particular matter. Writing to the Mother Superior-General of one of the great nursing orders in this city he says:&mdash;&ldquo;It has struck me that it is essential that the Sisters of Charity should not begin to build their new hospital until the question of inspection and control is satisfactorily settled.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way in which the Local Government Department is regarded, and that is the confidence the high authorities have in the attitude of that Department towards voluntary hospitalisation.  I would put that before the Minister and ask him, as <Col N="2081" /> Minister, to consider the vital importance of that voluntary principle.  It is because I saw in this original Bill no appreciation of this voluntary principle, but a decided effort to kill this voluntary principle, that I am speaking as I am now speaking.  When we come to the Committee Stage I want everything clear, and the limitations of the Minister and his Department circumscribed and as clearly stated as possible.  Do not put into the Bill certain things that you do not want to use.  You are dealing with the voluntary principle, and it is a delicate plant, though it is not quite as delicate apparently as Deputy Briscoe thinks.  Remember you are not dealing with public money.  You are merely called in as trustee to see that it is properly administered.  I am not sure that there has been any great addition to the hospitalisation of the City of Dublin as a result of that trusteeship.  I do not know how many millions are at the disposal of the Hospitals Committee.  Who does?  I cannot discuss that at all&mdash;it would be out of order to do so&mdash;but where is it?  Is that sound administration? Is that the result of the principle of the Bill which we are discussing?  Do you think you have made any advance for the hospital situation in the city to provide beds or anything else for the poor?</P>
    <P>It is regulations that are the main thing, getting a grip on the hospitals and not building hospitals.  I was glad to hear the tribute paid by the Minister to the voluntary hospitals.  Perhaps his Parliamentary Secretary will remember the debate on the principal Bill, when the hospitals first got a brick thrown at them and then got a bouquet thrown at them, so that in the end they did not know precisely whether they were in the dock or whether they were getting rewards. That is one of the disadvantages of the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary: that he is a bit blunter than the Minister or than even the Minister's predecessor in this particular matter. Certainly, as many bricks as bouquets were thrown at the voluntary hospitals on that particular occasion.  Why cannot the drawing up of regulations <Col N="2082" /> be left in the hands of those who have practical experience, namely, of the committee?  Why must the Local Government Department put its finger in?  Again, with the desire to get control, that absurd desire for uniformity, possibly, that every Government Department has.  The older I grow the more I dislike bureaucracy, and I confess I like to check it, wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Why cannot the making of these regulations be left to the committee? The Minister says he is willing to meet the hospitals in every possible way.  I admit he has done so to a considerable extent.  Why cannot that be left to the committee?  Why put in sections in the Bill that, apparently, are not necessary? Does the Minister think that, in a matter of this kind, he has better advisers amongst the civil servants, excellent as they may be in the Department of Local Government, than are to be found in the staffs of the hospitals in Dublin dealing with purely hospital matters?  I put it to the Minister that this is one more indication of the way in which this thing is looked at&mdash;from the point of view of a Government Department and not from the point of view of the hospitals or their management.</P>
    <P>In Section 4 the complaints, we are told by the Minister, will be rare indeed.  Why all the pother then? Why have all this regulation and all this unrest with regard to complaints which the Minister confesses will be very rare?  Is it worth it, or does the Minister really believe that the complaints will be rare?  On which leg is the Minister standing?  I do not think that civil servants are the proper people to run things of this kind.  I believe that in any country where bureaucracy has grown and got the upper hand it has ultimately been to the disadvantage of that country, no matter what sphere of occupation one thinks of, whether it be medical science, running hospitals or anything else.  I quite recognise that as civil servants they can do their work remarkably well, but bureaucracy is the last thing that you should allow to creep in to every possible institution in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> We were considerably relieved with what I may call the second portion of the Minister's speech.  I myself was very much afraid that, when he had finished reading the typescript before him, he was going to sit down.  I think I can congratulate the Minister and the House that he did not sit down when he had finished reading the typescript, because he then gave us some indication of the amendments which he was prepared to introduce into this Bill.  The amendments sketched out by the Minister will undoubtedly relieve, to a considerable extent, the anxiety felt.  I think that everybody will willingly pay that tribute to the Minister.  In conclusion, I would ask him to make a real effort to try to check that spirit of getting everything more and more into the hands of Government Departments.  If he did that, I think he would be doing a good work not merely for the hospitals, but for the running of government in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to this Bill from probably a different angle to that dealt with by the previous speaker.  Perhaps I may be almost in agreement with him on some of the matters that he referred to.  First of all, I would like to remind the House that this country has benefited from the Hospitals Sweeps in a way that no other country in the world ever has. An opportunity came to this country which, when availed of, turned out to be beyond the wildest dreams of anybody from the point of view of financial success.  Nobody could have imagined that, as a result of the success of the Sweepstakes, such great benefits would accrue to those of our people who most needed them.  Deputy O'Sullivan reminded the House of a remark that I made in it seven years ago in connection with our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that I said the voluntary system was dead.  I did not use that phrase in the sense that Deputy O'Sullivan has given to it, and he knows quite well what I meant.  I stated then that previously the hospitals had been supported mainly by voluntary subscriptions, and that because of the sweepstakes they would <Col N="2084" /> no longer benefit by those subscriptions. There was, at that time, a large accumulation of funds available for the benefit of the hospitals generally, and it was expected that, apart from the carrying out of improvements in the hospitals and the paying off of overdrafts, there would be sufficient to endow and maintain the hospitals in the future and thereby make them independent.  I stated that because of all that it would be very hard to get back to the old position under which the hospitals were supported by the voluntary system.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite frankly that, to a certain extent I am somewhat disappointed with the Bill.  I had hoped that, because of the extreme urgency and need in our bigger cities, particularly in Dublin, for extended hospital treatment, there would be in this Bill some reference to the establishment of a municipal hospital.  The Bill proposes, by means of the control of beds and so forth, to try to bring about something of that nature, but I do not think that is going to work out.  The last speaker spoke of the responsibility which the State has to what are termed the voluntary hospitals. My view is that the State has a much larger responsibility to the people who should be the beneficiaries from the large funds which have been accumulated, and which are now available, to provide better medical treatment and hospital treatment for the general body of our people.  I was also hoping, because I think the matter was discussed on a previous occasion, that there would be, in connection with the establishment of a municipal hospital, a large general hospital in which an opportunity would be afforded for the employment of very eminent medical people.</P>
    <P>The possibilities at the moment of providing those people with employment in this country are very limited. I had hoped that some portion of the funds available would be set aside for research work in medical science here. This Bill may do a certain amount of good.  It may meet certain complaints made at the moment, but, at the same time, I do not think it is going as far as it should in the direction of fulfilling the <Col N="2085" /> hopes of the people generally.  I have met, in countries abroad, a number of medical people who either studied in this country or did post-graduate courses here, and I was pleased to learn that in certain branches of medical science they have been very successful.  But I do believe that if we did take the responsibility in the proper manner and if we met the situation as we should, instead of dealing with this matter as it is before us now in the Bill, there would be an opportunity of seeing how far the funds available would permit of the establishment in the City of Dublin of a large municipal hospital.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat again, in view of the fact that Deputy O'Sullivan referred to it and was trying to make out that it was in connection with another aspect altogether that I used the phrase, that I did say that the voluntary system is dead in so far as it concerns the voluntary support of the hospitals.  I do not think it would be fair to attempt by any legislation to put back the hospitals which have benefited from the Sweepstakes into a position where they would again have to appeal for voluntary support. We now have the responsibility of utilising these funds in a way that will leave no room for future criticism of this Government or the previous Government, who, to their credit, made it possible for the Sweepstakes to be started, and in a way that will be of lasting benefit both to this and future generations.  I think the Minister might consider not rushing this Bill; he might consider holding it back and probably having a consultation not only with the voluntary hospitals as they are described, but, as I would call them, the private hospitals, but with the medical profession generally, with a view to seeing in what better way can this money now be employed so as to assure the maximum benefit to our generation and also to the future generations that will follow us.</P>

      <P>The last contribution was a welcome one.  I think the Deputy spoke thoughtlessly.  The Deputy must have realised, when speaking about the great benefit that came to the hospitals of this country from the Hospitals' Trust, and deploring, as <Col N="2086" /> he did, the absence of the voluntary contributions which used to come in, that there were two circumstances each of which had its impact on the situation which developed.  One was that there was the advent of a new source of supply for the hospitals, and the second was that the country was going through a hard time in the last seven or eight years, and that people generally had not a great deal of money to give in voluntary contributions to the hospitals.  But there were a favoured few gilt-edged industrialists, and if the Deputy wanted the voluntary system re-established, he might well have taken the lead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the House in possession of two items of information which were in sharp contrast. One was the information conveyed to me, and I think it has not been gainsaid in the House yet, that the main hospitals in Dublin&mdash;they were described as four hospitals, but in fact there are six&mdash;had, with the aid of the Minister's advisers, evolved a co-operative scheme for the establishment of a bed bureau without any State interference of a compulsory type, such as we have under this measure, and that the agreement had been presented to the Minister's predecessor in the late part of the year 1938.  We are presented now with what is an urgent problem, after the Minister's predecessor drooped and slumbered over what these people gave him in 1938.  I saw no criticism of that scheme.  Nobody knows yet what is in the scheme.  We do know that it was a co-operative form of voluntary business arranged by the main hospitals in this city and that, as in the First Stage of this Bill, it was to apply to the city alone.  This was arranged in a voluntary way.  There was no hint of criticism with regard to that.  It was locked in the fastnesses of the Department until this Bill emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, there was a scheme which was contrary to that which we <Col N="2088" /> get in this Bill, which is State interference of the most radical type.  There is a growing tendency towards that. The Ministry in recent years have gone in for all sorts of things.  They interfered in the flour business and thrust 6,000,000 loaves off the tables of the people.  They interfered with bacon and put 250,000 cwts. of bacon off the breakfast tables of the people.  They went into the bogs in Kildare and sunk a lot of State money there.  They went in for the slaughter of calves all over the country, and for the slaughter of dead meat in Roscrea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the tendency revealed here.  What is there in this measure but the crudest form of State interference?  Deputy O'Sullivan said he would give the Minister certain sections of the Bill, and we would all give him certain sections. We will give him Section 5 and the long Title.  I understand that Section 5 is the urgent matter.  That could be carried through this House inside a week.  But in every other respect&mdash; in Sections 1, 2, 4 and 6&mdash;this Bill is riddled with Government interference. Section 1 is worse even than State interference&mdash;it is deceitful.  It brings in hospitals as a matter of compulsion because they have got certain subventions from the Hospitals Commission, although at the time the subventions were given there was no condition attached to them.  After what we have been told by the Minister, I hope his promises will be implemented in full.  I was rather amazed to hear the breadth of the disclaimers the Minister made.  The Bill is not going to be retrospective in any degree.  In fact, as from the date of the introduction of the Bill, the hospitals are to have an option whether they will <Col N="2089" /> come in or go out.  That was, in fact, what the Minister stated.  By way of an interruption I got his assent to it. Section 1 had the other provision&mdash; that hospitals were to be brought into this willy-nilly because they took funds, although when they took these funds no condition was attached.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment of a bureau.  The first sub-section opens smoothly enough.  There was to be a bureau established by the Hospitals Commission with the consent of the Minister.  The Minister was there, but he was only lurking in the background. Then you come to sub-section (2) which is radical and ruthless.  It provides that the Minister may by regulations prescribe the manner in which any bureau established shall be carried on, and such regulations may impose-duties on the governing body or on any person taking part in the management of any of the hospitals concerned, including certain things. But the general phrase which comes first is limited by the narrow words which follow:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Impose duties on the governing body or on any person taking part in the management of any of the hospitals concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Simply because there was a bureau established, the Minister, by regulations, can impose duties on the management of the hospitals.  There is reference to the establishment of committees.  That whole scheme for the establishment of committees shows distinctly the grip of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a bureau is established under this Act in relation to two or more assisted hospitals, the Minister may appoint an advisory committee in respect of such bureau and such committee shall, as regards the governing body of each of the said hospitals, contain at least one person who in the opinion of the Minister is representative of such governing body.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was to appoint an advisory committee, and even though the hospitals might think it proper to put upon it someone as their representative, the Minister alone was to say whether that person should or should not be their representative on the governing body. <Col N="2090" /> As if that was not enough, the Minister was to fix the tenure of office of the committee:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and may at any time revoke the appointment of such committee or any member thereof or alter the constitution of such committee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If someone came to the committee who, the Minister thought, might be depended on at the beginning but turned out a little bit reluctant later, then the Minister could remove him because he has not obeyed orders sufficiently or to his liking, or he could abolish the whole committee and set up a new one.  Section 4 deals with matters of complaint, but there was a statement to-night that what was in the Bill was not intended.  Bills on presentation are supposed to contain what is meant and we are entitled to discuss this Bill as presented to us.  Arrangements as to the hearing of complaints are made but are not limited to the representative body.  A complaint is made to the Minister.  It has to beat two tests, that a person is refused admission or that the treatment is unreasonably delayed.  Suppose a complaint is made and the Minister operates that section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Minister may, if in his discretion he so thinks proper, cause an inquiry to be held in relation to such complaint and may appoint a person to hold such inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the centre of the measure. Provision for complaint is made and the person to receive the complaint is the Minister.  When the Minister gets a complaint, it is in his sole discretion to decide whether it is a proper complaint and to appoint a person to hold an inquiry.  When he thinks it proper, he appoints a person to hold an inquiry. These are powers given the person who holds the inquiry:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) being duly summoned to attend as a witness at an inquiry, fails to attend, ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That can only have reference to members of the hospital staff, to people concerned somewhere in or about the subject-matter of the complaint in relation to unreasonable delay or nonadmission. <Col N="2091" /> If they do not come along or if, having come along, they refuse to take the oath, to produce documents or to answer questions, then they are guilty of an offence and may be fined £5.</P>
    <P>To take the most odious comparison that occurs to me at the moment, you are putting the management committees of the hospitals in the same position as some recalcitrant member of the I.R.A. who is brought before the Military Tribunal under the Offences Against the State Act, and refuses to recognise the court.  It is thought that that is the proper attitude in connection with hospitals committees in this State, six of which had already presented some sort of scheme to the Minister as far back as 1938.  I pass over Section 5, which I consider is one that should be granted at once.  Section 6 (2) tells us:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of the performance of the duties of the Minister and of the Hospitals Commission under the Public Hospitals Acts, 1933 to 1939, and this Act, any officer of the Minister duly authorised in that behalf by the Minister or any officer of the Hospitals Commission duly authorised in that behalf by the Hospitals Commission may exercise in relation to every assisted hospital all or any of the powers specified in the principal sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason for that has still to be explained to me.  As I understood, under the old Act every member of the Hospitals Commission was entitled to visit, to inspect and report.  Every member of the Hospitals Commission has duties thrown upon him, including the collection of, and digesting of information with regard to the facilities for hospital and nursing treatment provided. There is a further clause&mdash;I cannot say which one&mdash;which gives the Minister power to decide who goes as representative of the Hospitals Commission into any of the hospitals.  Those authorised to inspect must get the approval of the Minister.  I would have considered that, as under the old Act, if the Minister required inspection, he could get it through the people delegated <Col N="2092" /> by the members of the commission. Here we get the Minister brought in again.  The Minister may authorise any officer to exercise in relation to every assisted hospital the powers in Section 14 (6) of the Act of 1933.  It is more or less narrowed down compared with the old Act, but we have the same obnoxious business that anyone who interferes with the exercise of the powers is liable to be fined £5.</P>
    <P>Here there is a reduction to a very low level, indeed, of the staffs of the hospitals.  In the background there is lurking this question: Has a case for the establishment of that rigid way been made?  The Minister to-day was facile on that.  He said that everyone admits the necessity, and there is a feeling that there ought to be a bed bureau set up.</P>
    <P>The feeling is based on the contention that the hospitals are not doing their duty.  Accepting, so to speak, justification for certain complaints as the test, I believe the Minister's statement would not be taken as a statement of fact.  The desire of the hospitals to have a bed bureau scheme established may be due to their present good position, so that they do not care about any of these inquiries.  They may feel that they are strong enough to face the public on any matters alleged against them, and I think it is a welcome sign from the hospitals as to how they are carrying out their duties that they are ready to have an investigation as to how they stand.  No case has been made for that.  The only concrete point the Minister made was that at some recent inquest the coroner made some remarks; on these remarks the Minister stands.  On that, somewhere in the Department, this particular measure was thought out.</P>
    <P>This Bill has State interference written all over it.  It is State control that is going to be imposed on the hospitals.  This State control is going to be imposed on them whether or not they accept certain funds.  There was some sort of State control before, but this is an appallingly bad measure.  As far as I am concerned, I want to see Section 5 going through.  I do not think there is any principle in the measure.  The Bill contains a series <Col N="2093" /> of bad clauses.  The principle of State control is inherent in it.  How far it goes we will not have any idea until we see the amendments.  Until I see the amendments, I have to suspend judgment as to what in the end I will do about this measure.  It will get permission as far as I am concerned to go another stage, but it is only going that length, until I see what is in the Minister's mind.  When we came to the House this evening, the noose of the Department of Local Government was around the necks of the hospitals.  They are now, more or less, in a state of suspended animation. Let them be suspended.  It may not be a comfortable position, but they can get their feet on the ground again. If there is going to be anything in the nature of State control&mdash;no matter how little it may be&mdash;unless the hospitals have the fullest freedom to get out of it, I shall be against the Bill at a later stage.</P>

      <P>There are one or two remarks that I want to make on this Bill, but I am not quite sure if they are strictly relevant.  It seemed to me that the Minister's statement was not only in conflict with certain clauses in the Bill, but actually in conflict with the spirit of the Bill.  When I read the Bill first I was very favourably impressed, because I took the view that the Government had at last become alive to its responsibilities to the public which had for so long been dissatisfied with the control and the running of the hospitals in Dublin. The principal cause of the dissatisfaction has been the difficulty of securing the admission of non-paying patients and patients who could only make a microscopic contribution towards their maintenance in hospitals supported by what are regarded as public funds, namely, the accumulation of the Hospitals Trust funds.  It was quite apparent that considerably organised opposition would have been directed against this Bill in its original form. To my mind, that opposition could have been effectively answered by putting the question.  &ldquo;What improvement has taken place in the hospital system in the past ten years to justify its retention?&rdquo;  I refer to the haphazard <Col N="2094" /> and unorganised system of admissions to these hospitals.  The Minister apparently preferred to take another course, to yield on certain vital matters which destroyed the whole effect of the Bill and which will produce a bed-bureau scheme which will not be effective.  The Government has shown great patience in delaying so long in the setting up of a hospital bed-bureau scheme.  It has, to my mind, displayed patience to a criminal degree in allowing this matter to be delayed so long.  For years the voluntary hospitals had been alternately coaxed and threatened to produce an organised scheme for the admission of patients, but so great was individual jealousy and rivalry, and indifference to the real point at issue, that no scheme was forthcoming.  The provisions in this Bill undoubtedly fulfil the requirements of a good bed-bureau scheme on paper.</P>
      <P>I had hoped, foolishly enough, that the passage of this Bill in its original state would be secured and that, when it became an Act, it would be properly operated.  I mean by that that the provisions of the Bill would be interpreted not in the letter but in the spirit.  I have heard this evening the voluntary hospital system extolled to the skies.  I should like the members of this House to hear the views of some of the dispensary medical officers and some of the humble practitioners who spend their lives working amongst the sick poor and the working classes. They would find that their views were much at variance with some of the views expressed here to-night.  From time to time, as many of us recollect, references have been made at coroners' courts to the death of some unfortunate whose life might have been saved if immediate admission to a hospital had been obtainable.  I am sorry that the Minister is not more impressed by public references such as these than by vested interests, organised opposition and the tremendous pressure which, undoubtedly, has been brought to bear on him to change his mind on this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has so completely explained the attitude which I should propose to take on this <Col N="2095" /> Bill that I intervene only for the purpose of underlining and pointing the moral to be drawn from the circumstances attending the introduction of this measure.  I spent three hours in the House this evening waiting for an opportunity to speak.  I was largely prevented from speaking by a speech of a colleague of the Minister who is introducing this Bill in which he denounced Deputy O'Higgins, following upon another colleague&mdash;the Minister for Defence&mdash;who had previously denounced Deputy O'Higgins.  Being forced to leave the House for the purpose of receiving some sustenance before dealing with this Bill, I returned, having missed the statement of the Minister in charge of this Bill and, to my surprise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To my surprise, I discovered that Deputy O'Higgins was handing out bouquets to the Minister for Local Government.  The spectacle of Deputy O'Higgins handing out a bouquet to any Fianna Fáil Minister was so unusual that it rather startled me, and I wondered what had been the change of attitude on this Bill, not having heard the Minister's promises. Having read the Bill for the first time, it appeared to me that there would be two public reactions to it.  In the first place I thought it would lead to what I believed would be the newest revolution in this country.  The I.R.A. are under the impression that they are to cause the next revolution.  I think they are wrong.  There is going to be a bloodless revolution by the ordinary, decent person against bureaucracy. That is going to be the first revolution. When the implications of this Bill were understood I was of opinion that it would assist in the forthcoming revolution to which I have referred.  The second reaction which, I thought, would come from this Bill, if persisted in, was a reaction against the sweepstakes themselves.  I thought that the Bill would probably bring about the early and complete closing down of the sweepstakes.  I had intended, because of the principles enshrined in the Bill &mdash;so far as there are any principles <Col N="2096" /> enshrined in it&mdash;to vote against the Bill.  I left the House with that intention and returned to achieve that object.  I gather now that the Minister has given way on a considerable number of points.  I, like Deputy McGilligan, suspend judgment until I see these changes in black and white, and can bring my judgment and professional skill to bear on the amendments dealing with the principles of bureaucracy and State-control underlying the measure.</P>
      <P>Why was the Bill introduced in this form?  That is the point which I wish to underline.  We had a separate Bill introduced by the Government to enable the sweepstakes to be carried on in the manner in which they are intended to be carried on under Section 5 of this Bill.  That Bill was withdrawn and a Bill for the establishment of a hospital bureau was mixed up with a Bill for the carrying on of the sweepstakes.  It appears to me that that was purely a trick on the part of the Government.  They intended to put those people who are anxious that the sweepstake authorities who want to carry on particular types of sweepstakes should get the authority proposed to be given them under Section 5, in the position that the Government could say to them: &ldquo;If you do not give us this Bill, including the bureau and bureaucratic power over the bureau, the sweepstake authorities will not get what they want.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There could be no other explanation of the extraordinary character of this Bill, looked at from the point of view of drafting or scientific preparation. Apparently, the Minister has now given way on most of the obnoxious clauses in this Bill but he has given no explanation as to why he has mixed up the two proposals.  I am not satisfied that he has given way or that he intends to give way on the principles that appeal to me.  Section 6 of the Bill comprises a very obnoxious principle, but I am told that that is a matter to be fought out subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Bill has any principle in it, it is the principle of establishing a bureau.  As far as I understand, the provisions in reference to the bureau <Col N="2097" /> were submitted to the Minister's Department a long time ago by the hospitals concerned.  There was no necessity, therefore, to bring in this Bill unless the Department intended to attach to it a system of State control, and to set up a bureaucracy to administer it.  The fact that the Minister has only now granted the concessions he has indicated is clear proof that the Department of Local Government has given way to the pressure of public opinion as disclosed in the last few days.  My purpose in speaking here to-night is to underline the moral, that if public opinion is sufficiently militant, sufficiently vocal, it will force the Government to give way to the wishes of the public as so made vocal.  I am quite satisfied that were it not for that vocal public opinion, expressed in the Press by doctors and hospital authorities, were it not for the vocal public opinion expressed on behalf of religious communities engaged in the carrying on of hospitals, we would have the Minister standing over every line and clause of the Bill as introduced. That is the principle I wish to underline here to-night so that the public may understand that if public opinion becomes sufficiently vocal, the Government will have to bow before the storm of such opinion and that it is well worth while to organise public opinion against a measure of this kind.  We have the Minister giving us certain undertakings, but not a single clause of the Bill with the exception of Clause 5 is necessary.  The question of the provision of a bureau could be dealt with by agreement.  The fact that it was introduced in the present form is capable of only one answer, that this Bill represents the Minister's original intentions but that the Government have had to bow before the storm of vocal public opinion in the last few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill on one side has been given perhaps the widest possible interpretation.  An atmosphere of suspicion in regard to it has been created for the last week or so. Arising out of that suspicion&mdash;unfounded and unnecessary suspicion&mdash; there has been an attempt to give it <Col N="2098" /> the widest possible interpretation rather than keep to the strict meaning of the provisions of the Bill.  I am sorry that the debate concluded on the note struck by Deputy Costello. On any measure I have introduced to this House I have been at all times ready to concede any amendments or to make any concessions that I felt I could safely concede, and what I have conceded in this Bill does not in the slightest degree prejudice the effectiveness of the Hospitals Bureau.  If I thought for one moment that any of the alterations or amendments, as I have already indicated in my opening statement, were going in the slightest way to render the purpose of the Bill nugatory, or that they would in the slightest degree prejudice its effectiveness, I would not agree to such amendments. Let us be clear on that.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of pressure of what Deputy Costello calls public opinion.  The opinion we have heard expressed is the opinion of people whose opinions anybody must respect, people who have given their service and their time to the advancement of medical science in this country.  The Minister, however, is chiefly concerned with the position that has arisen in regard to the treatment of the sick poor, with devising some reasonable method of meeting this position and of alleviating the sufferings of these poor people.  That is the only concern he has.  The Bill, as introduced, may have got, and may be entitled in some respects to get, the wide interpretation that has been given to it.  I believed in considering this matter that I could get the desired effect by amending the measure, and, as I have already indicated to the House, I am prepared to make such amendments.  It is not a question of pressure of public opinion.  We have always been anxious, so far as we could, to get that co-operation which is essential for the successful operation of a measure of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy McGilligan to the agreement that was reached between the hospitals.  I understood that that agreement was reached between four of the principal <Col N="2099" /> hospitals and that the others had not come in.  Suppose there was agreement between six, that bureau is not applicable to the present position. At that time it was intended that the bureau would operate when it had 600 beds available and that the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council would have representatives on the bureau because patients from St. Kevin's would be sent to the hospitals through the bureau.  At no time was it stated in these negotiations or in that agreement that the bureau as then contemplated could work unless and until these new hospitals were built and 600 new beds were provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the fact that I only gave one concrete example and that was a reference to a coroner's inquiry.  I said that I understood that it was accepted on all sides that the necessity for a hospitals bureau existed.  I have not heard anybody in this House, nor have I seen any articles in the Press in the last few days since this controversy arose, stating that a bureau was not required. In fact all the statements were to the contrary.  I referred in my opening statement to the reports of the Hospitals Commission.  Time after time, they pointed out the difficulties that have arisen through the fact that a hospital bureau was not in existence.  I know that people connected with social organisations who are constantly in touch with the poor have frequently pointed out the crying need for a hospital bureau.  We have, therefore, to face the position which these representations indicate.  We know that hospital accommodation is limited.  Reference has been made to the number of beds in this city and it has been asked where are the extra beds provided. That question has been raised with a cloak of suspicion thrown round it so that I think it worth while to refer to the matter in some detail.</P>
    <P>This is a table showing the number of beds in hospitals in Dublin City in 1929, and in February, 1940.  I shall read the increase in each case.  From 1929, as compared with 1940, the increase was: Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, <Col N="2100" /> 12; Mater Misericordiae Hospital, 50; Meath Hospital and County Dublin Infirmary, 7; Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke Hospitals, 7; Royal City of Dublin Hospital, 25; Dr. Steevens' Hospital, 17; St. Kevin's Hospital, 174.  That makes, for the general hospitals, a total increase in the number of beds in 1940, as compared with 1929, of 292.  In the special hospitals, the increase was as follows: Maternity hospitals&mdash;National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, 95 beds; Coombe Lying-In Hospital, 20; Rotunda Maternity Hospital, 16.  In other hospitals the increase was: Children's Hospital, Temple Street, 58; National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street, 17; Teach Ultain, 30; St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, 12; City of Dublin Cancer Hospital, 8; Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, 32; Catholic Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, 20; St. Vincent's Home for the Mentally Defective Children, 195.  This makes the net increase in beds in the special hospitals 503.  In Dublin County the increases were as follows: St. Michael's, Dun Laoghaire, 41; Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, 40; Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital for Tuberculosis, Dun Laoghaire, 32; Peamount Sanatorium, 89; Convalescent Home, Cheeverstown, 18; Linden Convalescent Home, 87; St. Augustine's Colony for Mental Defectives, 120. That made a grand total increase in the number of beds of 1,188.  I give those particulars now as I have been questioned here on a number of occasions as to where those beds were. We know that we have not a sufficient number of beds available to operate a bureau in the way it was hoped that it could be operated when that agreement was arrived at between my predecessor and the hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very useful if patients were coming in from hospitals in the country.  You might have one hospital full and another not, and, while there might be no very great <Col N="2101" /> necessity, the bureau would be in a position to fulfil a very useful service. Some reference has been made to complaints. I would not like to see penalties imposed on anybody in a Bill of this kind, any more than anybody else would.  It may not seem to be a proper thing, if it could be avoided, and I will look into the matter.  So far as complaints are concerned, the very same thing inserted in this Bill was accepted in that agreement, that is, with regard to the delay in admission for treatment or the delay in treatment after admission. I have met some people, and I understand that the sole objection they would have would be to any inspection with regard to the treatment, medical or surgical.  This provision for a bureau&mdash;which was agreed on between these hospitals&mdash;set out that it was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... to investigate complaints in regard to admission to, or refusal to admit any poor person to, or delay after admission in giving medical attention to any poor person in any of the hospitals concerned, and to report thereon to the Minister if so requested by him.  (The right of the committee to inspect and investigate complaints would not empower them to interfere between a medical practitioner and a patient in regard to the nature of the treatment afforded or to be afforded by him to the patient).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been followed in the Bill. That is the only sort of inspection we want.  We do not want to inquire into the treatment by a doctor of his patient.  There have been cases from time to time, however, in the Department&mdash;I only know of one or two since I went there, but I have been informed that there were cases before that&mdash;and no matter how well-conducted an institution may be there will be cases from time to time where very serious results have arisen from delay in treatment. I do not wish to suggest in any way that the hospitals are not well and properly run, but cases may occur where a hospital may not have control over itself or could not be regarded as having actual knowledge that may be brought to our attention and on which <Col N="2102" /> we may be able to take action to make that hospital more careful in the future. Whether merely bringing it to their notice would have the same effect as the claborate procedure outlined here, I do not know.  It is felt that it would not.  Again, when I say that there may be cases of delay in admission or of delay in treatment, I must add that these are very rare.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the regulations.  They will be made in consultation with this committee.  The committee should know their own business and, certainly, their advice in regard to the drafting of these regulations ought to put those regulations, in the ordinary way, in such a position that the Minister or his Department would find nothing to disagree with in them.  The committee which will make these regulations will be elected by the hospitals themselves.  I do not know whether I can simply say: &ldquo;Let the hospitals elect them, and do not leave them subject to sanction.&rdquo;  There may be some difficulty about that, but the hospitals certainly will, in their own organisation, nominate their own members. I am not going, as Minister, to criticise or interfere with those appointments.  Whether or not I should tie, for all time, a Department to such a procedure, I do not know.  It may be found necessary to specify a certain period.  That might be a matter on which the hospitals themselves might be able to give some assistance, in suggesting whether there should be a change of board from time to time.  I do not propose to nominate anybody or to appoint anybody on that board. This advisory committee will be composed entirely and completely of the representatives of the general and special hospitals.  I again repeat that I do not want to interfere with the nominations in any way.  They can nominate whomsoever they like and I will accept that, in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that we are interfering, that this is in the nature of bureaucracy, and that we are bringing the Local Government Department into the matter too much.  I do not like to be hearing, every time that anything such as this takes place, <Col N="2103" /> something in the nature of an attack on civil servants.  After all, the person to be attacked in connection with a Bill such as this is the Minister concerned, and not the civil servant, who is not in a position to defend himself. If the Minister concerned is doing his job, he should be responsible for whatever comes into this House in connection with any Bill that he is bringing in, and he should stand over that Bill. If there are faults in this particular Bill, I am sure that we shall do our best to correct them on the Committee Stage, but I think it is not fair that any Minister should try to fall back on the civil servants, and I, personally, certainly would not do so.  If it is suggested that some of the provisions in this Bill are too wide, that may be so, and we can correct such matters on the Committee Stage.  When we come to see the effect of this bed bureau system, if it can be made better by altering it or making provisions that would make it more palatable, then it does not matter, at least, so far as I am concerned, because all I want is to make the Bill as good and effective as possible.  It has been suggested that Section 6 here might be divested of the powers given in Section 14 (6) of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933.  This had reference to the duties assigned to the Minister under Section 14 (6) of the Act of 1933.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, yes, to the Minister; but in this report of the Hospitals Commission, of 1933-34, certain headings are set down as to the agreements to be entered into by the Minister and the hospitals concerned. I suppose it is not quite fair to refer to anybody outside this House, but I think I should be permitted to say that there is a body of medical opinion in this city which, time after time, has lauded the report of the Hospitals Commission.  I imagine that their appreciation should carry some weight, but in any case I think that everybody else lauds that report and, in my opinion, quite rightly so.  However, after going into the details of the various hospitals, the commission suggested various headings of conditions, in their 1933-34 report, and the headings are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  That the institution shall continue to be used as a hospital and that no section of it shall be devoted to any other purpose than that contemplated at the time the grant is made except with the concurrence of the Minister.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  That the hospital shall continue to be run as a charitable institution and that no portion of its income shall be utilised for purposes other than those affecting the essential services of the hospital.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  That an appropriate number of the patients accommodated annually in the hospital shall be treated free-of-charge.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  That the hospital shall be run in such a manner as to be as nearly self-supporting as possible, without detriment to the fundamental principles of providing, as far as possible, efficient medical treatment and attention for all classes, or the charitable purpose of providing free hospital treatment for the poor, which is the primary object for which voluntary hospitals have come into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" />&ldquo;(e)  That the hospital shall be subject to inspection at all reasonable times by authorised representatives of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And so on.  Now, the position is that agreements have been entered into with certain hospitals and have been accepted, and, under these agreements, provision is made to the effect that the Minister's representative may, at all reasonable times, inspect the hospitals concerned, with regard to seeing whether the provisions imposed on the Minister by the Act are being carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to refer the Minister to Section 24 and 25 of the Act of 1933, which have to do with the making of the grants out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  I think that the Minister is being put now into the position of being the judge, which I think he ought to be, but also into the position of being the advocate.  I put it to the Minister that if he is going in, and not an official, according to what he has just told us, he is now imposing upon himself two offices: firstly the office of an advocate and, secondly, the office of judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks are, no doubt, correct but it is rather a disappointment that the Minister has not something more to say on the housing question.  I think there were some thousands of men usually employed in the building industry, and I am afraid that the number is now down to hundreds.  I suppose the Minister will not accept responsibility for the whole of that position, but I think that a very large part of it can be laid at the Minister's door.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is going to make any pronouncement on the housing question because the present time, when this Bill is being introduced, seems to be opportune for the Government to tell us what is the position of the building industry for, at any rate, what I might describe as the war period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that that would be more relevant on the Minister's Estimate?  Pardon me, I just recall that that Estimate has been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Government to say what the Government policy with regard to housing is.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that the present state of the building industry has been largely brought about by the Government cutting down the housing grants 18 months ago.  That brought a corresponding reduction of <Col N="2108" /> all the building stocks held in this country and it has helped to produce some of the difficulties that are at present confronting the industry. Many builders are just hanging on at the present time and I think some of the workers, who cannot hang on any longer, are going across the water.  I do not know whether the Minister regards that position with equanimity or not.  Certainly there is a housing problem here.  The Taoiseach, I think, told us that, as a result of the war, urban areas would need assistance much more than rural areas.  It seems at the moment, at any rate, that that remark is very true.</P>
      <P>There is another matter arising on this Bill which I would like to put to the Minister.  The Report of the Housing Commission was promised by the end of April.  I think we are within an hour and a half of the end of April so I would like to ask the Minister when we are going to see the Housing Commission Report and if it is going to have an effect on the housing problem?  Another matter which was placed before the Government&mdash;I think it was mentioned at the Housing Commission, but it has also been put before the Minister's Department&mdash;is the suggestion that the American system of mortgage insurance be put in force here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that that matter too arises on this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should give us some statement as to the Government policy on housing, and that this is possibly the last appropriate occasion that we will have of reminding him that if they have a policy they might produce it to advantage.  Otherwise he might as well hand out tickets, not only to the workers, but to some of the builders and contractors, to go across the water for the period of the war and, I suppose, to come back here like migratory birds at the conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this Housing Bill, the Minister refers early to the fact that <Col N="2109" /> it is the same as the last one.  I take the Minister's word for that, but there is really very little about housing in it except the title.  If one goes through the Bill it appears as if everything had been considered except the really vital and pressing question in the urban areas.  I notice paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, has been revived. That is in regard to any person (other than an agricultural labourer) who derives his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture.</P>
    <P>That is not a very big section of the community and I think the Minister was quite safe in offering to continue the subsidy to that class.  Sub-section (d) of the same Act is also revived which refers to an agricultural labourer.  The Minister is going to subsidise an agricultural labourer who wants to build a house.  I hope I will not be accused of casting any aspersions on the agricultural labourers, but I would like to say that the agricultural labourers who are prepared to put up houses are few and far between.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one could put them in a bus or a taxi.  Paragraph (e) of the same Act, which is also revived, refers to any person other than a person <Col N="2110" /> who would come under (c) or (d), and (f) refers to any public utility society erecting a house for occupation by a person who derives his livelihood from agriculture.  To boil it all down, it really seems as if many classes in the community have been provided with subsidies except the people in the urban areas.</P>
      <P>Another point arises.  The housing problem is exacerbated by the inclusion in it of people whose circumstances are very different.  I think it is not so very long ago that we had people in this House who contended that there was so little labour available for housing that a certain section of the building industry would have to be closed down.  Now, I think, it appears as if the supply of labour is ample for any kind of houses that it is required to erect.</P>
