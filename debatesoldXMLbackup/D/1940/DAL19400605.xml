    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that according to the Infant Aid Society report for 1939-40 recently issued, the society has been compelled to cut down the amount of milk available for distribution because of the increased price of milk and the increase, due to unemployment, in the number of needy families; and, if so, whether in order to enable the society to continue its work and to enlarge its activities, he will recommend an increase in the existing grant of £30,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin City has been allocated its full proportion of the amount voted for the provision of free milk for necessitous children.  No increase in the grant can be authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, since the increase in the price of milk, the quantity distributed in necessitous cases had to make up the difference between the cheaper price and the dearer price and that, in consequence, a certain number of children have been deprived of a quantity of milk?  Surely, in the interest of public health, when children are proved to be necessitous, the grant should be increased to meet the increased cost of the milk so that these children would receive the quantity that the Parliamentary Secretary thought necessary a year ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

I do not think that that is good enough. Other tenants are coming in and complaining to me that, because they are bachelors or widowers, they are being required to leave their houses.  I think that that is unjust to agricultural workers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of uneasiness among sheep owners and wool buyers as to the possibility of the creation of a favoured monopoly for the purchase and export of Irish wool; and if he will take steps to ensure that before price control is effected the interests of the wool producers will be safeguarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make any statement with regard to the position?  Many people who own small packages of wool must get rid of it to pay their bills.  By this means, they are enabled, too, to make purchases at this time of year.  Could the Minister give some indication as to the price they may expect for their wool?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F.H. Crowley Mr. F.H. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether in view of the fact that the quantity of turf cut during the present season will be mainly governed by the attitude of his Department regarding future imports of coal, he will give an early assurance that such <Col N="1480" /> future imports will not militate against the sale of reasonably good turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information at my disposal indicates that the supplies of imported coal will be so restricted that there will be a ready market for all the turf which is likely to be produced this season.  In the circumstances, the question of giving an assurance of the nature referred to by the Deputy does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F.H. Crowley Mr. F.H. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether in view of the fact that the turf cutting season is now at hand, he will fix a minimum price for turf at the bogside, the price to operate from September and during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The demand for turf during the coming winter will almost certainly exceed the supply owing to the limited quantity of coal which will be available.  Consequently, it does not appear to be either necessary or desirable to fix a minimum price for turf at the bogside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the number of men employed in the works of the Dublin United Tramways Company has been reduced by 60, and that it has been officially intimated that an additional 70 men will shortly be served with notice; and, if so, whether he will approach the company with a view to having an effort made to re-employ these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the unemployment referred to by the Deputy has been caused by interruptions in the deliveries of omnibus chassis and other supplies.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Tramway Company have been in touch with the Department of Supplies, but the very serious difficulty in obtaining supplies of this character in present circumstances will be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> It will, of course, be understood that the re-absorption of the men whose services have been dispensed with will be governed largely by the circumstances attending deliveries of these supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, as a result of the change-over from electric trams to buses, the electric cars are immediately broken up? Having regard to the difficulty of obtaining chassis and other materials for the buses, will the Minister state if any advantage would be gained by suspending the change-over pending the possibility of obtaining supplies at a later date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the rate of change-over will be entirely conditioned by the rate at which supplies of bus materials can be made available.  If the change-over were suspended, all the work of the nature referred to in the Deputy's question would, of course, immediately cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The electric cars are being broken up immediately they go into the shed.  Would any advantage be gained by retaining them as a safeguard in the event of supplies of bus materials not being available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that during the past three weeks fresh mackerel were sold in Kinsale at 1/- per box (or at one penny per dozen) and that 20,000 to 25,000 mackerel were dumped into the sea at Kinsale owing to the inability of the fishermen to obtain buyers for their catch; that in the same period mackerel were sold in Cork Fish Market at from 3d. to 5d. each, according to size, and that at these prices the poor of the city are unable to buy fish; and whether in these circumstances he is prepared to take steps to provide a market for the fish available in Kinsale and at the same time provide the citizens of Cork <Col N="1482" /> with an adequate supply of fish at reasonable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While not aware of all the details referred to by the Deputy, I am dealing with this question on the basis of his own figures.  If there exists in Cork City a genuine demand for fresh mackerel and if the citizens have to pay up to 5d. each for the fish at a time when some 20,000 mackerel are being dumped for lack of buyers at Kinsale, say, 20 miles distant, there is evidently a great want of enterprise within the distributive trade.  All I can do in the circumstances is to undertake that any reasonable proposal for a solution of the problem that may be submitted to the Sea Fisheries Association will receive prompt and sympathetic consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Land Commission workers are now paid at the very low rate of 27/- a week, while the rate of wages for agricultural workers is 30/-, will the Minister indicate on what basis he can justify the payment of such a low rate of wages by a State Department at a time when individual farmers are compelled to pay a rate of 30/-?.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained, during the discussion on the Estimate, that Land Commission workers work only a 48-hour week, and I also pointed out that the position of Land Commission employees or similar employees in other Government Departments is such that they cannot be taken out and treated in the same manner as State employees generally.  There are other considerations, but these are two of the more important ones which make me come to the conclusion that at present I can see no hope of an increase in their wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the present rate of wages paid by the Land Commission to unskilled labourers employed on building schemes is, in some midland towns, 11/- less than the amount paid by the local contractor?  Surely, there should be some consideration given to this question from that point of view and some attention paid to its relation to the fair wages clause in connection with the carrying out of Government contracts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put this to the Minister for his consideration, that 27/- a week for a 48-hour week works out at 6½d. an hour, and in 1940 that surely must be regarded as a particularly low rate of pay, when one considers that individual farmers, without State resources to assist them, are compelled to pay 30/-?  I suggest it is most unfair to ask Land Commission workers to work for 27/- a week with broken time, which means that a man may not earn more than £1 a week in indifferent weather.</P>

      <P>Mrs. Sarah Mellowes, 87 Ceannt's Fort, Mount Brown, Dublin, applied in January, 1940, for consideration under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of the death of her son, Liam.

      <P>In view of the fact that Mrs. Mellowes made an application before the 1934 Pensions Act was passed and has had correspondence with members of the Government&mdash; there are letters which she can now produce&mdash;will the Minister take that into consideration and deem the correspondence, together with the original application made by her, to be an application for a pension within the meaning of the Act?  Mrs. Mellowes can produce abundant evidence that she was in continuous communication with members of the Government in respect to her claim for a pension or gratuity and surely it should be possible to deem that correspondence as a form of application, even though the lady in question might not have later complied with the strict formalities of the law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed in Dublin to begin with a minimum of two assistant managers.  In Cork it is proposed to reduce the number of assistant managers from three to two. That is the minimum.  Power, however, is being taken to increase that number if experience shows that an extra assistant manager is required in either Dublin or Cork&mdash;that is, after consultation with the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on the matter, but I would like to point out to the Minister that we have three county health districts in County Cork.  The present manager is a very good man and is conversant with probably every detail of county management. There is a great amount of work to be done in these three county health areas, and what the Minister is proposing may turn out to be a tremendous labour for the two assistant county managers, especially in view of the fact that at present there are three county board of health secretaries carrying out the work in their respective areas.  I am afraid that what the Minister is proposing may prove too much for two men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must remember that the secretaries to the board of health will be retained and will be able to deal successfully with the work that is being done in the present board of health districts. As I have said, if experience shows that an extra assistant manager is required the council will be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>But, in the interim, I am afraid that considerable confusion is likely to arise.  In future the members will only be dealing with their own districts.  The assistant manager who will probably be one of the present <Col N="1495" /> board of health secretaries may find some difficulty in acquainting himself with the work to be done in areas in which he had not formerly served.  I think that greater efficiency would be obtained by having three assistant managers.</P>

    <P>(a)  Section 5 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), shall not apply or have effect in relation to the first appointment to such office and Sections 6, 8 and 9 of that Act shall have effect in relation to such first appointment subject to the provisions of the next following paragraph of this sub-section;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister shall request the Local Appointments Commissioners to recommend to him a person for the first appointment to such office and those commissioners shall select (otherwise than by competitive examination) and recommend to the Minister under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), one and only one person for such first appointment, and thereupon the person so selected and recommended shall become and be appointed by virtue of such recommendation as on and from such day as the Minister shall by order appoint in that behalf;</P>
    <P>(c)  in carrying out the duties imposed on them by the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section, the Local Appointments Commissioners shall have regard to the provisions (where relevant) of this Act giving priority of recommendation to a particular person or requiring two particular offices to be held by one and the same person;</P>

      <P>This is intended to provide against the very remote possibility, where a deputy manager is to be appointed by a chairman, of a deadlock between two counties.  The Minister must specify in that case the chairman who shall nominate the deputy manager.  That can only arise where the deputy manager would have been suspended or would have been out of the county, and in that case unable to consult with the chairman himself.</P>

Representations have been made by the secretaries of the county councils, and I think the same question was raised here on the Committee Stage in this House that they feel that it is quite easy and quite possible to have four main heads for your Estimates. But within these four main heads there may be a number of sub-heads, and while it is not proposed to allow a saving in one of the four heads to be applied to making up a loss in one of the other heads&mdash;for example, to apply savings on the roads to repairs to mental hospitals&mdash;it is proposed to give the manager power within the heads to make a saving on any sub-head and that he can apply that towards making good the loss on another sub-head.  It must go to the other sub-heads.</P>

      <P>Section 29.  At the end of the section a new sub-section added as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Whenever it appears to the Minister to be necessary in order to enable the county manager for a county to attend the first annual meeting of the council of such county after the first election of members of such council held after the commencement of this Act or to attend the first meeting (whether annual or quarterly) of an elective body for which he is manager after the first election of members of such elective body held after the commencement of this Act, it shall be lawful for the Minister by order to appoint the day and hour at which the first annual meeting of such council or the first meeting (whether annual or quarterly) of such elective body after the first election of members of such <Col N="1501" /> council or elective body (as the case may be) after the commencement of this Act shall be held, and, where the Minister so appoints the day and hour for any such meeting, such meeting shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Local Elections Act, 1927 (No. 39 of 1927), be held on the day and at the hour so appointed.</P>
    <P>It is considered desirable that the manager should be present at the various meetings of the public bodies of his county or I should say at the annual meetings, and this amendment is to prevent the clashing of those meetings.  In other words, in order to enable the manager to be present at each, it is thought desirable to fix separate dates where meetings clash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move this Bill be now read a Second Time. Article 18, paragraph 10 (3) of the Constitution requires that casual vacancies in the number of the elected members of Seanad Eireann shall be filled in the manner provided by law.  This Bill contains the necessary legislative provision for filling a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or disqualification of a member elected as a panel member.  At a general election of members to Seanad Eireann, five panels are formed each of which contains the names of candidates who possess the qualifications required by the Constitution in respect of the particular panel.  The number of candidates to be elected from each panel is fixed by Section 44 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, that is to say&mdash;five from the cultural and educational panel; eleven from the agricultural panel; eleven from the labour panel; nine from the industrial and commercial panel and seven from the administrative panel.  Whenever a <Col N="1504" /> vacancy occurs among the members elected from a particular panel it is proposed that the qualifications necessary at a general election for nomination to that panel, will apply equally to the filling of the vacancy, so that, as between the different interests and service, the constitution of the Seanad will be maintained.  There is also a sub-division of each panel into a nominating bodies sub-panel, and a Dáil sub-panel.  This sub-division of panels is continued in the Bill.  Thus, if the person whose vacancy occasioned the bye-election was elected on the nominating bodies sub-panel, the vacancy will be filled as a nominating bodies vacancy and if on the Dáil sub-panel as a Dáil vacancy.</P>
      <P>The proceedings at a bye-election are originated by the giving of notice, on the direction of Seanad Eireann, to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of the occurrence of the vacancy.  The Minister will, not later than 180 days after receiving the notice, issue an order appointing the necessary dates for the election.  A separate bye-election will be held to fill each casual vacancy.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the constitution of a permanent standing committee for each panel.  This committee will consist of three persons nominated by each nominating body for the time being registered for that panel.  The committee will be permanent, but individual members will continue their membership only so long as the nominating body by which they were nominated continues to be registered and does not revoke their appointment.</P>
      <P>Whenever a vacancy in a nominating bodies sub-panel is to be filled, the members of the standing committee for that panel will be summoned to attend a nomination meeting.  It will be the duty of the members of the standing committee at the meeting to nominate three proper and qualified persons, of whom one will ultimately fill the vacancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the committee may nominate a candidate at any time within one hour after the commencement of the meeting, and may withdraw his nomination.  By this provision for a nomination meeting it is <Col N="1505" /> intended to afford to the members of the committee an opportunity, if they so desire, of discussing among themselves possible candidates, quite informally. If there is general agreement on three candidates, and no further candidates are nominated, the meeting will terminate.</P>
    <P>If more than three candidates are nominated, the meeting will be adjourned in order to take a poll.  The adjournment will, it is intended, be only for so long as is necessary to prepare ballot papers.  At the voting a member may vote for one, two or three candidates.  The returning officer will count the votes and announce the result to the members present.  The candidates will all be persons having knowledge and practical experience of the interests and services to which the panel relates.  In such conditions it does not seem necessary to require that the election be according to the principles of proportional representation; a simple direct election is sufficient.  Secrecy will be maintained, so that at the counting it will not be possible to ascertain how a particular person voted.  No code of rules for counting, such as apply at a Dáil election, appears in the Bill and the procedure will be as informal and simple as possible.  Any question which arises at or in relation to the taking of the poll is to be decided by the returning officer.</P>
    <P>If, after the ruling on nominations, less than three candidates stand nominated, the proceedings must commence afresh.  If three candidates stand nominated, their names will be arranged in alphabetical order in a list which will be sent to the Taoiseach. From those names he will select one of the persons named to fill the vacancy.</P>
    <P>If the vacancy occurs in the Dáil sub-panel of a panel, a candidate for election must be nominated by one Deputy or proposer and by eight other Deputies as assenting.  A sitting which will be attended by the judicial referee, will be held to rule upon the nominations.  If only one person stands nominated, the Returning Officer will <Col N="1506" /> declare that person elected.  If more than one person stands nominated a poll will be taken under which the members of dáil Eireann will vote by post.  A standing electorate corresponding to the special electorate constituted for a general election of members to the Seanad, for the sole purpose of voting at such bye-elections to Seanad Eireann as may occur, is not suggested. Such an electorate would be difficult and troublesome to maintain from day to day, and without any practical advantage over the electorate proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had presented to us a Bill for the filling of vacancies in the Seanad.  Like the original Bill, it has shackles and fetters and embellishments of all sorts. It appears to be a kind of joke following a previous joke.  We are to have a nominating committee and we have set out what the nominating committee is to do; but exactly what it will do is quite another matter altogether.  The whole thing appears to be a very unsatisfactory way of dealing with what, I suppose, is an unsatisfactory matter. There is nothing clear-cut about it; in the beginning there was not anything clear-cut about it.  The vocational system would work all right if it had reached the stage in which it could be got to work.  At the present time we are trying to meddle with something which is not really in being at all; consequently we have this Bill brought in.  If it meets the purpose of electing somebody, I suppose it cannot be much worse than what we had.  Following the original Bill for the setting-up of the Seanad, the way in which it was drafted, and the embellishments which it contained, I suppose we could not expect anything but something of this sort to follow.  We have really no objection to the passing of the Bill.  Something had to be done to fill the vacancies as they occur, and the Minister thinks that this is the way to do it.  It is a very imperfect Bill, but we have no objection to its passing.</P>

      <P>The Minister ought to reconsider this whole question, not <Col N="1507" /> only this particular Bill, which is more in the nature of a stop-gap than anything else, but the whole system on which the Seanad is elected is a humbug and everybody knows it.  If proof is asked for it cannot be given, just as in the case of anybody who is interned. Everybody knows that it is an unsatisfactory system.  It is open to the gravest possible objections of every sort and kind.  The Seanad is no more a vocational Seanad than any elementary school in the country is a vocational school.  This Bill is a very complicated measure.  One might as well say that on a given date the Taoiseach will receive representations in respect to persons suitable to fill the vacancies and that any of the bodies qualified to nominate could send in a nomination.  The Minister ought to reconsider the whole question.  The maintenance of the present method of electing the Seanad is not a credit to this country and it ought not to be maintained.  There are the same objections to this measure inasmuch as it perpetuates a system of that sort, that is not alone unsatisfactory, but unsavoury and objectionable in every respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the system is open to the objections that he thinks have shown themselves.  The vocational system that has been attempted in the Seanad is in its very early stages, and it is only with some little experience that we can see how it will work out. No system in its beginnings can be perfect.  When it has been in operation for some time, whatever imperfections there are&mdash;if there are imperfections&mdash;or whatever abuses disclose themselves, can be removed.  It was mentioned that representations might be made to the Taoiseach direct.  If you do that, I am afraid that, so far as the vocational system is concerned, you might get a very unbalanced Seanad.  You might have groups that have representation on a nominating body voting for a particular person, who might not belong properly to their group at all, and the reason for following these lines is to ensure, as far as <Col N="1508" /> possible, that a vocational Seanad is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of this Bill is to give continuing effect to the taxes and duties embodied in the Financial Resolutions following the Budget, and which have statutory effect for a limited period under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  That being so, it is hardly necessary to deal with them in greater detail now or with the general financial position.  During the debate on the Financial Resolutions I was described as a financial strategist.  It was stated that in the previous six months I created an atmosphere that people would believe that there would be a general all-round increase in taxation, and that with the general feeling of relief at no further increases in taxation, the additional impositions of November last would be forgotten.  I must first of all disillusion those who rate my powers of financial strategy so highly, as there was no such sinister intention behind the Supplementary Budget of November.  On the basis of the experience then obtained and on the information regarding the future conditions it was estimated that there would be a serious shrinkage of revenue for the financial year 1939-40. That we were right in our forecast and in imposing extra taxation is borne out by the actual results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total tax revenue for the year amounted to £26,303,000 as compared with an original estimate of £26,485,000, showing that the amount actually received was £182,000 less than the original estimate.  If the Supplementary Budget had not been introduced the difference would have been much greater; so that the actual results fully justified the introduction of the Supplementary Budget.  The actual yields of revenue were better than was anticipated in November, and <Col N="1509" /> I have already explained in my Budget Statement why such improvement occurred.</P>
    <P>Taxation here is now at a high level, and I do not wish to gloss over that fact despite statements and implications to the contrary.  We are, however, living in critical and extraordinary times and that being so it can hardly be expected that the taxation would keep at the ordinary level. Apart from the previous existing commitments, various additional items of expenditure have been forced on us by reason of the present emergency.  The provision for the Army alone is £3,355,420 as compared with estimate provisions of £3,252,209 last year, £1,995,684 in 1938-39 and £1,595,810 in 1937-38, showing an increase of £1,759,610 in three years.  I am afraid in view of recent happenings the estimates for this year are going to be considerably increased.  This has been accompanied by increased provision for new military barracks and works in the Estimate for public works and buildings the total for which amounted to £977,546 in 1937-38 as compared with £1,234,765 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Emergency conditions are also responsible for a good part of the increased provision for the Gárda Síochána, the Estimate for which is at present £1,924,554 as compared with £1,883,725 in 1937-38.  The new Department of Supplies requires a provision of £9,883 and would cost much more but for the fact that most of the staff serving in it are on loan from other Departments and their parent Departments still bear their salaries.  A similar remark applies to many of the staff in the Censorship Service and to increases in the staff of the Department of Defence.  There is also an additional £150,000 provided to meet the extra bonus on Civil Service salaries.</P>
    <P>Certain economies have been and are being effected but these are only sufficient to offset some of the increases just mentioned.  Declining yields from the various heads of revenue forced us to increase certain rates in order to preserve that total yield.  The total of various capital and abnormal items to <Col N="1510" /> be defrayed from borrowing this year is £1,194,000 as compared with an estimated figure of £2,005,000 at the time of introduction of the original Budget last year.  The difference of £811,000 had accordingly to be met out of current revenue, instead of being met by borrowed moneys.  These various factors combined have forced upon us the necessity for increasing taxation beyond the levels that obtained this time last year.</P>
    <P>After these introductory general observations, I now propose to refer briefly to those sections of the Finance Bill, that have not been already covered by the Financial Resolutions or have not been referred to in the Budget statement.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 5&mdash;income-tax and surtax&mdash;have already been before the House in the form of Resolutions. Section 6 has also been before the House in the form of a Resolution.  I may refer briefly, however, to a misunderstanding which arose at that stage with regard to the effect of sub-paragraph (d) in which Deputy Cosgrave is particularly interested.  It was suggested that this sub-paragraph has been designed to obtain some advantage for the Revenue.  This is not so.  The clause, as a whole, is limited to cases in which more than one individual would, under the law as it stands, be entitled to claim relief in respect of the same child.  Sub-paragraph (a) provides that in such a case only one deduction of £60 will be allowed.  The remaining sub-paragraphs are concerned solely with the allocation of the £60 allowance between the individuals concerned.  Whatever the allocation, the total allowance will still be £60.  If Deputies are not clear as to the manner in which paragraph (d) affects the allocation, I can go into it more fully on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  For the moment I merely wish to make it clear that, in so far as the allowance to, say, the father of a child is reduced as a result of sub-paragraph (d), there will be a corresponding increase in the allowance to the mother.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a new sub-section <Col N="1511" /> designed to grant an extension of the relief given by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1921, in the case of funds having for their purpose the provision of pensions for employees.  The new section extends the relief so as to embrace funds set up for the purpose of providing annuities for the widows, children or dependents of deceased employees.  Section 8 is a relieving clause which is designed to provide exemption from Income Tax under Schedule A in respect of premises in the occupation of the owner which are occupied and used solely for the purpose of air-raid precautions.</P>
    <P>Section 13 terminates the duty on imported butter.  The amount of butter imported is negligible and, as importation is controlled by licence, the Minister for Agriculture is satisfied that there is no necessity to retain the import duty which is being removed mainly for administrative convenience. Section 18 relates to duties on hydrocarbon oil.  It has been found necessary to amend existing legislation with a view to removing certain defects which have been experienced and in order to provide certain additional powers and penalties in administering the duties. Section 20 provides a licensing provision to import, free of duty, certain protected articles.  Experience shows that such licensing provision is desirable to alleviate cases of hardship or permit importation where such importation would not conflict with the protective nature of the duty.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is intended to confer certain customs powers and privileges on the new marine force and on certain members of the Coast-Watching Service.  Sections 23, 24 and 25 have already been before the House in the form of Resolutions.  Section 26 provides certain relief from estate duty in the case of the estates of domiciled Irishmen killed in the present war, in relation to relief in respect of double taxation.  In regard to Section 28, where the Revenue Commissioners have obtained a court judgment for the arrest of a person who has defaulted in paying any tax or duty, they are advised that under the existing law the acceptance of an instalment from <Col N="1512" /> such a person would deprive the State of the means of recovering the balance, and they apprehend that, if they accepted the instalment and subsequently failed to recover the balance, the Comptroller and Auditor-General might question their action.  In these circumstances, Section 28 will empower them to show leniency to the taxpayer by accepting instalments from him, at his own express request, without depriving the State of the power to recover the balance.</P>
    <P>Section 29, which relates to the Post Office Savings Bank, and the next two sections, which relate to Savings Certificates and the Trustee Savings Banks, respectively, are in the nature of interim legislation.  All these matters were exhaustively examined by the Banking Commission whose comments and recommendations are interlinked with other things, such as the suggested establishment of a debt and investment council.  It is the intention to promote comprehensive legislation of a definite character as soon as the Government have taken decisions on the relevant points of principle arising out of the commission's report. Pending the formulation of such definitive proposals, it has been thought well to provide, as Section 29 proposes, that the pre-1922 corpus of law and regulations, in accordance with which our Post Office Savings Bank has been operated from the beginning, shall specifically apply, subject to the minor modifications indicated which have been introduced to facilitate administration.  As regards Savings Certificates, Section 30 removes doubts which arose because of certain observations made by one of the circuit judges some little time ago as to the validity of the Savings Certificates Rules made in 1926.  Copies of the rules are available in the library if Deputies wish to consult them.  The position generally in regard to Trustee Savings Bank is anomalous and it will be remembered that this was one of the reserved matters mentioned in the Financial Agreement with the British Government signed on the 25th April, 1938. Negotiations with the British Government will be resumed when opportunity <Col N="1513" /> offers and meanwhile Section 31 remedies the position in which deposits have continued to be remitted to the National Debt Commissioners.  In future, all deposits will be lodged to a special account in the Bank of Ireland in the name of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Minister's statement to-day did not give us any greater hope or confidence in either the present or the future.  It is quite true that additional taxes were imposed last November, but that was done by reason of the emergency, apart altogether from the impositions now made.  We have got now to the point where, in the opinion of quite a number of people in this country, every additional imposition of taxation is, in effect, a limitation of employment and a very big factor in increasing unemployment.  The sum of money proposed to be taken this year exceeds that of any other year in our history.  We have no improvement in our industrial or commercial business. Even in the case of agriculture, where there has been an increase in price, there have been corresponding increases in the costs of production and increases in connection with those overhead expenses which are inseparable from a big industry of that kind. Even so far as the details of this measure are concerned, they themselves all tend in the direction of bureaucracy, and as we increase the power of the bureaucracy we add to the cost.  I do not feel quite satisfied with the Minister's explanation of Section 6.  My objection to that section&mdash;or rather, to sub-section (5) (d) of the Finance Act of 1920&mdash;is that it does not make plain what the law is.  It is plain that power is given to the Revenue Commissioners to interpret the law, but does not say plainly what that law is.  I object to that.  No servant of this State should have discretion in regard to a matter of this kind and, least of all, a body like the Revenue Commissioners which, so far as the public is concerned, is responsible and answerable to nobody but themselves.  Whatever the law is, it should be written down and the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1514" /> should be merely the administrators. They should not be interpreters in the sense that there is no court of appeal in respect to anything which they interpret.</P>
      <P>Much the same remark might be made in respect to Section 18.  The Revenue Commissioners find, or the Minister on their behalf finds, a reason for correcting something that is in doubt and he proceeds to correct that situation by giving unlimited power into their hands.  This Bill was circulated only this morning.  Another Bill was also circulated this morning&mdash; the Defence Forces Bill&mdash;and by the time one had read through these two Bills there was not much opportunity available for anything else.  I did not get further than Part III of this Bill. Reading over the sections rather hastily, I find that, as far as Section 18 is concerned, it simply means that more power is being given the Revenue Commissioners.  It is true that it is not so absolutely given in connection with this section as with regard to others, but the whole purpose of the section is to strengthen the hands of the Revenue Commissioners without giving us any indication as to the rights of persons who are being regimented.  We have the usual clause in that section that anybody who obstructs or interferes with an officer of the Revenue Commissioners shall be liable to a certain penalty.  I presume there are a great many brave people in this country, but I have never come across anybody who was prepared to obstruct or to interfere with the Revenue Commissioners or any of their officers.  They draw the line at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rather puzzling feature in connection with Section 17 is that an article of diet called cut plug is put into a superior class to plug that is not cut. My information about these two particular types of tobacco is that one simply goes through the operation of being cut, either by the manufacturer or the trader, but that there is in reality no distinction between them. They are sold at the same price and people who do not get plug cut are generally those who either have got <Col N="1515" /> good knives themselves or who think that, if it were cut, it would dry more rapidly and that they would lose something in that way.  The Minister may not be aware of the fact that there is a certain amount of moisture in tobacco and that the more it is cut or frayed the more it is likely to dry. Why it is that reduction in duty, if I read it correctly, is not to apply to cut plug is a little bit puzzling.  I have no doubt whatever that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to explain that to the Minister's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>With regard to other portions of the Bill and particularly those portions dealing with the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Banks, I am afraid that the Investment Council, to which the Minister referred, will not have much to do for quite a long time. I lay claim to no more than an ordinary knowledge of figures but I find no prospect of balancing four out of the last five Budgets.  Perhaps the Minister can do it but I cannot.  The Minister, like every other Minister for Finance, is blaming everybody else in the world for the troubles besetting him at the moment.  We all hope that he will not have to incur the very heavy expense he anticipates and that he will be able in some way to make economies.  It should be remembered, when speaking about the rather heavy expense falling on the State by reason of the increased cost of living, that there is no greater contributory factor towards that increase than the Minister himself. Let us hope that as a result of the efforts of the Minister, and of the better times which we all so fervently desire in the near future, the State will be relieved of a very considerable portion of the financial burden imposed by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly should very much wish to be in the position that Deputy Cosgrave hopes for, and that, the next time we have to introduce a Budget, the condition of affairs here and in the world in general will have so much improved that our Budget will be advantageously affected. I agree that taxation is high.  I was told that by many speakers who spoke <Col N="1516" /> in the Budget debate and who discussed the various Financial Resolutions. I said then, and I repeat now, that I have no desire whatever to assist anybody, if there be any such person, who wishes to hide that fact.  I do not want to hide it.  The more our people realise that taxation is already very high, the better it will be for everybody; the better it certainly will be for the Minister for Finance, because once the people in general, and members of the Dáil in particular, begin to realise the full extent of the taxation we are already bearing, I am hoping that the clamour for increased expenditure in various directions&mdash; expenditure for good purposes perhaps, but nevertheless increased expenditure which is so often demanded from all sides&mdash;will not continue or will, at any rate, be diminished.  It would certainly make matters much easier for the Minister for Finance.  It is quite true, as Deputy Cosgrave also states, that heavy expenditure on the part of the Government is a factor in limiting employment. I do not deny that such heavy expenditure restricts enterprise. I am sure that is so but I do not see any way of avoiding the expenditure for which we had to provide in the Budget of this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 6 (d), which we discussed the other day, I think I know a little more about it now and I hope that Deputy Cosgrave does also. I am not quite sure whether he said that he was satisfied with the explanation now given or that he was not satisfied.  At any rate, it is clear to me that the £60 which is allowed for a child is the maximum amount that will be allowed whether it goes to one parent or is divided between two.  The first three clauses of Section 6&mdash;Clauses (a), (b) and (c)&mdash;deal with the amount, £60; and the other clause, as I have already said, lays down the law as to how the £60 is to be divided, in the proportions between the two parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am sure that the Deputy knows that there is a variety of cases and that all sorts of conditions might arise, and if one were to lay down all these conditions in the Act and to specify how the Revenue Commissioners should divide that £60 in every type of case, it would mean that you would have an enormous Bill. I think you cannot do more than give a general direction.  The Deputy seems to have a very great distrust of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>I am, but in reality I am not giving them any increased power or any power that was not there already.  I am not increasing their power in any direction or giving them any greater discretion.  From my own experience, as I said the other day, I would be prepared to give them discretion&mdash;that is, from my own personal experience of them as an ordinary taxpayer.  Certainly, the Revenue Commissioners that I have met, both past commissioners and present commissioners, always gave me a square deal.  I do not think there is any discretion there that is unwarranted; in fact, the discretion is restricted to the finest possible point, even in regard to this particular section with which Deputy Cosgrave is dissatisfied.  Generally speaking, the Revenue Commissioners have not got <Col N="1518" /> a discretion, as they are tied up by the Income-tax Acts and the Finance Act of each year.  I think it is not true to say that there is no appeal.  First of all, there is an appeal to the Special Commissioners.  The Special Commissioners of income-tax can review the assessments and allowances, and then there is an appeal in certain cases to the courts also, at any rate so far as assessments are involved.</P>

      <P>Evidently.  Of course, as Minister, my experience is short, but as an ordinary taxpayer my experience extends over a good number of years, and I have nothing to complain of with regard to their treatment of me, at any rate.  With regard to the question of tobaccos, I am not an authority on tobacco of any kind.  I know the names of the various tobaccos and, when I meet a generous friend, occasionally, I know a good cigar and am able to enjoy it, but that is about the extent of my knowledge of tobaccos.  I understand, however, that there is a sharp differentiation made by the manufacturers between plug tobaccos and cut plug tobaccos.  The plug tobacco may be in the form of bars or squares, of two ounces weight and so on, whereas cut plug is in competition with flake tobacco, and both cut plug and flake tobaccos are sold at higher prices than plug tobacco.  I do not know if that adds to the Deputy's knowledge or not, but I admit that it is something with which I was unacquainted before.</P>

    <Title>County Management Bill, 1939&mdash;From the Seanad. - Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1940&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts by the enactment of certain provisions which are essential or highly desirable in the light of the present emergency. For the purpose of explanation, I may divide the provisions of the Bill broadly into the following categories and deal with the most important provisions under these heads:&mdash;(1) provisions regarding liability to service and active service; (2) provisions regarding the coast watching and marine service; (3) provisions of an emergency nature; (4) provisions regarding certain matters affecting neutrality; (5) provisions arising out of the establishment of the Irish Red Cross Society, and (6) provisions to simplify administrative procedure.</P>
      <P>As regards the first category, the liability of members of the Defence Forces to be employed on military service is rather unsatisfactorily set out in existing legislation, and Section 41 (1) of the present Bill now prescribes that the actual liability of members of the Defence Forces, other than the crews of State ships, who will be mentioned later, to be employed on military service is confined to the area of the State. It is, however, also provided at Section 5 that when, as occasionally happens, any personnel are abroad on courses of instruction, or as members of equitation teams, etc., they will, while so abroad, be subject to the provisions of the Defence Forces Acts in matters such as discipline, for example. This position has not hitherto been clearly stated owing to the fact that until the passing of the present Constitution, it was not possible to apply the Acts extra-territorially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of active service as contained at Section 2 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, <Col N="1523" /> 1923, has been amended.  The section in question was rather unfortunately worded as it empowered the Government to place the troops on active service by declaration only in the case of imminent or recent operations against an enemy.  It is undesirable that a declaration of active service should be synonymous with a declaration that imminent attack by an enemy is visualised.  Section 6 (2) of this Bill provides, therefore, that the Government may declare the Defence Forces to be on active service when the circumstances appear to warrant such a course.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second category, the marine and coast watching service was established over a year ago. Among other things, a small number of motor torpedo boats and patrol boats of the trawler type have been, and are being, acquired for the patrolling of the territorial waters of the State.  In this connection, the Bill contains provision at Section 50 for the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Government, to construct, acquire, equip, maintain and commission public armed vessels.  The strength of the marine and coast watching service is not at present so large as to justify its maintenance as a separate force.  It will accordingly be maintained as a component of the Defence Forces and the Defence Forces Acts will apply to the personnel of the service. Provision has been made to enable marine ranks and ratings&mdash; comparative scales of which are included at Sections 17 and 18 of the Bill&mdash;to be conferred on the officers and crews of the vessels.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made at Section 41 of the Bill for the liability of members of the vessels to serve outside territorial waters and, at Section 5, for their being subject to military law while so serving.  The vessels might have to proceed outside the territorial waters in such circumstances as the carrying out of rescue work, or the pursuit of any belligerent vessel which had entered the territorial waters in contravention of International law.  The Bill also contains <Col N="1524" /> other essential provisions with regard to the marine branch, including, at Sections 45 to 48, and the Sixth Schedule, a code of marine offences on the lines of analogous provisions of the code of military offences.</P>
    <P>I next come to the emergency provisions. One of the most important of these is Section 24, which provides for direct enlistment in the Forces for the period of an emergency.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, the Government has decided to augment the existing Forces during the present emergency and a recruiting campaign is at present being vigorously prosecuted.  Under present legislation, enlistment can be effected for a definite period of years only and the section mentioned is accordingly necessary so as to enable enlistment for the duration of the emergency.  The Bill also sets out in detail the procedure in regard to the enlistment, attestation, etc., of recruits who offer their services for the duration of an emergency.</P>
    <P>I think I may appropriately deal at this stage with Section 57.  This section is designed to ensure that members of the Reserve who are called out on permanent service and persons who enlist in the Forces in time of emergency will be reinstated in their employment on demobilisation.  I would like to say in this connection that hitherto very little difficulty has been experienced as regards the reinstatement of members of the Reserve in their employment on release from military duties.  The number of complaints received has been comparatively small and where complaints have been made, we have generally been met very fairly on making representations to employers.  At the same time, I feel that the question of reinstatement of employees on the termination of the present emergency might become a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>I have no fear but that all reputable employers will recognise their responsibilities, but I feel it desirable to provide against any employer who might utilise the present position to dispense with the service of some of his employees permanently.  It is also essential in connection with the <Col N="1525" /> present appeal for men to augment the existing Defence Forces, that employees should know that all reasonable steps have been taken to secure that their civil employment will be open to them when their services in the Army are no longer required. Reasonable safeguards as between employer and employee in regard to contracts of service and apprenticeship are also provided in the section.</P>
    <P>Another section of an emergency nature is Section 12, relating to billeting. The Act of 1923 contains provisions on this matter and the machinery provided for therein has been prepared in connection with the present emergency, although, happily, it has not been found necessary to put it into operation so far.  The preparation of the machinery, however, revealed that the prescribed procedure was unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  Section 173 of the 1923 Act, which contains the existing powers as to billeting, requires that the Government, by order, must authorise an officer not below the rank of commandant (who must be named in the order) to issue a billeting requisition. The authorised officer must then issue a requisition to the chief officer of police to provide the required billets.  This procedure in a matter which in an emergency would require considerable despatch is both cumbersome and rigid.  Section 12 of the present Bill empowers the Minister for Defence to issue regulations which will be prepared so as to simplify the present procedure in every possible respect.  Billets will be paid for at rates to be prescribed in the regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that, in a state of emergency proclaimed by the Government, the Minister for Defence may issue warrants requiring transport undertakings to give priority to military traffic.  This is a power which would be used only in the most exceptional circumstances.  It has been the experience of my Department, during the recent mobilisations, that the various transport companies spared no effort to meet military requirements and no difficulty whatsoever was experienced as regards transport arrangements.  It will be understood, <Col N="1526" /> however, that circumstances might conceivably arise in which it would be desirable that the power provided for should be available.  I may mention that, in other countries, the law provides for the taking over of transport services by the Executive, if necessary, in time of emergency.  We do not propose to go so far, but are confining the power sought to what we think might reasonably be necessary.</P>
    <P>Another section which I might deal with under the category of emergency provisions, although it may be acted upon at any time, is Section 11.  The object of this section is to secure that plant, vessels, vehicles, etc., of transport undertakings which may in an emergency have to be requisitioned for military purposes can be suitably adapted in order to meet military requirements.  It also gives power to secure that such plant, vessels, vehicles, etc., in the course of construction will be subject to such modifications and the introduction of such additional fittings as will render them readily adaptable for military purposes without interfering with their normal use.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it quite clear that this section is not likely to be extensively used and that if it is used there will be as little interference as possible with the normal use of the articles.  A visualised instance, though I must not be taken as stating that this will be done, is that transport companies might be required to adapt omnibuses, by so constructing them and introducing such fittings as would enable them to be used as ambulances in time of emergency.  In deciding to introduce this provision, I had in mind that the proposed procedure would be far less expensive than the purchase of new equipment which perhaps might never have to be used for the purposes for which it was bought.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that Sections 10 and 11 provide for compensation at rates to be agreed upon in respect of action taken under these sections.  In the majority of cases in which the powers provided may have to be used, I feel that there should be no difficulty in reaching agreement as to the amount of compensation.  To cover any cases, however, in which agreement may prove impossible, I hope to introduce <Col N="1527" /> at an early date legislation providing for a system of arbitration.</P>
    <P>It is being provided in Section 56 that the civil law in relation to the control of mechanically propelled vehicles in specified areas, the closing of roads to, and the lighting of such vehicles as well as the ordinary speed limits, etc., shall not apply to military transport and to members of the Forces driving on duty during a state of emergency.  Provision is contained at Section 4 for declaration by the Government of a state of emergency for the purposes of all the sections mentioned under the heading of emergency provisions.</P>
    <P>I next come to the provisions which I have broadly referred to as &ldquo;Provisions in relation to neutrality&rdquo;. These will be found at Section 58, and relate to recruitment and the publication of recruiting advertisements for the armed forces of other countries. The Government considers it highly undesirable, having regard to our neutral status, that recruitment for any foreign force should be permitted. For the same reason the Government considers it undesirable that papers printed within the State should contain recruiting advertisements for any foreign forces.  It is felt that the newspapers of other countries circulating here will respect our domestic law in the matter.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Sections 43 and 44 arise out of the recent establishment of the Irish Red Cross Society.  Article 10 of the Geneva Convention of 1929 which was signed on behalf of this State, lays down that in time of war personnel of voluntary aid societies, in order to obtain the protection afforded by the convention, must be subject to military law and regulations.  The convention provides that when so subject the personnel of the societies shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, and that if they fall into the hands of an enemy, they will not be treated as prisoners of war.  Furthermore, it is expected of all the countries who have signed the convention that they will take the necessary steps by legislation to bring established voluntary aid societies within the scope of <Col N="1528" /> the convention for the purposes mentioned. The sections in question are so drafted as to ensure that persons who voluntarily attach themselves to the forces during a period of active service, say as motor drivers or other civilian auxiliaries whom it might be necessary to employ in the field, shall also be subject to military law.</P>
    <P>The provisions for the simplification of administrative procedure include direct appointment of officers and direct enlistment of men into the Reserve.  It is necessary under existing law that persons whom it is desired to commission as officers of the Reserve or Volunteer force must first be commissioned in the regular forces for one day and retire therefrom, and similarly that persons whom it is desired to enlist for Volunteer force service must first be enlisted in the regular forces for one day and then be transferred to the Reserve.  Sub-section 15 (b) and sub-section 16 (c), taken in conjunction with Section 25, will authorise direct commissioning in and direct enlistment to the various classes of the Reserve and will obviate considerable administrative inconvenience.  This is a particularly important matter in connection with the present recruiting campaign.  The Third and Fifth Schedules of the Bill set out the oath to be taken by officers and men on direct appointment to or enlistment in the Reserve, and the Bill also sets out the procedure for enlistment, attestation, etc.  There is provided at Section 54 a simplification of the procedure regarding the transfer of absentees or deserters to military custody by the Gárda Síochána, and at Section 49 a simplification of the procedure regarding the disposal of charges against officers.  I think that I have now explained all the most important sections of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the Second Stage of this Bill. I feel that we have failed to communicate to the public a true sense of the peril that hangs over this country at the present moment.  If we have so failed, that failure is one for which we are all responsible.  I want to say deliberately now that I believe this <Col N="1529" /> State is in immediate danger of an invasion, which, I think, should be resisted by force with all the resources this State can command. I believe that if this country is to be protected from devastation, and our people protected from carnage of the most horrible kind, we must resist that invasion with all the forces at our disposal.</P>
      <P>I am aware that during the last week or so representations have been made by certain persons in this country that Ireland should, in the face of invasion, pursue the expedient adopted by Denmark. I say that such a suggestion is ignoble and disgraceful.  But, even if it were not so, if it were a suggestion that any honourable citizen of this State could contemplate, that alternative is not open to this country, because the submission by Denmark to invasion closed the chapter.  The submission by Ireland to invasion by one of the belligerent powers would promptly evoke counter-invasion by other Powers, with the result that this country would be turned into a bloody battlefield and our people destroyed between the upper and nether millstones of the contending forces.</P>
      <P>I say deliberately that the only effective means of preventing such a disaster being brought upon our people is to make manifest to the world now that any invasion of Ireland contemplated by any State will be resisted to the limit of our people's ability to resist.  I desire to say this, that every man who enrols now in the State service, whether it be in the Regular Army, the Volunteers or the Civil Defence Force, does the work of ten men in protecting our people and our country from the dangers I have mentioned. I say that because I am convinced that the enrolment of one man now is worth the enrolment of ten men in a month's time.  It is of vital and urgent importance to our country and to our people that we should show the world that every able-bodied man in Ireland is prepared to join in resisting the invasion of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this in conclusion.  For whatever weight my word carries with any individual in this State, my advice <Col N="1530" /> to him is to go now, without a moment's delay, and enrol for one of the three forces to which the Government ask the citizens of this country to offer their services, and to leave it to the Government to decide what individuals will be called to immediate service consequent upon that enrolment. The Government may determine that men with heavy family responsibilities or other special circumstances of that kind need not be called at the present moment so long as there are persons free from heavy responsibilities available for immediate service.  But the important thing to do is to show that every man in this country, whatever his difficulties are, is prepared, if the Government think it necessary, to surmount these difficulties and join with his fellow citizens in the supreme duty of the defence of the State.  No man need apprehend that his offer of service will be irresponsibly dealt with. Every man's case will doubtless be considered on its merits and the most suitable men first called upon to serve. It is vital that there should be no doubt in the mind of any citizen of this State that his duty at the present time is to place himself at the disposal of the Government for the defence of this country.  To every man who wishes to serve Ireland I say deliberately that the sooner he makes that enrolment the better his service to Ireland will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, if words could mean anything, the words used by An Taoiseach on Saturday night should have brought home to the people of this nation the seriousness of the position in which we exist.  On that occasion he referred to the fact that it may be only days that are left to the people of this country to prepare for whatever eventualities may arise.  If any words of mine could induce the young men and the older men whom we are prepared to enlist for the duration to come up at a faster rate than they are coming, then I would gladly use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is undoubtedly grave. Every member of the public must understand as clearly as I understand, the trend of events.  I think I can say, with Deputy Dillon, that every man <Col N="1531" /> who enrols now is a much more valuable man than the man who enrols when disaster confronts us.  I do not wish to use any words that would in any way alarm the general public, but I should like to say that the lethargy that apparently came upon the people during the last 12 months or so in respect to the conditions existing in Europe should fall from them now and they should show that, as the people of one small nation, they are prepared to defend the liberty of that nation to the death.  It means everything to us if this nation dies.  If this nation dies, <Col N="1532" /> I am sure there are few of us who would want to live.</P>
