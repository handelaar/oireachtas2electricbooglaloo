      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the opinions expressed at the recent congress of national teachers in Killarney relative to the harm done to the children and the language by what were described as the unsatisfactory methods of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish, he will have the whole question of the teaching of Irish inquired into.</P>

      <P>This matter is too important to be dealt with in a reply to a Parliamentary question.  I would suggest to the Deputy that it be left over until the appropriate Estimates are being discussed.  Meantime, I can assure him that the teaching of Irish and through Irish in the schools is under constant observation and examination in my Department.</P>

      <P>The number of heads of duty in the customs tariff on the 1st April, 1940, was 368.</P>
      <P>As the Finance Accounts have not yet been fully audited, it is not possible to give the precise yield of the customs revenue for the year ending 31st March, 1940.</P>
      <P>It is regretted that information is not available in such a form as would enable a reply to be given to the second part of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) for Minister for Supplies</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware <Col N="1645" /> that Irish coal importers have had difficulty in getting coal supplies from Great Britain.  The difficulty arose, mainly, out of the dislocation in the distribution of coal which was caused by the abnormal weather conditions in the early part of the year.

In the light of that, will the Minister take steps to see that normal Irish requirements are attended to <i>pari passu</i> with those required in Italy and Spain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the fact that an extensive acreage of land has this year been cropped with oats, he has considered the position that will arise when the crop is harvested, due to lack of storage facilities; also whether he will consider the payment of a guaranteed minimum price so that merchants will be prevented from taking unfair advantage of the farmers' <Col N="1647" /> difficulty, or the adoption of such other measures as will ensure that a reasonable price will be paid for the crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At all times the great bulk of the oat crop from upwards of 500,000 acres grown in the country has been fed to live stock on the growers' farms, and the storage of this or of the relatively small balance available for direct sale has not presented any difficulty.  Although an increase in the area under oats is anticipated this season, it is also anticipated that this will take place mainly on farms where the grain will be substituted in the feeding of live stock and poultry for the increasingly expensive imported foods, and I feel satisfied that the farmers concerned may be relied on to store their grain in a suitable manner. They are, of course, aware that in the absence of suitable lofts or granaries oats and other cereals may be safely stored in the stack over winter, provided steps are taken to guard against damage by vermin.  It is not proposed to institute a guaranteed price for oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that numerous farmers who up to this have not engaged in tillage to any great extent, have this year cultivated considerable portions of their lands and that a great proportion of that land, in fact in the majority of cases, has been planted in oats?  Once this is harvested and threshed there will be only one alternative open to the farmer and that is either to keep it and feed it to his stock or dispose of it.  Most farmers dispose of it to a merchant in the nearest town.  The farmers will be absolutely at the mercy of the buyers who can offer any price they like for the crop.  The result will be that the farmers will have to take whatever price is offered and in the circumstances there is a reasonable prospect that the farmers will not be fairly treated and does the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not consider taking some action that would prevent the merchants offering a ridiculous price for the oats and compelling the farmers to take it and does he not realise that in the absence of adequate storage facilities the farmers will be compelled to take the price that is offered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in certain areas in this country it is not possible for the farmers to retain their oats in the stack because the number of threshing machines in the area is so small, and that if the farmers do not avail of the first one that calls into their district, they may expect that no other threshing machine will come there that year and that it will be impossible for them to thresh at all?  Will the Minister in these circumstances consider making some provision for storage or making some arrangement with the local grain merchants to take the grain off the hands of the farmers, if the grain has to be threshed early in the season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question with regard to the supply of threshing machines will be examined in the very near future, and I am sure advice will be given to the farmers with regard to the threshing of their grain.  I imagine if threshing machines are scarce that will be all the more reason why the farmers should keep their oats in stacks&mdash;that is if there are not sufficient threshing machines to thresh it. That would make it all the more convenient for the farmers to keep the oats in the stacks.</P>

      <P>There may be areas in which the threshing machine comes say in October and the farmer may find himself faced with the fact that no other machine would come into that area that year.  That is true of the area in which I live and it is also true of Deputy Bennett's area.  Will the Minister say in the event of that dilemma he will intervene to provide us with threshing machines in the spring, if we hold over our oats?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the very high mortality of live stock that has occurred in County Clare, and if he will state whether he has made any provision with a view to enabling farmers to replenish their supplies of cattle, particularly their heifer stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of inquiries in the matter, I see no reason to suppose that mortality among live stock in Clare was more evident recently than in previous years.  I am satisfied that, in addition to the adoption of preventive and curative measures against liver fluke disease, farmers should pay more attention to the housing and feeding of their stock if they are to avoid the continuance of the losses from which they suffer.  During February last a veterinary surgeon gave a course of 18 lectures in the county which dealt with these questions.  These lectures were well attended and I hope will prove of considerable benefit.</P>
      <P>The Dairy Disposal Company, through the agency of their creameries in the county, are advancing loans to milk suppliers for the purchase of stock.</P>
      <P>A scheme of loans for the purchase of heifers has been adopted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and advertisements of it have appeared in the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply is he aware that, if the farmers in Clare adopt his advice with regard to providing better houses for their live stock, as soon as the housing is provided a valuer will come <Col N="1650" /> along, value the new houses and raise the poor law valuation?  The probability of persuading the valuer not to raise the valuation is no greater than was the probability of the tenants on the Clanricarde estate persuading Clanricarde that the rents should not be raised because of their improvements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say against that is that some farmers do improve their holdings.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that Mr. Pierce Bolger of Doon, Boyle, County Roscommon, was in receipt of a military disablement pension; that he has been deprived of this pension on the plea that his disablement was not 50 per cent.; that notwithstanding this decision the man is in fact totally disabled and unable to work; that his wife and six children have very limited means on which to exist; and if the Minister is prepared to reconsider his decision in view of the hardship inflicted on this man and his evident total disablement.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Mr. Bolger was in receipt of a disability pension under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, which ceased on the 28th February, 1937, when on re-examination his degree of disablement was found by the Army Pensions Board to have dropped below 80 per cent., the minimum required for the continuance of pension.  On the 14th October, 1937, Mr. Bolger submitted a claim for a pension under Section 26 (2) of the Army Pensions Act, 1937.  He was examined by the Army Pensions Board, who found that his disability was below the minimum, 50 per cent., required for the grant of a pension under that section. No award could, therefore, be made to him.  These decisions are in accordance with the terms of the Act and cannot, therefore, be reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide legislation for the establishment of a new general hospital in or near the City of Dublin in place of the House of Industry Hospitals. The House of Industry Hospitals are a group of hospitals which were established on premises in North Brunswick Street, Dublin, in connection with a House of Industry.  Houses of industry were first provided for by <Col N="1660" /> an Act passed by the Parliament of Ireland in the year 1771-2 entitled:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An Act for badging such poor as shall be found unable to support themselves by labour, and otherwise providing for them, and for restraining such as shall be found unable to support themselves by labour or industry from begging.</P>
      <P>The Act provided for the creation of a corporation in every county and city to be known by the name of &ldquo;the president and assistants instituted for the relief of the poor and for punishing vagabonds and sturdy beggars.&rdquo; These corporations were empowered to build hospitals to be called workhouses or houses of industry for the relief of the poor in their respective counties.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of this Act a corporation for the relief of the poor in the City of Dublin was constituted in the year 1773.  That corporation established and maintained the Dublin House of Industry.  Subsequently various buildings in the nature of hospitals as they are known to-day grew up in connection with the House of Industry. In the year 1774 two wards were set apart for medical and surgical cases.  In the year 1803 a hospital for the accommodation of cases of infectious and contagious diseases was opened.  Premises were purchased in the year 1811 and converted into a surgical hospital block.  A medical hospital block was opened in the year 1817.</P>
      <P>The Irish Poor Relief Act of 1838 introduced a new code of law for the relief of the poor.  By that Act the administration of the relief of the poor was entrusted to a central authority known as the Poor Law Commission. For the purpose of administration the country was to be divided into areas to be known as poor law unions.  In each union a workhouse for the relief of the poor was to be established and, if and when the Poor Law Commission. so directed, every house of industry was to be the workhouse for the poor law union in which it was situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the passing of the Act of 1838 the portion of the Dublin House of <Col N="1661" /> Industry which had been used merely for the relief of the poor was converted into a workhouse and became the workhouse of North Dublin Union.  The medical, surgical and fever hospitals already mentioned continued to function separately as hospitals and to be known as the House of Industry Hospitals.</P>
    <P>Special provision was made for the regulation of the House of Industry Hospitals by the Dublin Hospitals Regulation Act, 1856.  That Act provided that so much of the House of Industry Hospitals and lands as were not appropriated to the purposes of a workhouse under the provisions of the Act of 1838 should vest in the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland in trust for and to the use of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1856 empowered the Lord Lieutenant, with the approval of the Treasury Commissioners, to regulate as he thought fit the number and description of officers and servants to be kept in the hospitals and the salaries to be paid to them and from time to time to appoint and remove such officers or servants and upon the occurrence of a vacancy to make an appointment or otherwise as he thought fit.</P>
    <P>The Lord Lieutenant was empowered, when he deemed it expedient so to do, to direct that the management of the hospitals should be vested in a board of governors to be partly nominated by him and partly elected by the subscribers to the hospitals in such proportions as he determined from time to time, and to fix from time to time the number of members of which such board should consist and the qualification necessary for the members to be elected by subscribers. By an order dated the 9th May, 1857, the Lord Lieutenant fixed the number of members to constitute the board at eleven.  Later the number was increased to seventeen.  As there were no subscribers to the hospitals all the members of the board of governors were appointed by the Lord Lieutenant.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1856 sets out the powers in relation to officers and servants of <Col N="1662" /> the hospitals which should vest in a board of governors if and when appointed by the Lord Lieutenant.  The board, subject to the approval of the Lord Lieutenant and the Treasury Commissioners and subject to the orders made by the Lord Lieutenant, could regulate and determine the number and description of officers and servants to be kept in the hospitals, and the salaries to be paid to them, and they might from time to time remove such officers and servants and at their discretion make appointments to vacancies.  The Lord Lieutenant might from time to time alter the constitution and limit and define the powers of the board of governors and he might delegate to the board or to any officer of the hospitals all or any of the powers vested in him in relation thereto.</P>
    <P>The Act also gave the Lord Lieutenant power, at his discretion and subject to the consent and approval of the Treasury Commissioners, to grant a superannuation allowance to any officer or servant of the hospitals who became incapable of discharging his duties by reason of confirmed sickness, age or infirmity.</P>
    <P>After the establishment of the Irish Free State the powers and functions of the Lord Lieutenant under the Act of 1856 were transferred to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the powers of the Treasury Commissioners to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the provisions of the Bill under consideration it might be well to give the reasons which have rendered it necessary.  The Hospitals Commission in their First General Report recommended a scheme of hospitals for Dublin which would entail the development of four large general hospitals each with a complement of 550 beds.  One of the hospitals recommended to be developed was the House of Industry Hospitals.  These hospitals contained a total of 325 beds, but deducting 78 beds for fever cases there remained 247 beds for general medical and surgical cases.  To increase the accommodation from 247 to 550 beds would necessitate considerable additional buildings.  The board <Col N="1663" /> of governors of the existing hospitals have no power to erect new buildings. Their powers were limited by the Act of 1856 to the management of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>The site of the existing hospitals is rather restricted and for a large modern hospital it would be well to have considerably more space.  Proposals of the Dublin Town Planning Authorities for the replanning of the neighbourhood would have the effect of cutting off portions of the lands. This would further restrict the site and leave it inadequate for a large hospital. It would, therefore, be necessary to seek a new site.  At present neither the hospital authority nor the Minister has power to acquire land for the purposes of these hospitals, and it is now proposed to make the necessary legal provision.</P>
    <P>Though the provisions of the Bill are expressed in very clear terms, and largely explain themselves, I think it well to refer here to some of the principal points in the Bill.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is given power in the Bill to acquire land for the purposes of the new hospital.  He may acquire the land either by agreement or compulsorily, and for the purposes of compulsory acquisition the usual provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act and of the Lands Clauses Acts may be applied.  All land so acquired shall be held by the Minister in trust for and to the use of the hospital.  The expenses incurred by the Minister in connection with the acquisition of the land shall be defrayed out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has acquired a site he shall proceed to the establishment of a board of governors for the new hospital.  He shall by order provide for the number of members of the board, the method of appointment and terms of office of members and other matters such as resignation, disqualification and the filling of casual vacancies.  The Bill contains the provisions of a usual nature in regard to the meetings and proceedings of the board when established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> As regards appointment, salaries and removal of officers and servants of the board of governors, the Minister may by order declare in relation to any office that the power to appoint, remove, abolish and fix remuneration or any of such powers may be exercised by the board without his consent, and where such order is in force the board may exercise any of the powers permitted by the order in relation to officers.  The board of governors are required by the Bill to prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme with the object of providing pensions and gratuities for or in respect of officers and servants of the board.  In this connection I might mention that it will be necessary to move an amendment on the Committee Stage to distinguish between paid officers and unpaid officers.  It is not intended to submit a scheme of superannuation for the unpaid officers of the board.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains the usual clauses as regards accounts and contracts.  The board will be empowered to invest funds in trustee securities, to accept any real and personal property as an endowment, to hold land and to borrow by means of bank overdraft or otherwise.</P>
    <P>After the board has held its first meeting it is required with all convenient speed to prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme for the erection and equipment of a new hospital on the site acquired for that purpose by the Minister.  The Minister may approve of the scheme without modification, or modify it whether by addition, omission or variation, or he may require the board to submit a new scheme.  After the scheme has been approved by the Minister the board shall proceed to erect and equip the new hospital.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for payment by the existing governing body to the board of governors of the new hospital of the unexpended balance of any moneys received by that body under the Public Charitable Hospitals Act, 1930 to 1932, and any accumulations of such moneys.  These moneys are to be applied by the board of governors towards defraying the expenses <Col N="1665" /> incurred by the board in the preparation of the scheme and in the erection and equipment of the new hospital.  The balance of the expenses will be met by the Minister, so far as in his opinion they have been reasonably incurred, out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>The board of governors will be given power, with the consent of the Minister, to extend, alter, enlarge or otherwise improve the new hospital.  The hospital shall be controlled and managed by the board and they may do all such things as the governing body of a hospital are usually authorised to do in relation to a hospital controlled by such governing body.</P>
    <P>As soon as the new hospital is erected and equipped and is, in the opinion of the Minister, ready for the reception of patients, the governing body of the existing hospitals shall be dissolved and cease to exist and all their property, debts and liabilities shall be transferred to the board of governors of the new hospital.  Where any property transferred is held upon trust for the endowment of a bed, or medical prize, or medal fund, or upon other special trusts, such property shall be held by the board of governors upon such trusts as may be declared by the board but which shall, in the opinion of the board, correspond so far as circumstances allow to the trusts affecting the property before the transfer.</P>
    <P>Officers and servants of the existing governing body will also be transferred to the board of governors on the completion of the new hospital and there is provision in the Bill for the preservation of their status and remuneration.</P>
    <P>The board of governors of the new hospital are required to close the existing hospitals as soon as may be after the completion of the new hospital. There is provision in the Bill which will enable the board to provide and continue an out-patients' department to the new hospital on the premises of the existing hospitals after they are closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered by the <Col N="1666" /> Bill to dispose of the lands on which the existing hospitals are situated or any portion of them.  The net proceeds of any such disposal are to be paid by the Minister into the Hospitals Trust Fund.  It will be necessary on the Committee Stage to submit some amendments in relation to the provision regarding the closing of the existing hospitals.  It may not be possible or desirable to close the existing hospitals on the completion of the new hospital.  I propose to submit amendments providing for the closing in whole or part of the existing hospitals in such manner as the circumstances may require.</P>

      <P>It is not considered possible to build a new hospital on the present site, for the reason, with the information before me, that it appears there is not sufficient room available on the site.  If property adjacent to the present site can be procured, it does not follow that the existing site will not be used, in conjunction with whatever additional property may be secured, but the position appears to be, as far as I could examine it, that the existing site, as it stands, does not provide adequate accommodation for the proposed new hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his observations the Parliamentary Secretary made some reference to the Hospitals <Col N="1667" /> Commission that was set up by the Government, and that has Government nominees on it.  I think there is no one else on it except Government nominees, and when I say that I mean persons agreeable politically to the Government.  From an examination of the reports of this commission for the last few years, since 1933, when this body was set up by the Government, it does not appear to have been ever intended by the Hospitals Commission to put this hospital on any other site than the present one.  There are reasons for that.  There is a rumour to the effect that the Minister had acquired, or was about to acquire, a site at Cabra.  That would be two or three miles away from the site of the present three hospitals.  In the course of the report of the Hospitals Commission the desirability of having some agreement between the people who control the Morning Star and the Grangegorman Institution is mentioned. The reasons given for having an accommodation with the Grangegorman Institution are probably better known to the Parliamentary Secretary than to any other layman in the House. It is a matter with which the Parliamentary Secretary, as a professional man, should have acquainted himself. Why he never mentioned that in the course of his opening speech is rather mystifying if not puzzling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that this is an old surgical and mental hospital, with accommodation for fever patients. Generally speaking up to seven or eight years ago it was looked upon as a Government hospital.  That is a peculiar sort of name, Government hospital, but it was given for some reason.  There was a Government contribution towards this hospital from about the middle of the last century until 1932, of from £5,000 to £7,000. The Minister called the three hospitals the House of Industry Hospitals. Very few people in the City of Dublin know them by such names.  They are commonly known as the Richmond Hospital.  Sometimes one hears them referred to as the Hardwicke, or the Whitworth hospitals, but the Richmond is a name that stretches back <Col N="1668" /> over two centuries.  In so far as interference by the Government was concerned it was warranted and justified by the Government contribution, but since the date mentioned it is entirely independent of the Government.  Not only has the hospital no income from the State or from Government funds but it has repaid, along with the other hospitals, every penny it ever got from the Government.  Therefore, so far as interference is concerned, it is unjustified interference, and the Minister's position is that of an officer of the Gárda out on point duty.  He is in a position to regulate the traffic but not to control it, not to do as he pleases, but rather to enter into possession of authority that has come down to him to control the hospitals for the purpose intended.</P>
    <P>It was intended for the relief of the sick.  Is it going to relieve the sick in Cabra?  If the hospital is to be two or three miles out, will patients go to it?  This institution has had the distinction of being a teaching hospital for over two centuries.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary looked up the evidence given before the commission which sat in 1854 to deal with this matter?  He will hear from many of his confreres in the city about Dominick Corrigan.  Even as a student, he must have heard that name. Dominick Corrigan gave evidence before this commission and he referred to &ldquo;the mischief that would be done if these hospitals were closed&rdquo;.  He was referring to the site.  Are we to have in the year 1940 a perpetration of the mischief that was abhorred by Dominick Corrigan in 1854?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that the site on which these hospitals are at present is not sufficient for a 550-bed hospital. But it is probable that you could put such a hospital, or a series of hospitals to provide that accommodation, on the site.  In what the Ministry has called &ldquo;hospitalisation,&rdquo; generally, ornate, magnificent, architectural buildings are not required. What is required is such accommodation as will enable suitable treatment <Col N="1669" /> to be provided for the patients. The Minister cannot have reached his present position in his profession without knowing that there are such hospitals in some of the most highly hospitalised countries in the world.  He can obtain information about the hospitals of Baltimore, the Mayo Clinic and so on.  Why did they adopt these methods in dealing with these hospitals?  They adopted them to suit the convenience of those who would use the hospitals.  It may be urged that the site in this case is not sufficiently stylish and it may be that the people who go into the hospital are not sufficiently stylish, but they have gone in there for two and a half centuries. The hospital is well known and popular, and it has served a public need.  Distinguished members of the medical profession have attended there and it is a teaching hospital.</P>
    <P>Members may not be familiar with the meaning of that simple term&mdash;a &ldquo;teaching hospital&rdquo;.  It means that students attend there in the mornings. About 100 years ago they used to attend at 8 o'clock in the morning. Now, they attend at 9 o'clock and spend an hour and a half or an hour and three quarters there.  After that, they attend one of the colleges&mdash;the National, Trinity or the College of Surgeons&mdash;for their lectures.  The students say that this hospital is sufficiently far from the lecture colleges as it is and, if it were any greater distance, that they would not attend.  The hospital is not attached to any of the three colleges and it has students from all three.  Is it the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary that this hospital should be a teaching hospital? The matter was referred to during the inquiry of 1854 and it was thought to be of great advantage that it should be a teaching hospital.  That was the opinion both of the commission and of those who gave evidence before it.  In the course of the evidence, it was mentioned that one of the surgeons visiting the hospital some years before considered the matter of such importance that he set up a fund of a couple of thousand pounds to establish a museum of surgical and medical information. Subsequently, he left £8,000 or £10,000 <Col N="1670" /> for the same purpose.  His name was Mr. Carmichael.  That is the inheritance and the Parliamentary Secretary has no right to alter the site of the hospital to such an extent as to endanger the possibility of its use to the people for whom it was built or to endanger it as a teaching hospital.  If it be a teaching hospital, it is more than likely that the patients will get better attention than if it were not a teaching hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose it is necessary to read for the House the various references by the Hospitals Commission to this hospital or to say that, right through their whole series of recommendations, it was their intention that this hospital should be built upon the present site, using that term in the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary used it in one of the few remarks he made on the Bill&mdash;that is, that the site is capable of extension.  My information is that the Ministry has full particulars regarding the cost of extending the hospital site in the present area.  The figure is not very considerable, and the site will have to be acquired within the next few years.  The purpose is not yet settled&mdash;whether it will be for a housing scheme, for town planning or for an extension of this hospital.  That is the first objection I have to this Bill as drafted.  A site &ldquo;in or near the city&rdquo; could be at Nelson Pillar or it could be at Cabra.  It could be on the south side, although I think it is not intended to be on the south side.  No information has been given to the House to show that it would be desirable to change the location of these hospitals from the populous areas in which they are situated.  They have served the people who had recourse to them for two centuries very well.</P>
    <P>My second point is in connection with the constitution of the board. The members of the present board were appointed about 1919 or 1920 and have continued on from that period. About that time, the then Government&mdash;the British Government&mdash;refused to recognise this hospital as a Government hospital and the board of governors were not satisfied to administer anything else than the charity <Col N="1671" /> which they had been accustomed to administer.  The then surgical and medical staff&mdash;and the word &ldquo;staff&rdquo; does not appear in any part of this Bill&mdash;came together and, although their accounts were closed in various directions and they could not get any overdraft, they put up whatever money was needed to keep the hospital going until they submitted a number of schemes to the lord lieutenant of the time.  The constitution of the board then included six members of the staff, that is, six professional men, surgeons, physicians and others; there were approximately ten in all.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is the intention, in connection with the board that is to be appointed by the Minister to function after the establishment date, to associate the staff in the same way as they have been associated.  I do not mind one more or less, although I think six should be the minimum.  Is it intended to have the association which has gone on for something like 30 years?  It has been a happy association and it has functioned well.  I should say that during the period that has since elapsed the quality character of this hospital has been very well maintained.</P>
    <P>There are, it would appear, to be two boards.  It is unfortunate the way this Bill has been drafted.  One board will be the existing governing body. That it should be designated by small letters in the course of the whole Bill is somewhat surprising, because the new board has a capital &ldquo;B&rdquo; all through.  You might not have walked in that fashion on people who have done their work as they have done it during the last 30 years; you might have let them go out with some good grace.  If the sensible thing were done. the intention might be to appoint the old board as the new board.  The old board will continue as long as the old hospital is in existence.  The day when the new hospital is to be opened and the old hospital closed, the old board goes out of existence.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible, in the case of a <Col N="1672" /> hospital like this, where they have been accustomed to a fund of £5,000 or £7,000, that they had not spent much money on a clerical staff or that they had not got much accommodation. As the Bill is drawn, it would appear that the existing governing body, the present board, must supply office accommodation and clerical assistance to the new board.  I think it is fairly clear&mdash;it ought to be&mdash;that the chairman of the old board will be the chairman of the new board.  It may be awkward for him at a precise moment during the proceedings.  We will say that a board meeting is called for 11 o'clock and the meeting is over at 12 o'clock.  The second board meets at 12 o'clock and the chairman has to nod to one gentleman going out and to another coming in.  I think the Minister should make some effort to bring a little harmony into that part of the Bill.  I think he would find it possible to get agreement with the board in regard to anything in reason.</P>
    <P>That is practically all I have to say in regard to this measure.  I think it is unfortunate, not only in the interests of this hospital but of the patients who are either in the hospital or about to go into it, that it should be in contemplation to put the hospital on any other site.  I think it would not be in the interests of the sufferers that this hospital should be away from the location of the Grangegorman institution. It would be a great pity that this hospital would be at a distance from the Morning Star and the Regina Coeli.  It is inconceivable that three bodies such as those could not arrive at some agreement and, with the powers the Minister proposes to take, that they could not acquire land in that district. It seems almost unbelievable that those three institutions and the persons in control of them and responsible for conducting them cannot come to an agreement to give each other what is required there in the way of space, to harmonise relations and to put up a hospital in that district which will meet the needs of the district and which will be capable of working in conjunction with the Grangegorman institution, the Morning Star and the Regina Coeli.  It is in the hope that such <Col N="1673" /> accommodation can be found and in the belief that it should be possible to harmonise relations between the new board that is going to be appointed and the existing governing body, that I do not intend to vote against this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We can hardly consider this Bill without adverting to the rumours that abound to-day to the effect that the site of the new hospital will be somewhere in or around the Cabra area.  What the House is being asked to do is to agree to a Bill to change the Richmond Hospital to a place about four or five miles from the centre of the City of Dublin.  If rumour be correct it is understood that the Department have already acquired a site, or that a site has already been acquired in Cabra and will be transferred to and vested in the Minister on the enactment of this Bill.  No sane man outside the Custom House would suggest to this House or to the citizens of Dublin that the Richmond Hospital should be moved from its present location to a place in Cabra. This whole Bill is designed to change the Richmond Hospital to a place four or five miles from the centre of the city.  The Richmond Hospital is probably the most popular hospital in Dublin.  It was originally erected to provide free hospital treatment for the working-class people of the city.  It maintained that very honourable tradition until 1919, when the British Government insisted on putting wounded soldiers into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not give any more money and the hospital had to take in patients in order to balance its accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospital authorities then felt that they were being compelled to depart from the terms of their original charter, namely, that the hospital was one in which free treatment would be provided for the poorer citizens of Dublin.  Anybody who knows the hospital and knows the surroundings knows that the area is probably the most densely populated portion of the City of Dublin.  Anybody who knows the hospital knows <Col N="1674" /> that at present it supplies a very essential need to the thousands of people who occupy that portion of the city.</P>
      <P>It is true and, of course, the fact is evident to anybody who has ever visited the hospital, that it is in need of modernisation and extension.  But it is also true and evident to anybody who knows the area that there is plenty of space adjoining it which would facilitate the extension and modernisation of the hospital.  There is adjoining it a very substantial building known as the Morning Star.  There is not much difficulty in acquiring the Morning Star and extending the hospital to the Morning Star grounds.  But this Bill seems to be a Bill to transfer the Richmond Hospital to the Morning Star, whereas it ought to be a Bill to transfer the site of the Morning Star to the Richmond Hospital and to transfer the Morning Star to some other site in this city where it can quite easily fulfil the functions which it fulfils to-day.  If the rumour be correct that it is intended to erect a new hospital out at Cabra, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how he imagines that the poor people who have to attend the hospital can manage to get there from Queen Street, Church Street, Capel Street or North King Street to the City Hospital.  That difficulty will be accentuated when it is pointed out that the sick person cannot go to the hospital alone.  Such a person has to bring a friend with him and sometimes they have to use some king of conveyance. These poor people will have to go to the new hospital at Cabra if the site is to be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All along the discussions which related to the hospital had to do with the extent of its accommodation.  These discussions proceeded on the basis of leaving the hospital at its present site. All the reports have indicated that there was no question of an alternative site to the existing Richmond Hospital site until very recently.  Somebody apparently hit upon the idea that the best place for the hospital was as far away from the City of Dublin as it was possible to locate that hospital.  The idea apparently was to remove it as far <Col N="1675" /> away as possible from the residences of the people who mostly use that hospital. What is the insuperable difficulty in acquiring land adjacent to the existing site of the Richmond?  The land there is available.  It is not very expensive land, and there is no difficulty whatever in accommodating elsewhere those who now use the land.  It would be easy enough to give those reasonable accommodation elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult for the Parliamentary Secretary in reading through memoranda, sent by interested parties, to appreciate the value of the Richmond Hospital to the poor who live in the neighbourhood of that hospital.  I took the trouble of ascertaining what provision was made for and treatment given to the poor in that hospital during the year 1939.  In that year there were 33,500 bed days provided free of charge for persons who found it necessary to use the hospital.  The out-patients' department has been a very valuable institution to the poor people in the area.  In the year 1939 there were 50,000 persons treated in the out-patients' department attached to the hospital.  In future, if the poor are to have bed days at all they must manage to get to Cabra with all the inconvenience associated with getting there and with all the inconvenience associated with their relatives visiting them there.  If these people are to get attended to at the out-patients' department provided at Cabra for them it would be a very real hardship on them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said there was power to provide an out-patients' department on the site of the present hospital.  Well certainly it is not a satisfactory position to have the hospital located at Cabra four or five miles away and to have the out-patients' department located in the present hospital.  I never heard of that kind of a hospital scheme up to this. This is the first time it has been suggested that we are to have an out-patients' department situated four or five miles from the hospital.  Moreover, there is no guarantee even that an out-patients' department will be provided on the site of the present hospital.  The <Col N="1676" /> extent to which the hospital has been used by the poor people who obtain treatment free of charge, the number who attend as out-patients and the number who have attended the hospital clearly indicate that the hospital has been generally appreciated and its services utilised so far as the poor in the area are concerned.  I think the proposal to change the site of the hospital from its present location to Cabra is one that cannot be recommended on any reasonable grounds. The effect of the change will be to inflict great hardship on the poor of a very densely populated part of the city.  The Minister has not given any reason to indicate what in his opinion justifies this change.  Nobody has come forward to say that this change is essential.  Nobody can say&mdash;unless a person is looking for difficulties and hoping to find them&mdash;that it is impossible to secure additional accommodation for this hospital.  It is evident that there is no difficulty in finding the space necessary within the immediate vicinity of the present hospital.</P>
    <P>There is another rather strange feature in this Bill and that is that under it the Minister has power to appoint the governing body of the hospital. I think the present governing body is a self-appointed body.  If vacancies occur they are filled by certain members of the body.  But in this Bill we are being offered a scheme of control by which the Minister will appoint all the nominees of the governing body.  We were not told by the Parliamentary Secretary in what way that power will be exercised.  We may find that the Bill will work this way, that the Minister will appoint a number of people whom he considers suitable to be governors.  There is no reason to believe that these people will have any representative standing.  For instance, the entire staff of the hospital may be left out.  The local authorities may find that they will have no representation whatever and those who represent the workers of the city may find that they will have nobody there to represent them; that section of the community which is forced by economic necessity to avail of the services provided by the hospital, may have <Col N="1677" /> nobody to represent them on the governing body.  The Parliamentary Secretary should tell us about these things and he should make suitable amendments in the Bill, amendments that will provide that there shall be reasonable democratic control of the new hospital, that those who will be appointed to constitute the governing body of the hospital will be persons in a representative position, that efforts will be made to ensure that the hospital is democratically controlled and that the persons who utilise the hospital and who are personally concerned will be represented on the governing body.</P>
    <P>One serious omission in the Bill is that though we are really providing a new Richmond Hospital under another name we are doing nothing to perpetuate the purpose that was behind the inspiration to build the original hospital.  The present hospital was built to provide free treatment for the poor.  There is no assurance whatever in this Bill that there will be free treatment in the hospital, and there is no guarantees whatever that the poor will get in this hospital the treatment they are getting in the present Richmond Hospital.  There is no provision in the Bill to ensure that, expressed as a percentage, there will be a minimum percentage of free beds made available in this new hospital for people who are unable to pay for beds.</P>
    <P>My fear on the whole matter is that, if this hospital is changed from its present site to Cabra, it will be regarded largely as a suburban show-house into which wealthy patients, possibly the bulk of them from places outside the City of Dublin, will go for treatment, so that they can live in a kind of spa while the poor people who now rely on the Richmond Hospital to provide them with treatment will have to fend for themselves elsewhere, and that at a time when it is harder than ever for a poor person to get into a hospital.  It may, of course, be said that the Mater Hospital is not very far from the existing Richmond Hospital, and that the Mater Hospital really serves, to some extent, the needs of the area, but the poor people do not go to the Mater Hospital.  I am not <Col N="1678" /> too sure that poor people are wanted in the Mater Hospital if they cannot pay.  It is all very well, of course, to say that the Mater Hospital is there, but you might as well say to an unemployed labourer in Gardiner Street that the Gresham Hotel serves meals to non-residents as to tell him that the Mater Hospital is there.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made no real case for this Bill.  What he omitted to say was much more important than what he did say.  I suggest to him that he should give us more details as regards what is contemplated, so that we may know exactly what is really behind the move to rebuild the Richmond Hospital in some other place in the city.  So far as I am concerned, I am opposed to the Bill if it is for the purpose of transferring the existing Richmond Hospital from its present site to a site four or five miles away from the masses of the population which it at present serves.  The Parliamentary Secretary took very good care to conceal from the House the real location of the site of the new hospital.  We ought to have that information now, so that the House will definitely know what exactly it is voting for when it votes for a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>I rise on the Second Reading of this Bill not with any intention of criticising the terms of the Bill but simply to try to elucidate, on behalf of a great number of people who are interested in it, certain matters.  I think one can say, without exaggeration, that the eyes of the medical world of Ireland have been focussed on this Bill.  Quite a number of the men in the medical world have read all its provisions, and while many of them see no <i>ipso facto</i> objection to any single clause they feel that certain passages in the Bill contain a certain vagueness.  I, like other Deputies, rise for the purpose of seeking further clarification of its provisions.  I think that clarification is required if the fears of those medical men are to be allayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great things in this country has been the devotion of our <Col N="1679" /> teaching hospitals.  On account of our history we have not been able to do very much that is of great distinction in our own country, but one of the things that we have been able to do is to develop teaching hospitals, making them an example to the world. Associated with the ideal of teaching hospitals is the principle of voluntary hospitals, hospitals in which doctors work without remuneration, and very often for excessive hours.  The average person who takes an interest in medical development in this country, when he reads this Bill, sees one great danger before his mind which I would like to mention in the interests of Irish medicine in general, and so as to make the position perfectly clear.  If, as may be supposed, a hospital is built on a site at some distance from the present hospital; if it is equally found that it is not possible to close the present hospital, and if the board of both hospitals more or less represents the interests of the old board, including most of the members of the old board as I understand will be the case, you will have developing two sorts of hospitals. There will be the old Richmond Hospital worked on the voluntary principle of an unpaid staff. There may be a hospital built at Cabra with a large number of beds which it will be quite impossible to operate on the voluntary principle.  The staff there will have to be paid out of some fund or other.  In that situation the fundamental principle which lies behind the teaching hospitals, worked on the voluntary principle, will be changed.  It is that, principally, which is causing a great deal of concern to people in the medical world who are interested in maintaining the principle of teaching hospitals on the voluntary system.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that with a view to criticising the Bill.  There is nothing further from my mind, but what I do say is that the matter requires further clarification.  If the recommendation of the Hospitals Commission that there should be a sectional development of the Mater and Richmond Hospitals is carried out, then you will have a certain number of beds added <Col N="1680" /> to the existing Richmond Hospital. The extra beds can be carried on with the aid of a voluntary medical staff. You will have the same practitioners as before giving attention to the needy sick in the same manner as before, teaching the new students who come along and maintaining the old principle, so long in operation amongst the medical profession in the country. But once you change the site of the hospital, or go to an area where students cannot be taught with ease, to one in which the doctors will be unable to give their voluntary services, then the whole principle behind the recommendations of the Hospitals Commission will be changed.</P>
    <P>I would like to read for the House an extract from the report of the Hospitals Commission of 1933-34.  At page 80 in their report, in the last paragraph they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Mater and Richmond Hospitals, Dublin, the development of which is contemplated, on their existing sites, are examples of hospitals where <i>sectional development</i> could be allowed to proceed without putting too great a strain on the Hospitals Trust Fund.  Should the final scheme for these hospitals prove impossible of attainment, through lack of funds, this sectional development would not result in wastage, as under any circumstances the improvements are urgently required, and improved hospital facilities would be secured. In the case of hospitals whose schemes of development involve the erection of their buildings on new sites, it would of course be inadvisable to allow such schemes to proceed immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have a clear recommendation from the Hospitals Commission. I understand also from the people in the medical world that it is envisaged as being possible to build section by section a new hospital on the present Richmond site with about 550 beds, if an arrangement could be come to between the Grangegorman Hospital and the Morning Star.  I understand that it is very possible that such an arrangement could be come to.  If that <Col N="1681" /> is the case, the Parliamentary Secretary would be carrying out the recommendations of the Hospitals Commission in so doing.  He would be preserving the voluntary system of teaching hospitals, one that has a great tradition in this country, and at the same time he would be going far to relieve the minds of people in the medical world.  I again want to say that I am not in the least criticising the Bill.  I am simply asking for a clarification of the position. If the Parliamentary Secretary desires to create a large new hospital in an entirely new area, far from any institution in which teaching is undertaken, and with a staff that has to be paid from funds of one kind or another, it is obvious that that should be done in an entirely separate Bill.  It is a separate principle that should be developed for a specific purpose.  It is the ambiguity that has arisen in connection with this Bill that has caused all this worry.  I want, in conclusion, to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he can assure the House that the voluntary principle will be maintained, and the board will not be asked to carry out such responsibilities as will entail their looking after and paying for a staff.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has succeeded in establishing a record in this House.  It is obvious that he has left everybody very much befuddled as to what exactly they are going to vote on here and what is going to be the result of our discussions. Deputy Norton said the Parliamentary Secretary did not make a case for the Bill.  He did not.  If his case does not reflect what is in the Bill, his Bill apparently does not reflect what he is going to do.  That is why there is so much demand for clarification. The Parliamentary Secretary spoke for a long time about the history of the institution we are discussing.  Deputy Cosgrave talked about some of the difficulties in passing through the transition stage.  I should like to keep my eye on the future when all this fog has passed and when the Minister's actions have taken place.  If the future is to be related to this Bill, then on the surface we are going to get a very astonishing thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> The Minister is going to take a hospital organism that exists at present, that has long established roots, and that has a very definite connection with the life of the city and with medical development and service in more ways than one.  He is taking power to procure a site and then to say to the people in charge of the present hospitals' scheme: &ldquo;Go and build your hospital on that site and the money will be provided from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I am going to issue orders of my own as to the type of board that is going to control that hospital in the future.&rdquo;  That is, that you are going to have a Ministerial decision as to a site and then you are going to have a Ministerial line of policy; he is the person who, by order, may say what kind of board is going to run that hospital, and he is going to select that board in his own way.  On the face of the Bill the Minister and the Minister's sweet will count for everything.  I take it from what Deputy Cosgrave said in his opposition to this Bill that what is purposed is not what is here.  At any rate, what is in the Bill is that the Minister can do anything he likes.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a very disastrous thing at this particular stage for the House to pass a Bill without knowing what exactly is in the Bill.  When we consider all the various things that must have been considered before the Bill was framed; the various discussions that must have taken place in relation to the medical staffs there and the ordinary medical work they are carrying out, in relation to the teaching side, and in relation to the side of this hospital's work that impinges on the treatment of the poor in the City of Dublin; and the discussions that, I take it, were carefully, fully and thoroughly gone on with, then the Parliamentary Secretary has given the House very little information.  In dealing with this matter I think we ought to have more information.  We do not want detailed information so much as a line on the principles that will guide him in bringing about the development of this hospital as a new hospital, or an extension of the old hospital, and the principles upon which <Col N="1683" /> the control of that hospital and the carrying on of its work in future will be carried out.</P>
    <P>To put the Bill before this House in its present state is absurd.  It is asking the House not only to discuss a local matter, but you might also say an individual matter; a matter dealing with an individual institution without stating the principles upon which the matter is going to be run.  I do not say that it is not an important thing. I think it is as important a thing from the point of view of principle as might come before the House.  When you take the general line of thought at present, here in Dublin we are appointing a manager who is going to be in charge of the City and County of Dublin. Then the political atmosphere is reeking with suggestions of vocationalism as a general scheme that is going to cure a lot of things that cannot be cured by mere politicians or democratically-elected institutions.  We talk about planning.  In the middle of all this talk about the importance of the control of everything in the City and County of Dublin by municipal machinery assisted or controlled by a manager, on the one hand, and planning in all directions on the other, as well as planning in the vocational line, here we get the Minister stepping into a very complicated and intricate situation and saying, &ldquo;This is a Bill to give the Minister power to do everything that he likes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill ought to be held up and not proceeded with in this House, at any rate, until the Parliamentary Secretary feels that he can take us more into his confidence as to what is going to happen.  If this hospital is going to be brought to Cabra, then a new situation is being developed here. It is a case of the Minister taking, for what reasons nobody can tell, the matter entirely into his own hands and working on lines dictated by his own mind.  It is ignoring some of the vital interests of the City of Dublin as far as the treatment of the poor is concerned. It is ignoring vital interests as far as medical education in the city is concerned.  It has been suggested <Col N="1684" /> that, if the hospital is taken to Cabra, the students will not go there.  The reactions are going to be wider than that.  At present the teaching hospitals have a difficulty in catering for the number of students attending them. If the Richmond Hospital is going to be removed, then not only is the Richmond Hospital going to be deprived of the status of a teaching hospital, and the students of the additional facilities given there, but the other hospitals in the teaching group are going to have their teaching work made even more difficult than at present.  In the interests of the students, and particularly of the senior students, it would be a disastrous thing if the difficulties of the teaching hospitals in regard to overcrowding were to be increased. Then, on the purely medical side, there are difficulties no doubt that would be created by the removing of the hospital.</P>
    <P>In regard to these matters I think we ought to get some more information as to what is the Minister's intention. Is he going to ignore the facilities provided by the Richmond Hospital for the treatment of the poor in the City of Dublin?  Is he going to ignore the reactions on medical education in the city if the hospital is going to be removed outside the city?  Is he going to ignore the reactions on the medical practitioners who will be carrying on their work in that hospital?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that it is not overstating the position so far as this House is concerned when I say that this is a Bill, on the superficial proposals in it, for which no case has been made; that it is setting up a hospital that will be a purely Government hospital, controlled by the Minister, and, on the other hand, it is a Bill that does not really disclose what its intentions are.  In a matter that reacts in such an important way on Dublin City, and on various interests in the city, he should explain why his proposals are being presented in this way, and give the House some idea what his plans are.</P>

      <P>Outside what was provided in maternity hospitals, I am not aware that additional beds were provided in the city hospitals, for medical and surgical patients.  That was the reason I said I gave a sigh of relief on hearing that something was going to be done.  I suggest that the Richmond Hospital should not be removed from a position where it is catering for a very large number of deserving people in a working-class district.  If students are sent to Cabra they will be four miles from Phibsboro' corner. There are no restaurants or shops there.  That should be taken into consideration. <Col N="1686" /> These students may have only an hour or an hour and three-quarters for lunch or tea.  To ask them to come into the city, and pay bus fares, means that the hospitals are not going to get as many students. The workers will also have a grievance. While the Minister can make a good case for Cabra, being a very beautiful area, with plenty of sunshine, I suggest he should bear in mind that there is need for a home for incurables in that area.</P>
      <P>Those who know how difficult it is to get a person into the incurable hospital on the south side of Dublin, consider that there is urgent need for another incurable home, and the Cabra area should be suitable for that purpose. I wish to correct a statement that was made by Deputy Norton.  In drawing attention to a reference to Cabra, and the residents there being catered for by the Mater Hospital, he said it would be just like telling an unemployed person that the Gresham Hotel provided meals for non-residents.  I do not think Deputy Norton meant that reference to apply to the Mater Hospital, because that hospital is doing glorious work, and has more than its share of non-paying patients.  As Deputy Childers pointed out the medical and nursing staffs there are on duty at all hours of the day and night, attending without fee or reward to the very large number of patients that attend there.  I visit the Mater Hospital very often and I see people there who are not able to pay.  There are patients in the Mater Hospital who are not expected to pay. I want to say of the Mater Hospital that the poor and unemployed who cannot pay get the best of attention there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would happen in the area in which the Richmond is now situate if the hospital were removed?  What is to become of the very large number of dispensary patients who visit it every morning?  The Richmond Hospital is full at present.  I am in touch with the hospital and it is only a few days since I got a patient in there.  The authorities in the Richmond Hospital have been most kind and attentive to <Col N="1687" /> the people of the city.  I know of instances where the Richmond Hospital, although over-crowded, removed some patients to certain hotels in the vicinity, in order to make room for others who required immediate attention. Patients who attend the dispensary daily are repeatedly advised to go into hospital for a few days' treatment.  If the hospital is removed to Cabra what would happen to these people?  It would be impossible for them to attend the proposed new hospital. Very often relatives object to going a distance to visit their friends. We all know that relatives of patients influence them regarding the hospitals to which they should go for treatment Patients will be inclined to say: &ldquo;I do not want to go so far away.  I will not be able to see my friends there, and it will be lonesome.&rdquo;  Dublin is in need of a hospital similar to the Mater, Sir Patrick Dun's or Mercer's, but it is wanted in that part of the city where the Richmond is at present doing such splendid work.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to change his mind about the provision regarding the present Richmond Hospital.  I understand that there is plenty of room for development in that district.  If the hospital is removed I do not know what will happen patients who now attend there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle Mr. P.S. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a very interesting review of the work of what is known as the Richmond Hospital. I think if the Richmond Hospital has excelled in the work it has done for the sick poor of the city it is principally in connection with the expert medical treatment it has provided for many centuries.  It is a pity now to change it if the intention is to join up the three hospitals.  If the additional ground necessary to enlarge the hospital can be secured it should be secured in the heart of the city, and around such a populous district as the one in which the present hospital is situate.  It would be a calamity to transfer the work of that hospital to the outskirts of the city.  That has been impressed upon the Parliamentary Secretary by previous speakers and I <Col N="1688" /> trust he will take some notice of their criticism.  In his statement the Parliamentary Secretary did not refer to the number of free beds that will be available when the addition to this hospital is made.  I wish to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that there are many chronic cases in hospitals in the city which very often have to be transferred to St. Kevin's.  Some extra provision should be made for such cases in any modernising of the hospital system that takes place.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the amount of hospital-extension work done in the past few years, but I am not at all satisfied that sufficient attention has been devoted to the question of the provision of hospitals in the cities.  I do not say that merely for the purpose of criticising, but because I think it is wrong to remove the hospitals outside the cities as, I think, is the intention in this case.  The same applies to other cities. I think the hospitals ought to be in the hearts of the cities, save in an exceptional case.  I know of the good work done throughout the country in building new hospitals.  Everybody must admire that work, but I think that the policy of having the hospitals removed from the populous areas is a mistaken policy.  It involves also a certain amount of extra expense and thus imposes a burden on the State or the local authority.  References have been made to the constitution of the board.  I do not know what the Minister's intention is as regards the number to be appointed on the board, but I think that some recognition ought to be given to those who have carried on this work for years.  With many of them it has been a tradition and I do not think that they should be cast aside or prevented from continuing that good work by a mere stroke of the pen.  If the Minister elucidates some of the points I have mentioned, it is not my intention to oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of interesting points, calling more for investigation than for critical comment, arise on this stage of the Bill.  In the first place, I should like to deal with <Col N="1689" /> the question of the site.  It is understood that the proposal is that the hospital itself should be removed to a site at Cabra.  As I read the Bill, I can see no provision for having in any other area an out-patients' department.  The only provision for acquisition or retention of land by the Minister is in respect of an area adjacent to the site of the new hospital.  If the site of the new hospital is to be in Cabra, it seems to me that the phrase used in the Bill rules out the possibility of what was regarded as almost a certainty&mdash;that the out-patients' department, catering for those who at present attend the dispensary attached to the Richmond, would remain as it is.  If the whole outfit&mdash;intern accommodation and the out-patients' department&mdash;is to be removed to Cabra, a certain amount of hardship will be created for those who visit the out-patients' department of the Richmond.  Those in number are a considerable body of the citizens.  The Hospitals Commission, which reported in 1933, indicated that the attendances at the out-patients' department of the Richmond totalled 25,000.  That does not mean 25,000 individuals.  The same persons might attend over and over again but 25,000 attendances were registered.  If that means only 5,000 or 6,000 persons attending at the out-patients' department, there will be a hardship if they have to travel to Cabra&mdash;which they will hardly do&mdash;or if they have to resort to some other out-patients' department in the neighbourhood. That resort will not be to Jervis Street, because the out-patients' department there is overcrowded.  At the time that there were 25,000 attendances at the out-patients' department at the Richmond, the attendances at Jervis Street ran to over 40,000.  If the idea be, as at one time it was understood to be, that the hospital proper be removed to Cabra but that facilities for out-patients still remain somewhere about the site of the present Richmond, in the main the objection to the site would disappear.  Undoubtedly, some further accommodation would be required in connection with the teaching institutions.  If students have to walk the new hospital and attend lectures at any of the three teaching institutions, some facilities will have to <Col N="1690" /> be provided.  With the new means of transport&mdash;even if it costs the student something extra&mdash;accommodation can be provided.  Some change may be required in the hours of the lectures at the different colleges, but that can be arranged if the new hospital attracts a sufficient body of students as a teaching hospital.</P>
      <P>The Bill is, of course, completely away from the recommendations of the commission.  The commission recommended the rebuilding of the Richmond Hospital on its present site. Some other proposals were put to them which they did not favour.  Finally, a proposal similar to that in the Bill was put to them, with the distinction that the out-patients' department was to remain where it is, and they flatly and decisively turned it down.  They gave reasons for so doing and these reasons should be attended to by the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply. A body which was supposed to have specialised qualifications, and which was set up to report upon this matter, amongst other matters, reported decisively against this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter that arises is that of costs and funds.  Nothing is causing so much curiosity and, possibly, disquiet as the question of where the moneys are that were supposed to be accumulated through the Hospitals Sweepstakes and lodged in certain accounts for future paying-out to these hospitals.  Questions were asked in this House about these matters and they only met with evasions.  There is considerable curiosity and a fair amount of anxiety in the city as to where, in fact, the £8,500,000 supposed to be available for better hospital accommodation is, whether it is there at all or, if it is there, whether it is in such a form that it can easily be loosened as and when required.  It is quite obvious to anybody who knows the situation of the country that, if £8,500,000 were invested in any of the ordinary securities of this country, an attempt to cash out even £500,000 of this sum would probably prove disastrous.  It would cause a considerable fluctuation in the value of the particular holdings to others who had to hold on to them.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1691" /> Secretary and the Minister were, from time to time, given an opportunity to say not exactly where all these funds are but to mention the main places where they are held.  Up to date, all we have had is a certain number of evasive answers such as: that it was not considered good policy to give information in connection with matters in control of an outside body. The Parliamentary Secretary was asked if he would privately give such information and he gave an assurance that he would do that.  I have not heard that that has been done. Possibly, the Parliamentary Secretary will now fulfil the promise he gave a Deputy that he would inquire and let him know as a private individual where these funds at present reside. Let us assume that there are moneys in hands and that these moneys can be loosened up without causing any great disruption of the country's finances.</P>
    <P>There is, to me, one overshadowing feature in connection with this Bill. It is only the extension of a policy which we have seen proceeding apace since the present Government came into office.  The Government have gone into all sorts of things, not always with the greatest success.  They were dealing with bogs or peat at Ticknevin; they had dealings in dead meat also. Perhaps no useful purpose would be served by going through the whole list of their failures.  They were in all sorts of things that Governments would be better off not to have any connection with.  They are now going to deal with hospitals.  We have three measures running their course through the House which indicate the advancement of this particular type of mind.  For instance, we have a Bill about advanced studies.  That is going to be a matter in which the Executive Council are going to interfere at every turn.  We are going to have county management; the work is going to be done through county managers, but it seems clear that it is definitely going to be a matter for the Government and for a particular Minister.  Now we have this proposal in regard to the hospitals.</P>
    <P>As far as this Bill goes, it may work <Col N="1692" /> out in either of two ways.  It may give complete freedom to the hospital authorities&mdash;and that would be as I desire.  On the other hand, the Bill undoubtedly affords an easy opportunity of interference by the Government, or an officious Minister could intervene at every hand's turn. Throughout the Bill phrases are numerous indicating that the board, once appointed, may not do various things without the consent or the concurrence of the Minister, or a couple of Ministers.  So long as there are phrases in the Bill there is the possibility of the fullest Government control being exercised.</P>
    <P>The Minister will arrange for the appointment of the board.  He can decide the whole scheme of organisation of the new board, the number to be on it, and the method of appointment.  I should not have minded the Government starting the institution and then letting it sail along under conditions that would be set down; but there is a sub-paragraph to the effect that whatever the Minister does by an order he can next day withdraw or amend, and he can put a series of fresh proposals for the building up of the board.  In fact, he can call upon the members of the board for their resignation at any moment.  That power may not be used in the way in which the phrase sets it out, but it is possible it may be used in the way I have suggested.</P>
    <P>There is clearly one thing which is taken out of the board's hands altogether, and that is the appointment and dismissal of officers and servants.  Neither an appointment nor a dismissal can be achieved without the consent of the Minister.  I wonder how far does that term carry?  So far as servants, in the sense that they are porters or gatekeepers or persons of that type are concerned, one can understand the proposal; but the point is, does it go to the extent of including nurses, resident surgeons, resident medical people, honorary visiting physicians and surgeons?  How far does the phrase extend?  If it goes very widely, and if it is intended to include the appointment or dismissal of any member of the staff, then I think it is the most unwholesome and <Col N="1693" /> undesirable type of procedure that could possibly be established.</P>
    <P>I expect the answer to this objection will be that at the moment the appointment of some of the staff of the Richmond Hospital requires the assent of the Minister for Local Government. That comes down from olden times.  It comes from the time when the hospital, to a great extent, depended upon Parliamentary moneys. There was a view held that where money was provided by public grants to any institution of this type, then something in the nature of control of the institution should be effected by public representatives.  It is a long time since the Richmond and the Hardwicke Hospitals were founded. Even though we can trace back to a period when there was possible a particular form of Government control, the fact is that that Government control was rarely used and was almost obsolete.  As a matter of fact, it has become obsolete and it is rather anomalous that, in the year 1940, we should start off in circumstances under which this hospital is not going to get what in the ordinary way would be called public moneys and put it, as far as legislation can put it, under the control of a Government Department. Even if that answer be given, I suggest that the passage of time has rendered the analogy that may be founded on the old situation, when the hospital was constructed, completely out of date.</P>
    <P>The modern situation with regard to hospitals and educational institutions is, broadly, that if the Government give anything of the taxpayers' money, they may intervene in relation to the formation of the lines upon which the hospital or other institution ought to proceed, directing it in its first years and, having launched it, then letting it swing along for itself afterwards. That is not what is set out in this Bill. It may be what is intended.  There have been countless examples where pieces of legislation were brought in here containing powers capable of being used in two ways, in a way that would commend itself to those prepared to support the proposal, or in the opposite way.  Those who expressed <Col N="1694" /> some fears were generally lulled into a false sense of security. They were told that, so far as the phrases were concerned, the intention was that the legislation would be operated in a particular way.  In a few years changes of government may occur and people with totally different ideas may operate along the lines in regard to which fears were originally expressed.  It is not much use if the Parliamentary Secretary tells us what his intentions are.  If he gets those intentions agreed to by the House the Bill should be moulded so that the matter cannot be arranged in any other way than along those lines and in accordance with the intentions that are expressed.</P>
    <P>Before we vote even on the principle of this Bill we require an explanation of some things.  Have the Government appreciated the difficulties, which apparently the Hospitals Commission did, of removing this institution from its present area?  If they have appreciated the difficulties, how is it proposed to have them met?  Has there been consultation with those who are primarily concerned?  Is there a proposal to split the hospital, as it were, and have the out-patient department left where it is, with better accommodation, and the in-patient department removed to Cabra?  If that is the situation, has any special provision been made?  Will there be any special ambulance provision for the removal of patients to the outskirts of the city?  From the point of view of the students and the staff, and their association with the teaching institution, has there been any consultation in order to ascertain whether or not this matter is going to cause trouble? It seems to me that it will cause some trouble.  Has this matter been investigated by the people concerned; has it been ascertained what their opinion is, and if there is going to be any trouble arising out of the present proposal?</P>
    <P>With regard to finance, is the money there?  I am not speaking of the money for this particular measure. Is the £8,500,000 there and is the money in such a way that it can easily, from time to time, say in drafts <Col N="1695" /> of £250,000 or so, be freed so as to be available for those who are to interest themselves in these proposals?</P>
    <P>The overshadowing thing in this Bill is the position in regard to control. Will the hospital be under the control of the Government and is this the position, that the Government will exercise some supervision and control over the board and will insist on the board following some lines of development that may be set out?  How far does this phrase about officers and servants carry?  Even if the board is to be under the control of the Government, how far are the members of the board, irrespective of any fundamental changes that may be imposed on them by a Government dissatisfied with their progress, going to have control of the nursing and the medical staffs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne (Junior) Mr. Byrne (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see any justification for taking the Richmond Hospital out of the present densely-populated area which it has served so faithfully for many years and sending poor people miles away to a place which, if they are unable to walk to it, they cannot reach without spending a small fortune on bus fares.  As Deputy Norton very correctly pointed out, when the patient has to be taken to the hospital a very expensive form of transport has to be used, that is a taxi as a rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present hospital is very convenient for no less than 75,000 of our Dublin citizens in the immediate vicinity.  According to the 1936 census the areas immediately surrounding the Richmond Hospital, without trespassing on outside areas at all which are catered for by other hospitals, had a population of approximately 60,000. There are probably now 70,000 to 75,000 people in that area and those people are to be deprived of the Richmond Hospital; if the rumours are correct they will have to go elsewhere.  That is most unjust.  I personally protest very vigorously here against the removal of the Richmond Hospital.  We are told that it would be difficult to build a new hospital in the site of the present one.  We are told that it would <Col N="1696" /> be necessary to build a 550-bed hospital and that it would not be possible to extend the present hospital to that number of beds.  I have been told on reliable authority and several Deputies have already mentioned it that plans are available for the erection of a 550-bed hospital on the present site.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government to withdraw their plans and to erect the new hospital on the-old-site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish to make one point.  This point has already been made by many of the previous speakers and that is the advisability of keeping the hospital on its present site.  Apparently there is some doubt as to whether a hospital could be erected on the ground available.  But there is no doubt in the mind of anybody who looks into it that there is sufficient space available in the neighbourhood to erect an ideal hospital.  I think we ought to hear from the Minister if a final decision has been reached on that point, because to my mind that is the essence of the whole Bill.  I would like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary when replying to deal specifically with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the debate on this Bill has been based on the assumption that the Ministry had already reached a decision that the new hospital would be built in Cabra or in the Cabra district, and that in no circumstances would the new hospital be built anywhere else.  Various Deputies have stated that there are rumours afloat that a site has actually been acquired in the Cabra district.  There is no foundation whatever for any such rumours.  The Cabra district as a desirable district in which the new hospital might be situated has been discussed, but it is entirely misleading to suggest that a decision has been arrived at and that the hospital must be built in that area.  There are various objections. Most of these objections have been raised by some one or other of the Deputies.  Some of the objections have been raised by Deputies who spoke of the new hospital being on the outskirts of the city.  The attitude of the Ministry has been from the beginning and it still <Col N="1697" /> is that if a suitable site can be provided in or near the centre of the city they will not insist on the hospital being built out in the suburbs.  Deputy Norton spoke about the difficulties that might be experienced by the poor in finding their way out to the hospital in Cabra and the additional difficulties in the case of relatives who wanted to visit them.  He dealt with the difficulty that would be created by the hospital being located outside the centre of the city.  But it is well to bear in mind that the present density of population in the district in which the constituent hospitals are at present located may not continue in the future.  That area will in all probability be cleared.  Buildings and houses will have to be provided in other areas for the people who are now living in these congested streets in the neighbourhood immediately surrounding the present hospitals. Taking the long view it might be wiser to go outside the congested districts when securing a site for the new hospital.  For example, the city may develop and develop rapidly and extensively in the Cabra district, and the people who are now so anxious to remain near the present site may find that the density of population has moved out to a different part of the city altogether and that it would have been wiser to take the long view now when considering sites for the hospital.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Byrne will allow me to continue I will cover most of the points troubling him and the various points that have arisen.  I merely mention some of the considerations that have arisen with regard to the question of selecting the site for the new hospital.  When that question is under consideration Deputies might remember there are two sides to it and that the Minister must try to take the long view.  Deputy Cosgrave and, I think, Deputy McGilligan, perhaps not so emphatically, adverted to the possibility of an adverse effect in going out from the centre of the city and the <Col N="1698" /> possible effects on the new institution as a teaching concern.  Deputy Cosgrave asked if it was the Minister's intention to stop the hospital as a teaching hospital.  Well it certainly is not.  I would look upon it as nothing short of a calamity if the new hospital should cease to be a teaching hospital.  I have no doubt whatever that when all the points for and against the present site are put before the Ministry they will get the most careful and sympathetic consideration.  The Minister is not tied to the Cabra site nor to the present site, nor to any particular site. He will ultimately select the site that appears to be best in the interests of the city&mdash;and of the poor of the city.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested that, on account of its teaching traditions and of the various men of fame in medical science who have been associated with the Richmond Hospital, its name should have been perpetuated in the Bill.  I can only say in reply that the name of the Richmond Hospital is not embodied in any statutory measure at the present time.  It is not known in law as the Richmond Hospital.  The Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke Hospital names are sentimental rather than statutory.  In law the institution is known as the House of Industry Hospitals.  We are merely amending the law, and if some of these institutions should continue to be known in that way, if people have a sentimental feeling about them, and think they should continue to be known as the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke Hospitals there is nothing in law to prevent that public feeling finding expression.  But, so far as this Bill is concerned, we are only substituting the name of Saint Laurence O'Toole for the House of Industry.</P>

The present Minister has not been in office for 18 years, but his predecessors in office enjoyed exactly the same powers that the present Minister enjoys.  In this Bill the powers sought are substantially less than the powers the Minister has to-day under the Act of 1856, and less than the powers that the Viceroys of ancient history in this country have enjoyed in a past generation in regard to this particular institution. Why, when a Bill such as this comes before the House, the present Minister should be asked to divest himself of powers that the Viceroys of old enjoyed, and that previous Ministers for Local Government enjoyed, is something that I cannot understand.</P>

      <P>He had not half enough. The Deputy asked if it was proposed to associate the staff with the board of governors.  It is.  I think that the points that the Deputy advanced in favour of that do not need any further emphasis.  Undoubtedly, it will be extremely useful to have the advantage of their specialised knowledge.  I think it is essential that members of the staff should be associated with the board of governors.  Deputy Norton said the Bill was designed to change the site of the present hospital.  I think I have said enough on that already. The Bill was necessary in order that a site might be provided, for the simple reason that the present board of governors have no statutory power to acquire land.  I think everyone will agree that, wherever the new hospital is to be built, even if it were to be built adjacent to the present site, additional land would have to be acquired for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers suggested the possibility of sectional development, building a portion of the new hospital now and moving on by degrees over a long period of years until the entire building had been erected.  That, undoubtedly, is a possibility, but whether the hospital is to be built in sections, or whether the whole undertaking in connection with it is to be embarked upon at the one time, the Bill is still necessary in order to provide the necessary machinery: to set up a board with statutory authority to build the hospital and giving the Minister power to acquire land for the purpose.  As to the possibility mentioned by various Deputies of agreement being reached between the authorities of Grangegorman Mental Hospital, the Morning Star and the present board of governors of the Richmond, Whitworth and <Col N="1701" /> Hardwicke Hospitals, I have no doubt that if they reach agreement as to a site and present the Minister with such an agreement, and if the site appears to be reasonably satisfactory, the Minister will be glad to see a suitable site provided in or near the centre of the city as the title of the Bill suggests.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle wanted to know how many free beds would be maintained.  There is no such thing as free beds in the Dublin hospitals at present.  The beds are either paid for out of the Hospitals Trust Fund or by local authorities.  I think it is entirely a misnomer to refer to them as free beds.  But the main purpose of the new institution, as of the present institution, will be to serve the needs of the poor.  The local authorities' patients and poor patients will have first claim on any beds provided in the institution.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested by various speakers that in the constitution of the new board recognition should be given to members of the old board who have given long service to the present institutions. I have no doubt that when the Minister comes to set up the new board he will be very relucant to pass over the name of any member of the board who has taken an actual live interest in the affairs of the hospital.  I do not think there will be any difficulty on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of closing, and the possibility of retaining an out-patient department, or, perhaps, continuing certain portions of the existing institutions after the new hospital has been provided, these matters will be safeguarded in amendments which I propose to submit to the House on the Committee Stage.  As I said in my opening statement, it may not be possible, or it may not be desirable, to close down the present institutions even when a new hospital has been provided.  There may still be an acute <Col N="1702" /> shortage of beds, and it may be necessary to keep, in whole or in part, the existing institutions over a period.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary deal with the question I raised, namely, the question of including in one Bill the principle of a voluntary hospital and that of a hospital which may have to be run by a paid staff?  There is fear in medical circles that, should the hospital be built in Cabra, it cannot be operated by a voluntary staff and that it will necessitate a paid staff.  There are two separate principles, one of which is not associated with the present Richmond Hospital management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is my fault or the Deputy's, but I confess I do not clearly follow what the Deputy has in mind.  The Deputy will correct me if I am not properly interpreting him, but, as I understand it, he has in mind the possibility that if the new hospital is built in Cabra, it will not be possible to secure a sufficient honorary staff to work it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that it is necessary to provide for such a contingency in the Bill.  In the first place, I doubt the wisdom of discussing a contingency that may not arise.  If the hospital is in fact built in or near the centre of the city, or contiguous to the present site, the difficulties that the Deputy has in mind will not arise. <Col N="1703" /> But if, having considered all the various aspects of the matter in conjunction and in consultation with the board of governors, it is finally determined that the hospital should be built on the outskirts of the city, I think that by arranging a special system of transport the students could be got out to the new hospital.  I doubt very much if, by reason of the fact that the new hospital was built on the outskirts of the city, you would not be able to get a voluntary staff in future.  It is quite possible that you would not; but I am by no means convinced that you would not get your honorary staff in much the same way as your would get it nearer the centre of the city, especially if arrangements can be made for the transport of students from the centre of the city out to the hospital for teaching purposes.  In any event, the out-patient department would be maintained in the present buildings no matter where the hospital is situated, so that there would be that degree of contact, at any rate, with the material that would be useful for teaching purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary misunderstands me.  What I want to emphasise is this, that a very large number of people in the medical world who are associated with the voluntary hospitals are very anxious that there should not be associated with any one of these four hospital groups any scheme which will eventually involve payment of a staff, as distinct from a voluntary staff.  They feel that they should be kept absolutely distinct.  They see the possibility of that in one of the alternatives which might arise in connection with the development of this hospital.  What I want the Parliamentary Secretary to say is that he realises the importance of not confusing or mixing up two fundamentally different methods of operating.</P>

      <P>As to the desirability of having these two boards in operation <Col N="1705" /> and the passing out of one and the coming into office of another, that ought to take place at the earliest possible moment.  There should not be two special meetings.  So far as the Bill is concerned as it stands, and that is all we are concerned with until we see the amendments, one hospital is to open and another hospital is to close at a precise moment.  If that is the case, obviously there is some furniture in one hospital which is going to be closed which might be useful in the new one.  It is not going to be used. It certainly could not be used with two boards in operation.  If you had a single board it is possible that it could.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to vote against this Bill, mainly for the reason that I think the method proposed in it to improve certain local government <Col N="1709" /> services will not effect the desired result.  The Local Government Act of 1898 operated very successfully for 20 years.  On the whole it gave a general measure of satisfaction.  If in the subsequent 20 years there was not a similar degree of satisfaction, that was due to two reasons, the first of which was the suspension of the operation of the district councils and the amalgamation of services that they performed under boards of health.  That was the first advance in the way of amalgamation in recent years.  In this Bill it is proposed further to amalgamate these services and to advance a further stage in centralisation.  In other words, to put duties now performed by the boards of health under one particular individual.  If our experience of centralisation generally was extraordinarily satisfactory there might not be the opposition that there is to this proceeding, but we have not had any extraordinary satisfaction.  The tendency to centralise applies even to the duties that fall to Deputies of this House.  There is a tendency to take away the powers that we have and to centralise them.  I would not refer to that now, but the danger is there. Those of us who are in opposition to the Bill do not believe that centralisation will be a cure for all the ill results that arose from the operations of boards of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the methods of curing these ills would be to get back to the system that obtained when local government functioned successfully&mdash;the system of district councils or something similar. Certainly, the move should not be in the direction of further amalgamation or centralisation.  We are going too far in the direction of centralisation.  The original Bill failed not because of any great faults contained in it but because, in recent years, the tendency was to make members of local bodies followers of one political party or another.  That was one of the things that upset local government.  There were no less able men in this country in the last 20 years than there were in the previous 20 years.  In the previous 20 years, local government functioned, to the satisfaction of the majority of the people, under the Act <Col N="1710" /> of 1898 which we amended some years ago and which we propose further to amend today.  It certainly functioned to the satisfaction of the people who contributed the greater part of the expense: I do not want to insult the citizens of the past 20 years by saying that there was not as much intelligence amongst them as there was amongst the people of the previous 20 years.  Local elections were, however, turned into political conflicts.  The boards were mainly political and work that was done without reference to politics in the past took on a political aspect. These are things that militated against the success of the local councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving two reasons.  The Act of 1898 functioned successfully for 20 years.  Then, the councils were made political.  I shall not get into acrimonious discussion with anybody by saying who was responsible for that.  Deputies know that it took place.  We should have common agreement now that there would be no such thing as political advantage in the local councils.  I speak for myself but I am sure members of my Party would agree to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing that we should drop politics in local administration. I do not agree that the proposals in this Bill will lead to improvement in the administration of health services.  Our experience has been that the system of district <Col N="1711" /> councils, where a small body had the care of a small district, operated more successfully than did the subsequent method of putting the whole direction of these matters in the control of one body, consisting of ten persons. If it failed under ten persons, is it more likely to succeed under one? Ratepayers, generally, are interested in local bodies as to (1) the efficiency of these bodies in looking after the poor and (2) their success in keeping down the rates.  If I thought that this Bill would have these two effects, I would vote for it.  I do not believe it will have either.  I do not believe it will lead to more efficient or more economic working.  I am completely opposed to further centralisation.  We have had experience of the gradual development of centralisation over a period of eight or ten years.  That development has been so great that some of the former functions of Deputies in this House have been taken out of their hands and are now effected by resolution.  If we advance further, we will reach very dangerous ground.  I am not, by any vote of mine, going to help in the development of a situation in which everything will be centralised under a department of civil servants, with a Minister at its head.  We may criticise local bodies&mdash; I have criticised them as much as any man&mdash;but they often took a useful stand against the central body.  When special expenditure was proposed by the central department, the local body oftentimes stood out against it, with good results to the community.  Is the same stand likely to be made on behalf of the people by a manager?  I do not believe it will.  I do not believe that there will be the same resistance by the manager to unwarranted expenditure proposed by the central body as there was by the councils.  That is one of the reasons why I propose to vote against this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced, we opposed it and sought to have the whole question of local government examined by a commission.  Never once during the course of the debate on this Bill did the Minister attempt to give the House one reason to show <Col N="1712" /> that it was urgent, that it was imperative to enact it at this stage or that any vital principle of local government would be endangered if the enactment of the Bill were deferred.  The Minister made no case for the Bill on the ground that it was urgent or on the ground that it had been recommended by anybody who had made an adequate review of local government.  So far as the public were concerned, the Minister could scarcely get two dozen people to come out and say they were in favour of this Bill.  Quite a number of members of the Minister's Party denounced the Bill.  Quite a number of members of the Minister's Party on local authorities denounced the Bill.  Quite a number of the boys organised in Cumainn said they did not want to have anything to do with the Bill, that it was leading to dictatorship and that it was in tune with some other undesirable developments they saw taking place through the instrumentality of the Government.  Yet, a time of crisis which is labelled an &ldquo;emergency period&rdquo; by the Government is the time selected by that Government for the introduction of a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have preferred to have the whole matter of local government examined by a commission of persons with practical experience of the work of local authorities throughout the country who would be actuated by a desire to remedy any imperfections which might have been revealed in the administration of local authorities or in the manner in which their duties were discharged.  An examination of a matter of that kind would have enabled us to obtain comprehensive reports on local government a review of local government as it affected other countries, and an opportunity of ascertaining the reactions of a managerial system elsewhere and its prospects of success here.  But, instead of referring the matter to a commission to get some impartial examination of the subject, instead of fortifying himself with the report of a commission qualified to examine and report on the matter, the Minister took the most unusual steps of simply replying upon his majority to force through a Bill of this kind for which no urgency can be pleaded and <Col N="1713" /> which, I venture to say, on a free vote, the Minister could not possibly carry.</P>
    <P>We are now asked to pass a Bill, the sole purpose of which is to concentrate all the power of local government in the hands of county managers.  A member of a county council, a board of health, an urban council or a town commissioner, who feels that his function is to direct the secretary of the council, or the town clerk as the case may be, to do what the majority of the members desire, will, when this Bill passes, find himself in the position that in the future the secretary of the county council is going to tell the members what he is going to do and not what they are going to do.  In future the members of the council may pass any kind of a flummery resolution they like, but the secretary of the county council, acting as county manager, will say: &ldquo;I will consider that&rdquo;, and he may spend very little time considering it and he may give no reason whatever for refusing to carry out the expressed wishes of the majority.</P>
    <P>Members of county councils and other local authorities who vote for a proposal of this kind are voting to accept a position whereby in future the county manager appointed by and controlled by the Minister is to tell the members of the local authority that they must do what he tells them to do, that it is his policy that is going to be implemented and their function is merely to raise the rate, to sign the cheques and, within the ambit of the cheques, he is going to carry out such policy as he determines is best in the interests of the area in which he functions. The members of the county council will be left with puny functions to discharge, functions which have merited the condemnation of members of the Government Party here when analysed in relation to the work of the Dublin and Cork Corporations.  In future a member of a county council or urban authority will find himself in the position that he may be sent to that body by an overwhelming majority of voters, but when he gets there his power is merely to plead with and petition the county manager to do what an overwhelming majority of electors sent him in to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> The members of the councils in the future are merely going to be rubber stamps for the county manager and we can well see the possibility of unscrupulous use being made by county managers of the powers they are getting under this Bill.  The chief functions of the county councils in the future will be vested in the county managers.  They will be all-powerful. They are being given power in this Bill far wider than the power in existing legislation in cases where city managers function.  They will be given that power over areas in respect of which it is not possible for them to exercise control in any personal way. I will give the House one example. Under this Bill there is to be a county manager for Carlow and Kildare.  In addition to managing the county councils and the boards of health he will also manage the Naas Urban Council, the Newbridge Town Commissioners, the Athy Urban Council, the Carlow Urban Council and the Muinebeag Town Commissioners.  That is to be the function of one man.</P>
    <P>Is it not quite inconceivable that one man could possibly be able to take a personal interest in the wide and diversified matters which would require to be dealt with in respect of all that territory, involving an examination of urban problems one minute and rural problems another minute and possibly problems that are partly rural and partly urban?  He could not possibly carry out his functions over that area. He will probably appoint a number of subordinates and the subordinates will be just as impertinent to the members of the council as will the county manager under this Bill.  Anything that is done at one end of the county while the county manager is functioning at the other end will be done in the name and under the authority of the county manager.  His name will be utilised as the justification for doing certain things.  He cannot exercise any personal interest in the matters that will be dealt with by his subordinates.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is possible for the county manager system to work successfully on lines like that, and I still think it would have been far better if the Minister had this whole matter <Col N="1715" /> examined by a competent commission so that the House and the country might have a report from an authoritative body of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Bill, it seems to me, will have another effect.  It will weaken and deaden the interests of citizens in the machinery of local government.  One of the immediate effects of the Bill will be to make it increasingly difficult to secure worthy, public-spirited representatives to serve on local authorities when they find their only function there is to carry out the dictates of the county manager and perhaps express mild opinions on puny matters which no public representative, whose services were in demand by anybody, would waste his time dealing with. Local government and local councils will tend to become places in which will assemble people who have nothing else to do, because nobody wants their services.  Such people will be dragged in there in order to have the privilege of looking at the county manager and daring to petition him to do something for them, something in which they are interested.</P>
    <P>I think the whole effect of this Bill will be to kill a live interest in local government.  If we want to maintain a live interest in local government there are advantages in doing so.  But passing this Bill is not maintaining a live interest in popular democratic government. By its passing we are killing that interest and blunting that desire to maintain popular and democratic representation.  That is what a Bill of this kind is doing.  We have the Taoiseach telling us one day about the benefit of parish councils and the diffusion of authority involved in that; after that we have a spate of oratory about parish councils and then we get a Bill of this kind the very negation of all parish councils and the very negation of popular representative government to determine the conduct of municipal matters.  Instead of being allowed retain democratic institutions we are offered a Bill of this kind the effect of which is intensive centralisation.</P>
    <P>That sort of thing has gone on here particularly during the last ten years. <Col N="1716" /> We are now handing over to the county managers powers which they cannot possibly exercise themselves, powers which must be delegated to subordinates and powers which must be exercised without any regard to the viewpoint of the popularly elected representatives or to the desires of the people whose money provides the wherewithal to maintain local government in this country.  Deputy Bennett has rightly said that more and more our legislation is tending to take power out of the hands of the people.  To some extent it is, perhaps, inevitable in the complicated system of modern municipal government that power is being vested in departments.  In certain circumstances and under well-defined control power is given to do certain things by regulations.  But this is taking control out of the hands of the people and putting it into the hands of Ministers and country and city managers to exercise it in the way they desire.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another step towards taking away control and power from the hands of the people.  It is concentrating virtually the entire power of local government in this country in the hands of a couple of dozen managers who will be allowed to exercise powers in a wide sphere of activity, powers which up to the present have been exercised by public representatives.  I am opposed to this Bill because I think it is dictatorial in its conception and that its whole tendency will be to take a dictatorial line in local matters and to deaden interest in local government. To do that is to render a grave disservice to democracy and to public representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am opposed to this Bill, because I consider it is a danger in itself at the present time to take away power from the hands of the people.  At present everything should be done to encourage people to take an active interest in the government of their country.  But instead of that we find that power is now being exercised by the central Government and through them by civil servants and county managers.  Therefore, the people are losing interest in public administration <Col N="1717" /> and in governmental matters altogether.  It may be claimed that centralisation makes for efficiency. First of all, I would ask the people who say that to tell me why, if there is going to be centralisation of administration, if the power over local matters is to be centralised, should not the power over the raising of revenue be also centralised?  Why, if you are going to take the power of administering local affairs out of the hands of local representatives, should you not also abolish local taxation?</P>

      <P>If the Government are prepared to take such a course, if they are prepared to take over the administration of local matters and also the financing of local government, there might be something to be said for this Bill.  We have frequently heard the slogan &ldquo;No taxation without representation&rdquo;. In this Bill it is proposed to retain local taxation and to deprive the local people of representation, or at any rate to deprive them of all executive power in the administration. I think it is very foolish on the part of the Government to put forward a scheme of this kind of such far-reaching ramifications.  Does the Minister consider that a county manager sitting in the town of Naas would be able to administer efficiently the two counties of Kildare and Carlow?  Does he consider that a manager sitting in Naas would be able to understand and appreciate the condition of small fármers of the Wexford border at the foot of the Blackstairs mountain?  What knowledge would such a man have of their condition or of the condition of the small farmers living on the Wicklow border 50 miles from Naas?  He would have to depend entirely on his officials. He could expect very little help from the type of local councillors who would be elected under this Bill.  No decent self-respecting representative would be prepared to go forward and secure election, having regard to the fact that he would have no power.  The type of people who would secure election under this Bill, the type who will sit on local bodies under this Bill, will be the grovelling type of insect who would be <Col N="1718" /> prepared to serve a public official in control, perhaps in order to secure a favour from him.  Under this Bill it is intended that boards of health will be abolished.  It is intended that the mental hospitals will be abolished.  The only function that the local representatives will have in connection with the mental hospitals will be to billet the patients.  They will receive, probably, a certain amount of sympathy from those patients.  Those refugees of the democratic form of government will probably be welcomed into the mental hospitals as the only place left them.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a step towards the abolition of democratic government.  Instead of this Bill we should have had an attempt made to recast and improve the whole system of local government, and first of all to set about establishing, not centralising, local bodies.  We should be establishing bodies in every parish where the plain ordinary citizens of the country would have a chance of coming together and helping out in the administration of the country.  Instead of that you have the local administration centralised, and you certainly will have a very inferior type of people acting as representatives on the county councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this Bill on the Second Reading; I will not repeat now what I said on that occasion.  I see no reason to alter the opinions I then held.  What I have heard during the various stages since then has not made me change my views.  One of the matters I raised on the Second Reading &mdash;and it has some bearing on the Final Stage of this Bill&mdash;was that the Minister has stated that he intended to introduce at some future date another Bill dealing with local government elections, and so forth.  I regard this Bill as being a misnomer as the County Management Bill.  I think it could be more properly called the Local Government Bill of 1939, because its aim is to bring about a complete revolution in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is right that the House should be asked to pass this Bill without having the benefit of knowing what is in the other Bill that the Minister has told us is to be introduced later.  I think the two Bills should be <Col N="1719" /> read together and passed together.  We are being asked to pass this Bill which proposes to alter the entire system under which local authorities have been operating, with the knowledge that further legislation, which may have a very important bearing on this measure, is envisaged by the Minister. So far as I can see, what we are doing is: we are in this measure passing rules which will be operated later on by another Local Government Bill.  For that reason, apart from the other reasons which I indicated on earlier stages of the Bill, it would in my opinion be a very hasty judgment on our part to pass this Bill to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am opposed to the Bill.  I voted against it on every occasion it came before the House.  I have already given my reasons for my opposition to it.  Briefly stated, these were that I think it indicates a retrograde step.  It is a moving away from democratic government.  While I do not claim that the present local bodies are very economical or very efficient, I think it can be said of them that they compare favourably with some State Departments.  This Bill indicates a step towards centralisation, and I do not think that is justifiable.  The county manager could not possibly have the amount of local knowledge that local representatives possess.  He will be bound in any case to consult with the local bodies.</P>
      <P>The new county councils to be elected will be simply acting in an advisory capacity, so that instead of things being done above board, they will be done behind the door, and no report of them will go to the Press. The new bodies will at the same time have a certain influence, perhaps a sinister influence.  As some Deputies have pointed out you will not have men standing for election of the same type as the men on local bodies to-day. Men of the present type may go forward at first, but I venture to say they will gradually cease to do so when they discover that they are to be figureheads only.  That is a very dangerous and a very serious step to take, and one that is not likely to give good results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> As the last speaker has indicated, another Bill dealing with local government affairs is to be brought forward later.  I agree with him that both Bills should have been introduced together. Some people had thought that when this step was taken to relieve the local people of certain responsibilities in connection with local government, that it was really a preliminary to derating. That, however, does not appear to be the case.  This is piecemeal work, and I cannot see any good likely to arise from it.  I fear, however, that a great deal of harm may come from it.  I am opposed to this Bill because it is a step towards centralisation and away from democratic government.  It is not likely to lead either to efficiency or economy.  For these reasons I am opposed to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already spoken against the Bill.  As Deputies know, I am a member of a corporation and of several boards which are carrying on under a City Management Act.  One is therefore at a disadvantage in speaking on a measure of this kind, for the reason that it may be said that one's mind is prejudiced.  I have very good reasons for being opposed to this Bill. As I have said before, we here are not opposed to the principle of having a city or county manager, but what we feel is that he should be a manager for a council or a corporation rather than a manager for a county.  A county manager will not be responsible to public opinion in the same way that elected representatives are.  Also, in a sense, he will be completely independent of public opinion, and for that reason I think this measure will have a very serious effect on the civic spirit of our people in the cities and the counties. I venture to say that time will prove that our attitude of opposition to this Bill is well founded.  I have had experience of a city manager for the last five or six years.  I think there is a danger in having so much executive authority as is proposed in this measure, vested in one man.  Deputy Corry is a member of public boards.  I am sure I can rely on his support for the statement that a county manager, dealing with public health boards, mental hospital boards and other <Col N="1721" /> boards must feel that he is not responsible to public opinion in the same way as local representatives are.  He will have his mind and attention centred on the Department of Local Government rather than on the opinions of the people.  The result will be, I fear, that you will have loose things being done under that system.</P>
      <P>Much of our opposition to this Bill is due to the experience we have had of the City Management Acts.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that some of the things that have happened under the City Management Act, so far as Cork is concerned, are anything but satisfactory.  Cork County is a very large one, and I am at a loss to understand how efficient administration is going to be brought about under one man.  I think it would be far better if more executive authority were vested in the officers of the various boards.  We all know that public representatives in the past have given very good service to the people. They have always manifested a lively interest in everything that concerned the welfare of the people.  My fear is that you will not get men of that type to go forward for election to the different boards when this measure comes into operation.

      <P>When this Bill was introduced I was definitely opposed to it.  I have good reason to dread any further power being vested in Government officials, but events that have occurred in Cork County during the past few months have led me to believe that any change would be better than the system we have at present.  Deputy Hickey should be a very good judge of that.</P>

      <P>They certainly do not. He knows what happened during the past few months, and I had hoped that that would have made him view this Bill in a more favourable light, as it has made me.  We had a permanent <Col N="1722" /> officer employed under definite terms of appointment at a salary of about £250 a year, getting £700 or £800 more out of the ratepayers' pockets for work he was bound to do under the terms of his appointment.  It is to their credit that the members of the Labour Party on the South Cork Board of Assistance opposed that.  We had an individual appointed under definite terms of appointment, and bound under these terms to do certain work, coming before the board of assistance and claiming that, in addition to being paid for that work, he should also be paid fees amounting to £700 or £800, and the majority of the board, who should be the guardians of the ratepayers, voting for a thing like that.</P>

I am not in love with it by any means.  From what I have seen of the working of the Cork City Management Act I am not enamoured of the managerial system in any shape or form.  The city manager there, together with an official of the Department, without consulting any representative of the ratepayers, paid out £3,000 for a hospital site which was condemned in a few months' time by another official of the Department.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the money was paid without the knowledge of the corporation.  But I say that this is an improvement on the present position, as I see it, in County Cork.  I say that frankly and I am sorry to have to say it.  I have had experience of local bodies since 1924, when I first went on the county council, and I cannot see any great powers which are being taken over.  I remember, in 1925 or 1926, the Minister for Local Government sent an order to the county council as to the particular type of individual who was to be employed to break stones on the roads and as to the particular army from which he was to be drawn.  If the Minister, at that time, had power to send an order to the county council that a particular individual from a particular organisation was to get first preference on road work, you cannot give much more power than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

We have seen orders come down one week after another from the Local Government Department to do this and to do that, and letters refusing to sanction this and refusing to sanction that. The power was there all the time. What I have experienced in the past few months in local bodies in Cork County, at any rate, induces me to give my vote for this Bill.</P>

One Deputy said that Fianna Fáil Deputies who sit on county councils apparently, by some means, have been coerced into voting for a thing which they did not certainly enthuse very much about.  Deputy Corry is now a notable convert.  He talked in such a tendentious way that it is only possible to grope at what he is after.  If one could imagine his being guilty of trying to wangle something, one could imagine his speaking with the vehemence with which he spoke.  I do not know whether that was what was in his mind, but it sounds very much like it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to one matter in connection with past administration&mdash;an order sending ex-army men to work on the roads.  Why should that not be done?  They were given that work and they showed themselves equal to the task.  Deputy Corry was unique in his personal objection to that, but it has brought about his personal conversion.  The general arguments against the Bill are framed under two heads.  One has a certain amount of regret that the Act of 1898 is disappearing.  I believe this is the end of local government as started by <Col N="1726" /> that Act.  There were other arguments founded on the suggestion that it was in substitution for the old system, and that this Bill will not be as efficient. There is no reason why it should not be.  The Act of 1898 was passed when circumstances were different.  We were, to a certain extent, victims of another system and the people welcomed the Local Government Act of 1898 because it was the first thing that gave them an opportunity to disprove the contention that they were not fit for self-government. People availed themselves not merely of that Act but proved their capacity for self-government.  The present local government administration has fallen upon evil times recently and for obvious reasons.  The Government played havoc with it.  The Government interested themselves mainly in seeing that the local bodies were packed with politicians.  Once that came about, added to the additional voting that was provided, the capacity of these bodies was lowered.  We were to have adult voting and democracy ran riot.  The system, we were told, would not be representative until you had people of 21 years voting.  That was tried in Dublin, and enough was learned to see how evil it was.</P>
      <P>I am all for representative institutions, but I do not say that there is democracy in every institution that is set up in this way.  That is not democracy. It is democracy brought to an absurd point.  If the main institution is established on democratic lines, the people have control over it, and can change local government every time they please.  There is enough democracy in the representative institutions here.  We cannot have too much of these institutions.  I believe this Bill will make for efficiency.  I could never understand, in a country with a population of 3,000,000, with no great divergence in the way of climate and no great divergence in the temperament of the people, what makes it necessary to have ruling the same set of people multitudinous local bodies.  I believe you make for efficiency in getting the matter gripped by a limited set of men.  I do not see how that makes for centralisation.  If I thought it would tend towards centralisation my approval of the Bill would be lessened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> As far as I see, the managers that are to be appointed are free from the control of the Minister save the control the Minister has at present but he is not in a position at sweet will to dismiss a county manager.  A vote has to be taken first by the county council.  As I read the measure, the initiative in the dismissal of a manager must come from the county council, and the council must have a decided majority before it can put forward a proposal for dismissal. It may be said that the Minister will have greater control because he will have only 20 or 30 reports instead of those from multitudinous boards.  If he has, well and good. Remember in the background we have still representatives here who can question and attack the Minister on any of the matters that arise.  I believe the managers appointed will control things better.  There is no reason why they should not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has probably painted the picture on the other side too vividly.  He talked of a manager duplicating for Kildare and Carlow and having a number of institutions and authorities to grip.  I think he will grip them.  It is within the compass of a man, not a super man but an ordinary individual, to grip even the multitudinous affairs of the number of authorities now scattered over Kildare and Carlow There was never at any time need for such a number of authorities for two relatively small areas like Kildare and Carlow.  I see no reason why a county manager could not control the affairs of these counties, and, if he does, he is going to bring about a more ordered future as well as efficiency in every way.  At least, the Bill says that.  If you get bad people appointed the Bill will not achieve that object.  I do not believe there will be any more centralisation, and I would hesitate to vote for the Bill if there was.  We must remember that if we are trying to set up the city management system we have barely tried it in four places.  We are very definitely lacking in the progress made in that way in other countries.  In many parts of America, the cities are governed entirely by city managers.</P>
    <P>One of the faults I have to find with the Bill is that it does not go far <Col N="1728" /> enough.  It crosses the border-line in connection with local government.  I am sorry the Minister did not go further and immediately start a system of county managers.  I was not here for the whole of the debate, but I read what took place and I believe the main fault found by those with experience of local authorities was that you would not get hereafter the same people to put themselves forward for election as previously&mdash;once they find the limited power they have.  Having their powers limited, they will be still subject to odium as they will be asked about things that happened.  I believe, if that happens, you will get a clearing out of the best type&mdash;decent people who gave a vast amount of good service to local institutions.</P>
    <P>They were already disappearing once the county councils were subjected to political influence, once the voting age was lowered, and once it became clear that it was the intention of the Government to have political influence rampant.  Once that became clear, the people who gave the most unselfish services were definitely bound to go.  They will go faster now.  That is the disadvantage. When one sets out to frame a Bill, one must demolish first.  This is the demolition period.  I am sorry we have not gone in for demolition more radically.  I believe this Bill will ease the derating position.  If derating comes about, the county councils will have very little to do.  Once derating is accomplished, the Minister for Local Government must see that that is the essential corollary to derating.  When that happens, it makes it easier to remove certain objections in the future. There is one disadvantage in the measure.  I think it tends to break with local government as we knew it.</P>
    <P>I do not regret that, once local government had taken the downward swing it had taken, but I feel that something is going to disappear from life in this country that enriched it.  I do not know how many men in this Assembly and in other Dála made their mark first in the local authorities.  They got their chance there, and they made themselves known to the citizens around them.  They got a certain experience there, and they spoke with a certain <Col N="1729" /> amount of experience in this House which other people coming into the House in future will not have.  It is to be regretted that that training ground for this representative Assembly is about to disappear.  I think it will disappear. It can, of course, be rebuilt. It seems to me that there is place for some body which would form a background to the county manager.  Deputy Hickey will, I think, be proved a prophet.  Somebody will feel justified in coming forward in the future and introducing a Bill to provide something in the nature of an assembly in and about the county manager to give him something in the way of advice, though the powers given to the county manager in this Bill may not be taken back from him.  If you had some body in relation to the county manager in the position which the Seanad ought to occupy in its relationship to this body, you would get a group of people performing a useful function, and a useful training ground for this Assembly would be provided.  I regret the disappearance of local administration from that angle, but only from that angle.  The Bill will make for efficiency so far as the welfare of the poor, which is one of the objectives of local administration, is concerned, and it will give a better chance for economy. If we do not get that, it may be found that the fault lies in the personnel of the county managers.  It may be that there will be something lacking, but I think the scheme is good, and it is the scheme, and not the details of the scheme, that I personally approve of in voting for the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down spoke about efficiency and economy.  He mentioned three or four areas in which the managerial system has been operating for some time.  If Deputy McGilligan examines the position of the boards in these areas, he will find that rates are just as high as, if not higher than, they are under other boards throughout the country, and that the same complaints are being made by the ratepayers in these areas.  Deputy Corry's attitude this evening, and his efforts to whitewash himself and justify himself in voting for this Bill, have been very <Col N="1730" /> amusing.  He started off by saying that when this Bill was introduced, he was definitely opposed to it, but that he has changed his mind now in consequence of what happened within the last few months, or the last few weeks, at Cork County Council.  I do not know what has happened at Cork County Council to make Deputy Corry change his mind, but I do know that the Second Reading of this Bill was passed prior to Christmas.  That is more than three or four weeks ago.  I think Deputy Corry voted for the Second Reading, though I am not sure.</P>

Instead, his action is in keeping with that of other Fianna Fáil members. When you meet them in the Lobby they tell you they are against the Bill.  Yet they come in and vote for the Bill.  I have met members of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Council of Municipal Authorities and on the General Council of County Councils.  When resolutions were passed against this Bill, they voted with the majority and, in a great many cases, condemned the Bill in all its moods and tenses.  Perhaps I may refer to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis held some time ago.  I was told by a very prominent member of Fianna Fáil that the debate on this Bill there was closured and no vote taken.  I challenge the Minister to give us the voting on this Bill at the Ard Fheis.</P>

      <P>This Bill is described as a measure &ldquo;to make further and better provision for the local government of counties&rdquo;.  We have waited in vain during all the stages of this Bill to hear the Minister, or any of the Minister's supporters, indicate how that &ldquo;better provision&rdquo; was to be made.  Those who are interested in the Bill and who sat out all its Stages are still waiting for that information.  As I said on Second Stage, and as other Deputies said, one could understand the appointment of a manager if the manager was to be subject to the council.  When the Minister was closing the Second Reading debate, he chided me with being a member of a commission which was supposed to be in favour of the managerial system.  I said then, and I say now, that I am in favour of a managerial system.  On that commission we were dealing with the City of Dublin, and I was in favour, and am now in favour, of a manager for the City of Dublin, that manager being subject to the council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member of the commission did not make a separate report.  What I visualised and what Senator O'Farrell, who also represented the Labour Party on the commission, visualised was a council with a manager subject to it.  In the Bill before us, we have a manager of the different councils, not a manager for the councils.  That is what I object to. I say that it would be absolutely necessary in a city like Dublin to have a manager to do all the small things that require to be done, leaving the council free to attend to more important matters.  Under this Bill, the Minister is going to appoint so many little Napoleons for the different counties. The councils will have very little to do and, as pointed out by Deputy McGovern and Deputy Norton, you will not get the proper people to come forward for membership of the councils under this system.  They are not going to put themselves in a position in which they will have to plead with, and appeal to, the manager in connection with every little thing that requires <Col N="1732" /> to be done in their area.  It will be a perfect farce to elect a council under the conditions that will obtain when this Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>We heard a lot about reserved functions, but very few of the functions are reserved.  The Minister and other supporters of the Bill told us that the councils would have complete control of finance and that they would strike the rate.  The county manager will, I think, prepare the estimate.  I do not grumble at that.  But, if the rates go up, the council will be blamed, whereas, if the rates come down, the credit will go to the manager.  At one meeting in the year the elected representatives of the people will have control over the finances of the council inasmuch as they will be permitted to strike a rate in accordance with the estimate prepared by the manager; but the moment that meeting is over they will cease to have any connection, good, bad or indifferent, with the financial affairs of the council.</P>
      <P>In so far as the point made by Deputy Bennett is concerned, I think it is an important one.  I inferred from his statement that some time about 1923 local government legislation was introduced here and under it certain councils, notably rural councils, were abolished.  It was pointed out at the time that they were unnecessary and that the work they were doing could be done by county councils or county boards of health.  We now hear a different story.  I should like to point out that the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party at the time objected to those councils being abolished.  A different story is being told to-day, when a case is being made for a Bill of this kind.  We find that in consequence of the rural councils being abolished the county councils and the county boards of health are overburdened and now we are told that we must have county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is to determine, when this measure comes into operation, who is a fit and proper person to receive home help?  Is it suggested that the county manager will know each unfortunate poor person in a district, <Col N="1733" /> and will be in a position to form an opinion whether or not that poor person should get relief?  Anybody who has had anything to do with county boards of health or rural district councils or boards of guardians in this country during the last 40 years is aware that it is absolutely necessary to have the human touch, to be in direct touch with these people who have of necessity to apply for relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">

      <P>What about the home assistance officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the position in regard to the home assistance officers as well as I do.  If the Deputy has ever been a member of a board of health, he knows very well that councillors have had to fight a case against the home assistance officers; that the assistance officers do not always know all the details in connection with an application from a poor person, and time and again, in consequence of the representations made by members of the board, a case had to be fought against home assistance officers and relief was given.  That state of affairs will go on.</P>
      <P>I suggest this Bill was rushed through with indecent haste.  The Minister appeared to be anxious to get it through because of the growing volume of opposition to it.  Opposition was growing every day in the country, notably amongst the Minister's own supporters, who made themselves vocal through the medium of the local boards on which they served. The Minister was in such a hurry to get the Bill through that we were brought back for Holy Week in order to put it through different stages.  The Dáil hitherto has not made a practice of sitting during Holy Week, but the Minister, in his anxiety to get this Bill through, insisted that we should come back that week.  We were threatened that if we did not let the Bill through before Friday we would be brought back the following week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has persisted in the attitude it took up at the beginning. I suggested that there was no necessity for the haste shown by the Government.  We are against this Bill <Col N="1734" /> and, in spite of what Deputy McGilligan has stated, I still suggest that this measure is a negation of democracy, and the people will one day wake up and find themselves in the same position as they occupied prior to the enactment of the Local Government Act of 1898.  The passage of that Act through the British House of Commons was hailed as the dawn of freedom for this country.  We are all aware of the agitation through the country and the nature of the work done by the Irish Parliamentary Party at that time to ensure that the people would get democratic institutions established here.  I never thought I would see members of a Fianna Fáil Government, who professed such great democratic ideas ten years ago, fostering a measure of this kind.  I never thought they would be the people who would bring in a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some observations made by Deputy McGilligan with which I do not quite agree.  I had an amendment down to this Bill on the Committee Stage.  It was moved on my behalf.  I suppose anything I would say now would not induce the Minister to change his mind.  I believe the county manager will have to make himself conversant with every detail of county administration, and I should like to know how he is going to do that.  Let me take County Tipperary as an example.  We have there the North Riding and the South Riding. The following counties are smaller than the South Riding and yet they are to have a county manager: Cavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon and Wicklow.  In the case of Louth, Meath, Monaghan and Wicklow the population is about equal to that of Tipperary North Riding and they are to have a manager.  Even from the point of view of valuation I think there is every justification for asking that there should be a manager for both the North Riding and South Riding of Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certainly in agreement with the principle of the Bill, and I think it is time that such a measure was introduced. We may talk about democracy and local authorities and all that sort of thing, but I remember some very <Col N="1735" /> strange incidents happening in Tipperary in connection with the local government administration.  It is well known&mdash;I do not know if the present Minister is aware of it&mdash;that the letting of a cottage cost a labourer £30, and the gentleman who got it was sentenced to six months in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin.  One hears people talking about not wanting a Bill like this, but I think it is time we had it, from what I know of local administration, and I have been interested in it for quite a number of years.  As regards these supermen, as they have been called, let me say that the South Riding of Tipperary has been managed by a commissioner for quite a long time &mdash;the incident I have referred to was responsible for putting a commissioner there.  Quite recently the committee of the mental hospital got some plans drawn up for a new building.  The South Riding was represented by the commissioner and nobody had anything to say to it except himself.  The plans were drawn up, and reference was made to them here recently in connection with the architect's fees.  The estimated cost of the cowhouse was £15,000, and there was a bulls' house estimated to cost £700.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, if I cannot discuss that aspect any further I will deal with what I have been discussing, the administration in County Tipperary. <Col N="1736" /> Deputy McGilligan talked here about supermen.  It is well known that commissioners are supposed to be the next best thing, or at least equal to county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under what section would you put the bulls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what section, but all I can say is this that the plans were drawn up.  Of course they were rejected.  I see by the Press now that the ratepayers are being called on to pay for the architect's fees. In one case for drawing up plans for the bulls' house a fee of £700 was demanded and for the boars' house a fee of £800 was asked for.  Some local wag in the papers wanted to know had the architect provided for a toilet room upstairs in these houses.  However, the irony of it was that the local people were asked to pay for the drawing up of these plans.  Now, we in Tipperary were represented by a commissioner on that occasion.  I believe, myself, in the principle of this Bill.  I believe it will be worked as we hope it will, but too much responsibility is being put on the manager.  I have only just come into this House.  I am not half-an-hour here and, in driving here this morning, I touched on five counties: Tipperary, Galway, Laoighis, Kildare and Dublin. I could drive the same distance in my own constituency and will do it any day.  Now, can anybody tell me that a manager can gather all the details of that constituency?  I am not inclined to agree that he can.  I am not surprised by the fact that the county manager is there put over the head of another official.  I know that the officials manage the local bodies and the local authorities 99 per cent.  What is the use of putting another official over these officials?  Is that going to bring about the revolutionary changes that people visualise in connection with this Bill?  I believe that there is too much responsibility placed on the managers in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given my views with regard to the present administration in South Tipperary.  I have mentioned about the fees demanded by the architects for the drawing of plans which are never to be adopted.  If our Commissioner <Col N="1737" /> was a superman he should not have allowed these plans to be prepared. I know that the North Riding was represented on that committee.  I take this occasion to point out to the Minister what has happened in connection with these matters.  It is all very well to say, as was said about Deputy McGilligan, that he would manage them all.  He would gather the documents and figures before him.  But I would not be prepared to have that from a county manager.  He should have to point out to the board the work to be done or the work that could be rejected and it ought to be his duty to give reasons as to why he should reject the one or pass the other.  If he is to be responsible for the large area that is to be given to him under this Bill I do not see how he is going to be anything more than a rubber stamp.  Take the urban areas of South Tipperary. First of all there is Clonmel with a valuation of £22,000, Tipperary £12,000, Carrick-on-Suir £8,500, Cashel £4,500, making a total valuation of £47,000 odd.  In addition to that there are the urban areas in North Tipperary too.</P>
    <P>I suppose at this stage it is no use appealing to the Minister to look into this matter.  I have discussed the position with very prominent men in Tipperary, with men who understand the working of the local government business from A to Z.  I have not met anyone who is not in agreement with the principle of the Bill but I have met nobody who is in agreement with the idea of one manager and a subordinate. I appeal to the Minister even now when the Bill is going to the Seanad to accede to the request I am making and that is to have two managers for Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of entering into the personal element under this Bill.  I confine myself to dealing with the general principles which the Minister has introduced and which I feel it my duty to support.  I support the Bill because I feel that a complete alteration has taken place in local administration from the time when the turnpike trusts first started&mdash; even before that time there was something in the way of local government&mdash; down to the time when the Grand Jury <Col N="1738" /> administered or, perhaps, I should say mismanaged affairs on to the time when, in 1898, local administration was put on a regular basis.  I think we are all unanimous in saying that when the Act of 1898 was passed we had as fine an exhibition of local administration as could be found.  Local men were elected and they took their duty seriously.  The people elected their best men, men who had previously been in public life or had taken a very prominent part in the national administration. These men were put forward to administer the affairs of the county and they did their work well.  There was a Local Government Board which either sanctioned or refused to sanction their activities.</P>
      <P>At any rate there is this to be said, that the men who took part in the work in that period were absolutely sincere. Whether one can say that the successors of these men were equally sincere and efficient is a matter which the country will have to judge.  I am not in agreement with those people who say that the county managers, or the county secretaries or other officials appointed as managers will not be conversant with local affairs.  They as county secretaries were appointed by councillors.  In Cork, at any rate, we are agreed that when the county secretary comes to be appointed we will have in him a man who will be conversant with every detail in the affairs of the county; we will have a thoroughly efficient man who has been courteous to the members and true to his trust.  I believe when Cork comes to be administered we will be fortunate in having a man of that kind and that we will be equally fortunate in the assistant county managers, because one of them is now acting as commissioner for the affairs of Passage West, where he is drawing that particular urban area out of its involved difficulties.  The same can be said of our secretaries to the boards of assistance and boards of health in Cork County.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of men elected on those boards is very small.  There are ten men for each of the three boards of assistance or boards of health, and in the case of the South Cork Board this is supplemented by five members from <Col N="1739" /> the Cork Corporation.  When we bear in mind that prior to union amalgamation there were in the South Cork Board of Health area six rural districts each of which sent a large number of representatives to the rural councils, it can be seen what a lot of work falls on the present board.  We had then 200 to 250 men on these boards and yet the ten men on the board of health are now supposed to do the work more efficiently than the 250 members of the old councils did.  Each rural district was, of course, very much smaller than the area comprised by the boards of health at the present time.  Yet it is contended by Deputies here that those ten men would undoubtedly know more about the affairs of their area than the old representatives in the rural areas knew about theirs, and these ten men have much business of their own to do in addition.  The present officials are certainly very efficient men.  They were appointed as the result of a competitive examination, and if they did not prove efficient they were quickly got rid of.  I feel that we could not have better administration than what we are getting from the officials in the South Cork area.  On my proposal a rule was made that no home assistance would be granted unless it was first recommended by the superintendent home assistance officer who, naturally, had reports from his subordinate to guide him, as well as an opportunity of investigating each case himself.  That system has worked wonderfully well in the South Cork area.  An effort was made on one occasion to go back to the old system, but I am glad to say that no member was found in favour of doing so.  What I have described as prevailing in the South Cork area also obtains, I understand, in the North Cork and West Cork areas.</P>
    <P>I think that is a striking testimony to the officials concerned who have done their work wisely and well.  It is also a testimony to what the county manager can do.  He will have every facility in the matter of getting recommendations from his subordinate officials.  He will be in a position to get advice and reports from the county surveyor, the county medical officer of <Col N="1740" /> health, and the other principal officials, so that with a county secretary, such as we have in Cork, a county manager of that type will be able to give magnificent service, service equal to that given by the 68 members of the Cork County Council, which is a kind of miniature Dáil.  If any Deputy has ever paid a visit to the Cork County Council when in session, he will know that on occasions you have half a dozen meetings going on at the same time.  It is very difficult to do business under those conditions.  With quiet and ordered conditions, a county manager will be able to do much better work and much speedier work.  Under the present system, prolonged discussions are carried on on perhaps one or two items on the agenda.  It has often happened that items on the agenda have not been reached for 12 months.  Yet, in spite of that, we have men sobbing because it is proposed to take away some powers from the present bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because I am in favour of democracy that I am supporting this Bill.  I do not think it can be said that the local bodies are being entirely shorn of their powers, for the reason that the Department of Local Government will have to sanction practically everything that is done. The decisions taken by the local bodies at present have to be sent up to the Minister for his approval and returned to them again.  That has led to a great waste of time and money.  The new councils, at any rate, will have the striking of the rate, and consequently will be in a position to control the expenditure of money.  They can say that such a thing will not be passed, and the manager cannot do anything if they refuse to provide him with the necessary money.  If one takes into consideration the position of the City of Cork at the present time, the growth and improvement that have taken place there under the managerial system, then I think the name of Philip Monahan deserves to be honoured for the work that he has done, often under very considerable difficulties.  If, under <Col N="1741" /> this new system, the county is not going to suffer any more than the City of Cork has done, then I think we will be in a very happy condition indeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the Cork County Council, or rather I should say to the county councils, as a training ground for membership of the Dáil.  Cork County has given county surveyors to many counties in Éire. Those men got a very good training from the county surveyor and the other staffs of the council.  I believe the staffs we have will make a success of this measure.  There is one thing that the new county council will not have, and that is the appointment of officials. I am not going to cry over that.</P>

If that is so I am sorry that I <Col N="1742" /> was not present when the Minister was speaking.  At no period during the discussions on this Bill, or previous to them, have I said anything that would give the Minister any justification for quoting me as being in favour of the Bill.  I have refrained from taking part in the discussions on it, because I never have had any direct association with the working of local bodies.  I am prepared to leave it to my colleagues, most of whom have had a lifelong association with local administration, to express their views as well as the Party view on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.  So far as I am concerned, I believe that the success of a Bill of this kind, of what is commonly called the managerial system, will, in the long run, depend upon the men who will have to work the system, and on the attitude of the Minister directing those in charge of the various local authorities&mdash;those who are being given dictatorial powers under the Bill.  I say that it will depend on the attitude of the Minister, whose servants, in my opinion, the new managers will be, as to whether this system is going to succeed or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want an illustration as to whether the Minister is, or future Ministers are, likely to interfere in local administration or not, we can point to the recent direct interference of the present Minister with the Dublin City Manager in connection with the dispute between the Dublin Corporation, as represented by the manager, if you like, and the workers employed by the corporation.  Is there anybody in the House, even including the Minister, who will deny that there was direct interference with the manager in the discharge of his duties on that particular occasion? The members of the city council, towards the end of that dispute, through the Lord Mayor, were summoned to a special meeting of the corporation to be held on a certain Monday night.  I am glad that Deputy Cooney is listening attentively and, if I am wrong, perhaps he will correct me.  As I say, the members were summoned to a <Col N="1743" /> meeting on a certain Monday night. At ten o'clock that morning the city manager, by direction, as I suggest, of the Minister, delivered an ultimatum to the workers which prevented the city council at their meeting from doing anything effective towards bringing the dispute to a satisfactory conclusion. In my opinion, that is one recent case of direct interference by the Minister with the manager.  When you have Ministerial interference of that kind with the manager in the discharge of his duties&mdash;well, I do not know what you can call it.</P>
    <P>I think that this kind of system is likely to lead to a very effective dictatorship if the Ministry in power at the time want to use their position for the purpose of creating that kind of situation.  From the limited knowledge I have of the working of local government I agree that this Bill will remove a certain amount of undesirable overlapping, and that, in my opinion, is necessary.  But the Bill goes far beyond that.  I do not want to go into details, but I have come across cases where overlapping has taken place and has resulted, if you like, in inefficiency or delay; and delay in discharging the duties of a local authority in matters of importance means inefficiency and waste.  I am glad to find that there are sections in the Bill which I believe will remove overlapping which has been the cause of inefficiency in the past.</P>
    <P>I was made the medium on one occasion, through pressure from ratepayers in a certain county in my constituency, for supporting a demand for a sworn inquiry and going before that inquiry to make a case for the abolition of a local authority.  It was a job which I did not like taking on as an individual. I was wondering whether my action on that occasion in making a case for the abolition of a local authority, that it was admitted had not been discharging its duty in an efficient way, and the subsequent action of the Ministry in appointing a commissioner is being used as an argument to suggest that I am in favour of the managerial system or the contents of this measure.  It has been stated, of <Col N="1744" /> course, that the representatives of the ratepayers will still be entitled to represent the views of the people who find the money to pay for local administration. They will have the doubtful pleasure&mdash;those of them who will seek election to local authorities under this Bill&mdash;of going to annual meetings and passing the estimates.  They will also go to the meetings with the knowledge, if they are intelligent people and understand this measure, that if they do not pass the estimates by a certain date somebody will do that for them.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Brasier suggest that the representatives on the local authorities will have full power under the terms of the Bill to spend the money which they collect from the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>To pass the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have power to pass the estimates, if they wish, but they will have very little say in the spending of the money.  What right will they have under the Bill to instruct or persuade or compel, if you like, the manager to carry out a certain work by direct labour or by contract? Does Deputy Brasier, with his knowledge of administration and his expert knowledge of the meaning of this measure, suggest that a local authority in the future, under the terms of this Bill, will have power to give a direction to the new manager to carry out a certain job by direct labour or by contract?  He is not taking the risk of saying that the members of the council will have that power.  If they have not that power, and it is only a simple matter, after having taken the responsibility of collecting the money from the ratepayers, what power have they got?  Does he suggest that they will have power under the terms of the Bill to appoint any official, except the rate collector who will collect the money which they have decided should be collected from the ratepayers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I do not claim to have any knowledge of local affairs.  I think this Bill is coming forward at an inopportune time.  I should like to know from the Minister what authority has the Fianna Fáil Party received from the electors to push this measure <Col N="1745" /> through the House.  I want the Minister to quote any authority from the electors, who put them into this House as a Party, for the passage of this measure in its present form.  I understand that there was a discussion on the merits of this measure, before it was published, at the governing body of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I should like to know from the Minister whether there was complete unanimity at that Árd-Fheis in support of a measure of this kind.  I am not aware that this so-called democratic Government has received from the electors in a democratic way authority to push through this measure.  If they have not, I want to know what is the urgency for pushing the measure through.</P>
    <P>I said that I believe this Bill will remove overlapping.  I have seen minutes of boards of health meetings on a few occasions.  I have never been privileged to be a member of any local body.  But there is no doubt that their agenda is a very long one and that their meetings are also very long. Perhaps there is a case for referring certain detailed matters of administration to the executive officer of the body concerned, and in that way saving much time to the representatives of the ratepayers acting on those bodies.  There is a good deal to be said in existing circumstances, particularly from the point of view of those who say that they are real democrats, for having local people associated with the government of the country, whether it is central or local. I think that this measure is likely to take away power from the people, that that will have bad results, and that experience of the working of this Bill will prove that.</P>
    <P>I have a limited experience of the working of the commissioner system in my constituency.  I want to say that the man in charge of the local administration is frank, blunt and straightforward, and that he himself would be the first to admit that he has not the local contact that would enable him to be fully acquainted with the reasonable requirements of the people in every area in the two counties that he is administering at present.  As a <Col N="1746" /> matter of fact, this commissioner can only spare time to spend three days in one county and three days in another.  Can the Minister say, from what he knows of the situation in the two counties over which this commissioner is presiding, that there is a reasonable chance of his running them efficiently, irrespective of whether he may be the most efficient man in the country or not?</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the principle of the Bill.  I believe the time is not opportune for the introduction of the Bill. I believe the people who are introducing this measure have no authority from the electors to do so.  While I admit that sections of the Bill will remove overlapping, which in the past has led to inefficiency, for the reasons I have given I cannot support the final passage of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are any services in the State in which consideration and humane administration are required, it is in connection with local government, but one of the ironies that have resulted from national government, has been that local services have been gradually shorn of these qualities for a number years.  Deputy Mulcahy when Minister for Local Government went very far in that direction.  I do not think any more convincing case in that respect could be made against this Bill than the speeches made by the Minister's colleagues, when previous measures embodying principles of this kind were under consideration in the House.  The present Minister for Finance, who was afterwards Minister for Local Government, excelled himself in his violent, and almost hysterical tendencies, regarding the dictatorship enshrined in measures of this kind.  This Bill is the natural product of a Government that has become stale, tired, and impatient of criticism.  Anyone who has watched the signs of the times for the last few years, knows that local authorities in every county were becoming impatient, because of the autocratic attitude of the Minister and his predecessors, and the criticisms offered by these bodies have evidently been one of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> It is all very well in moments of virtuous indignation to be sanctimonious and to make as a background for this Bill what was said to be corruption amongst local bodies.  But it should be remembered that nepotism is not confined to local authorities.  People can point to exhibitions of that kind elsewhere, that certainly are greater, because of their nature, on the part of the central government than amongst local bodies.  This indignation about the inefficiency of local authorities is amusing.  Certain aspects of local government have been chaotic for the last few years, not because of local inefficiency but because of complete inefficiency where the Minister's Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>We had a system of hospitalisation offered the people that they were told would be self-contained in county health areas, under which such work would be carried out efficiently.  Under that scheme one hospital was to be known as a county hospital, where surgical work that formerly required the transfer of patients long distances to city hospitals, could be carried out. Suddenly, and without any apparent reason, the whole policy was changed and local authorities were informed that work of that kind could not be done locally.  At least, that was our experience in Cork where we were informed that such work would have to be done elsewhere.  In the constituency I live in there are six hospitals, but only operations that are relatively insignificant are carried out in them. Yet every hospital concerned was at the direct suggestion of the Minister fitted out for operation work.  Local authorities are not to blame there.</P>
    <P>In one particular case I know that very valuable service was given to the people in the way of surgical work, but when the resident surgeon died the suggestion that another surgeon should be appointed was not acceptable, and a medical officer was appointed.  That hospital is now idle.  I consider that the greatest damage has been done to local government since 1922, by the complete change or lack of policy displayed by the Local Government Department.  This Bill is being foisted <Col N="1748" /> on the people in the name of efficiency. I heard Deputy Brasier giving it his benediction, having taken as his cue what were said to be the efficient results of managerial control in Cork. If the Deputy read the newspapers to-day he would have seen that the rates in the city are now 25/- in the £, and that they were only kept at that figure by an effort.  Anyone who is familiar with local administration in Cork knows that efficiency has not resulted from that system, but that there has resulted considerable discontent in many quarters, and that it is entirely out of harmony with the natural policy of local government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to get this Bill, having regard to the present constitution of the House.  The people of this country struggled for a long time to secure local government, and I believe they will decide that it is better to have democratic control in the matter of local government with occasional mistakes, with stumbles and inefficiency, perhaps, here and there&mdash;which is not confined to local government&mdash; rather than have a certain number of people described as public representatives alleged to be functioning in local affairs without any power, but merely executing the commands of a Minister at the Custom House.  Decisions will be taken locally, but the voice behind them will not be that of the manager, but of the Minister.  The manager will be a discreet person, one who will obey the commands of the Minister.  The whole viewpoint expressed in the Bill is that of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age in which we see many aspects of what happens in the effort to secure wide powers; when people feel that they can not only rule their own countries, but other countries.  We would be out of fashion if we had not our would-be dictators. The winning of local government here was an achievement second only to the attainment of national government. At one time a scheme was suggested that would practically embody national self-government inside the provisions of extended local government, and the Irish representatives at that time considered what their attitude towards the measure would be.  It is rather a <Col N="1749" /> pathetic reflection that Irish people, through their representatives, should now attempt to tear down the edifice of local government that has been built up.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going to inflict considerable hardship on poor people.  Deprived of any local representation, and not being in a position to approach representatives of the Minister, in whose hands local government will be in future, they will find themselves completely forgotten in whatever their wants or needs may be.  Our viewpoint on that question has been made perfectly clear on the various stages of this Bill.  I regard it as a bad Bill in every sense of the word, emanating from people who have steadily recanted the democratic views in regard to local government which they so eloquently expressed in this House not so very long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not have replied to this debate at all but for the references made to the steam-rolling of this Bill through the House.  Everything that could be said on the Bill was said during the Second Reading and subsequent stages.  Deputy Corish referred to the rushing of the Bill through the House.  I venture to say that few Bills have been discussed for so long a time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said the Bill was rushed.  The Bill was introduced last November&mdash;six months ago. It was brought forward for Second Reading on the 5th December, and the debate continued on the 6th and 7th December.  A considerable time was given for Committee Stage, and now we find ourselves on the 24th April taking the Final Stage.  More than six months have elapsed since the Bill was introduced.  When arguments of that kind are advanced to raise prejudice against a measure, I am sure they will react on the people who put them forward.  We are told that the poor will be neglected and will have no touch with the administration.  As I indicated on Second Reading, there is nothing to prevent county councils <Col N="1750" /> setting up home help committees or any other committees to bring to the notice of relieving officers the conditions of individuals or groups of individuals. We are told that the Bill will be unwieldy in the case of single counties and much more so in the case of joint counties.  Let us consider the machinery which will be in existence. Let us not imagine that councils have the powers to-day which some of the Labour members seem to think they have.  Since the advent of the present system of administration, you had a secretary in the case of each county council and board of health. The manager will be somewhat in the position of an overseer or a controller of staff who will go around to see that his officials do their work.  It is the duty and obligation of a county secretary at the present time to notify his council of the rate that will be required and to inform them as to whether the rate is in order or not. If the council persists in striking a rate against his advice, the Department will, if the secretary is acting in accordance with regulations, intervene.</P>
      <P>That is the position, and there is hardly a matter which comes before county councils and boards of health at present that has not to be examined by the Local Government Department. It is in their discretion whether they sanction it or not.  There are, of course, the matters which come within the province of the Appointments Commission, in which the Minister has no say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the manager will be appointed by the Minister.  Deputies might as well say that the Minister makes every appointment at present made.  The manager is recommended by the Appointments Commission and is appointed by virtue of the recommendation. The manager is an officer of the council, and a certain method of removal by the council is provided. Some people think that this Bill is taking away enormous rights from the councils.  The essence of all democracy, as recognised by some of the greatest democratic nations in the world, is efficient control of staff.  I do not want to take up Deputy Davin &mdash;though I am quite sure he has seen <Col N="1751" /> the report&mdash;except in so far as the implications of his speeches and the clear statements he made here are concerned. He came into the House this evening and he represented that he heard at some time or other that I made some statement&mdash;he thought it was on this Bill&mdash;that he was in favour of the Bill.  I am not so very stupid as not to know that Deputy Davin has got the report of the statement I made here.</P>

      <P>I do not want to misquote the Deputy.  I shall refer him to the records of the House.  In volume 70, column 1395, Deputy Davin is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have listened, from time to time, both here and elsewhere, to discussions in regard to the merits and demerits of the managerial system.  I am of the opinion that some people, when discussing this matter, are too much inclined to think of the manager or the man instead of the merits or demerits of the system.  I listened last night to a Deputy, who does not know too much, I think, about the activities or work of the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation, paying a proper tribute, in my opinion, to the managerial system as administered in that area. I imagine he speaks from hearsay, but as a ratepayer in the district and speaking from some intimate knowledge of how the managerial system has been administered in that area, I want to say that, in my opinion, it has been carried out on model lines.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In column 1397, Deputy Davin says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the administration is going to be efficient, you must have one <Col N="1752" /> central head in charge, as you have in charge of Departments of State, the executive head of each being responsible to the political head of the department.  I would not like to see in the case of public concerns in this country directors, whether a large or a small number of them, constantly interfering in the activities of the executive officers of the different departments.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>So it seems.  I am accused by Deputy Corish of misquoting from the Report of the Greater Dublin Commission.  I do not want to misquote anybody.  I quote from the records.  The Report of the Greater Dublin Commission, 1926, states in conclusion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The scheme of City Management under an elective council accords with the best experience of the United States, Germany and the more progressive cantons of Switzerland. Civic administration is a business; accordingly the commission recommends the entrusting of the civic management of Greater Dublin to the business conduct of a body of directors.  The system herein recommended of government by one elective civic council and administration by salaried civic managers has proved in the United States at once the most democratic form of municipal government and the most businesslike form of municipal administration.&rdquo;</P>

I have indicated what two Deputies of the Labour Party said about this system and I hope that in a very short time the remainder of the Labour Party will come round to the views held by these <Col N="1754" /> Deputies.  I agree with Deputy Davin that the success or failure of the system will depend on the men who administer it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I read nothing of the kind in the newspapers.  The Deputy should have quoted the newspaper, and he would see that it did not contain any statement of that kind.  The city manager in that case acted in co-operation with the corporation.  Some other Deputy referred here to what had happened at the Ard Fheis.  I can tell the Deputy that there was an overwhelming majority in favour of the managerial system at the Ard Fheis.  I have no doubt, when the system is in operation in this country, if it gets a reasonable chance, that the people of the country will appreciate it and understand it, and that it will not have the effect that some Deputies&mdash;sincerely, I believe&mdash;think that it may have, namely, that it might lessen the desire of public representatives to go forward for election to public bodies.  We know the position at present in the country. If the manager will not be in a position to attend to the whole business of a council, surely the county councils at present are not in a position to look after the multitudinous matters that appear on the agenda at every meeting? Anybody who is honest and who has experience of what happens at these meetings will have to admit <Col N="1755" /> that members of these bodies have not sufficient time to examine the various matters that come before them in detail or to give them the consideration they should get. Everybody who has been a member of a board of health or a county council knows that it is absolutely impossible to do so, that the greater part of the time of members is taken up with matters that should be within the province <Col N="1756" /> of somebody in the position of manager.  The council will have ample control over the ordinary business that comes before the council.  I believe that this Bill will make for efficiency, and that the system which it enshrines is the essence of democracy.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of the Principal Act sets out that &ldquo;within one month after the end of every local financial year the Commissioners shall certify to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the total amount expended in the preceding local financial year in paying the remuneration of the Commissioners and the expenses incurred by the Commissioners in carrying this Act into effect&rdquo;.  It has been found that one month is too short a period, and hence this amendment is now being recommended to the House.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied now that after all there was possibly some merit in adjourning the consideration of this measure, since he has now proposed an amendment himself.  On the last occasion he wanted to have all the stages taken on the same day.</P>

      <P>Well, apparently, the Parliamentary Secretary has found <Col N="1758" /> sufficient time to think the matter over and to put in an amendment of his own. However, I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary why, when he was making this amendment, he did not put in a definite period.  I think that this method of amendment by reference is most objectionable. That is my first reason for saying that, and secondly I think that we are going further and further away from any attempt at the co-ordination of local government law.  I should like to know why this is not being brought in and inserted in the Bill as a definite period.  As things are, one has to go to the Principal Act to find out what a certain section there says, and then one finds that, possibly, that section has been amended in a succeeding Act. I think that is most objectionable. Why did not the Parliamentary Secretary make a definite period of two months, three months or six months? In the Principal Act a period of one month was fixed, and there must have been some reason for that.  Why does not the Parliamentary Secretary consider mentioning some specific period instead of using that very flexible phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; has been used just for the reason that it is so flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can quite believe that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, the case is that many of the expenses referred to in the section have to be apportioned between the Civil Service Commissioners and the Local Appointments Commissioners, and in connection with such items as telegrams, telephones and other incidental expenditure, it might not be possible to make the proper apportionment between the departments concerned within one month or even within two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that, if you fix a period of three months, it is more likely to cover all possible contingencies than a period of one month, but the only reason that can be put forward in defence of this particular phrase is that, by its very flexibility, it provides for <Col N="1759" /> every possible contingency.  However, if the Deputy wants to put a limit, such as three months, definitely here, I have no objection, but it was thought that, in all the circumstances, seeing that we were making the change from the period of one month, it would be better to have this flexibility of phrase in order to cover all contingencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary told us whether or not the original period of one month had, in fact, proved to be satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary did.  He did mention the difficulty of a rush of work being occasioned in certain circumstances, and the difficulty of apportioning the expenditure in such cases.  My point, however, is that we have not the Principal Act before us, and there is the difficulty of finding out that a section of the Principal Act is amended afterwards. There must have been some reason for making the period of one month originally, and, therefore, why should this phrase be used?  I certainly am not inclined to give the Local Government Department any further opportunity for delays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three points on which I should like to have some information from the Minister in connection with this Vote.  On previous occasions in this House questions were addressed to the Minister for Defence, or to the previous Minister for Defence, asking for the number of additional Army officers and men who had been called up following on the outbreak of the European war, and the Minister said that it was not in the public interest to disclose that information. Will the present Minister now tell the House, the members of which, equally with himself, are responsible for the expenditure of the ratepayers' money, what was the number of officers and men who were called up to the Army subsequent to the outbreak of the present war and what was the number of these officers and men who were subsequently demobilised under that particular sub-head, if it is a sub-head, in the Estimate?  I should also like to hear from the Minister how he arrived at the rates of wages or salaries, if you like, of the officers and men who were recruited for the coast watching service. He has certain figures here showing the cost for the employment of lieutenants, second lieutenants and members of the crews, which is dealt with under sub-head P (2).  Then lower down on the same page, there is an item connected with additional pay provided for officers and men.  Would the Minister give us the inclusive cost, or charge, or rate of pay, per week, for lieutenants, second lieutenants and members of the crews recruited for the Marine Coast Watching Service, and would he also tell us how their rates of pay, salaries or subsistence allowances <Col N="1762" /> were arrived at in such cases?  I should like to know whether the lieutenants and second lieutenants are men who have had marine or merchant service qualifications; whether the men in charge of these patrol vessels and so on are men who hold masters' tickets&mdash;I am sure the Minister understands what I mean by that.</P>
      <P>What qualifications have the men in charge of the vessels or the officers immediately under them in work of this kind, either at home or abroad, and when the rates of pay or salaries or subsistence allowances were fixed were they related to the rates of pay and conditions of service of the men presently employed in the merchant service either across-Channel or foreign-going?</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister, if he would not mind doing so, to state whether there has been any increase in the figures provided for ration allowances of N.C.O.s and men, whether the rate per day or per week has been increased since the outbreak of the European war or since the cost of living has gone up, as it has gone up by about 20 to 25 per cent. or, if no increased provision has been made for the N.C.O.s and men under the heading of rations or allowances in lieu of rations, whether any such proposal is at present under consideration.  These are a couple of matters I would like the Minister to deal with when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret that the National Army is not as popular as it should be with the people of Ireland at the present time.  We know that in the past, when this country was seeking its independence, people looked forward to an Irish Army as something glorious, something which they would be proud of.  To-day if people think of the Army at all they think of it as a huge devouring monster that is consuming £3,300,000 per annum of the taxpayers' money.  If the Army is not popular to-day I would like to say that it is not due to any fault of the officers or men of the Army.  I do not think there are any soldiers in the world who are more efficient than the Army of this country.  I would like to say also that wherever the Army has been brought <Col N="1763" /> into contact with the civilian population or has had to interfere with the civilian population the Army has always shown itself very courteous and efficient.  I think that is a matter which reflects credit both upon the officers and men of the Army.  What is causing widespread complaint throughout the country is the enormous cost of this service and people are asking what useful purpose does this enormous expenditure serve.  We know that since 1931 the Army has increased in cost from, I think, £1,100,000 per annum to £3,300,000.  The cost has been practically trebled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The common people of the country, looking at the matter from an ordinary common-sense point of view, will ask what benefit do we derive from this enormously increased expenditure? The Army is called upon to serve two functions, that is, to protect this country from external aggression and to maintain or to assist in maintaining order and upholding the State.  As far as protecting this country is concerned, I think it is generally agreed that our Army cannot do anything effective from the point of view of protecting this country from any big military Power that would think of taking this nation under its protection.  I think that an Army costing £1,100,000, as in 1931, an Army much smaller and much less expensive than we have at present, would be just as effective as an Army costing £3,300,000.  If any big military Power were to consider taking over this country they would not worry very much as to whether our Army was one of 4,000 men or 5,000 men or one of 12,000 or 13,000.  It would not make any material difference.  I think that both from the point of view of resisting external attack or of dissuading a belligerent Power from invading this country it does not matter very much whether we have an Army of 4,000 or 5,000 or an Army of 13,000 or 14,000. If we proposed maintaining an Army sufficient to prevent a foreign Power from considering the invasion of this country I think we would have to consider raising an Army of at least 50,000 and probably 100,000 men.  An Army of 12,000 or 13,000 men would not make any material difference and <Col N="1764" /> would not be taken into consideration by any Power that might consider it desirable to invade this country.</P>
    <P>The second purpose for which an Army might be required is the preservation of order.  If the Government claim that the increased expenditure this year as compared with 1931 is necessary in order to maintain order in this country, that, I think, is the strongest indictment that could be brought against the present Government. We must remember that in 1931 we had a Government which was not as popular, I think, or did not claim to be as popular with the forces that would be likely to cause disorder, forces of ultra-nationalism, as the present Government claim to be.  Yet, in 1931 that Government was able to maintain order with an Army costing one-third of what the present Army costs to-day and that Government had to uphold a Constitution which was not as attractively worded as the Constitution which we have at present.</P>
    <P>Since 1931 many constitutional changes and many other changes have been brought about at great expense to the people in order to meet the claims of those who profess to be ultra-national or ultra-patriotic and in spite of all those efforts that have been made by the present Government to satisfy the claims of the republicans and other people who want to separate this country from Great Britain, we have to face the fact that to-day the taxpayers are called upon to pay £2,000,000 a year more than under the previous Government.  That, I think, is a terrible condemnation of the present Government.  It shows that in some way or other the country has deteriorated. It shows that the Government have failed to increase the civic spirit of those people and to intensify the desire for law and order in this country and, as a result, they are compelled to inflict upon the taxpayers an added burden of £2,000,000 a year as compared with 1931. I think that is a matter which the Government should take seriously to heart.  The taxpayers of the country are not prepared to go on shouldering that enormous burden for all time, and the immediate task of the Government <Col N="1765" /> should be to consider ways and means of bringing the cost of the Army back to what it was in 1931.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Army serves no useful purpose in regard to external aggression.  I have no doubt whatever that if this country were attacked by any external Power, the Army, for its size, would give a fair account of itself. It would do as much as could be expected from it, but the most that any Army of, say, less than 50,000 men, properly equipped, could do is to make a protest against invasion of the country. It might be a very heroic protest, as I am sure it would, from what I know of our Army, but it would be ineffective and, therefore, the immediate duty of the Government is to bring down the cost of the Army to the 1931 figure, to set about reducing the number of men in the Army and to set about the constitution of a small permanent Army&mdash;an Army, as I would suggest, of men who regard service in the Army as their permanent employment.  I think that taking men into the Army for a few months, for a year, or even for two years, is not desirable.  If the Army is to be as effective as it could be, it should be composed of men who look upon service in it as a career and who are prepared to devote the greater part of their lives to service in the Army.  They could always be relied upon to be 100 per cent. loyal to whatever Government the people of Ireland might elect and would act as a stabilising influence in this country.</P>
    <P>I notice provision in the Estimates for what are known as military lands and for the employment of herds. My opinion with regard to military service is that members of an army always have a certain amount of leisure, and it is right that that should be so.  An army is a machine, if you like, which is used only in time of emergency and, therefore, the greater part of a soldier's time is occupied in waiting for such an emergency.  On that account, soldiers must have a considerable amount of leisure, and I think that leisure could be usefully employed by the Army authorities by the provision of a certain amount of work, by acquiring and utilising a certain amount of the land adjoining <Col N="1766" /> any military barracks, so that members of the Army would be given an opportunity of engaging in useful civilian employment during their leisure moments, and acquiring skill in employment which would be useful to them in after life.  They could also be given opportunities of acquiring skill in various trades, in horticulture, and so on, which would make them more useful citizens when they have served their period in the Army, and also help to reduce to a certain extent the cost of the maintenance of the Army.  We read in the Press that the French Army has been employed on a vast scheme of cultivation of crops in the war zone, and I do not see why it should not be considered desirable that in times of peace&mdash;and this country is still at peace&mdash;the Army should be encouraged to do useful work of that kind.  It may be suggested that every available moment of a soldier's time is taken up by the ordinary guard duties and training, but I think that cannot be possible, because I do not think it possible to employ the time of a soldier continually in training.  Military training imposes a certain strain, and relaxation from that strain is required, and I suggest that a change of work is as useful and desirable for members of the Army as sending them out on recreation.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in connection with the Department of the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. I notice that the Minister is not here, and he was not here on the last day the Estimate was before the House. His time is probably so completely taken up with co-ordinating the various defensive measures of the country that he cannot find it possible to afford time to come to the House.  One of the duties of the Minister is in respect of the censorship service, and there is in charge of this service a controller with a salary of £1,500 per year and a chief Press censor with a salary of £700, rising to £800.  While I agree that in war-time censorship is necessary to a certain extent.  I am not satisfied that the duties of the censor have been fairly exercised.</P>
    <P>When a body of citizens in the country decided to press for an improvement of their conditions by withholding <Col N="1767" /> their supplies until they had secured these better conditions, the Press censor intervened to prevent that body of useful citizens from stating their case and explaining to the people, through the Press, that they intended to organise a strike and setting out the purposes for which they intended to strike.  By the intervention of the Press censor, a great deal of confusion was caused amongst the general public, inasmuch as they were not aware of the step taken.  There have been a number of other strikes in the country and in the city since then, but the Press censor has never exercised his authority against any section of the community except the farmers.  That is a very remarkable situation&mdash;why the farmers should be singled out for penalisation in this way.</P>
    <P>Some of the officers of the Minister's Department are constituted as a military tribunal.  In connection also with that farmers' strike, I noticed a number of farmers were brought before the Military Tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has nothing to do with that.  It is a matter for another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to remark that in regard to other strikes where violence was used, such as the stopping and the burning of lorries, nobody was brought before the Military Tribunal. I do not know whether the Minister for Defence had anything to do with the mobilisation or the calling out of a section of the Army to commandeer farm produce during the strike and to bring that farm produce into the city to feed the elephants in the Zoo&mdash;that was the excuse which was given for the commandeering of the farm produce.  I have never heard of the Army being used for that purpose before.  The elephants in the Zoo may not be the only creatures in this country who suffer from hunger.  I have never heard of the Army being used to collect food, even one crust of bread, for any of the poor in the city.  Apparently it was considered good policy to use the Army to commandeer farm produce in order to feed wild animals.  I think actions of that kind tend to bring the Army into disrepute.  I suggest the <Col N="1768" /> immediate task of the Minister is to scale down the personnel of the Army, to let any man who has an aptitude for civilian life go back to it, and concentrate in the service of the State only those men who have made up their minds to remain in the Army for a considerable number of years and who are likely to give permanent and efficient service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though we have had during previous debates&mdash;not, I understand, during this debate&mdash;two Ministers whose salaries are provided for in this Estimate, and though, on previous occasions, the House pressed, and pressed very hard&mdash;I do not think there was a single speaker on these benches who did not press for information on certain matters&mdash;we got absolutely no information of the slightest value from either of the Ministers concerned. I can well conceive that the present Minister thinks he has two duties to fulfil.  One is to look after the general administration of the Army or, as it seems to some of us, to mess about with the Army.  That duty he fulfils according to his lights, as his predecessor did.  He has another duty, however, and that he makes no effort even to pretend to fulfil.  It is a duty both to this House and to the Army, namely, to make some attempt to justify a sum of money amounting to close on £4,000,000.  I am referring to the Vote that we are discussing formally at the moment, but I called attention before to the fact that under other Votes there were other large sums of money voted for the Army, and if you deduct from the total sum of £4,400,000, which is the amount that is being voted for Army purposes, £600,000 roughly, the amount spent on Army pensions, you come to a sum of about £3,800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although frequently he has been challenged on every debate, challenged by practically every speaker, to show that he is giving any kind of value for the increased expenditure which he has sponsored and which his predecessor was sponsoring for the last 21 months, or seven months, as the case may be, he has never attempted, not once, to show that he has given any return to the nation for the money that he is demanding from the nation. <Col N="1769" /> Again and again he has been challenged, but he has been silent on this point when giving his so-called replies to the debates.  He has dealt in his replies with a few minor points that will usually be raised in the course of any debate, but the main issue he has shirked, and that is neither fair to the House nor to the Army.  If he wants to be fair to the Parliament or to the Army, I suggest he does make some attempt to prove that this money is being usefully spent.  Deputy Cogan talked about popularity and unpopularity. I am not discussing that.  The people, in fairness to the Army, should know why this additional sum is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is a set practice or not, but I do stress that no two Ministers can show more clearly by their attitude their contempt for Parliamentary institutions than the present Minister and the other of the heavenly twins who sometimes sits beside him.  I am sorry that the other heavenly twin, the other Minister, is absent at the moment.  His sole duty up to the present, so far as we can see, has been to come here and sit beside the present Minister and, so to speak, hold his hand while this Minister was holding his silence.  That has been his whole contribution since the great swopping of Ministries took place last September, at the outbreak of the war.  I am not sure that this open contempt for Parliamentary institutions is not part of a settled policy on the part of the Government.  They can, undoubtedly, make a very serious contribution to the so-called breakdown of Parliamentary institutions in this country, and they are doing it, but that a Minister should come here after repeated challenges, introduce an Estimate of such magnitude and make no effort to justify the amount of money in that Estimate, confining himself to a few statements about figures and refusing to tackle the main question, is something that we must emphatically protest against.</P>
    <P>What is the justification for the expenditure? The Minister cannot say he was not asked often enough.  Taking the debate that took place here last March, I think every Deputy who spoke from these benches definitely put that <Col N="1770" /> question to him.  What is the justification? I would advise the House to read the Minister's so-called reply to that particular question.  What was it?  Something like this: Last September the Government had a responsibility, and it was a heavy responsibility. We admit the responsibility was heavy, but what was not shown to us was how the Government shouldered that responsibility.  What was not proved to us was that the manner in which they tried to shoulder that responsibility was the least bit of good to the nation.  He pointed out that other small nations were calling up their man-power and, therefore, apparently we were to do it.  He has been asked since then on every occasion on which it was possible to ask him, what benefit accrued to the nation from that calling up of man-power.  I have given you his answer.  Did he attempt to show that that increased man power in the slightest degree strengthened our defences against actual or potential attack?  He did not.  I have given you, I think, and I challenge the Minister to show the opposite, the whole case practically of his reply, with this vague addition that it was necessary to provide for the security of this country. What he did not say was how man-power without modern ammunition and equipment would contribute to the safety and security of this country. Having dealt with a few minor points, in his innocence he omitted to deal with the main challenges and he finished by saying: &ldquo;I think I have dealt with all the points that have been raised.&rdquo;  He said that, having specially omitted the two principal ones.</P>
    <P>He has not shown us that the mobilisation of last September was justified.  He has not shown us that doubling or trebling your man power, and not your ammunition, is a contribution in the present conditions of warfare to the safety of the country. He did not attempt to do it, and then he calmly tells this House that he thinks he has answered all the points raised.  The one thing he forgot was to justify his own Estimate.  That was his attitude last March.  But he had an opportunity between that date and this to sit down and consult his advisers <Col N="1771" /> and ask them to put up a case. It was his duty to do so, seeing the amount of criticism levelled at him on that occasion, not merely to assert that the Government with a full sense of its grave responsibility thought this was an excellent thing to do.  It was pointed out to him then that there was no justification and no vindication of the step taken by the Government. The mistake made in mobilising was pointed out at the time it took place, and on every opportunity which was since given to the Deputies of this House.  He should immediately have tried to right the situation.  In part gradually the situation was to be put right.  One after another the men were to be driven back out of the Army into the civil employment they had left. But having discovered their mistake in calling up the men, they did not tackle the situation as logically or as drastically as they should have.  To save their faces the pace of leaving the men out of the Army had to be slowed down.  For that immense expenditure had to be kept up.  At any rate, what the Minister has never done at any period was to show that our Army, no matter what the numbers were, was properly equipped to repel a serious attack from any invader, any great modern power.  He has not shown that our Army is at all equipped to face that situation.  He has shirked that issue whenever it was put before him.</P>
    <P>I put it to him that whether you have an Army of 5,000 or 14,000 men, if they are not equipped in modern fashion you are simply sacrificing their lives and nothing else.  Is there any indication that we are equipped? Can the ammunition promised be secured?  Has there been any advance in that direction?  Will he think it necessary to make a case for the expenditure?  He need not; for he can rely on those Deputies who will vote any sums of money that the Government will ask without putting to themselves the awkward question whether any value is given for the expenditure of that money.  Of course, he will do nothing of that kind.  But in fairness to the Army, he should make a case for the <Col N="1772" /> expenditure, and he should show to the House that it is not pure waste of money, as the bulk of the people believe it is.  That has been stated in this House again and again, and no attempt made by the Minister to refute that case for himself, or for his absent colleague.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the policy of the Government is.  I am not going to ask the Minister what his defence policy is. I do not believe he has any.  The Government may pretend that they acted on information when they mobilised last September.  If so they communicated that information to nobody.  They gave no indication that they had any information which the general public had not that compelled them to state that the mobilisation that they were responsible for was justified. Is it the view of the Government, from the secret information which they had not got, that there was a danger of invasion last September and that that danger is diminished to-day?  Is that the view of the Government?  Possibly the Minister will think he is asked to give away European secrets if he attempts to answer a question like that.  If that is not the view of the Government, what is the justification for mobilising last September and cutting down now?  There was no justification at any time for calling up those men.  It dislocated business.  It interfered with the ordinary life of the country, and there was a huge expenditure of public money.  I can only repeat that the Government found itself in an unaccustomed situation last September, and their only means of convincing the country that they were doing something to meet the crisis was by spending public money.</P>
    <P>It now appears from the Estimate before us that they have not a proper equipment for the Army.  If any crisis occurred in the way of invasion, what is the good of 14,000 men if you have not armed them in modern fashion? You were going to spend large sums on equipment and on armaments and you have not spent it.  Why?  Because you could not.  It was not such a long time ago that the Minister told us he was going to get ammunition.  He was asked where.  He said he would not tell where.  I should say that to anybody <Col N="1773" /> looking at his Estimates the answer is quite clear.  He did not know.  Perhaps he had ordered. Apparently he was still under the impression that ordering was the same as getting the ammunition.  We do not know now when he will get the ammunition. At a time when he thinks it is necessary to keep a large Army, double the size that would be necessary for internal purposes in this country, he can say that the great bulk of the money that he is to spend on ammunition and warlike stores is not going to be spent within the next 12 months. He budgets for £400,000 this year, but £2,000,000 extra is to be spent, the Lord knows when.  He has placed contracts. When are they going to be fulfilled?  Let any man put himself that question and the answer is obvious&mdash;at the end of the war.</P>
    <P>There is going to be an expenditure of several millions on military stores but we shall have to wait until after the war to get these stores to meet any crisis that may arise in the country. Then we will probably get a good bargain.  Probably you will get twice as much for your money as now.  That is as good as any defence the Minister has made for his policy up to the present.  But it is simply playing with the situation.  I presume the Minister knows there is a war on and that countries have been invaded.  He has seen the extraordinary part played by modern inventions, by mechanised methods of warfare, by aeroplanes and so on.  What provision has he made for these things?  Does he think that man power alone, not properly armed will be able to do any of the things that he pretends this Army is to be called upon to do, namely, preserve our independence against a serious invasion from a big power or preserve our neutrality?  Countries much better armed in a modern way than we are were not able to do it, and yet the only contribution that has been made to the defence of this country is to increase expenditure, not bothering whether he gets any return in the way of increased efficiency to deal with a dangerous situation or not.  That he leaves to the future.</P>
    <P>We have a peculiar situation as regards the matter of material.  A sum <Col N="1774" /> of £460,000 is estimated to be spent this year.  We do not know whether it will be spent or not.  The Minister or his predecessor estimated expenditure before, but it is not spent.  We were able to discuss that last March, slightly more than a month ago, when on a Vote for £1,000,000 we simply had to take a token Vote for £10 because of the interference with the spending capacity of the Minister in that respect.  Anyhow, he estimates, and only estimates remember.  He does not know whether he will get it or not. The £460,000 roughly covers the purchase of the following warlike materials.  We have first the aviation section.  Would the Minister tell us the number of aeroplanes and the type, or is that a secret that dare not be told to this House, that must be kept from the British from whom we must purchase them, or from the Germans who certainly seem to have a great deal more information about the defence of this country than the Minister has given to this House?</P>
    <P>Will he refuse to give the information to the House because it might endanger the defence of this country if he did?  The various warlike stores are set out.  For fighting vessels there is the figure of £172,000.  One reason, and one good reason, for these fighting vessels is that they give his colleague the appearance of something to do, but it is mere appearance, because the Minister himself is responsible for it, not Deputy Aiken.  Even the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures apparently will not be busy upon that.  What he is busy on, well, who knows?  This House was never told, but as that is a separate item I can revert to it afterwards.</P>
    <P>We then get the statement that the sum of £2,196,000 odd is in respect of outstanding orders against which deliveries are not expected within the financial year 1940-41.  When are they expected?  We are not told.  All that we are told is that they are not expected in the coming 12 months.  As I say, the best chance is after the war. Then you will have done something to justify your existence as a Government, that faced this enormous European and world crisis in a way that it should be <Col N="1775" /> faced.  See what they are!  You would imagine they are things that ought to be there if we were serious.  I do not say that even if you were to get them to-morrow they would bring our Army up to a position to stand against the mechanised and modern methods of modern armies.  It is not a question of the capacity of our officers or of the bravery of our officers and our men. That is not in question, but men with practically bare hands cannot fight against the modern machinery of warfare. It is not a slur on the Army to say that because it cannot do it, but it is a slur on the Minister that he should expect them to do it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Guns and carriages, £850,000&rdquo;&mdash;to be delivered when?  To enable them to face the crisis?  Has the Minister arranged with the belligerents on both sides when the crisis is going to hit this country?  Has he asked them not to do it anyhow until the 12 months are up, because he may hope to get this equipment then, though he does not say it?  There is the figure of £750,000 for ammunition and so on down the list. £148,000 for aircraft.  Those who have taken the slightest interest in military matters&mdash;I confess I know nothing about them and I am only speaking as a Parliamentary Deputy&mdash;know the rate at which all these modern machines of warfare and destruction can get out of date&mdash;aeroplanes particularly.  Is the situation this, that these things may be delivered to us when they are old models, and is that the contribution the Minister has to make?  He has already contracted for the delivery of certain things.  I presume the contract is there&mdash;so he says, anyhow.  It would look very much as if what he has contracted to get may very well be out of date, if he gets them before the end of the war.  They may be very much out of date by the time he gets them, and there are obvious reasons that that is quite likely.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister for the number of aeroplanes.  I do not expect he will give the information.  He has never given information to this House on more important matters than that. I think he resents this House asking why nearly £4,000,000 should be voted <Col N="1776" /> for defence services.  He thinks that because of its wisdom the Government feels the weight of responsibility so much that it is almost crushed under it, that is enough, and that the only business of the House is to keep silent and to vote the money.  All that we do ask is, if we vote money, that at least an attempt should be made by the Minister to show that value is given for the money, but he has consistently shelved that question.  I think it was another Minister, the supreme Minister of all, who said on one occasion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Oh!  if we did not take these measures, and anything happened, you would be the first to criticise us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was that the reason the Government mobilised the Army&mdash;to escape criticism and not to defend the country? What we criticised you for is that you took measures that were in our view completely unnecessary and exceedingly costly, and that you never made a single effort to show that these costly efforts were of the slightest use.  If you think that you are justified in plunging this country into big expenditure so that people cannot say to you afterwards: &ldquo;When the crisis came why did you not do something?&rdquo;&mdash;that is not a sufficient excuse, I put it to the Minister, for spending millions of public money now, and contracting to spend more millions of public money.</P>
    <P>We come, then, to the extraordinary, the occasional apparition that we see in this House&mdash;the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. The Minister who is in charge of this Vote was asked last March by several Deputies on this side of the House, what were the functions of that Minister, and what was the reason for his existence as a Minister.  In his reply the Minister said: &ldquo;I think I dealt with all the questions raised,&rdquo; but did not say one word on that.  The question was raised by several Deputies.  I opened the debate myself, and I stressed the importance of an answer to that question.  The question was also raised by Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Linehan.  The Minister was pressed to give an answer, and he could not give an answer.  Anyhow, he did not give an answer.  Therefore, we must assume <Col N="1777" /> that he could not give an answer. What does this Minister co-ordinate? The Cabinet, is it?  Is he a kind of Minister for neutrality or something in the Cabinet, or what is he?</P>
    <P>What is his justification there? Surely not the answer that he gave by way of interruption in the debate when he said: &ldquo;I gave my colleague, the Minister for Defence, a statement to make about the censorship.&rdquo;  We are to be solemnly told here that it was necessary to appoint Deputy Aiken Minister for Censorship, and give him the name of Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. Was it a way of getting rid of him and pensioning him?  What does he do? Does the Minister think that the House and the country are not entitled to an answer to that plain question?  What does he co-ordinate?  Is it the navy and Army?  I see that the Muirchu is no longer what it was, but is now fully brought up to date and is under the charge of the Minister, and that the people on it must have military experience. Apparently, his fellow Minister has nothing to do with that. The small craft, the M.I. and so on, are under the Minister for Defence. So far as we know, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures has nothing to do except to come in here and hold the hand of the Minister for Defence while the Minister is refusing to give information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are asking too much of the man.  There are limits to what any man can do.  He is not any longer Minister for Defence, but so far as silence is concerned, his successor certainly went further than he went, and that is a great length. Here we have what really amounts, so far as the public life of this country is concerned, to a scandal; I mean in this sense, that on several occasions the Government have been challenged to justify the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, and they have never tried to do so.  Their conception of a parliament is that Parliament has no right to raise this <Col N="1778" /> question, and their conception of the country is that the country has no right to ask this question.  The one duty of the country, so far as the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures is concerned, is to provide the portion of the taxes necessary to pay his salary.  Its duty and its rights begin and end there.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Defence to say what are the functions of that Minister.  He is not the Minister without Portfolio, or is he?  When that extraordinary provision was being made in a Bill before this House I must confess that I thought the Tánaiste had his eye on that as being an excellent job for him.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary almost agrees with me in that.  But now I am not so sure that it has not been gripped from him.  I will put it that I think the Tánaiste would be much happier as Minister without Portfolio than in showing his great financial ability in bringing this country through the crisis in financial affairs that threatens the whole world.  But apparently the post is occupied.  Therefore we must assume that the counsel and advice of Deputy Aiken are so important&mdash;looking after the Cabinet to see that they do not fall into any mistakes&mdash;that he is really the Minister without Portfolio. If he has that power of counsel he certainly has concealed it remarkably well from this House.  He has not given any counsel, advice or information to this House that he could possibly avoid giving.  It is amazing how much information he can avoid giving in these respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, there are things in his duty to the country which the Minister takes lightly&mdash;I am not sure that he takes his duty to the Army any more seriously&mdash;that the Minister ought to consider.  I can never convince myself that there is any real effort to cut down expenditure.  I called attention on the last occasion, and I do so now, to the fact that all the expenditure&mdash;I am leaving out military pensions&mdash;for which the Army is responsible is not shown in this Vote.  You will get other large sums of money when you turn to the Estimates of the Office of Public <Col N="1779" /> Works.  I wonder whether all this expenditure is necessary.  You have now, counting the large barracks, almost as many barracks here as in the British time.  Is that necessary? I am speaking purely as a layman, and I wonder is it wise to have your Army scattered all over these barracks.  Do you think that for an Army of 6,000 or 7,000&mdash;the number you had up to the crisis and which you met so ably last September by this mobilisation order (!) &mdash;all these barracks were necessary? Were new ones necessary?  I have heard an excuse&mdash;I do not know what the value of it is&mdash;given by a layman for what occurred last Christmas in the raid on the Fort, namely, that we have not sufficient men to go round to do all these fatigue duties&mdash;I think that is the technical term.  We have not sufficient men to go round.  We have them in every barracks.  If we had fewer barracks we would have less men engaged in that kind of work and they might be doing more useful work. There certainly was a place where, I presume, they could have done useful work last Christmas and they did not do it.</P>
    <P>You have, as I say, in the Estimate for the Office of Public Works provision for a number of new quarters and for married quarters.  You have to recondition them not only in one barracks but in nearly every barracks.  It would strike the ordinary person that a little more concentration would not merely be more economic, but might work out better for the Army itself.  I see a provision here in the Vote for the Office of Public Works for a magazine.  Do you not think that you have had enough trouble with one magazine?  However, this might not be so harmful, because you may not have ammunition to put in it.  Therefore, it may not be so disastrous as the other magazine already in existence.  You have two and a half pages here of works.  Are they necessary? Apparently having got barracks at one time, you cannot give them up, and you want more.  I do not know what the defence for that is.  We are not going to get it when we come to debate Vote No. 10, namely, Public <Col N="1780" /> Works and Buildings, because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will say quite rightly, &ldquo;The Army asked for these&rdquo;. It was not he who pressed you to take the buildings; you must have put up a case to him for them.  It was not the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who went to the Army and said: &ldquo;Will you have a couple more buildings?  We would like to give you some.&rdquo;  Naturally the defence that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will put up is: &ldquo;It was the Department of Defence that came to me and said &lsquo;We must have these buildings&rsquo;&rdquo;.  If there is to be any defence put up for this, it ought to be on this Vote.  Just as we are not able to discuss other things, because another Minister is responsible for them, it is plain that this question of new buildings should be defended by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On Islandbridge barracks there is a total expenditure of £80,000, on McKee barracks, £60,000, Portobello barracks, £9,000; married quarters £20,000; camp equipment for use of the Command, £12,000; reconstruction in Baldonnel area, £134,000.  That last may be necessary to a large extent and is a new service.  Cork has one barracks, and it is necessary to do something to bring it up to date.  Then there is the Magazine, £61,000.  What Magazine? Is it the old Magazine?  Do you want two Magazines to defend?  What is the money for?  When is the work to get through?  Is it a Magazine that is to be built this year for ammunition that you are not going to get?  Everywhere we have evidence of the desire to spend money, but no evidence and no justification for the belief that the country is going to get value for it. That is our main objection to this Vote; that so far as we are concerned this Department is represented in this House by what for practical purposes, amounts to a dummy.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the striking distance of the M. 1s is.  Is it a fact that these vessels are not capable of taking to the open sea in rough weather?  I do not know whether they are or not.  Is it a fact that they have <Col N="1781" /> no kind of offensive weapon between machine guns and torpedo tubes?  I heard it stated recently that there are two types of ships in our Navy, one that can go fast and catch a boat but cannot keep it, and the other that cannot catch a boat but if it catches it cannot keep it.  By boat I mean a trawler.</P>
    <P>Another item concerns the purchase of transport.  I know that there are certain countries in Europe that have for other purposes purchased transport, but that it has not been properly used or properly kept.  I have no doubt the Minister will say that transport here is properly housed and kept.  Is that the case?  Where is it properly housed and kept?  Possibly the House had better not get that information.  Possibly that is information to keep back, except from people who might want to capture transport, and the House might not know anything about it.  The total expenditure is very great and, as far as we can judge, no effort has been made by the Minister, except his ipse dixit, to justify it.  So far as we can judge no addition has been made to the defensive powers of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne (Junior) Mr. Byrne (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call attention to a few minor points but they are of importance to those concerned. If my memory serves me right, the Minister or his predecessor assured the House on several occasions, that he had received promises from many employers of their willingness to co-operate with the Government in the Volunteer enlistment scheme, and that any of their employees who were called up in the Volunteers would be reinstated in their employment when demobilised.  Notwithstanding such assurances, there have been cases of men not being re-employed when demobilised.  That was very harsh treatment towards these men, especially at a time like this when it is almost impossible to find new employment.  I ask the Minister to have special inquiries made into the matter, with a view to seeing that those men get back their jobs, and also to make a further effort amongst employers to get their co-operation in that respect.  I think the Minister should take some punitive action against the few employers who <Col N="1782" /> have acted so meanly towards these men.  Deputy MacEoin referred to the delay that took place in the payment of allowances to the wives and families of serving soldiers.  I hope the Minister will remedy that injustice of which I heard complaints.  I have been told that Volunteers find that there is undue delay about being paid.  Many of these men have families living in Dublin and they are dependent on these allowances for the provision of bread and butter. They cannot wait several weeks for payment.</P>
      <P>I will vote for the amendment put down by Deputy O'Higgins, and I ask the House to vote for it, and to reject this proposal of the Government to squeeze this amount of money from admittedly already overtaxed taxpayers for the provision of ways and means of destruction.  This is a time when much constructive work requires to be done, and when many people now unemployed could be engaged on such work.  Many taxpayers have a struggle for existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week Deputy Mulcahy challenged the Minister for Defence, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; catch-weights, all in, and nothing barred&mdash;and demanded their intervention in the debate for the purpose of casting some light on the Estimate. I am a man who has been trying to avoid fighting all my life, and I never try to answer questions until I have been asked them.  In my particular little section of the Department of Defence I did not find any type of criticism that needed any answer. Deputy Mulcahy suggested that I made one intervention in the debate, and that was, as he said, to utter a few words under my teeth to Deputy Giles.  I believe every man in every Party should get fair play, and whether or not he has a case to make he should be allowed to make it, or to try to make it.  I do not think I have ever interrupted any Deputy. Deputy Giles and I suffer from certain disabilities.  We are both country men <Col N="1783" /> and we are more used to work than to be talking about work, and because of that, we find it rather difficult to clothe in satisfactory words any ideas we may have.  For that reason, for Deputy Giles and myself, there is even more latitude than for a very eloquent Deputy like Deputy O'Higgins.  I want to say that I do not like an accusation of that sort to be made against me because I am inclined to play the game.  I did not interrupt Deputy Giles on the occasion of his speech.  This is not a plea on my own behalf that I should not be interrupted.  I am not particularly interested in that respect.  I am responsible for a certain small amount of the expenditure that it is proposed to undertake as a result of this Vote.</P>
      <P>I am confronted with several methods of meeting the Opposition attack on the proposed defence expenditure and organisation.  I have already explained, to the apparent satisfaction of so severe a critic as Deputy Dillon, the activities of the Department in relation to A.R.P. Deputy Davin has a habit of missing the tide.  I hope the schedule in the North Wall will not be affected by Deputy Davin's new promotion.  He prepared a speech on A.R.P. a couple of months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, he was not present when the matter was discussed. Even though all the problems that affected him two months ago were, to the satisfaction of Deputy Dillon, resolved in this House, Deputy Davin felt that the midnight oil should not be wasted, and that we should have the benefit of his ideas on the problem of A.R.P.  I answered all those questions but I may come back to the Deputy again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attack is often the best line of defence and I could make my defence of the Estimate by attacking many imbecilities which seem to be a feature of the opposition to any Government proposal.  Finally, I have decided to <Col N="1784" /> take the line which I shall indicate. While it is possibly the most difficult line, it is the line that, to my mind, is most beneficial and most straightforward in so serious a matter as that which confronts the country.  I propose to assume that while the Opposition believes that its main business is to oppose it is anxious to co-operate with us in what is, in our common opinion, the best method of dealing nationally with the present situation.  In last week's debate, the criticism of the Opposition boiled down to two main points and a minor point&mdash;the illegitimate black baby of A.R.P.&mdash;which nobody wants to recognise.  The two main points raised in the debate were the inadequacy or absence of any Government defence policy and the inefficiency of the machine which is to implement that defence policy if we need it.</P>
    <P>The defence policy of a Government is affected and conditioned by things external in a way that the policy of no other Government Department is affected.  I do not think that it should be discussed in the same fashion or along the same lines as Government policy in any other Department of State.  Again, policy and planning, particularly in the Department of Defence, are very much interwoven, and discussion of Army plans in public does not seem to me to be good military practice or good defence practice. A Government in a democratic country is elected on a declared policy and part of that policy&mdash;a very important part&mdash;is concerned with defence.  In discussing the policy of defence in time of war or imminent danger, the most that can be expected from a Government is a statement of the objective at which the Government aims and&mdash;in very broad outline only &mdash;a statement of the means by which it hopes to reach that objective.  It has been said here in the Dáil and throughout the country that the policy of the Government at the present time is neutrality.  What is meant by &ldquo;policy&rdquo;?  Whatever the dictionary may say, I would say that policy is a considered line of action, adapted to circumstances, and directed to the achievement of a desired objective. <Col N="1785" /> What is our objective?  I am not in the confidence of the Cabinet nor do I know what plans the Army Command have for the defence of the country. I said to an Opposition Deputy who argued with me one time about the question of defence that, in my belief, there should not be any Parliamentary Secretaries.  A Parliamentary Secretary is a very humble person.  He does not know much.  He has to believe what he is told and do what he is told, and he hopes that the Opposition and, particularly, the people in his own constituency will do the same.</P>
    <P>I have no particular and special information at my disposal.  I think it was Deputy Mulcahy who said that we have no information other than that supplied by the much-censored newspapers and the Dáil debates.  I have not any more information than Deputy Mulcahy.  If I were to say what is the objective of the Government at the present juncture, I would say that it is at least the preservation of the measure of freedom we already have &mdash;as Deputy Dillon said, the preservation of the Irish race in all its vitality and vigour.  Deputy McGilligan said last week, and I agree with him, that neutrality is spoken of in this House and outside this House as if it were some sort of closed compartment in which people could hide and as if people, having opted for a policy of neutrality, could have the assurance that that neutrality would be respected by everybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan knows, and I know, that neutrality is not a bombproof funk hole in which the people of the country can hibernate until after the war.  He knows there is danger, real danger, to this country.  He knows&mdash;we have seen it in the newspapers&mdash;that if there is a possibility of a fight between the belligerents for the possession of Iceland and Greenland, then surely there is tremendous danger of a fight between the belligerents for the possession of this country.  He is not asking, as Deputy Mulcahy asked: &ldquo;Where is the danger?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, opening the debate, said that we had got no <Col N="1786" /> information with regard to the position of this country, the defence plans of the country or the dangers confronting the country.  I say that I do not know what plans the Army have for the defence of the country.  I do not think I am entitled to know what plans the Army have.</P>

      <P>It would seem to me to be enough for the Government and the political Parties to state as exactly as possible what their military and defence objectives are and to entrust to the Army leaders, the military experts and technicians, the forwarding and the implementation of plans for securing these objectives.  So far as the danger confronting the country is concerned, Deputy Esmonde speaking in this debate said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This time last year I do not think any individual here could have believed that within 12 months the face of Europe could and would have changed to present the picture which it presents at the present time.  If there had been a prophet here 12 months ago who could state that Poland, Denmark, Norway and parts of Finland would have disappeared within 12 months, I think such a prophet would have been laughed out of court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Esmonde was right and, with the example before us of what has happened in the past 12 months, he would be a rash man to-day who would prophesy what would happen in the next 12 months.  Deputy Esmonde says that the only way in which we can keep ourselves from invasion is by showing ourselves to be men of peace.  Deputy Esmonde has a good deal of military experience and a good many years ago when he thought his services were needed, in defence of an ideal which he believed in then, he became a soldier.  I find it difficult to believe that in spite of his avowed pacifism he would not to-day be prepared to defend an ideal which is closer to home, closer to all of us.  He reminds me in his pacifism of a very well-known soldier, the late <Col N="1787" /> Brigadier-General Crozier, who after a lifetime in warfare, became in his old age a pacifist.  I would suggest to Deputy Esmonde that <i>A Brass Hat in No Man's Land</i> is a much more interesting and stimulating story than the book of the pacifist, <i>The Men I Killed.</i> Impossible idealisms are not the best national policy.</P>
    <P>Men of good will without arms have always been conquered by men of ill-will with arms.  If we had not an Irish Army mobilised here to-day in Ireland, if we demobilised the Army and hoped to preserve such independence as we have by a show of pacifism, how many hours would pass before we would have another army in Ireland?  There might be two armies in Ireland disputing for the possession of the country. The British Empire, think of it what we will, was not built up by men who lacked foresight and energy, and Britain could not defend herself to-day if she were not led by men of the same foresight and energy.  If you had no army of your own in this country, the morning hostilities began between England and Germany, that very morning you might have had Britain disembarking an army on our shores for her own defence and Deputy Esmonde's pacifism would be of damn little use to him then.</P>
    <P>We got a gem as usual from Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon said:  &ldquo;If Great Britain reoccupies this country we have got to start the same kind of war that we fought against them before, guerilla warfare, which may go on for our lives and the lives of our children and their children's grandchildren... which warfare will go on for 700 years&rdquo;.  Does Deputy O'Higgins not know that that is tripe?  I find little comfort in the prospect of getting out the British, or the soldiers of any other nation who landed here, in 700 years time.  There seems to have occurred some sort of sea change in Deputy Dillon's attitude towards the things which men on this side of the House and men on the other side of the House believed in and fought for. Deputy Dillon speaks so intimately of flying columns one would think that he <Col N="1788" /> was a member of one of them.  If he talks about guerilla warfare and getting the British out in 700 years' time anybody who knows anything about it knows that he is living in the long, long past.  The year 2640 is of very little use to me as a date for getting the British or the Germans out, if they came.  I have a number of small children, as a lot of Deputies here have, too.  There is a rising generation of children and I should like to pass on to them at least the measure of freedom that we now enjoy.  I should like to pass on to them a country reasonably prosperous and one with a guarantee of tradition behind personal liberty and democracy. I think that the best way to get the British out of here is to keep them out and the only way we can hope to keep them out is by having an army and a public opinion here prepared to make all sacrifices with that intent.  What I have to say of Britain applies to Germany with equal force.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not believe that it is tactful to go out of our way to give offence to any country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From such a pugnacious individual as Deputy O'Higgins that is unusual.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that the most offensive thing that we have done was to mobilise immediately we got an unsolicited assurance from the German representative that the neutrality of this country would be respected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The most offensive thing that we in this country could do would be to leave another nation in doubt as to our attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes said a threat was made against this country that, if we continued to supply food-stuffs to Great Britain, certain measures might be taken to prevent our doing so and that this might mean a visitation from bombers.  We must tell those who are responsible for that statement&mdash;if the statement has been made&mdash;that we insist on our rights to carry on the normal trade which is necessary for the life of our country.  This is not swashbuckling; it is not Chauvinism. Like Deputy O'Higgins, I should <Col N="1789" /> prefer a successful defence, even though it may not be as spectacular as a glorious failure.  I agree with him there.  This country is just tired of moral victories, as the Fine Gael Party ought to be.  The defence policy of this Government is the building up, the training and the equipping in the best manner open to us, of the Army; and the mobilisation of all national opinion in support of that Army.  So much for policy.</P>
    <P>In the debate here last week, a good deal of criticism was aimed at the Army.  Personally, I may say that I have always had a tremendous affection for soldiers, even though they may have been ranged on the side to which I did not belong.  There is something genial, something devil-may-care, about the soldier's attitude towards life which is altogether different from the attitude towards life of the careful business man.  He is not always counting the cost&mdash;in fact, the very profession he adopts points out that he has not counted the cost much.  I have not the civilian attitude towards life that has been displayed here by certain members of the Dáil in relation to the Army.  I trust I will not be regarded as a British imperialist when I say that Kipling sensed that anti-soldier attitude when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is Tommy this and Tommy that,</P>
    <P>And chuck him out, the brute;</P>
    <P>And welcome Mr. Atkins</P>
    <P>When the guns begin to shoot.</P>
    <P>There is imminent danger of guns beginning to shoot at the present time, and it is about time that we showed a little bit of respect and confidence for the soldier and for the Army.  Such respect and such confidence would have a great effect for good in the Army and in the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that I am not used to speaking and am a little bit deaf also, and cannot grasp everything at once.  Now, I have not had much contact with the Army, nor have I had much contact with a lot of the officers of the Army, but I have had some contact with senior officers of the Army and I will say that I was tremendously impressed by their ability and by their energy and I was impressed further by another thing, and that is the fact that they considered their profession as being something more than a mere way of making a living and that they also have a very high sense of their duty to their country and an interest in its welfare. Deputy O'Higgins criticised the Volunteers and the method of recruitment and organisation of the Volunteer force.  When the Volunteer force was organised some years back, the idea of a Volunteer force was new.  Ideas are not always perfect at the beginning and you cannot expect that your idea of a Volunteer force is going immediately to produce an army, booted, spurred, equipped, armed and disciplined, right off the reel.  As the years have gone by, however, the organisation of the Volunteers has developed progressively, and the Volunteers have developed a keen sense of discipline and a keen sense of duty, and I know that the Army Command is quite satisfied with the progress <Col N="1791" /> made by the Volunteer force and also quite satisfied that it can mould the Volunteers into a very fine body of soldiers.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a tremendous objection to the Volunteers by the Opposition.  That is an ancient objection arising out of the lack of a proper appreciation of military matters.  During the American Civil War, General Johnston of the Confederate Army, when he saw a regiment of volunteers passing by, said, like the members of the Opposition, that he would not give one company of regulars for a whole regiment of volunteers.  On the other hand, the famous general in the American Civil War, Stonewall Jackson, said that the patriotic volunteer, fighting for his country and his rights, makes the most reliable soldier on earth, and Stonewall Jackson proved it.  A Deputy here referred to the Volunteers in this country as casual soldiers.  A casual soldier is an accidental soldier, and accidents happen in every army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and in every Party, but I hope this accident will not be too serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the purposes of discipline and organisation to get rid of these, and that has been done relentlessly and ruthlessly in the Volunteer force.  The word &ldquo;casual&rdquo; in the mouth of a Deputy, referring to soldiers, is a bad one, but the use of such words as &ldquo;corner boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;ragamuffin&rdquo; by another Deputy sounds to me very evil.  The same Deputy made reference to a number of young soldiers who flung away their rifles in order to grab at a few apples. Well, I think that the legend of Atalanta is not more far-fetched than that.  I know that after the raid on the Magazine, when bodies of troops were around the country, I was held up on the roads a dozen times by Volunteers, and I and my companions were kept covered in such a way by the Volunteers that, if they were as nervous as I was, I would not be speaking here to-night.  That has been <Col N="1792" /> my experience, not once but a dozen times, and the statement that a number of soldiers threw away their rifles to grab at a few apples is one which I beg to doubt very gravely.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton talked of the coldness and inhumanity of the treatment received by certain officers as a result of the inquiry into the Magazine raid. He said that this was quite unworthy of the Minister and of a public Department.  National policy is solely a matter for the Government and solely their responsibility, and it is not a matter for discussion by the Army.  Army organisation is a matter of technique and one on which the Government and the Army would find many matters of profitable discussion, but it seems to me that Army discipline, except in the extreme case of a mutiny by an Army command, is entirely a matter for the Army. Deputy Dillon spoke a few nights ago about the release of certain prisoners, put into a guard room or imprisoned in some other way, and he stated that these men were imprisoned for insubordination and were released, over the heads of their officers, by order of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies in the Opposition say that neither the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence nor myself knows his place or knows his position, but, certainly, if it can be proved that any Minister interfered in a matter of discipline in this fashion, then he should not be a Minister here.  I do not think that Deputy Dillon does his duty to this Dáil or to the country if he knows of such a thing to have happened that he would not try to elucidate the full facts here and bring them before us.  An undisciplined army destroys itself.  In the interests of its own safety and preservation, army discipline must be maintained and there must not be interference by outsiders in the question of army discipline. As I see it, this question in regard to the Magazine raid was not a matter for the Minister.  It was a matter for the Army chiefs.  Every Army officer with the least shadow of intelligence knows that indiscipline will smash an army.  The Government <Col N="1793" /> and the Minister for Defence must entrust the preservation of discipline to the Army Command and be advised by them and must support them in this matter with all the forces at their command.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell Deputy Norton that an army is not organised along the lines of a trade union.  Freedom of action is necessarily much more circumscribed and methods of enforcing discipline naturally much more drastic. G.K. Chesterton in some book of his told the story of a man who came along to join the British Army, and when asked his religion he said he was a Methusalite.  When he was asked to describe the tenets of that religion he said it was to try to live as long as he could.  He had a poor conception of his religion.  If his religion was to try to live as long as he could he did not come into the right church.  He had a poor conception of the implications of military organisation.  Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and we are all natural-born Methusalites, but an army is a fighting machine, the units of which may be faced at any time with battle, murder and sudden death, and the methods of training and discipline must be directed towards the overcoming of the natural human repugnance to pain, suffering and bloodshed.  It must be welded into one unit acting under one directing mind and its training must be hard and Spartan-like.  Duty must be always and forever the din in the soldier's ear, and it must forever be the example given to him by his officers.</P>
    <P>Dereliction of duty on the part of a private is an evil thing.  On the part of an officer it is a criminally evil thing.  I am a very fearful individual. I have always found it difficult in times of trouble to allay my nervous apprehensions and control my fears and if I had been in the Magazine as part of the company that held the Magazine I would probably be the &ldquo;windiest&rdquo; man in the Magazine but I would be dead now.</P>

I am sorry that Deputy Norton was not here so that he could listen to the lecture but I hope he will read the debate and we might come back on the matter again.</P>
