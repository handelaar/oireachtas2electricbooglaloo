      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that evening classes in agricultural science in rural technical schools have been closed at the request of the Department of Agriculture which objected that these classes trespassed on their domain, and whether he will take steps to have this objection overruled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware no evening classes in agricultural science in rural technical schools have been closed at the request of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The provision of instruction in the technical and economic aspects of agriculture for persons actually engaged in farming is the function of the committees of agriculture.  The vocational education committees are empowered under the Act of 1930 merely to provide instruction in the elementary scientific principles of agriculture for young persons who may later be engaged in farm work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that in many parts of this country it is impossible to get a 16-year-old or 17-year-old boy to come to a day-time class in agricultural science, that instructors, moved by their own enthusiasm, have in certain cases set up evening classes of technical instruction in agricultural science which were being well attended No. 13. <Col N="1824" /> and that they were requested by the Department to close them on the ground that this was a trespass on the Department's domain?  Surely, the Minister does not object to the imparting of instruction to the youths of the country in agricultural science through the technical schools if that be practicable?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will cause inquiries to be made into the standard of education obtaining amongst ex-pupils of primary schools who enter the rural technical schools, with a view to deciding whether a preliminary year of instruction <Col N="1825" /> in reading, writing and arichmetic is requisite for most pupils enrolling in rural technical schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am having inquiries made as suggested by the Deputy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that during the 1914-18 war the regulations of the Dublin Corporation governing the keeping of swine in the city area which ensured that pigs should not be kept at a less distance than 50 feet from any adjoining dwelling-house were relaxed; and, if so, if he will permit a similar relaxation during the period of the present war, subject to the strict observance in such cases of all other public health requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in view of the increase in the price of flannelettes, he will recommend to the Minister for Finance that the duty of 40 per cent. at present levied should be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has, I understand, been a recent increase in the price of flannelette, the increase being due to a substantial advance in the price of cotton.  The increase in the price of cotton has, of course, been general and applies not only to our own manufacturers but also to the textile trade in the various other countries concerned.  In the circumstances I see no reason to recommend the removal of the duty on flannelette.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that, as a result of the increased cost of flannelette, resulting on the increased cost of cotton, the duty has become an added burden and that where in the past people had to take 10d. value for 1/-, they have now to take 7d. value for 1/-, partly due to the world rise in the price of cotton and partly due to the 40 per cent. tariff?  Does the Minister realise that 40 per cent. on a 6d. cloth is substantially less than 40 per cent. on the same cloth when world prices have raised the cost from 6d. to 8d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking for the abolition of the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be some case for a modification of the duty, but I do not think there is any case for its abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that to secure supplies from <Col N="1827" /> any source is extremely difficult and that to require people to go without clothing essential to keep warmth in their bodies because they cannot afford to pay for it is an intolerable hardship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence that they cannot afford to pay for it, nor have I any evidence that the price is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not alleging that the price charged by the Irish manufacturers, considering their small output and the difficulties with which they have to contend, is excessive.  I am aware that the price of cotton has gone up.  What I am asking the Minister is, in view of that fact, will he not withdraw the duty while the price of cotton is so high as to make the cost of flannelette plus the 40 per cent. tariff almost prohibitive for the poor? I tell the Minister that people are paying 1/- for flannelette which before the war cost only 7d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five firms all of which afford a considerable amount of employment engaged in this industry, and I certainly could not contemplate any action which would put these firms out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the abolition of the tax would not mean that these firms would have to go out of business? One of the firms concerned is the Greenmount Mills, and I am aware that they would gladly cease the manufacture of flannelette as it would enable them to employ their looms in manufacturing other products.  They regard flannelette as a real nuisance and the tariff as a real blister on the backs of the people of this country at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go so far as to say that they are so inadequate as all that but, as I have already informed the Deputy, the position is being closely examined by the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply will he explain why, in view of the appeal made by the Taoiseach and other members of the Government to private employers to retain staffs during the emergency, he could not at least pay some honour to that appeal by retaining the staff of his own Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, these men were retained during the emergency period until we saw how we could carry on on a normal basis. Their being out of employment now is ruled entirely by the fact that we have no work for them to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the fact that persons who want to have telephones installed to-day are experiencing delay in having them installed solely because of the <Col N="1831" /> fact that there are not sufficient men to carry out the work?  Is he not aware of the further fact that many lines of communication throughout the country are very badly in need of repair and that many poles and connections are very badly in need of renewal?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the dismissal of these 36 men in the engineering branch is directly contrary to the appeal made by the Taoiseach?  If a Government Department feels that it can set that sort of headline to private employers, how does the Government expect private employers to listen to one word of the appeal made by the Taoiseach and other members of the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue in force for another year the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923 to 1939, which will expire on the 31st March next.  The preparation of the permanent Defence Bill, the desirability of which has been adverted to in this House on many occasions, was completed last year.  It would have been introduced during the last Session had the present emergency not arisen, with the result that, in existing circumstances, the introduction of a <Col N="1833" /> comprehensive measure consisting of some 300 sections would have been inopportune.  It was decided not to proceed with the permanent Defence Bill at present, but to promote a considerably shorter measure which, I hope, I may be able to introduce in this House later in the present Session. It will relate mainly to the marine and coast watching services, and certain other matters, provision for which the present emergency has rendered highly desirable.  In former years the House was good enough to grant all stages of the Bill at the one sitting, and I trust it will be possible to give the same facilities this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate that the Minister's hope will be justified by events.  I think the Minister might very well have given this House longer notice of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill this year, than he has seen fit to give.  But that difficulty is aggravated by the announcement made by the Government yesterday, that they intended to discharge the Second Reading of the permanent statute and that they have now abandoned it altogether, and propose to substitute a skeleton measure to deal with coast watching services.  That means that the permanent Defence legislation is indefinitely postponed.  I shall not comment on the indignation with which members of the present Government used to criticise the last Government, for failing to make permanent provision for the Defence Forces when, after eight years of office, they find themselves constrained to come before the House and say they are unable to do so themselves.  I do not dwell on that because I think graver issues are raised and that everybody feels an obligation in regard to certain public services to exercise discretion, and even forbearance, in order to enable the Executive to take such measures as they think necessary to put them in proper order, but I think the time has now come when discretion and forbearance impose on this House the obligation to challenge the Minister to render an account of his stewardship, and the stewardship <Col N="1834" /> of his predecessor in the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>He told us yesterday that he did not propose to publish the minutes of evidence of the Commission of Inquiry which sat and inquired into the disgraceful episode of the Magazine Fort. He told us that he would give no undertaking whatever to give the House any information that might have been brought under his notice as a result of that investigation.  It, therefore, seems to me that the time has come to state quite openly in the House what is being stated widely throughout the country, and to afford the Minister for Defence an opportunity to restore public confidence in the Army, on the same basis that it enjoyed before the present Government accepted responsibility for that Army.  The policy of the late Government was to have a small highly efficient Army with a full personnel of technicians.  The object was to keep it small, and to raise its standard of perfection, so that in a time of emergency it might be used as the basis for a wide expansion into a larger fighting force, if the necessity for defending the integrity of the nation should ever arise. It was the policy of the last Government to establish in this country a professional Army, an Army which within its ranks would include no politicians, and have no interest in them, but that accepted as its exclusive duty the defence of the State under the authority of whatever Government the Irish people had by their democratic vote chosen to instal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Prime Minister stated in public that he gladly acknowledged that there was handed over to his Government, when they came into office, a disciplined and loyal Army that was not concerned or interested in the political affiliations of the Minister responsible for the Department of Defence, but was solely concerned to carry out all legitimate orders given to it.  The late Minister for Defence, the present Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, went out of his way to say that he was obliged to admit that although he took office with a certain amount of trepidation, he discovered that the Army gave him a <Col N="1835" /> measure of loyalty and co-operation which, in his most optimistic hour, he would not dare to hope for.  That was the kind of Army we had; that was the kind of Army we were justly proud of; that was the kind of Army that reflected credit on those who manned it and those who raised it.  Have we that kind of Army now?  I am going to suggest to the House that a large number of people believe that we have not; I am going to suggest to the House that it is common talk in the country that the discipline, the morale and the confidence of the personnel of the Army is shattered; and I am going to suggest to the House that recent injections of personnel into the Army have seriously militated against discipline and morale, and that these injections in many cases have shaken the confidence of officers and men in their own colleagues.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures is responsible for raising the sluaighte in this country.  I fully appreciate that there did enrol in the Volunteer force a large number of disinterested and loyal young men who desired nothing but to serve, as they conceived it to be their duty, in the reserve forces of this State, but I submit that, in addition to that, there enrolled a substantial body of persons who had no such intention, but who joined that force believing it to be a political force and intending to discharge the function of political spies and political commissars within the ranks of the Army, and, proceeding on those lines, have wrought havoc with the confidence which is an essential prerequisite of morale and discipline in any army. I am told that occasions have been presented on which members of the sluaighte, when called to task by regular Army military police, have bade them defiance and told them that if they dared to interfere with them they would take the stripes off their sleeves, and the tragedy is that I am not certain that these military police were quite clear in their minds that it was beyond the power of these individuals of the sluaighte to make good their threat.  There was a time when, <Col N="1836" /> if any member of the Army, be he general, colonel, major or private, dared to suggest that it was within his power to subvert the course of justice in respect of his conduct, that very suggestion on his part would have constituted an offence for which he would have been promptly and justly dealt with.</P>
    <P>Can we say as much to-day?  There was a time when if the forces of this State on duty were heard to indulge in political catchcries, or to hold themselves out as the uniformed supporters of an individual political Party, their conduct would have been severely censured and adequate steps taken to prevent a recurrence of such an abuse. Can we say that that has been consistently done in recent years?  Can the Minister deny that, within the ranks of the Army at present, there exists, far from the spirit of absolute confidence between one officer and another, a considerable atmosphere of distrust? Does the Minister think that he contributed to the welfare of our Army, where there is a large number of young officers, blocked by the very nature of our Army from the ordinary rate of promotion that soldiers would normally expect, bearing in mind that all our officers when we started were young men and, therefore, the young man who went into low-commissioned rank found advancement unduly slow, by bringing in a large number of persons of comparatively high-commissioned rank who had never served a day in the Army? Does he think he contributed to the welfare of our Army by bringing in untried, undisciplined and untrained men and making them the commissioned officers of the Volunteer force which was to be the substance of our future armed forces?  Does he think that has had no effect upon the morale of the remainder of the Army who had devoted their lives to, and made their careers, the improvement and uplifting of the national forces of the State? I cannot but think that that course of action was in itself calculated to injure the morale of the Army.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister deny that the sluaighte, while containing individuals <Col N="1837" /> who were <i>bona fide</i> and enthusiastic public servants, were very largely constituted of politically-minded persons in whom he himself to-day has a very imperfect confidence?  Does he consider that the disaster which overtook us at the Magazine Fort would ever have taken place if that arsenal were not partly protected by inadequately trained members of the sluaighte? Does he at this moment deny that in every camp in Ireland, where sluaighte form a part of the personnel, difficulties and disciplinary complexities are presenting themselves which were quite unknown when we were dealing with the regular Army and the regular reserve?</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for anybody who has not available to him the confidential files of the Department of Defence, or who is not free to send for the responsible officers of the Army and to consult them, to know with certainty what the precise nature of the evil is. No such opportunity presents itself to me.  I have no access to the files of the Department of Defence; I have no contact with the officers of the Army, and I am happy to think that if I had, they would not consider it becoming to bring their complaints about such matters to me.  But I have access to the minds of the people up and down the country, and I know what they are thinking, and there is not a Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches who does not know what they are thinking and saying. Their general view is that things are not well with the Army and that view, I am sorry to say, got striking confirmation in the utterly shocking instance at the arsenal, to which reference has been made.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if some of my colleagues who are military men were dealing with this matter, they might be able to go in deeper detail into it. I am glad that the occasion has made it necessary for a civilian member of this Parliament to raise this question, because I think it is a matter to which the civilian section of our community have primarily a right to refer.  Let us never forget in this democratic State that the Army is the servant of the people's Parliament, and that it is the <Col N="1838" /> Army's duty, through their Minister, to satisfy, not only themselves, but the democratic Parliament of the people that they are delivering the goods.  It is not enough for the Minister for Defence to say, as the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures has stated on a previous occasion, that he is not interested in civilians' criticism of Army matters.  It is his duty to be interested.  It is the bounden duty of the Minister for Defence to satisfy civilian members of the House that things are as they should be, and it is the duty of the Minister to remember in his own person, and to keep constantly before the minds of the younger officers of the Army who may require such reminder&mdash;I do not think that the senior officers do&mdash;that the control in all these matters must be always vested in Parliament and that Parliament must be satisfied from day to day, from week to week, and from year to year that its will and not that of the Army Council shall ultimately prevail in all matters relating to the Army, as it must in regard to every other Department of State.</P>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion.  I have emphasised twice, and I desire to do so again, that there were individuals who joined the sluaighte in good faith and have done their service in good faith and are anxious to live up to the high traditions established by the Army in this country during the earlier years of its existence.  They were high traditions; they were traditions that any young country might be proud of. They were an Army built out of a revolutionary army, an Army confronted with all the trials and difficulties of a civil war in the first years of their existence and, nevertheless, after ten years an Army which reflected credit on the State.  Therefore, I should be sorry if this House should condemn without discretion the entire personnel of the Volunteer force.  But, I think the time has come to sort the wheat from the chaff, and I suggest to the Minister for Defence that the first step he should take is to invite the members of the Volunteer force either to join the regular Army or else to return to civilian life.  I believe that <Col N="1839" /> that is a good rough-and-ready way of putting the wheat into the Army and returning the chaff to civilian life to convert itself into some useful material in whatever civilian occupation it may care to pursue.  That done, I think it should be made perfectly clear that the day when there was any differentiation between the personnel of the Volunteer force and that of the regular Army is over and that there should be equal discipline and equal justice for all. Thirdly, that it should be made quite clear to the new force and to the old that the old standards of discipline must be maintained and improved upon, and that the Army has no room within its ranks for men not prepared to give of their best to the service to which they voluntarily belong.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Army of this country consisting not of an undisciplined rabble that I think certain elements in the Volunteer force would wish to turn it into; but I should like to see them what I am convinced the regular Army is capable of being made into, as highly disciplined, as highly trained, and as highly honourable an Army as there is in Europe.  I should like soldiers in the Irish Army to be looked upon, in the commissioned ranks, as professional men of a standing second to no profession in this country, and, in the uncommissioned ranks, as skilled craftsmen as valuable, if not more so, as the members of any other skilled trade in the community. Discipline, confidence, and morale are, in our opinion, gravely shaken.  I charge the Minister now to tell the House honestly what the true situation is and what steps he proposes to take to put it right.  I want to ask the Minister another question.  Large sums of money have been appropriated in this House during the last couple of years for the equipment of the Army.  I want to know how has that money been spent.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill policy may be discussed. The Deputy's speech so far has been mainly directed to policy.  It is obvious that the Minister is not in a position to discuss administrative <Col N="1840" /> details which will arise on the Army Estimate and also on the Minister's Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I wanted to raise was, what the policy of the Government was in the matter of getting supplies for the Army.  Are we orientating our purchasing in directions where replacements and parts and ammunition for armaments already acquired can be readily secured, or has there been a policy in the Department of buying equipment indiscriminately anywhere without any due regard being paid to the possibility of replacing it or completing it with the necessary ammunition or spare parts which user would make necessary?</P>
      <P>I have reason to believe that during the present emergency and even before the present emergency the Government had no policy in regard to this matter; instead of realising that Army supplies which are not bought with one's eyes wide open for two or three years ahead are worthless, and that Army supplies, replacements of which cannot be supplied when they are needed, are worthless, the Government have bought without advertence to these facts.  But the Government are now discovering that much of what they bought is perfectly worthless because they are finding that they are quite unable to get the replacement parts which are necessary for the full user of these armaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, fortunately all this money has not gone, and if it is to be properly spent and if the Army is to be enabled to do its job, the Minister ought to tell us here to-day what plans he has in mind to provide the Army with the equipment that will fit it to do its job. There is no use in telling the Air Force to equip itself to do credit to this country in a time of emergency if you do not give them the wherewithal to fly.  There is no use in providing the Air Force with equipment if every time they lose a king-pin they discover that it is impossible to replace it.  There is no use in providing the Air Force or any other division of the Army with small arms if they discover later that the only place where they can get anything <Col N="1841" /> to fit these small arms is no longer prepared to deliver these replacements.  There is no use in inviting the artillery to familiarise itself with the most modern instruments of war if you furnish them with instruments which, if it became necessary to expand the Army, it would be quite impossible for us to get for the Army.  If you make up your mind to the fact that this country has to defend itself in arms as a sovereign State we have got to train the Army to use arms that we can buy and we have to make up our minds that these arms, armaments and munitions with which we are training our Army will be available from sources that in a time of emergency we can reach.</P>
    <P>There was some talk one time of getting the Imperial Chemicals Company to build a munition factory in Clare.  That has gone up the spout. Now that it has gone up the spout, let us come down to earth and make up our minds what we are going to do. Are we to make the Skoda works in Czecho-Slovakia our source of supply or are we to write a polite note to Herr Hitler that we want him to send us a shipload of armaments and munitions in the middle of a European war and, incidentally, in order to deliver that shipload to us, to sink the British Fleet?  Or are we going to buy our arms and munitions in England, or are we going to buy them in America?  I have no doubt that every loyal Fianna Fáil heart bounds when I suggest that we should buy them in America.  But let us make up our minds that if we are to buy them in America, America will want to get cash and when we buy them the payment will have to be with sterling credit.  Let us make up our minds that we will have that sterling credit wherewith to buy these armaments. But, if those who control sterling credit say that it is not to be used for that purpose, what is the position? Then if the United States say that they are supplying only on the basis of cash-and-carry, we would be left with guns, but with no munitions.  Let the Minister tell us does he propose to get arms and the wherewithal to use them from the only place where we will <Col N="1842" /> always have credit to purchase them&mdash; that is from Great Britain?  There is no use going on with the silly kind of codology, of which the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defence is so fond, conducting manæuvres on the Six-County Border in order to show his readiness to do or die.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to find what is the policy of the Minister in this matter.  Has the Minister a policy of building up a highly-efficient Army, an Army that will protect the sovereign independence of this country and that will be supplied with the necessary equipment?  I suggest that buying your munitions from sources that cannot be tapped in the hour of emergency is not the right way to set about defending this country from invasion; it is merely playing at arms. I submit that we ought to build up our <Col N="1843" /> Army on the basis that in any probable contingency where it would be necessary to use that Army, we would be able to get armaments and munitions to fit the supplies we already have, so that those out in the field would be assured of an adequate supply of arms and that they would not be told half-way through the battle that we could not get a supply of arms from Yangtse-Kiang or from Central Europe because we had no means of paying for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister says &ldquo;I can get equipment for the Army from any part of the world and I can get credit to pay for them any time without any difficulty at all,&rdquo; that is a reasonable answer.  But if he is constrained to say: &ldquo;I admit that taking into consideration the question of credits for the purchase of equipment and the transport difficulties about getting that Army equipment here, there is only one rational source of supply and that is Great Britain&rdquo;, let him get up and say that to the House.  Let the Minister say: &ldquo;I have to face that fact and I am pursuing a policy boldly and coldly based on that fact because it is my duty to provide this State with an efficient Army and to provide that efficient Army with adequate means to do justice to the spirit that inspires it&rdquo;.  Brave men cannot fight without arms and it is up to him to tell us how he is going to put into the hands of these men the wherewithal to do justice to their past and to the reputation I hope they will still acquire in the future.  I have spoken freely and frankly because I am perfectly certain that much of what I am saying would be said under the rose not only by members on this side of the House but by members on the Government side too.  I have no doubt if the Minister will get up and make a true and frank statement as to the measures he proposes to take to secure the state of efficiency that both he and I hope to see in the Army he will meet no captious criticism from any part of the House.  If he is prepared to face this matter courageously and fearlessly I promise him all the help, moral and <Col N="1844" /> active, which he may require to restore the Army to that pitch of efficiency and excellence which the Minister for Co-Ordination requires, that competency which he acknowledged the Army had reached when it was handed over to him in 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were talking on a debate on some other subject I might go into some detail to congratulate Deputy Dillon on his conversion to the policy of self-sufficiency. I hope that the very good principle that the Deputy enunciated here to-day in relation to the supplies for the Army will be kept in mind by him when talking about the supply of the necessities of life for the people.  &ldquo;There is no use in having guns without bullets.&rdquo; That is agreed.  But there is no use in having gullets without food, a position in which we might have found ourselves if Deputy Dillon's policy of depending upon outside supplies of food for the people had been in operation in this country in recent years. The people of the country, the people on the opposite side of the House and the people here, have, I believe, the same fundamental idea of what the Army should be.  We want it to be disciplined and controlled by the Government elected by the people.  It is unfortunate that Deputy Dillon or anybody else should use language which would throw doubt upon the existence of that state of affairs at the moment because, by and large, I would say that the Army of to-day is as disciplined and as loyal to the Government elected by the Irish people as the army of any other country is to the Government elected by its people.  That is not to say that there can never be in our Army an individual act of indiscipline.  Nobody would claim that for any army in the world or for any organisation.  Deputy Dillon himself has been disciplined by his own organisation in recent times, but I say that the Army is at present a disciplined Army, that it is giving full loyalty to the Government and that, as far as its resources permit, it is forming a protective force to defend the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> Deputy Dillon threw some doubt upon the utility of the Volunteer force as an effective defensive force and said that we should have only a regular Army.  But the question is: Can we afford, as a small country, to keep a standing Army of the strength necessary to give adequate protection to our people or can we afford a standing Army which will give the same amount of protection to the people as an Army composed half of regulars and half of reservists of one type or another?  This question was discussed many times in this House.  This Government and the last Government had the view that we should have, in addition to the regular Army, reservists of some kind.  The last Government established a Volunteer force.  They had a Volunteer reserve force in addition to the reservists who had passed through the standing Army.  They had the &ldquo;B&rdquo; reserve force and, at least, half of the reservists of 1932 were what were called &ldquo;B&rdquo; reserve men who served three months with the standing Army, then went on to the reserve and came up for a month every year.</P>
    <P>As regards the Volunteer force, before a man becomes a first-class Volunteer he has to do three months' training with the regular Army or its equivalent in local drills.  He has to reach a three months' standard before he is recognised as a trained Volunteer. Up to that, he is an untrained man. Every military officer would like to see that three months' period extended to three years, but does Deputy Dillon or anybody else think we can afford to keep a fairly large defence force organised and trained on that basis?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon alluded to the number of Volunteer officers and indicated by question that the fact that a number of Volunteer officers were commissioned created distrust in the Army because they were blocking jobs to which the regular personnel would be promoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that that has been made clear.  The officers to whom the Deputy alluded are members of the regular Army and subject to regular Army discipline.  The young men who joined the Volunteers and were commissioned as Volunteer officers are not blocking promotion in the regular Army.  They are two separate branches of the Defence force.  If they were called out on permanent service, Volunteer officers of long standing might be promoted and put over the heads of junior regular Army officers but that is quite all right.  You have the same thing in every country in which you have a territorial force and a regular army.  The young Volunteer officers are a credit to the country and a credit to themselves.  They are highly trained men.  No man is ever commissioned as a Volunteer officer who has not done the equivalent of about nine months intensive study, and that is pretty good.  Most of them have done a preliminary three months as privates. They have done a further three months as N.C.O's.  After that, they did six months in the Officers' Training College in the Curragh Camp or an equivalent course under the regular Army instructors in Portobello Barracks.  They are highly trained and are recognised as fully efficient to handle the number of men of which they have control.  It has been arranged that if any of these Volunteer officers ever qualify, through length of service and initiative, to take charge of a battalion or higher unit they will have to do an extension course on &ldquo;Command and staff&rdquo; as other officers would have to do. Volunteer officers do not block promotion in the regular Army.  They are an essential part of our Defence force so that we may have officers to take charge of an increased number of reservists in time of emergency.</P>

      <Col N="1847" /> Now, Deputy Dillon asked a question&mdash;and again I thought that, by his asking the question, he would have indicated to somebody that he had knowledge which he did not want to communicate directly and which he was imparting by way of question&mdash;and that was whether Volunteers bid defiance to regular Army officers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, wait a moment.  I said regular Army military police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Military police?  Well, if they do, and if the military policeman did not discipline them there and then, he was at fault himself.  A military policeman has the same powers of discipline over a Volunteer as he has over a regular soldier or a member of the regular reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister himself heard of such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I personally have not heard of such cases, but I am not prepared to say, knowing men and knowing soldiers, that somewhere or another no military policeman was ever called a son of a sea-cook by a Volunteer or by a regular soldier.  There are probably such instances, but none came to my personal attention.  However, even though it may be the fact that one or two cases of this kind occurred, it is not typical of the relationship of military policemen or regular military officers to the Volunteer force.  If they are under their command, they are under their command, and there is the same power and authority over them as if they were regular soldiers.  It is the same code of discipline that applies to both forces and it is the one Army Act that governs and disciplines both.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Can the Minister deny that there is a want of confidence and that there is an atmosphere of distrust?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, the Minister for Defence can <Col N="1848" /> speak for himself, but I never found it when I was Minister for Defence, nor have I found it to be so since then in any contacts I have made.  Again, there may be individuals in the Volunteer force who should not be there, but every care that it was possible to take in their selection was taken.  The ordinary routine in regard to the enlistment of any soldier is that the local Gárdaí are asked for information about the man, and the same thing happens in regard to the Volunteer force.  In spite of that, however, people may have got into the Volunteers who should not be there, just as in the case of the regular Army there are sometimes enlisted men who should not be allowed in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked a question as to whether the Magazine Fort would have fallen if it had not been partly manned by Volunteers.  In my belief, that had nothing vital to do with the matter, but that is a question in regard to which certain men may have to stand trial and I do not want to go any further into it.  From the general public point of view, however, I think that the people can have confidence that the Army will give a good account of itself.  One incident did occur which, I am perfectly prepared to admit, did gravely disturb public confidence in the Army, but in my belief it is not typical of the state of discipline in the Army as a whole, and accidents do happen in the best regulated families on occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It was got back, and if the action in the Magazine Fort, or the failure there, had been typical of the Army discipline generally, we would not have got back the ammunition as quickly as we did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And I do not propose to go into it, Sir.  With regard to the policy of maintaining the Volunteer Force, I think that it should be kept on.  It may be that there should not be the same distinction in uniform that there is at the moment between the Volunteers and the regular personnel of the Army and that we should follow the same principle as in other countries where the uniforms are identical.  That proposition is being examined in Defence at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the Minister is breaking the news gently, that you are going to incorporate them into the regular Army.  If you do that you will do a very sensible thing&mdash;that is, with regard to the good ones amongst them, and throw the bad ones out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of the use of words.  As far as the Volunteers are concerned, they are portion of the defence forces of Ireland, and the <Col N="1850" /> question as to whether they will wear a different uniform from that of other portions of the defence forces is just in the same category as whether there should be the same uniform for the artillery as there is for the cavalry, or some other corps, and for some time the question of making the one service uniform for both has been under consideration. I do not want to go any further into the matter, but I have dealt with some of the points made by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's announcement about putting the Volunteers into the same uniform as that of the regular Army, is an opportunity going to be given to those amongst them who want to get out, now that the terms of service are to be slightly altered, to get out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>In the concluding portion of Deputy Dillon's speech the Deputy put very strongly to the Minister a question of which the Minister must have taken a note because he made a reference to it in the beginning of his own speech.  The Minister, however, gave no reply to that question, and refused to give a reply to it, quite obviously, by making a gibe at some alleged policy of Deputy Dillon's as regard food.  Did the House, however, hear any reply to the question that was put at some length to the Minister: namely, where the ammunition was to come from?  Not an attempt was made to reply to it.  Does the Minister regard the question of the supply of ammunition for the Army as of no importance? Apparently, he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1851" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has still to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the first thing the Minister referred to in his speech, and yet he did not answer it.  I am now given to understand that he pledges the Minister for Defence to reply to that question.  I hope the Minister for Defence will honour his predecessor's pledge and tell us where he intends to get sufficient ammunition for an increased Army.  It is important. I wonder whether the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, the Minister without portfolio&mdash;possibly that is the reason he lost his Magazine&mdash;attaches more importance to the question of a change of uniform than he does to the supply of ammunition.  Why the change of uniform was stressed I do not know. We gather from what has been said that it is a matter that is getting the serious consideration of Defence authorities at the moment.</P>
      <P>That was the most important thing, in a way, that emerged from the Minister's speech, in answer to criticism. But then, we understood that it did not signify anything at all except a change of clothes.  It is quite obvious that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures regarded it as more important to tell us about that than to tell us what I thought he was going to tell us, where he was going to get the ammunition.  The Minister objects to certain questions put to him, based, as he says, on rumour.  Why have we to depend on rumour?  This is a Bill that deals with discipline, among other matters.  Take the matter that was referred to by the Minister as a great encroachment on discipline. What are we to depend upon except rumour when the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Defence, announced in the House yesterday that information is not going to be given to the House as to the state of discipline in the Army which enables such an event to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say any such thing.</P>

    <Col N="1852" />
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made it quite clear that he was not going to publish the report of the Court of Inquiry.  That is the report that we want, not a doctored account&mdash;I am not saying a deliberately doctored account &mdash;of that report.  We want to know what the state of discipline is; we want to know that there is nothing seriously wrong as a result of the present administration by the Minister and by his predecessor&mdash;that there is nothing seriously wrong in view of that event. The point is that we, who are responsible to the people, are not to be allowed to know precisely what is wrong.  Listening to the Minister's predecessor to-day, the House might imagine that there was nothing at all requiring investigation.  What use is it to us to be told that there is a certain code?  Of course there is a code, but what we want to know is, is it being enforced?  We have seen the discipline and the effectiveness of another branch of the service undermined by interference from above, and we are aware that those who wanted to enforce discipline were almost frowned upon by the members of the Government.</P>
      <P>What the people of the country fear &mdash;I am giving it not as my view, but as the view of the people I meet in the ordinary way&mdash;is that, as a result of Ministerial interference, the ordinary discipline has been affected.  What we are faced with is a refusal to give us the material upon which we can found a decision.  We were asked some time ago to leave over a discussion on this matter until the inquiry that was then proceeding would conclude.  If we are not to get the evidence and the results of the inquiry placed formally before the House, what is the good of asking us to wait?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was there not an implied pledge?  I do not say it was exactly an explicit pledge, but was there not an implied pledge that the House would be put in possession of the full facts that led up to that particular episode?  We have had no satisfactory explanation as to how this occurred.  The Minister is naturally loyal to his own children, so to speak, the Volunteers.  He believes <Col N="1853" /> that their presence there had nothing to do with it.  Let us have the results of the inquiry to show that that is so, to show how it was that people, enemies of the State, got into the Magazine so easily.  Does the Minister not recognise that it is harder for a Deputy to get into this House at the present moment than it was for enemies of the State to get into the Magazine?  Yet, if you are to have an army, the ammunition stored there was of considerable importance.  I regard it as a partial excuse and a proof of the excellent discipline that the ammunition was got back in a comparatively short time.  What you have to explain is that the people who were so incompetent to keep what they had got were competent enough to get into the Magazine.  The getting back of the ammunition makes the original episode&mdash;I suppose the Minister would like to call it that&mdash;all the stranger and more difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>We are told that we want a larger Army.  The Minister who has just spoken, and who was so long responsible for defence, never explained to us how that would really be effective for the purpose of defence in the case of a big European outbreak and a real invasion of this country.  Leaving aside the question of ammunition for that force, I find it difficult to believe that the additional cost that is undertaken and the additional Volunteer units will make us more capable of resisting a real invasion from any of the two opposing sides, if they are able to carry it out.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding many things said by the Minister, I see no reason for changing my views.  I cannot see why a properly disciplined, reliable Army, properly trained and consisting of 5,000 men, would not be as effective for all practical purposes as a bigger Army such as the Minister contemplates and for which no justification has been given.  There is the feeling through the country that not merely has the existence of the Volunteer force not added to our defensive capacity, but it has had, if anything, the opposite effect.  The Minister says that he does not believe that, but let me point out <Col N="1854" /> that apparently we are not going to get a definitely trustworthy document that will enable us to form an opinion as to what the real state of affairs is.</P>
    <P>In view of the Government's attitude, I think it is rather daring&mdash;of course daring is to be expected from a Minister for Defence&mdash;for the Minister to object here because inconvenient questions are asked.  If there are inconvenient questions asked, it is because the country and ourselves are kept in ignorance&mdash;I find it very difficult to avoid saying that we are deliberately kept in ignorance of the real state of affairs.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I cannot envisage a situation in which the addition of these partially trained soldiers can add to our capacity to defend ourselves if our neutrality is violated.  I have never been able to see that, and I must say the Ministry has always refrained from helping us to envisage a situation in which that can take place.  Quite typical, I say, of the whole attitude of the Ministry was the line adopted by the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures in shelving the very definite and clear question put before him by Deputy Dillon&mdash;passing it off with a sneer.  That is not good enough.  It is not good enough for the public, and it will not help to increase confidence in the manner in which that Minister conducted the affairs of the Army while he was in charge of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of making a few observations on the policy of the Government with regard to the defence forces of the country.  The Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures addressed this query to the House: &ldquo;Can we afford to keep a standing Army of the strength necessary to give adequate protection&rdquo;, as an argument why there should be an addition to the standing Army&mdash;a Volunteer force. Now for the past number of years, until the Volunteer force was established, there was in existence a standing Army, a very efficient, well-disciplined, small, model standing Army; but, so far as there were any normal duties connected with the work of a <Col N="1855" /> soldier in the field, none had at any time to be performed by that standing Army.  I have always regarded the existence of a standing Army here, and the justification for the expenditure of public moneys to support it, as being due to this: that it was for the purpose of meeting, at some time, the emergency for which that Army was being prepared.  That emergency would arise either as a result of an invasion of the country by the forces of some outside State, or else be for the purpose of keeping order in the country during the existence of an emergency outside.</P>
      <P>The only reason why the taxpayers of the country should be asked to pay for the maintenance of that standing Army year after year was this: that there would be in reserve some forces, existing for the benefit of the State, to meet such an emergency.  But the policy of the Government has been, so far as I can make out, to operate and use the defence forces only for the purpose of increasing the size of the Army and the quantity of equipment that the Army would use, having regard to the European situation and to the general situation in the world at the present time.  Therefore, this standing Army which has been in existence for some years is, as a result of the policy that the Government are administering, not effective for the purpose for which it has been trained over a very long period.  If the standing Army has been kept in reserve just to meet the situation at the present time, if that is why it is there, and if it is not able to do that now, then obviously it was an unnecessary luxury for which we have been paying year after year.  Now that the situation has arisen for which that standing Army has been trained, we find that we have to spend a great deal more money on it and also to increase its size.  At least that is the policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to take this opportunity of protesting against the policy of the Government in expanding the Army both as regards men and increased expenditure on equipment.  Deputy O'Sullivan very sensibly said, I think, that a small force of 5,000 men would be <Col N="1856" /> just as efficient to withstand any invasion of any part of this country as the present force of, I think, 30,000 men which the Ministry envisage having.  One does not need to have any great knowledge of military matters to know, because anyone reading the papers and taking note of what is going on in the world to-day must realise it, that this country could not afford to defend itself against invasion. That is not a nice thing to have to say, but we have to face the facts in this Assembly when dealing with matters of this kind.  In order to have any reasonable hope of repelling an invasion of this country, we would need to have a very much larger Army than we have had up to the present, and a much better equipped Army.  We would have to spend ten times or perhaps 20 times the amount of money that we voted last year for the upkeep of the Army and its equipment to enable us to do that.  Therefore, the position, so far as repelling an invasion is concerned, is absolutely hopeless.  Everybody in the country realises that.  I can see no justification whatever for increasing the Army to the size now proposed or for expending additional money on it. It is for the purpose of making a protest on these lines that I have risen to speak on this Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards discipline in the Army, I think it is a matter of regret to every Irishman that what happened a few weeks ago was a very serious breach of discipline.  For the sake of the country we all hope that a thing like that will not occur again.  Perhaps in a way it was a lesson, but at the same time I think that the harm that was done by the raid on the Magazine Fort will not be in any way lessened unless the Government take the country fully into their confidence and give the public a complete explanation as found in the report of whatever committee is investigating the matter.  I think it would be very much in the interests of the public morale of the country, very much in the interests of good Government, and very much in the interests of the public welfare if that report were published in full, so that the public would know, first of all, what was the real cause of this unfortunate incident and, secondly, what measures <Col N="1857" /> the Government have taken to guard against a repetition of such an incident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Dillon is not here, because if he were I might be able to answer some of his questions and ease some of the misgivings he appears to have been suffering from. I am also sorry that he spoke in the tone that he did to-day because I regard Deputy Dillon as a man who is widely informed on many subjects, but in this particular debate he satisfied me that he is most ill-informed.  He spoke of matters of very great importance and, as far as I can find from his remarks, his only foundation for the statements he was making was based on rumours, on something that he heard outside, something that he heard in his meanderings around the country and something I am sure every Deputy in the House here has heard from time to time.  It naturally follows, when an incident occurs of the magnitude of the incident which occurred recently at the Magazine, that all sorts of fanciful stories will follow in its wake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid Deputy Dillon allowed his imagination to run riot here to-day on the general subject of the Army. The morale of the Army&mdash;as far as my observations show&mdash;has not been affected in the slightest, nor was it affected on the immediate occasion of the raid.  The manner in which the other sections of the Army set out to recover the ammunition which was lost by one small section&mdash;and did in fact recover nine-tenths of it&mdash;was a proof that the morale of the Army is quite all right.  There is no doubt that there have been a few undesirable people getting into the Volunteers.  I suppose that is something which no machinery could provide against.  There is a system whereby examination of the character of the individual applying for membership is undertaken.  The system is that the Guards are given the name of the applicant and they are expected to inform the Army authorities of the character of the individual. If it is such that the Army authorities believe he is a suitable person to recruit, <Col N="1858" /> they recruit him into the Army. Having got in, if he is not all that either the Gárdaí or the Army authorities themselves thought he was, the Army authorities could only find that out in contact with the individual. There again, when the man is a member of the force, the Army authorities naturally operate the measures which they possess in respect of discipline for members of the Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the principal Act which the former Minister for Defence introduced last July, I think.  It was the intention of the Minister to proceed with that particular Act: it was a voluminous document, running to something like 310 sections.  When I was transferred to the Department of Defence and had to deal with this document, a state of emergency had been declared.  War had been declared in Europe and emergency measures had been taken here at home.  It appeared to me that it would be unwise to proceed with such a very important document in view of the emergency, and I deemed it advisable to postpone the moving of the Second Reading of that document because of the state of emergency.  I feel pretty sure that by the time the state of emergency has reached its conclusion, it will have produced a certain state of affairs which will make it necessary to add very largely to the measures in that document.  Therefore, I deemed it advisable to go ahead with a much smaller type of document, which I will be introducing here in the near future&mdash;a Temporary Provisions Bill to deal with matters such as coast watching and other necessary things of that kind.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Esmonde, while he may be honest in his view that we cannot possibly defend ourselves with a small standing Army such as we have, I think it is the duty of this nation&mdash;just as it is the duty of any other nation&mdash;to make provisions sufficient to deter any nation from attempting to violate our neutrality. We must not have a state of affairs existing here which might be an invitation to all and sundry to come within our shores.  The Finns are a population no greater than ourselves and yet they have managed to put up a tremendous <Col N="1859" /> defence and withstand the assaults of a very much more powerful nation.  I think that is a justification of the fact that we should be prepared from the point of view of having an Army on which we can rely.</P>

A lot of play has been made in respect of my statement that I would not be prepared to produce the report of the court of inquiry into the loss of ammunition from the Magazine Fort.  There is nothing wrong about that.  Courts of inquiry have been taking place continuously in the Army and no one has asked that the reports of the findings of those courts of inquiry should be produced.</P>

      <P>There is, of course. The actual position is that one small unit of the Army lost a certain amount of ammunition.  An inquiry has been held into the reasons for the loss of that ammunition.  If it were only the loss of half a dozen rifles, a similar type of court of inquiry would have been instituted and investigations would proceed; and no one, I think, would ask for or be interested in the report.  The matter will be dealt with in the ordinary way as with every court of inquiry that has been held in the Army since it was established.  I do not want to say too much in respect <Col N="1860" /> of the Magazine Fort, as the matter has not yet come to a conclusion.  I think I have answered all the questions which have been raised.</P>

      <P>The Minister was asked twice&mdash;by Deputy Dillon and by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan&mdash;about supplies of arms and ammunition for the Army.

      <P>That particular reason is that I have not come here armed for a debate on this Bill, which is of a very minor character. In the very near future&mdash;possibly next week; I am not certain&mdash; the Supplementary Estimate will be before the House.  This is the first time, to my knowledge, that such a debate has taken place on this very minor type of Bill, which merely asks for the continuance of the Defence Forces Regulations Act for another year.  The Army is not short of supplies. I can say that.  There is no question of a shortage of supplies.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary procedure provides some safeguards for the Opposition, one of which is that reasonable inquiries in regard to legislation passing through the House will be civilly answered by the Ministers responsible to Parliament.  The Minister for Defence says that he asked for facilities which have been refused.  Yesterday, he asked would we give him the Second Stage of the Defence Forces Bill to-day.  We said: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; at 24 hours' notice.  I am not asking him to go into the detailed matter of some individual case where he might have to consult a file.  I am asking the only man in Ireland who must know what the policy of the Department is in regard to equipment for the Army, as to what that policy is, and you told me, Sir, that this is the occasion upon which to raise it, as distinct from the Estimate, when you say matters of administration must be dealt with; to-day, matters of policy; on the Estimate, matters of administration.</P>

      <P>The purposes for which this additional sum is required, I think, are fully set out in Part III of the Estimate.  I might say, in connection with items I., I.I. and K., that a very large part of the moneys there are asked for because the necessary accounts for payment were not received in the Department and were not presented to the Government during the last financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On those Supplementary Estimates, the debate is confined strictly to the sub-heads in respect of which the appropriations are proposed. In regard to sub-head I., my information is that while the building in New York was satisfactory, the exhibit was unimaginative and poor, and, what is worse, I have been told by persons who went to the Irish stand at the New York World Fair that those who were employed there for the purpose of giving information and answering visitors' queries were most unsatisfactory in that they did not seem to be in the least degree interested in the querists <Col N="1865" /> and were rather more concerned to get rid of them than to stimulate their interests and enthusiasm for such exhibits as we had to show.</P>
      <P>I think that is deplorable.  There is no country in the world in which more importance is attached to cordiality, hospitality and generosity in answering strangers' inquiries than America. Any of us who have been there are much beholden to the most casual persons we met for their overflowing courtesy and anxiety to help strangers. It ill-becomes us when visitors from America enter what must have been to them one of the least sensational exhibits in the fair, that they were received almost with indifference and their inquiries treated in a casual way.  I think these things are hard to provide against in advance but I do not think that our failure in that regard should be allowed to pass without comment so that if a similar enterprise were embarked upon in future we would take special precautions to ensure that the staff, whether they be Irish nationals or recruited in the country where the exhibition is held, would reflect credit on this country and extend a fitting welcome to those who are good enough to visit the stand we establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to I (1), here I have a worse tale to tell.  I am told the Glasgow Exhibition was little short of a scandal; that it presented the appearance of the usual pyramid of glass bottles; that there the reception of guests was not only casual but positively peremptory and that people complained that they did not get a civil reply to their inquiries.  I think that is deplorable.  It would have been much better not to have exhibited at all than that it should be given to anybody to say that when they interested themselves in what we had to offer they got nothing but a short answer.  That can happen.  I have had that kind of experience myself at Ballsbridge.  It is regrettable to have to say it, but it is better to say it and repair it than to allow it to go on, stick our heads in sand and conceal these facts from us.  I have seen Government exhibits at Ballsbridge where the people in charge, though they seem to be full of <Col N="1866" /> enthusiasm and interest for one individual, if another visitor goes up they bite his nose off and send him about his business.  I think that may arise from the fact that at all exhibits of this kind you get two classes of visitor: one is the person who by his introductory remarks shows that he has keen technical interest in the exhibit and that his interest in it is intelligent and informed.  You cannot blame an expert who may be there to demonstrate his exhibit welcoming that visitor with peculiar cordiality.</P>
    <P>Then you get the harmless, good-natured blather who comes up and starts clattering in an obviously uninformed way and is manifestly inspired rather by idle curiosity than an informed desire to acquaint himself with the merits of the product.  That person gets a short answer.  Of course, the man that clatters at an exhibition clatters when he gets home.  The technical fellow does not talk.  He has only a very limited acquaintance amongst his expert friends and he tells them that it was an interesting exhibit or was not.  That is as far as it goes. But when the garrulous visitor who gets his or her nose bitten off, goes home the whole parish, city, county hear how cordially he was received by those Bolsheviks in the Russian stand but that when he went around to &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; where his grand-mother's aunt came from, he got nothing but impertinence.  That is not good either in New York or in Glasgow.  If that is to be the scandalous conduct of persons who are charged with speaking and receiving on behalf of Ireland at these international exhibitions it would be better that we did not participate in them at all.  I am sorry to be critical but it is better to be critical and bend our hand and try to understand the difficulties that we have met with than simply to close our eyes to them and allow them to happen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that we sallied forth on the Clonsast Bog on the assumption that the nature of Irish bogs was the same as the nature of German bogs.  I am mentioning Clonsast, which is not referred to in either of these Estimates, in order to provide that a similar error will not be fallen into in either of these bogs as was fallen into in Clonsast.  I am informed that the Turf Development Board was misled into the belief that the nature of the Irish bogs was analogous to that of the German bogs and some other bogs in eastern Europe, which are dry bogs, whereas <Col N="1868" /> ours, as we all know, are wet.  I understand that the boys sallied forth on the Clonsast Bog and announced that they were going to dig a drain.  Any Land Commission inspector or indeed any Land Commission ganger could have told them that if you want to drain an Irish bog you must drain the verge of the bog first and then draw your drains from the crown of the bog down to the verge.  But that old-fashioned information was not good enough for the Turf Development Board.  They were going to drive their drain clean through Clonsast Bog, which they did, and they all stood in amazement at this magnificent drain and went home.  They came back in the morning to inspect the glorious drain and discovered the bog had closed it in the night.  Any Land Commission ganger could have told them it would do that because it is a wet bog.  If they drove 40 drains through the middle of Clonsast bog the bog would close them all.  That was not all.  They then skinned the bog and bought immensely expensive machinery to glean the turf by machinery.  By the time the machinery had arrived on the verge of the bog they discovered the bog had turned into a large black swamp and that it would be impossible for any man, much less a machine, to work on it for the next 40 years.  Then, and only then, they sent for a Land Commission ganger, and he said to them: &ldquo;What else did you expect it to turn into when you took the skin off it?&rdquo; There it is now, a large black swamp, on which a sod will not be cut for 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister tell me what have we got out of these bogs to-day? Mind you, when we get in Estimates like this here, a sum of £44,000, we think that is the true measure of our expenditure on these experiments, but it is not.  Have any Deputies been down at Inny Junction recently?  Inny Junction used to be a junction on the Midland, Great Western Railway, in the middle of nowhere.  You would not see a living creature within 15 miles of Inny Junction but now you would think it was Piccadilly Circus.  There are roads striking out from the right and striking out from the left; yet <Col N="1869" /> there is not a living creature within 15 miles of the place.  The next stage was that immense barricades of turf began to accumulate on the sidings at Inny Junction.  Talk of the Maginot Line! It was not in it with the line of turf erected at Inny Junction.  All these roads were built for the purpose of erecting this Maginot Line of turf which was to stock our kitchens and fire our hearths for I do not know how long.  But that was not the end of the story.  After the Maginot Line was established&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been talking about the money spent on these ridiculous schemes for the past two years.  Let us hear now the end of the story.  The Minister knows what the end of the story is and that is why he is so anxious to interrupt me. The question was: who would consume this Maginot Line of turf, and it was proposed that some of it should be burned here in Leinster House.  Accordingly it was suggested that some of the turf accumulated at Inny Junction should be used as fuel in this House, but it was then discovered that, as a result of purchases of turf already made, the cellars of Leinster House are so full of turf mould that it would take about £1,000 to clear them out. There is at present under our feet in the cellars of this House so much turf mould that it would take about 100 men a fortnight to dig it out.  There is an accumulation of turf mould so formidable in the cellars of this House that nobody will attempt the task of digging it out and carting it away, for two reasons, one, that it would take an army to do it and, two, that there is no place into which the turf mould can be dumped.  The result is that the Maginot Line of turf at Inny Junction is melting away because there is no place to burn it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> These being the facts, I say that it is entirely reckless to ask the Dáil to sanction this further expenditure on bogs and bog roads of this character, bog roads which are not intended for the accommodation of the ordinary people, but which are designed to accommodate the Turf Development Board in producing huge quantities of turf, the disposal of which presents an immense problem.  What are we going to do at Lullymore Bog, or are we going to keep to the bogs on which the Turf Development Board has been operating heretofore?  I deliberately say that to tax sugar, tobacco and the necessaries of life that our people have to consume, in order to provide £44,000 to develop Lullymore Bog is a public scandal.  Just imagine going to the people and telling them that you are going to pile on their backs extra taxes of the kind incorporated in the recent Budget in order to keep the Turf Development Board in existence and to add to their activities the development of Lullymore Bog.  How does the Minister justify it?  How does the Minister justify it in the full knowledge that to-day nothing has come out of these bogs which has been of the least use to the community as a whole?  The only product that had any merit was these turf briquettes made down at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Exactly.  The only product of merit that came out of these bogs was the peat briquettes which came from Ticknevin.  That establishment was allowed to go bankrupt and all the employees were thrown out of work.  It may have been impossible to avoid that; I do not know whether that was the Government's fault or not, but it is certainly true that that company was producing something which was capable of being used.  Yet it was let to go bankrupt with all the losses that must have been involved in winding up and breaking up that entire organisation.  If the Minister had come in here before that firm had got into hopeless bankruptcy and had <Col N="1871" /> said that an advance would keep these people afloat until such time as they could become solvent, that might have been a reasonable suggestion to make and there might have been a prospect of the taxpayer getting his money back, but it was allowed to go smash.</P>

I do not know what the management was like, but I do know they were producing something that could be used, even though it may have been hopelessly uneconomic.  I know nothing of the inner workings of that company, but, on the quality of its product, I thought a case could be made for it. If Deputy Norton tells me that the company was hopelessly insolvent and had already lost an immense amount of public money, he probably knows more about it than I do.  To come and ask us for more money now to finance the operations of the Turf Development Board, knowing what we do of its operations in the past, seems to me to be an act of gross extravagance, especially when these sums have to be raised by taxation on sugar, tobacco and other necessities of life which the poor at the moment are obliged to go without because they are not able to pay for them.</P>

      <P>Before supporting this Estimate, there is just one point that I should like to raise.  The Minister, in introducing the Estimate, referring to sub-heads I. and I.I., said that the reason for the new Estimate was that the Government was not presented with the accounts during the financial year in time to put them into the general Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I said that they did not come in course of payment during the year 1938-39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Minister said that the accounts were not presented.  Now he says that they did <Col N="1872" /> not come in course of payment during the year.  When the original Estimate was being introduced, did the Minister know what the exhibition at the New York World Fair was going to cost us at all?</P>
      <P>When he introduced the original Estimate of £25,000, did he assume that that amount would be the total expenditure by this country on that exhibition?  Is he coming along now with this additional Estimate, having discovered that it is going to cost an extra £17,000?  Does the same thing apply to the Glasgow Exhibition of 1938?  Is the Minister now coming along and asking for £1,140 extra, because he did not know what the cost would be, or because bills were not sent in?  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  What he stated at first was that the accounts were not presented, but he now says that they did not come in course of payment during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister first put in an estimate and got it passed, but he now comes along and asks for additional payments in respect of two sub-heads, either because he did not know what the two experiments would cost or was careless what they would cost.  Could the Minister tell the House, out of this total expenditure of £42,000, what this country expected to get back from these exhibitions?  Was it simply a case that a World's Fair was to be held in New York&mdash;which is to be continued this year&mdash;and that the Irish Government should have an exhibition there?  The exhibitions cost £42,000 and there is no explanation as to what the likely return will be, or whether they will be of any benefit to this country.  As far as the Glasgow Exhibition is concerned it is over for the past two years, yet the Minister wants £1,140 extra in connection with it.  I do not care whether the Minister says he did not know what the cost was going to be, or that the bills did not come in, it means, at any rate, that two years after the Glasgow Exhibition the Minister is asking for extra money to pay a debt incurred by this State in regard to the pavilion at that exhibition. <Col N="1873" /> If the fault was that the Minister who was responsible at the time did not properly estimate the expenditure for the New York and Glasgow Exhibitions, or that Deputies were gravely misled, I do not believe&mdash;however praiseworthy many of us might think the idea of having pavilions at New York and Glasgow&mdash;anybody would be prepared to spend the amount that the Minister is now asking for on these two objects, without getting some indication that the country was going to benefit from them.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's attitude towards accountancy in this respect.  If any commercial concern was to conduct its business on the principle that they could make an estimate to carry on a particular line and, having expended a certain amount of money on it, then had to go to the directors and say: &ldquo;We are sorry we did not estimate a correct amount for what we had to spend on that particular branch, and as the accounts were not presented in time we did not anticipate the amount&rdquo;&mdash;what would happen?  Even if the accounts were not presented, surely the Minister should have ensured what the total cost would be.  I do not believe that this country has gained sufficient benefit from the pavilions at the New York and Glasgow Exhibitions to justify the House voting £18,140 extra for what, on the Minister's explanation, has been a piece of very bad book-keeping.  I could not support this Estimate unless I was satisfied that the Minister can explain why it was, when the original Estimate was introduced, that the Minister who was then in charge could not have given some idea of what the total cost was likely to be, or why we should be met with the explanation now, that the only reason for the additional Estimate was that bills were not presented, or were not anticipated at the time the original Estimate was passed.  I cannot understand that system of book-keeping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some further information in connection with this Estimate.  There is an item of £44,000, grants to the Turf Development Board, Ltd., for the development <Col N="1874" /> of Lullymore Bog, and for the acquisition of the assets of the Peat Fuel Company, Ltd.  Whatever technical experience may have been obtained from the operations of the Peat Fuel Company at Ticknevin, I think every one will agree that, as far as the financial enterprise was concerned, it was a very ill-starred one.  A trade loan to the amount of £90,000 under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was given to the company, and £65,000 was given to it on the basis of a repayable grant-in-aid, making £155,000 of State money sunk in that venture.  In addition to that, it is credibly reported that there was a first mortgage bank overdraft of £30,000, making £185,000.  It is also stated, with considerable authority, that approximately £25,000 of capital went into the venture, making a total of £210,000, on the experiment of producing turf at Ticknevin.  It may be possible to say that some technical advantage has been obtained from the expenditure of that sum of money in the production of turf.  One thing is certain, at all events, that the money is gone and that the assets there against the investments represent a negligible proportion of the investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what the position is to be in connection with the purchase of these assets by the Turf Development Board.  The Minister has £155,000 of State money sunk in that venture, and possibly £3,000 or £3,500 of that amount has been repaid.  What is the State going to get out of the assets, and how does it rank in relation to private capital and in relation to the bank overdraft?  Is it intended that the Turf Development Board should continue to operate this venture in the same manner as the Peat Fuel Company?  Everybody knows&mdash; certainly the staff employed in the place knows&mdash;that the original venture was not blessed&mdash;but was dammed, one might say&mdash;with good luck, and was not helped at all by good management. In the first instance very expensive and very heavy machinery was put in to exploit the bogs.  That machinery was scrapped.  Subsequently lighter machinery was introduced, but not <Col N="1875" /> even the introduction of lighter machinery and substantial State Grants-in-Aid, could suffice to save the company from going into bank-ruptey. If we are going to spend another £44,000 on this venture, I should like to hear from the Minister what programme of development the Turf Development Board is about to embark upon?  Is it going to continue the methods that proved such a costly failure in the past?  Is it going to continue the same methods of winning turf at Ticknevin Bog?  I notice here that it is described as Lullymore Bog, but it is known locally as Ticknevin Bog.  The intention is to cover a much wider area of turbary than was formerly operated by the Peat Fuel Company.  Are we going to have a continuance of the same type of management and the same methods as proved so costly in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so long since we had a rather Olympian declaration from the Minister's predecessor in which he visualised 50,000 people getting regular employment there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would like to consult the files for the speech in which the Minister's predecessor said that 50,000 people would be employed there.  I never believed that.  I do not think it is possible, and while I would like to see peat fuel developed as much as possible, I realise that there are limits to its development.  A very eminent engineer recently put a limitation on the development of peat fuel when he said that an examination of the peat fuel found in this country disclosed that there is more solidity in milk than in turf.  He gave it as his opinion that there were 12 lbs. of solid matter in 100 lbs. of milk, and only 8 lbs of solid matter in the same quantity of turf.  I do not purpose to be in a position either to give approbation to or denial of a statement of that kind, <Col N="1876" /> but this very reputable engineer knew the limitations.</P>
      <P>If we are going to continue to spend money on turf development, I am not adverse from doing so, so long as the money is prudently expended, so long as the State's resources are reasonably husbanded and so long as there is competent management directing the enterprises in relation to peat fuel development.  I think we ought to have from the Minister&mdash;it is the first time we have heard him on turf development&mdash;a declaration as to the lines upon which he thinks turf development should proceed, but, in any case, we are entitled, on an Estimate of this kind, under which we are going to spend another £44,000 of State money, to know what has happened to our £90,000 under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act and what has happened to the £65,000 grant-in-aid.  Are we going to get any of that back, and how do we stand in relation to the other private investors and mortgagees of the peat fuel companies?</P>

      <P>I had hoped that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, learning from the experience the ex-Minister had in the bogs, would have tried to keep out of the bog, but perhaps circumstances were too strong for him.  I think the country generally will be against any further expenditure of public money on this enterprise, and I, for one, very much object to any further expenditure.  I want to ask the Minister, particularly, if he would separate the items in sub-head M. 6&mdash;Grants to the Turf Development Board, Ltd., for the development of Lullymore Bog, County Kildare, and for the acquisition of the assets of the Peat Fuel Company, Ltd.  I should like to know how much of the £44,000 is intended for development and how much for the acquisition of the Peat Fuel Company's assets.  In that connection, if there are any assets, I think that, logically, the Exchequer ought to have first call on them.  We lent considerable sums of money to that company which were never repaid, and we are now apparently going to lend a further big sum of money for the purchase of portion of the assets of this defunct company.  A more <Col N="1877" /> reasonable proposition might have been that we should have claimed whatever assets of that company there were and presented them, if necessary, to this new company to help them in the further development of the bog. The more one looks at the thing, the more bogged one becomes.  I personally should like to get out of the bog as much as I can, but I should like the Minister to give a reasonable explanation of the sub-head and to state the amount to be spent on development, the amount to be spent on the acquisition of assets, and also to whom the money is to be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years ago, the Minister's predecessor introduced an Estimate somewhat similar to this. With the changing of names, I do not know whether this is exactly the same bog, or some other bog, but it was certainly the same peat fuel company.  At that time, I accused the Minister of endeavouring to throw turf mould into the eyes of people by pretending that we were getting some kind of workable asset, some asset of value, in making a grant towards the Peat Fuel Company.  The grant was made, however, and the Minister assured the House at that time&mdash;I do not know how far he convinced the House, but he certainly did not convince me&mdash;that if we made this grant, there was a very reasonable chance of success, that the possibilities were good and that he hoped in the very near future that there would be an economic production of peat fuel.  The result was that that company, and that industry, which, I think, was situated in Turraun&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances to the ordinary man in the country are that the production of peat fuel by machinery in this country, in the way <Col N="1878" /> in which it is sought to obtain it, does not appear to be a success and does not appear to have any hope of success. What has always struck me about the development of bogs, and the spending of big sums of money on them, is that peat fuel has been examined on the Continent at very great expense and with first-class expert advice and technicians. All that is an open book to everybody.  The results have been published and can be read by anybody, but notwithstanding all that, we rush in with the taxpayers' money to buy dud machinery, because that is what we are doing here.  We encouraged people to put their money into these enterprises, and, when the money is gone, we buy over the &ldquo;duds&rdquo;.  That is what we are doing now.</P>
      <P>We are told in a footnote to this Supplementary Estimate, which is very enlightening, that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provision under this sub-head includes a sum of £18,000, approximately, representing the cost of acquisition by the Turf Development Board, Ltd., of the first debenture on the assets of the Peat Fuel Company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What are they worth?  It also says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the assets are acquired the debenture will be discharged and the cost thereof will be refunded by the board to the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we not dealing with a company which has not been able to carry on business economically, which has not been able to produce an economic article, and where is the use in trying to pretend to the taxpayers that it is good business to buy off machinery that will apparently be &ldquo;dud&rdquo; machinery and that will be left on our hands to rust?  I think it is time the Minister called a halt to this kind of thing, and unless there is some assur ance of success, some hope that at some stage an economic article can be produced, they ought to give the idea up.  If people have gone into this business and have put their money into it at the instance of the Government the Government possibly feel that there is an obligation on them to buy them off, but what about the tax <Col N="1879" /> payers?  I think the whole position with regard to bog development in this country is most unsatisfactory.  The Government have burned their fingers more than once, and not with peat fuel but with the taxpayers' money, and they ought to drop it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard this discussion as being at all without value if it brings home to the minds of the people that, though we may have, in peat and other things, natural resources which may be of great value, nevertheless the cost of developing them is not going to be insignificant. We are sometimes told by members of the Opposition and by other interests in the country that the Government ought to solve the problem of unemployment, or ought to provide for the unemployed, not by giving them doles but by giving them opportunities to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now dealing with a project which it was stated by those who first put it forward would give a considerable amount of permanent employment and be of permanent value to the country. The proposition, when it was put up, if one might judge by the article which it was designed to produce, seemed to be a feasible one and a highly practical one.  There is no doubt about it that the company which was operating Lullymore Bog and which was developing the peat briquette business had an attractive article to offer.  We have heard Deputy Dillon loud in its praise here to-day, blaming the Government because we had allowed that company to cease operations, blaming the Government because we had permitted it to go bankrupt, because we had permitted the one peat enterprise for which he saw any hope to come to an end. It is well the House and the country, and again those who think that it is as easy as they imagine to produce useful public works and deal with unemployment in this country, to consider what the history of that company has been.  It was incorporated in 1934.  The paid up capital amounted to £57,004 and additional capital was provided from time to time.  Ninety thousand pounds was provided under <Col N="1880" /> the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  Then the company raised a further £20,000 upon a debenture ranking in priority to the debentures securing the Trade Loan.  In 1937, the Dáil voted £35,000 as a grant-in-aid and in 1938 an additional £30,000 was voted by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>£57,000 was private capital.  The position with which we are faced in regard to this development is this, that a great deal of money has been put into it, a large amount of experimental work has been done, and the only thing is whether we are going to allow any residuum of practical utility which may remain in the bog as developed as a result of these experiments to be completely dissipated and allow the whole place to fall back into its pristine and original state.  I have not taken a firm decision in regard to the matter.  What I have decided to do is to put the Turf Development Board in a position to acquire the assets for what they are worth and they have acquired the debenture, which of course gives the assets, for a sum of about £19,000. There is a considerable amount of plant and machinery there.</P>

      <P>It was.  The Deputy cannot ride two horses.  He has to be as consistent in his policy as a member of the Government has to be.  He has an almost equal responsibility.  As I said, this was frankly regarded as an experiment.  When it was clear that the initial capital provided was not going to be sufficient, we had to consider how the fresh capital required was going to be raised.  We facilitated the company in raising this additional £20,000 of capital to the extent that we allowed this debenture to take priority over ours.  That is what was done.  Bear in mind that we have got to try out this question.  We have got to investigate for ourselves and see what value, in fact, there is in our bogs.  That had to be done by one Government or another.  It can only be done by undertaking operations on a commercial scale.</P>

I wonder if the Deputy ever considered how long it took to develop some of the mining ventures in Great Britain, how much money was lost in developing coal and iron and steel in Great Britain.  Let us try and not deal with a proposition of this sort in a narrow huckstering <Col N="1882" /> spirit.  It is a venture in which someone has to take risks; there is no person in this country, I think, big enough to take a personal, private, individual risk in the matter, and the State, if the resources of the country are to be developed at all, has to come in.</P>

The Turf Development Board will send their engineers down there to survey the bog and see whether it is possible to try to develop it upon more promising and effective lines.  In my mind that is still a matter of some doubt.  I am not prepared to say in relation to this enterprise that there may not have been defects in the management as well as defects in the process.  I do not know, but one thing that has struck me when reading these papers is the fact that the management was never able to realise its estimates in regard to production.  However, as Deputy Dillon has said, the company is now in bankruptcy and we are not going to hold an inquest upon them here.  The Turf Development Board will consider whether a more promising, a more economic and efficient process for the development of this bog cannot be evolved by them.  Whether that is so or not is going to depend upon a number of factors.  First of all, this bog will have to be run upon strictly commercial lines.  There is going to be no eleemosynary element in it either in regard to the management or anything else.  It has got to be upon a basis that we cannot afford to undertake an experiment of this sort merely as something which is going to give spare time employment to a number of people.  If a staff has got to be recruited there, it has to be recruited with the idea that it has got to <Col N="1883" /> discipline itself and harness itself, so to speak, to the bog.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon in his opening passage drew attention to this item for the Lullymore bog, and made some statements reflecting on the position at another bog at Clonsast.  Perhaps he will take the trouble to go down there and investigate and see the work which the Turf Development Board is still doing.  I feel that the Deputy, when describing mistakes made, had this Lullymore bog in mind and not the Clonsast bog.  I am not saying, of course, that the Turf Development Board have not made mistakes.

      <P>In the ordinary course of things it would be very difficult for them not to make mistakes unless they were acting under divine guidance, because this is virgin work in this country.  The development of bogs upon a commercial scale and their adaptation for commercial work is very <Col N="1884" /> largely experimental in every country. Deputy Brennan has told us how it has been tried out here, there and everywhere on the Continent.  If the Deputy would read any of the authoritative works on this matter he would find this warning&mdash;that the whole question of the development of peat has been very largely prejudiced by over-optimism.</P>

      <P>That might be.  Many honest men have lost and learned.  The thing which is characteristic of the Turf Development Board, I believe, since it overcame its teething troubles and since it got fairly established, has been its careful and efficient management.  I have said that if Deputy Dillon inspects some of the works which they have undertaken and are carrying through&mdash;and they are not at all as numerous and widespread as the Deputy seems to conceive&mdash;he will come to the conclusion that these works are always prudently planned and very carefully managed.  If there is any possibility of developing the peat resources of the country that possibility rests and depends upon the Turf Development Board being allowed to expand its operations in the prudent and careful way which they have outlined for themselves.  Again, as I said. I hope that Deputy Dillon will, upon <Col N="1885" /> further consideration, see his way to visit some of these places and if he discusses their policy with those who are responsible for the development of the bogs, and truly ascertains what the results have been, I am perfectly certain he will not come back to the House with the same wild statements he made to-day.  The trouble with the Deputy is he has got a very exuberant imagination which is always working at high pressure.  He told us to-day about the tons and tons of unuseable turf that are supposed to be stored within the basement of Leinster House.  Did the Deputy ever see these himself?</P>

I should have thought that before the Deputy, who claimed earlier to-day to speak on behalf of the Opposition, got up and made the speech he did on this question of turf, he would have investigated one aspect of the matter which is conveniently under his eyes or under his feet.  He spoke about tons and tons of turf which were supposed to be stuffing the cellar of Leinster House. He did not know whether that was so or not.  If he had gone down there, he would not have made that statement.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to New York Fair and Glasgow Exhibition, and I should like to say a few words in reply before I sit down. He made complaints in regard to both these ventures.  I had not heard any complaint regarding the value of the exhibits at the Glasgow Exhibition or the manner in which they were displayed. I have heard some complaints about New York Exhibition.  Not having examined the matter on the ground, I cannot say what substance there may be in those complaints. There may be some substance in them, but the cause may be due to circumstances which it is rather difficult for us clearly to envisage. The two stands at the exhibition were staffed mainly by persons sent out from here.  I gather that, on their arrival at New York, they found that a great deal of work remained to be done to get the pavilions opened on the day appointed.  They were considerably overworked in getting the necessary arrangements made. Deputies should remember that things did not run smoothly for the promoters of the New York Fair.  From the beginning, they met with all sorts of difficulties which, naturally, had their reactions on individual exhibitors.  Our staff went out in May, when the hot season was beginning, and they had no time to become acclimatised.  Looking at the matter now, I think that we were rather too economical in the numbers we sent out.  It is possible that, in the trying circumstances&mdash;I am saying this not because I am accepting at their face value all the complaints made, but because complaints have been made by persons in regard to whom I would not be predisposed <Col N="1887" /> to assume that they would make them unless there was some substance in the complaints.  I believe that such substance as might be in the complaints was largely due to the difficulties arising from change of climate and to the derangement that existed in the opening stages of the Exhibition.  I am giad the Deputy has mentioned the matter here, because very little value is to be got out of expenditure of this sort unless we make the people who come to see our pavilions&mdash;whether they be experts or mere blatherers, as the Deputy suggested, some might be&mdash;satisfied that they have got value for their money.  I am quite certain that the officers of my Department have gained a great deal of experience in these matters now.  It is a pity that they were not so experienced at the start but, if ventures of this kind are ever undertaken again, there will not, I think, be so many complaints as there were on this occasion.  I was going to say something about Deputy Linehan's remarks but I do not think that they are worth comment.</P>

      <P>A large sum of money is being voted on this Estimate, but much more important is the precedent which is being established.  We guaranteed £90,000 to this company, which placed us in the position of first mortgagees of the assets of the company.  We then waived our first-mortgagee rights.  We conceded them to a bank, which advanced £20,000 to the company on first mortgage.  After we had advanced substantial additional sums, directly and indirectly, the time came when this firm became insolvent.  The bank had their mortgage remedy to turn to. In that state of affairs, we go in and, with public money, take his mortgage from the mortgagee, leaving it to ourselves to realise it, although the mortgagee elected to take that security voluntarily and asked us to give it to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a sane thing to establish such a precedent?  I know a <Col N="1888" /> case in which a much stronger claim could be made for the execution of a similar manoeuvre.  If this case goes through, there can be no answer to that claim.  Where are you to end? How far are public funds to be employed to relieve voluntary mortgagees of their responsibilities?  Surely the Minister must know that the proposal in this case is dangerous and undesirable to the last degree, apart from the money involved?</P>

      <P>I agree.  We should not do this, and would not do it except for one thing&mdash;we do not want the assets and the existing works to be broken up and the plant dispersed.  By buying the debenture, we are taking over the existing assets on the bog as they stand.  If we allowed the debenture-holder to assert his right, he would probably put up the plant for break-up sale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister realise the danger?  It may be that he is getting this property cheaply, as he says, but is it right that the procedure of receivership in matters of this kind, where the mortgagee has already got a concession from the State, should be set aside?  Would it not be better that the mortgagee should be told that he could put up the assets, that if the Government choose to buy them, they will and, if not, that he can do what he likes with them?  Does not the Minister know that this procedure is wrong?  Is the Minister quite frank? I cannot believe that he is standing for such procedure.  I believe he is keeping something back.</P>

There was a trade loan guarantee, and afterwards additional capital was raised by debentures.  Then we came to the Dáil for a Grant-in-Aid of £30,000 for this particular process, and the facts were disclosed to the Dáil at the time and disclosed to the Dáil a second time.  Of course, naturally, when public money is to be put into a venture of this sort on the basis of a Grant-in-Aid it is quite clear to the ordinary person that it is experimental; otherwise, the question would be: why do you give a Grant-in-Aid?</P>

      <P>I want some information and I wonder if the Minister is in a position to give it to me. In connection with the meteorological side of these services, I understand there are different grades&mdash;you might call them the first, second, third and fourth grades, in respect of the men in that particular service.  I understand that for what I would roughly call the second grade, say, the junior professional staff, there are cadets who, after two years' service, would become established officers.  In that connection I understand the requirements include <Col N="1893" /> a mathematical or scientific degree, together with a knowledge of one of two great continental languages. Would the Minister be able to tell me, in connection with the original appointments after the service had come under our control, how many citizens of this State were successful in securing appointments&mdash;what proportion they were?</P>
      <P>I am not saying now that a certain number of these appointments must not necessarily go to people who are not citizens of this State.  I realise it may be difficult to find specially qualified, technical men.  Where the requirements did not include any previous meteorological knowledge, but purely a scientific degree, with possibly a knowledge of French or German, I should like to know what proportion of our own people were successful in gaining appointments on that particular section of the staff.  I am speaking now of the appointments as they were before the end of last year; I am not referring to any recent appointments that were made, say, since the end of November of last year.  The point is that if only a small proportion got into that section, it raises important educational as well as other questions.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give me information as to the proportion of our own men that were taken on and if there is what would seem to be an undue proportion of outsiders on that particular section of the staff.  I am not referring now to the lower grades, because I understand we might have a monopoly there.  What I have in mind would be the second grade, where there would be cadets, and so on.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask two questions.  The first has reference to the civil airports.  What is this sum of £7,150 required for?  It is indicated that it represents an additional sum required for the acquisition of land. I wonder where this land is.  The second question is this.  I wonder, if the Minister had to complain or inquire in regard to the matter that was referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan, would he have employed as moderate language or would he have wondered <Col N="1894" /> why was it that an Irish Government scoured the world to get foreigners for the public service rather than employ decent, Irish boys who have no work to do?  I think he would get quite eloquent about it.  It would be a chastening thought for him to turn over in his mind what he would have done in Deputy O'Sullivan's place?</P>

      <P>I am afraid that, at the moment, I am not able to answer Deputy O'Sullivan's question.  I did not anticipate that it would arise on the Estimate because there is nothing here about staff.  I shall be glad to send the Deputy the particulars he asks for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down a question I will give him the information.  With regard to the question of the amount provided under sub-head B, the position there is that it was anticipated that about £68,000 in all would be required for the acquisition of land for the aerodromes.  It was thought, prior to the printing of the Estimates for the current year, that about £63,000 of that would have been expended by the 31st March, 1939, leaving the necessary provision for the current year about £4,250.  In fact, owing to delay in proving title and completing other legal formalities, it was not possible to pay more than £54,500 approximately before the end of March, 1939, and, accordingly, the sum of £7,900, over and above what has been set out in the volume of Estimates, had to be met in this year.  That is the reason for the sub-head in the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that the total anticipated expenditure on land is in the order of £68,000?  If that is so, is it the Minister's purpose, year after year, to provide in the Estimates only so much of that £68,000 as he intends to spend within the financial year, because, in the main book of Estimates, the Minister is providing a sum of £3,200 for the purchase of land for civil airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister turns to page 276 of the book of Estimates he will find under sub-head B.&mdash;Civil Airports&mdash;that the provision made for the acquisition of land is £3,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make very much difference whether it is £4,250 or £3,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister not begin to ramble.  What we want to find out is this: the Minister was understood to have said that his requirements were in the order of £68,000.  Where does he get that figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy that of this £68,000 it was anticipated, when the volume of Estimates was sent to the printers some time in January of last year, that £63,750 of that would have been paid by the 31st March last.  In fact, due to delays in proving title, only £54,500 was paid before the end of March, 1939. The balance was carried over and has to be met in the current year.  It is to meet the balance which was carried over that the present Supplementary Estimate is introduced.  We are in exactly the same position as we were in regard to the New York Fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But this is the puzzle. The Minister says that he contemplated an expenditure of £68,000, and that this balance arises from the fact that he did not transfer the money to the vendors at the end of the financial year 1939, whereas he anticipated that he would have had to do that.  Instead of doing that, he surrendered the balance to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely it is a very undesirable practice to allow to grow up to have Ministers romping into this House with bunches of Supplementary Estimates in their hands, knowing nothing and caring less about what the expenditure called for under them is. It is a tedious job&mdash;nobody denies it&mdash; for a Minister to get his Estimates through this House, sometimes.  It is a difficult job, but that is what it is meant to be.  That is Parliamentary Government. For a Minister with a majority behind him in the House simply to say &ldquo;No, I will give you no information; you may divide and I will march my <Col N="1897" /> boys into the lobby against you&rdquo;, is to prostitute Parliamentary Government.</P>
      <P>It is of the very essence of Parliamentary Government that we secure all the information asked for.  When we are in office the Minister will be able to secure the information he requires. In this case we ask for somewhat complex figures and the Minister has given us, I think, a somewhat facile reply. He intended to expend £68,000 in all, he glances at the book before him, misinterprets it to say that he had not paid over certain moneys at the end of the financial year and surrendered them to the Exchequer, and is now seeking them from the Exchequer in a Supplementary Estimate.  But we cannot reconcile those figures with the figures given by him when he was Minister for Finance.</P>

I did not say that the. whole of the £68,000 or £63,000 was to be spent in the year 1938-39, but I gave the expenditure in the preceding years.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House the reason why it is necessary to introduce this Supplementary Estimate for £7,000 odd, which it was estimated would be expended when the volume of Estimates for the current year was being printed.  We expected it would have fallen to be paid in the last financial year, but did not come <Col N="1898" /> in course of payment up to the 31st March last, and has fallen into this financial year for payment; for this we are now asking authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this finish the expenditure of the whole £68,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Supplementary Estimate does not complete it, but the Supplementary Estimate, with the provision we have made this year, will bring the total to be paid for land up to £68,000.  I should say that that £68,000 includes the curent rates on the land, too.</P>

      <P>We consider all this subject of the inaccuracy of estimating an objectionable one.  We have here a number of Votes; this is one of them.  The total sum comes to £370,000.  It is quite true that there are certain savings, but I gather they were allowed for when the original Budget was being introduced, as there is always a certain percentage taken off for savings.  Surely there ought to be better justification now in every one of these Supplementary Estimates for the sudden huge sum of £370,000 additional to the Estimates.  We have not got them all here; there are various others to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a point in which there has apparently been incorrect estimation. It is only an example of the whole lot. Having got a pack of Estimates last March in a number of normal <Col N="1899" /> services&mdash;the army is not included&mdash;we have now over £370,000 additional by way of Supplementary Estimates, and more to come.  Savings bring that down to £270,000, but this is already allowed for in the Budget.  I think it is highly reprehensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister for Industry and Commerce put this to his colleague, the Minister for Supplies: I know nearly 200 men who are out of a job because the raw materials of the industry that used to employ them are not available.  I know a boot factory whose representatives went to the Government last April and said to them: &ldquo;We want to get hides, to ensure that we will be able to carry on our industry in the event of there being any shortage as the result of a European crisis, and we can get them to suit us from South America now, but we cannot finance the purchase of them.  Will you finance the purchase, and hold the hides against the money, and we will pay back the purchase price as we draw the hides&rdquo;?  They were told: &ldquo;No; you must go down to the leather industry in Carrick-on-Suir and buy the hides from them.&rdquo;  The leather industry in Carrick-on-Suir was importing the hides, or not even importing the hides, but importing the leather.  Another firm in Ireland went to the leather firm in question, and, on condition that they took from this leather firm 50 per cent. of their requirements, the leather firm, if you please, issued a recommendation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he would license this second firm to import a similar quantity of hides from abroad.  But the first firm, who <Col N="1903" /> had not got any licence from the Carrick-on-Suir firm to import leather, are now left with their doors closed and 200 men out of a job.  Now, is that right?  I do not think it is.</P>
      <P>Might I put it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he ought to make strict inquiries among those who are giving employment in this country as to the success that is attending the efforts of his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, to secure raw materials to keep those establishments open?  Would it astonish the people in this House to know that there was an order for 500,000 pairs of army boots hawked around this country, and there was not a single factory in Ireland that would take it? That was two years' work, I suppose, for 500 men, and there was not a single factory in Ireland that would take it.  I hawked around this country an order for 100,000 pairs of blankets&mdash;gradual delivery, and the factory to name its own price, within reason&mdash;and I could not get a single one of them to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the army boots were to be made in this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The army boots were to be made here for the British Army&mdash; 500,000 pairs, to be delivered as they were ready, the price being pretty open, a price sufficient to give the manufacturer a fair profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is the Minister for Supplies' job.  Remember, the Minister for Supplies is continually swaggering up and down the Dáil telling us about the remarkable success which has attended the efforts of the Government to secure supplies for the industries of this country.  The reason the unemployed are unemployed in this country is that we cannot get the stuff, and the Minister for Supplies is not getting the stuff, to employ the men.  There is employment in every boot factory and every woollen mill in Ireland sufficient to keep every <Col N="1904" /> operative employed for the next two years, and neither of the orders can be accepted because the Minister for Supplies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no; but it is the reason why we have to provide £230,000 to keep those unfortunate men on the dole, instead of having them earning good wages and, at the same time, enriching the community instead of impoverishing the community. I think the efforts of the Minister for Supplies have been one of the greatest and most tragic jokes that we have ever had in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the only means of keeping those men off the dole, where the vast majority of them have no desire to be, is to get them employment. I make no boast about the fact that I was able to offer employment which would keep them going for two years; anybody could do it, but it is no use.  The buyers are there; the men are there; the factories are there, but the materials are not there.  Certainly in regard to boots, that situation is in no small measure due to the fact that there was a fake factory established in this country by two gentlemen from Czecho-Slovakia, and 50 per cent. of what was being sold in this country as Irish upper leather was being imported from the relatives of the members of that company who were then resident in Czecho-Slovakia.  I could not buy a side of leather outside the country; I had to go down, hat in hand, to Carrick-on-Suir and let the gentleman there buy his side of leather in Czecho-Slovakia and then charge me whatever price he liked behind the tariff that had been put on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He was, surely.  It was he who put on the tariff.  Does the <Col N="1905" /> Minister deny that?  Here I tell the House of a case where a firm with 200 men, who are at present on the street, were prepared to make provision against this emergency, and they would not be allowed, and of another case where a firm was obliged to go down and undertake to buy from the firm in Carrick-on-Suir before the Minister would give them a licence to import.  I think the unemployed in this country have every reason to complain, and complain bitterly, that they are turned into &ldquo;dolees&rdquo; simply because the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Supplies have made a mess of the job they were charged with.</P>
      <P>When the Minister gets up to reply, I think he ought to tell us what his information is on the subject of supplies. I think he ought to tell us, and mind you, tell the country, that.  But for the difficulties in regard to supplies, I think we could employ every unemployed man in this country, just as was done during the European War of 1914-18.  If we could produce the boots and the woollen cloth and the blankets and the commodities of that kind that are wanted by the warring nations at the present time there would not be an unemployed man in this country, and the only thing preventing us from doing that is the failure to secure supplies.  Remember that a great deal of that failure to secure supplies results from the destruction of the natural trade relations that existed here before the Robins-run-the-ditch were brought in from Czecho-Slovakia and East Europe to set up fake factories in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to you this way: I know firms from which, in my tin-pot way, I was getting supplies. Manufacturers in this country were, no doubt, getting supplies from them too.  They were told they must not deal with Great Britain any longer, that they must get their supplies from Czecho-Slovakia or somewhere else.  The result of that now is that they cannot get <Col N="1906" /> supplies from these persons to whom they were sent and the old sources of supply, which would have felt a certain moral obligation to give us at least a part of what we had been getting pre-war, told us: &ldquo;Well, when we wanted your custom you took it away from us and handed it over to people you never dealt with before. Now these people have let you down and we cannot accept responsibility for keeping you supplied in your hour of need.&rdquo;  That is as certain as that we are in this House and that is the responsibility of the Ministers of that Government.  Those facts ought to be faced and those facts ought to be known.  Eighty per cent. of the unemployed men and women in this country are unemployed to-day because we cannot get supplies.  That is not all the fault of the Government because every country has difficulty in supply but a great part of the fault is due to the fact that that Government made us depend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>£220,000, required to protect from starvation these men who have been thrown into the street because their employers are unable to get supplies on which these men could exert their talent.  I will give the Minister the name afterwards of a firm who closed their doors on 200 men because it is not getting material for those men to work on and they have rejected orders that would have kept the factory working full time for the next two years because it could not <Col N="1907" /> get material.  I know that part of that&mdash;I am not saying all&mdash;but part of that dilemma is due to the fact that those people were forced to sever their business relations with firms with which they had been dealing for 100 years and transfer their custom to a fraudulent&mdash;fraudulent is not the correct word&mdash;but to a fake firm, a fake manufacturer, in this country who was in fact no more than an importer of manufactured Czecho-Slovakian goods.</P>

That did show that in respect of this particular category of employees there would be 1,000 less continuously employed during the 12 months.

      <P>There may be a certain amount of fluctuation and variations between one year and the other. As Deputy Hickey has pointed out there are fewer men on employment schemes and naturally fewer men fall <Col N="1911" /> within the terms of the Employment Schemes Vote.  The figure which I have given shows the total number of men who were on the live register. Add that to the number who are engaged on unemployment schemes and you get the net number who are not in normal employment.  There is, as I have said, an increase of 4,755.  Of that number, possibly I think about 3,000 would represent the average net increase in unemployment as compared with last year.  About 1,400 may represent the decrease in the number engaged on employment schemes.  It is very difficult to segregate one from the other.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not <Col N="1914" /> exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Gárda Síochána, including the Taca Síochána (No. 7 of 1925, No. 10 of 1926, No. 5 of 1937 and No. 28 of 1939).</P>
    <P>This Estimate does not mean that there has been an increase in expenditure over the amount originally estimated for.  At the beginning of the year the Minister mentioned that it would be necessary to recruit about 220 permanent men for the Gárda Síochána and provision was made for that number.  When war broke out, and an emergency situation arose, precautions of an exceptional nature had to be taken, and it was felt that a much larger number of Guards would be required immediately.  As that number would be in excess of the number provided for a new force was set up, called the Taca Síochána, on a temporary basis.  The actual amount spent on that force in the year will not exceed the amount provided, for the Gárda Síochána.  It was thought that 500 of these temporary people would be required, but finally authority was got for 400, and that figure was also revised, and the number is now somewhere in excess of 300.  Already about 230 have been recruited, and about 100 more are in process of recruitment, or expecting to be called. All of them have been summoned and would be in the Depôt some time ago but for the frost, owing to which it was not found possible to provide for their training.  I believe that about the 28th of this month the balance of these men will be due to arrive.  Additional stores, clothing and equipment and medical stores are required.  There is one other item in the Estimate, amounting to £6,500, required for a wireless transmitting equipment for Dublin and district.  The provision of such an apparatus is long overdue. The idea is to have a transmitting set at headquarters in a suitable place, and to provide patrols, both foot, cycle and car patrols, with receiving sets.  The car patrols will have a two-way apparatus, and can both send and receive messages.</P>

Now the Minister told us that it was then proposed to recruit 500, that the number was then reduced to 400, then to 300, and that only 230 were recruited.

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that that is not a good principle by any means.  If you propose to take any men into the Gárda Síochána, do not let them be temporary men.  You cannot do that with advantage to the State or to the service.  If the Minister proposes to get 100 more I advise him not to get another 100, but to content himself with 230.  Is it an advisable thing to have temporary policemen?  They will not have the satisfaction of doing their duty properly, nor is it likely that their services will be of advantage to the State. Whatever the idea was, when it was originally proposed to increase the number to 500, and now to 400, and to call them temporary, it does not appear to me to be good business.  I should <Col N="1917" /> like to have a further explanation of that.  The Minister said nothing about sub-head H, Transport and Carriage, except that an additional sum was required for the purchase of a reserve stock of necessaries, and to meet a rise in the contract prices for petrol and spare parts.  Does he intend to buy any new motor cars?  The amount set out is £2,768, less savings on other subheads of £700.</P>

There are cars made in the City of Cork, the Ford cars, which were used for State purposes for a great number of years.  Suddenly the Minister launched out and bought a number of Dodge cars.  Can he tell us what was the reason for the departure from the previous policy?  I understand the new cars are more expensive. In the ordinary way, as far as local authorities are concerned, when it is proposed to advertise requirements, they are bound to accept the lowest tenders, and if the local authority exercises discretion by the purchase of an expensive car instead of an inexpensive car, the members of the local authority are surcharged.  In this case, I think we ought to know what was the difference in price, what was the reason for the change, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanation for an increase in this force is not convincing.  We got no reason for it.  I looked up the returns of the numbers of Guards engaged by the Department over the last eight or nine years.  I gave the figures here to the Minister for Finance, and I gave them as they are returned in the book issued under his name.  I am speaking now of the ex-Minister for Finance.  He opened up telephonic communication with the Gárda Síochána and he got different figures from those presented in the Estimates. I am not concerned with what untruths the Minister puts his name to, but he did put his name to this document, the Book of Estimates, and it appears in it every year-Seán MacEntee, Aire Airgeadais, February, 1939.  That is all we can go on.  The <Col N="1918" /> Minister, I am sure, does not expect us to ring up the headquarters of the Guards to see whether the numbers are correct, but apparently the Minister for Finance thought we should do so. The figures are up on the figures for 1932, and, as I have said in another place, we have no more peace here now than we had in 1932.</P>

      <P>So far as traffic is concerned, there are traffic lights which were not set up in 1932, and they were put up at very considerable expense.  Assuming that you have some road traffic services to be rendered, you are getting paid for them now, and, apart from the numbers being up, the costs are up in addition, but, strangely enough, the Minister told me that there were only 11 more Guards than in 1932, although the return shows&mdash;I could not say how many now as it is 12 months since I saw it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Cosgrave, I think there are more Guards wanted in certain parts of the country. I know rural areas where they have been understaffed for a number of months and, in consequence, I assume, <Col N="1919" /> of that, some of the Gárda did not receive any holidays at all last year. I should like to know from the Minister if that is the reason.  There are a number of Guards in my constituency who got no holidays at all last year, and I submit that is a great hardship. One wonders if that is in consequence of the fact that some of these Gárda stations are understaffed.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that the Minister did not tell us when introducing the Estimate, and that is the wage, salary, or whatever you like to call it, which the Taca Síochána are supposed to get. There was a statement published recently in the Dublin Press to the effect that these men were in receipt of only something like £2 or £2 5s. a week. I suggest to the Minister that to ask a man to take up the position of policeman at £2 or £2 5s. a week is a joke. I agree with Deputy Cosgrave in this respect.  It is not desirable at all to have temporary Gárda, and especially it is very undesirable to have temporary Gárda at a wage of £2 or £2 5s. a week, because a great many temptations are put in the way of men in that position, and one might expect that some of them might take advantage of these temptations when they have such a low wage as £2 or £2 5s.  I say that it is absolutely ridiculous that men should be recruited into the Gárda Síochána, that advantage should be taken of three or four of the best years of their lives at a small wage, and that they should then be thrown out on the scrap heap.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider the position so far as wages are concerned, and that they should be paid a decent wage and, if at all possible, they should be taken into the permanent force.</P>

      <P>I want to stress the points raised by Deputy Corish with regard to the subsidiary police force referred to in the Estimates as the Taca Síochána.  My information is that the salary of the members of this force is round about £2 per week, but a more serious aspect of the matter is that this new body is widely known as the &ldquo;cut-price police force,&rdquo; and I think that in respect of a State force of the <Col N="1920" /> importance of a police force, whose duty it is to keep the peace in difficult times, that will surely have a demoralising effect all round, and I should very much like the Minister to clarify the position with regard to these matters.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied in his own mind that all the elements in the Gárda Síochána at present are dependable? That is the kind of thing nobody likes to say, but it is much better to say it in public and let the Minister answer it, than to listen to its being whispered all through the country, and preserve a kind of scared silence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will serve the Minister better to join with us in exertions to make an end of the rumour, or the root of the rumour.  An efficient and effective police force is as necessary for him as it is for us, and it is as ardently desired, I have no doubt, by the Minister as it is by any Deputy on this side.  He ought to rest assured that in any actions he deems it necessary to take to that end, he is certain of all the help he wants, and he might well remember that his predecessor had to take certain disciplinary measures and certain reforming measures and very little comment was made upon them because it was known that he was dealing with a difficult situation, albeit he was largely responsible for creating it.  But when he made up his mind to deal with it, no new obstacles were put in his way and there was very little talk about the measures he felt it necessary to take.  I am not going back on them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> I suppose that when you enrol large numbers of men all of a sudden, you are liable to get some undesirable characters in, particularly in the circumstances in which the Minister's predecessor enrolled most of the new members of the Gárda Síochána.  If a mistake is made then, let us not, for the purpose of saving face, persist in our error to the grave detriment of a very fine body, the Gárda Síochána. I am not satisfied that the personnel of the Gárda at present is completely satisfactory, and I think the Minister should take steps to improve it.  I do not believe in victimising anyone. The toughest &ldquo;egg&rdquo; that ever appeared may turn over a new leaf and become a very good man.  But I think it ought to be made perfectly clear that discipline is going appreciably to be tightened up in the Gárda Síochána, and that any man who fails to measure up to the highest requirements of discipline and integrity will be ruthlessly disposed of, no matter what his record.</P>
    <P>I take so grave a view of the present situation that I urge Deputies on all sides of the House not to canvass the reasons for the situation that at present confronts us.  Many of us may have different views as to what has created this situation.  I believe it is there and that it is not an easy situation to remedy.  So far as past incidents go, I urge Deputies not to go into them.  But I recognise that a difficult situation exists that we have got to tackle.  So far as the present circumstances are concerned, I have the utmost respect for the Chief Commissioner, but I think a gesture requires to be made in order to indicate quite clearly to the youngest Guard and the most senior chief superintendent, that there is going to be a general shake-up and reform.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the appointment of an inspector-general of the Gárda, charged with the enforcement of discipline and the maintenance of proper standards throughout the ranks everywhere, in all stations, and on and off duty.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot recently after the arsenal was robbed to the effect that, if the routine drill and procedure had <Col N="1922" /> been carefully observed, no one would have gone in there.  Does any Deputy believe that the routine drill is carried through in every Gárda station to-day? Does the Minister believe that the routine drill is carried through in every Gárda station to-day?  Does not everybody know that it is not?  Does the Minister believe that the full precision of discipline is enforced by every superintendent and every chief superintendent to-day?  Do we not all know that it is not?  I fully recognise the hardship involved in a member of the Gárda keeping himself up to a very high standard of neatness and precision when he feels that a lower standard would do the job just as well. But, what that individual does not understand is that, unless a high and seemingly unnecessary standard is constantly maintained, a disaster analogous to the arsenal disaster could happen in a flash.  It is the duty of the officers, of the high officers, understanding the importance of these things, to enforce them rigidly.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is this, that if you have in the ranks of the Gárda Síochána a number of persons, be it a small number of persons, who are not doing their job, or who are acting the part of a sort of spies in the ranks, you are going to create throughout the ranks of the Gárda Síochána an atmosphere of distrust, suspicion, and uncertainty that paralyses it.  I am apprehensive that that is happening.  I want to try to restore the position in which the youngest member of the Taca Síochána and the most senior sergeant in the force knows that, if he does his duty strictly in accordance with the regulations, not even the Prime Minister himself will be able to do him injury without precipitating the resignation of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>That is not the present case.  There is never smoke without fire.  You ask the people of North County Dublin why certain sergeants were removed from stations there and sent down the country, and you will hear what the rumour is.  You ask the average Guard down the country: &ldquo;Is it expedient to enforce the licensing regulations on certain public houses?&rdquo; and I do not think he would say to you: &ldquo;I would <Col N="1923" /> not touch so-and-so's house,&rdquo; but what he will say is: &ldquo;The less you have to do with the licensing business, the better for you.  After hours, stay in the barracks; it is the safest place for you, because you never know where you are. If the publican is not able to wangle it on you, you may find some fellow in the public house, and he will destroy you if you prosecute him.&rdquo;  Does not the Minister know that that suspicion is abroad?  Honestly, there are many shortcomings of which I believe the Minister to be guilty; but I do not believe he wants that, and I do not believe the Chief Commissioner wants it. But some dramatic departure is requisite to reassure the Gárdaí up and down the country that it is not going to happen, and that, if officers below the chief superintendent attempt to interfere with the due course of justice and the proper execution of a Guard's duty, the most summary penalties will be visited on them.</P>

      <P>The general administration of the Gardá Síochána itself.  I would not venture to do it, but I see this is a token Estimate which seems to me to open up that, especially in this connection.  Of course, if it were out of order, that would put an end to the matter.  I raise the matter because I have heard so much talk that I think it is dishonest to allow such talk to continue without giving the Minister a chance to grapple with it.  I have gone to the Minister on another occasion in relation to rumours which were in circulation about landings on the Kerry coast and he agreed with me that the only way to dispose of rumours once they became formidable was to bring them out into the open and <Col N="1924" /> announce that you are going to deal with the evils which were alleged.  I believe that there is substance in these rumours.  I have not the experience of administration which many of my colleagues have and the Minister has acquired, but it does seem to me that one way of dealing with that situation would be to appoint an Inspector-General of the Gárda Síochana to cooperate with the Chief Commissioner for the purpose of ensuring that unreliable members of the Gárda Síochána will be disposed of summarily; that discipline in its highest sense would be restored from one end of the force to the other and that contact between the Gárda and the Gárda officers and between Gárda officers and headquarters would be effectively established and above all that it would be made clear to the Guards that if they found a T.D. or even a Minister committing any breach of the law and prosecuted him, they would be commended for their impartiality rather than victimised for their temerity.  Now there are some details to which one might make reference but I do not propose to do so.  I am I confess grieved that so fine a body of men as the Gárda Síochána should be suffered to disintegrate.  As the Minister knows, I come from the County Mayo.  The Minister is familiar with the County Roscommon.  I have heard it said that in respect of the County Mayo, one could do anything at all with the Gárda because that was the ex-Minister's county.  I do not know what the situation there now is, but I hope it is better than it was in the time of the ex-Minister.  I do not know.  None of us could hope to derive much benefit from making any observation on that head during the time when Deputy Ruttledge was Minister for Justice. During that time, at all events, the impression was abroad that one could not expect very much because no matter on what side the person was, the Gárdaí might find themselves acting against somebody who had been personating agent for the Minister for Justice at the last election and any Gárda or Gárda officer who interfered in such a case was foredoomed to failure.</P>

The Minister knows what is going on, and I believe that if he could get a specific case he would act vigorously, but he cannot get a specific case.  How could he?  Supposing a Gárda does find himself rapped across the knuckles, would it be in his interest to go behind the Chief Commissioner's back and make a complaint of that kind?  What would happen to him?  Suppose I wrote to the Chief Commissioner or to the Minister that this man had come to me and made a complaint about them, does he not imagine what would happen?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I believe I am in order, Sir.  That leaves this deliberately open on a general debate of this kind.  Coming back to the point I have been discussing, it is more difficult for a Deputy to get a specific case of that kind than it is for the Minister.  I do not know whether the Minister feels that he is constrained to say that there is nothing in my case at all.  I believe he knows there is.  Now, I submit if the Minister says: &ldquo;I am going out to deal with that and I will do all I possibly can to prevent it,&rdquo; more than half the battle would be won.  If we can bring back to the individual Gárda the confidence he felt that so long as he did his duty impartially he was immune from exterior pressure of any kind, there is material in that force which is enough guarantee for satisfaction in the future.  At the present the evil is in the suggestion (1) that if a Guard does his duty he will injure himself rather than be commended; the second point is the belief even amongst the Gárda that there are commissars on behalf of the Government anonymously watching the force; that there are certain sorts of privileged members of the force who have some kind of direct contact with the Minister at headquarters.  That makes it extremely difficult to correct that situation and the only way, as I suggest, is a clear pronouncement from the Minister and the appointment of an inspector-general whose mandate will be supported by the Minister against all-comers.  It is of vital importance that it should be brought home to the Gárda, new and old, that a higher standard of efficiency and the strict observance of the regulations will be required in the future and that anyone who fails to come up to that standard will be summarily disposed of lest his failure to meet the higher <Col N="1927" /> requirements should demoralise the whole force.  That is a matter requiring urgent attention and I do not believe there is a Deputy in the House who does not agree with me in that, though some of them do not think it politic to do so publicly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and no hanky-panky. I put it to the Minister that whether Deputy Dillon was right or not in mentioning these rumours there is a great suspicion that all of the 230 appointments that were made some time ago were not giving satisfaction to Deputies on the Government Benches and the position was that Deputies on the Government side and their supporters are asking:&mdash;&ldquo;How did that fellow get in; he was not one of our supporters?&rdquo; The suspicion is that that was why they stopped at 230. If the Minister can assure the country <Col N="1928" /> that there is no danger of the wrong type of appointment being made in the future, confidence in the Gárdaí will be greatly increased.  The Minister seems to be a very innocent man; he is taken as a very innocent man and he gets away with it in this House pretty often because of his assumed air of innocence.  But when that air of innocence will not work the Minister gets indignant, hits out and makes a statement like he did a few moments ago.  His case about the necessity for increasing the Guards was based on something like the Road Traffic Act, I believe.  We were told that the appointment of increased Gárdaí to examine hackney vehicles was necessary. It is hard, however, to see where the extra work came in under the Road Traffic Act.  In the course of the past three years a number of Gárdaí were released from active service and these could have taken over these duties. There is the new type of flying squad, but there does not appear to be much necessity for that now.  The Minister says there are a number of stations under-staffed.  But one of the ways out of that would be to shift down the country some of the extremely well-dressed plain clothes men we have here and get them to do a little of this extra work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Token Vote for £10.  The total, without reference to the savings on other sub-heads, is fairly alarming. It is quite possible that, with the savings on other sub-heads, the Minister requires only £10, but it shows that the tendency of the Gárda Vote, like that of every other Vote, is to go on steadily increasing.  There are items here and there in this Vote that, with a little foresight on the part of the Minister, might have been avoided.  There is an item of £31,000 as an additional sum required for clothing for the Taca Síochána and for reserves of clothing for the Gárda Síochána.  I assume that one of the reasons for that is that the Minister for Justice was &ldquo;caught out&rdquo; in respect of stocks, as every other Minister was.  In every Supplementary Estimate coming before the House to-night, there is a little item to cover increased stocks of something the Department in question ran short of.  The <Col N="1929" /> Minister for Justice, like the other Ministers, did not realise what was going to happen and walked into the soup.</P>
    <P>I do not like the Minister's attitude to the references made by Deputy Dillon.  If the Minister believes that there is no suspicion in the country as to the efficiency of his administration of the Gárda Síochána, he is quite entitled to his belief, but he is wrong in thinking that when he says &ldquo;That is all nonsense&rdquo; that ends the matter. Is it not well known that if there is any demoralisation in the Gárda Síochána&mdash;we have, of course, the Taca Síochána as well now&mdash;it exists since the establishment of the second new force which went all over the country and was planked into Civic Guards' Barracks, scaring the wits out of the Gárda Síochána during a period of political turmoil because they were quite sure that these people were planted upon them to see that they were good boys, not from the point of view of the State, but from the point of view of Fianna Fáil&mdash;that they were custodians of Fianna Fáil interests in the country.  There is no use in saying that these things are all nonsense.  Will the Minister go so far as this&mdash;will he make it a criminal offence on the part of any T.D. or public representative to approach himself, as Minister for Justice, or the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána with a view to the removal, dismissal or other interference with the administration of the Gárda force?  If the Minister would do that, he would achieve something, but I do not think he is man enough to stand up to it and say that there will be no interference, particularly from our friends on the opposite benches.  If he would do that, or something like it, it would strengthen the country's confidence very much.  If he convinced the people of the country that appointments to the Gárda Síochána would be on character and merit, he would do good work, but I do not think that anybody believes that the present Minister for Justice is the man who will do that.  As long as the people have the opinion that appointments to the Gárda Síochána are being made by our friends on the opposite side, God help the force.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister, when replying to the debate, to tell us something more about the pay of the temporary men.  If it is £2 or £2 5s. 0d., it is very small for a man doing important national work.  I would ask him also to say if it is true that members of the temporary force are not entitled to sick pay.  If that be so, I would make a special appeal to him to grant them a little concession, especially in view of the fact that men like them have to be up at all hours of the night and morning, and in all sorts of weather, and are particularly prone to illness.  If, as would happen in a great many cases, their economic circumstances are not good and they are not entitled to sick pay, there is a temptation to them to go in to work although they may not be feeling well. I make a special appeal to the Minister to grant a little concession in this case.</P>

      <P>I want to go back to the roots of this matter, if that is possible on this Estimate.  I want the Minister to state, when replying, what exactly is the purpose for which this force is recruited.  In an interruption, I gave the view that I gathered from a previous debate that it had to do with the growth of political crime in the country.  My authority for that statement is the ex-Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Speaking here on the Supplementary Budget, he indulged in what I thought then were exaggerated flights of rhetoric.  He said that there was in the country a gang of murderous ruffians, with a perfected technique of terrorism, and that if we did not vote the sums provided for in the Budget, especially the provision being made for the Volunteers and the Taca Síochána, we could not sleep peacefully in our beds at night.  That may be wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister says that that is not so, I shall refer him to the page in the debates where the present Minister for Industry and Commerce made the statement.  I spoke after him.  I said that I had not understood that that was the purpose of the recruitment of these people, but I was assured it was.  The Minister may have another story to-night.  I gather that he does not agree that the growth of political crime is responsible in any way for the recruitment of these men.  Is that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody will have to tell us to-night, or at some other time, what is the purpose of the recruitment of these people.  It is on record that the purpose is to put down a gang of ruffians who have perfected a technique of terrorism.  These are not my words.  I am quoting the Minister for Industry and Commerce. This estimate covers 220 men.  Deputy Linehan referred to this as the third special force.  The people who preceded them were an experiment in the way of a special force.  They were called &ldquo;harriers&rdquo;.  They were known throughout the country in odious and derisive fashion by that name and they richly deserved the odium and the derision cast upon them.  So bad were they that we had it from a judge of the High Court that three of them were guilty of attempted murder, and he asked that the names be sent forward to the Attorney-General with a request that they be prosecuted.  When, under the Emergency Powers Bill, I asked about these three men, I was told that one had certainly left the Guards. The then Minister for Justice thought that a second man had left, too, but I got the impression that the third man was still in the force.  I hope that is not so.  I would like to have an assurance, which would help to restore the confidence which was definitely shattered by the &ldquo;harriers&rdquo;, that these three persons have been kicked out of the Guards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That judge did make a distinction between the special force and the ordinary force, and it is a distinction which still prevails in the minds of <Col N="1932" /> the country people.  It is recognised that the Guards have to attend to their duties.  There is some doubt as to whether the duties they are asked to give attention to are worth all the attention which is showered upon them. In any event, however, it was not their duty to decide that; they simply did what they were told to do and they did their work effectively, but again this special squad came in and everybody knows that it was initiated for political purposes.  Everybody knows that it was one way of getting political adherents for the Party, and possibly it was also one way of buying off a certain number of people who had paraded themselves as republicans, and perhaps it was thought that their republican sympathies could be diverted or merged easily into gathering particulars about licensed houses and into gathering statistics about crops and so on.  That, of course, did not work, and the judge who decided the Marsh's Yard case did say that, while the citizens as a whole, he thought, had every right to have confidence in the force as a whole, they certainly had lost that confidence because of the infusion of these alien elements into their ranks.  Something at least, it would appear, has been done, if, as is laid down under the Emergency Order, these people are to be appointed and recruited by the present Commissioner of the Gárdaí, because he has the confidence of the people.</P>
    <P>I think it can be said that the present Commissioner absolutely has the confidence of the people, and if he is going to be allowed to recruit these men I think there is very little danger of any bias being given because of the political views that may be held by these people, and certainly there is going to be no bias in his mind in connection with people who have temporarily abandoned a career of something in the nature of roguery in order to become members of the police force and guardians of the people.  Apart from that, however, there is no doubt that the force did suffer very much from the infiltration of these &ldquo;Harriers.&rdquo;  It certainly did, and I think nobody can deny it.  They were a demoralising influence on the force <Col N="1933" /> and I think that they certainly led to a certain break-up of the morale of the Government themselves.  At any rate, so far as the Guards are concerned, we have not yet had the spectacle that arose in this country the other day where a member of the Defence Forces had to be dragged to his feet in court, then saying that he did not recognise the court, and still allowed to go around with his uniform on him.  As I say, we have not yet got to that stage so far as the Gárdaí are concerned, but we have the case of these three men who were before the High Court and who had the castigation thrown upon them by the judge that they were attempted murderers.  Nobody can say that that was just a matter of one wing of the force, or that there was no question of the possibility of weakening confidence in the force as a whole. However, I hope that that kind of thing is a thing of the past and I hope that the Minister will give a precise answer to Deputy Linehan's request that the present Commissioner will be allowed to recruit these men entirely on his own, without any trouble and without any question of political bias, and that he will be enabled to make his choice on the standards that he thinks will best suit the force.</P>
    <P>With regard to these forces themselves, the Minister knows very well that there must be a certain restraint of language in dealing with such matters.  One comes in here and states certain things, and then one is challenged as to whether one knows that things are so or not.  The Minister can always drive one further by asking for proof, and then when it becomes clear that the allegation is true, one is blamed for having brought it up here. Does the Minister think it wise to ask me or other Deputies to give him day and date as to people who have been dislodged from the Guards because something they did was repugnant to the Government?  I shall give him some of these cases, if he likes.  The Minister may not wish me to do so, but they are to be had.  If the Minister likes to put a definite challenge to me to mention these cases in the House, I shall do so, but I should prefer not to be asked to speak of them in the <Col N="1934" /> House openly.  Possibly, however we can leave that.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister is going to get a couple of hundred people, and I should like to find out from him, simply as a matter of curiosity, who drafted the oath that these people have to take. It is set out in the Emergency Orders. The judges have to take an oath in accordance with the Constitution, and that oath runs to about five lines, but these people have a double mouthful to swallow.  They have to swear and affirm their good faith doubly, and apparently there is no appreciation of, let us say, the Quaker element or anything else in it.  I think that, even prior to solemnly pledging their oath and making their affirmation, these people are made to promise certain things on their word of honour.  I do not know whether that is supposed to catch out people who might have the &ldquo;empty formula&rdquo; conscience&mdash;it probably is&mdash;but I cannot understand the things that are to be put into the mouths of these people who, apparently, are to get £2 5s. a week and who are to be recruited by and under the control of the Commissioner.  As I say, however, as a matter of curiosity, I should like to know who it was who drew up that oath.  I do not think it was the Minister himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a variety of oaths laid down by statute for judges and certain other people, but this is something on its own; it is more involved and more cumbrous, and the net is flung very wide.  It means, apparently, that anybody who objects, on principle, to an oath, cannot get on to that body, because the taking of the oath is compulsory.  I thought that the reason for the existence of this force was for the putting down of definite crime, and if it is merely for the purpose of collecting more statistics about crops, and so on, for attending to the matter of licensed houses and the Road Traffic Acts, I do not think it is worth spending another shilling upon.  I had understood that the reason for this new force was in order to deal with a new situation that had arisen here because of the impact of the war and because of the existence of people here such as <Col N="1935" /> undesirable aliens or of people who, if not aliens, may still be undesirable and objectionable in another way.  I did understand that the proposition of the Government was that they needed more money and this extra force in order to meet an emergency&mdash;not in connection with road traffic and things like that, but in connection with definite crime.  That being the position, we said: &ldquo;Very good; we will accept the proposition, but we should like to know what type of crime has to be met.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this connection, there is another matter to which I should like to refer. I do not know whether the Government are responsible, or who is responsible for the position in which Deputies coming into this House within the last couple of days have found themselves. It seems to me that we are almost having the experience of people entering a beleaguered fortress.  Whether that situation of being locked up is the same as the Taca Síochána at the moment, I cannot say.  It may be, but it may also be that the Government cannot depend on their own servants, and that therefore they must have a certain amount of rigidity and restriction on what used to be a fairly free access to this building.</P>

      <P>Then, Sir, I gather that the particular conditions under which we are living at the moment here have been established by those who have the responsibility for the conduct and guardianship of this House, but I wonder whether or not the same reasons are at the back of this as in the other case?  I can understand that certain precautions must be taken for the guardianship of this House, but I still want to know what has led up to these tightened regulations with regard to entrance to, and exit from, the House, because we are certainly in a <Col N="1936" /> very restrained position compared with that in which we were formerly.  It may be that it is in connection with the same matter, and I suggest that it is.  At any rate, certain people yesterday found that they could not get access to the building, and the excuse that was made was that the particular door concerned was locked and could not be opened, although it was pointed out that the key of the door was hanging on a nail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave the detailed points aside and get down to the general question.  Is the Minister in touch with those who have responsibility for the specific guardianship of this House?  Has he had any case made to him for the better protection of the House and, if so, what is that case?  Will it involve the utilisation of the Gárda Síochána generally, or the Taca Síochána?  I do not know exactly what is the situation with regard to this new body.  We were given to understand they were constituted for a certain purpose.  I suggest it is an experiment again in the way of a temporary force and the Minister must realise the disadvantages that lie in bringing people into a position of definite authority and having them on this day-to-day or week-to-week or month-to-month basis.  I suggest it is an experiment that is fraught with dangers and difficulties and that it is an experiment that cannot be entered upon lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> Already we have had experience of a body like that, but a lesson can be learned from the experience gained in that connection.  That arrangement resulted badly because it was arranged badly.  Is the Minister prepared to give an assurance that if these men are recruited by the Commissioner of the Gárda he will have full freedom in his choice and that there will be none of these manoeuvres that we had in relation to the last force and with regard to the Gárda Síochána generally, such as in the case of people who did their duty and, because they did, it made them unpopular and they were lowered in rank or they were sent to remote places in the country, where they had less amenities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should tell us what his intentions are with regard to the new force.  This is probably the only country in the world which has a permanent and a temporary police force.  We have the permanent Gárda Síochána, and we have this temporary force, the members of which are employed, as Deputy McGilligan has said, on a week to week or a month to month basis.  They have no security of tenure and, because of that, they cannot possibly have the same outlook in their employment as the regular Gárdaí necessarily have.  No information was given to the House as to the circumstances under which it was found necessary to recruit this temporary force beyond the hysterical outburst of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who told us some short time ago, on the occasion of a Supplementary Budget, that there was going to be ruin, chaos and anarchy unless the pay of this temporary force was voted, and they were retained in the service of the State. Knowing the Minister's colleague, nobody believed that; nobody took much notice of his hysterical utterance; but his, nevertheless, was the only statement from a Minister which indicated the purpose for which the Taca Síochána was recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Justice should take the earliest opportunity of indicating that there is to be one police force only in this country and <Col N="1938" /> that a permanent one.  It is very unsatisfactory to have here a permanent and a temporary police force. No other country would resort to an unsatisfactory experiment of that kind, and the Minister ought to try to get rid of the existing situation at the earliest moment.  It would remind one of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Special mentality of the Six Counties.  We ought to have as soon as possible a statement from the Minister that it is intended to merge the temporary force into the permanent police force.  The present state of affairs is unsatisfactory.  The existing arrangement is bound to be unsatisfactory in operation.  The sooner we get rid of the temporary force the better.  If it is found necessary to retain these men, they ought to be merged into the regular Gárdaí.</P>

      <P>I am loth to say anything on this matter, but the attitude of the Minister has rather disappointed me.  I should like him to face the issues that have been put before him.  Everyone here is quite friendly to him.  He is the one Minister in this State to whom the country is looking with confidence.  They look with confidence to this Minister fairly to administer the Department he controls, and I believe he will do that; I believe he is capable of doing that.  I believe he has the rugged, natural integrity of a man who will do his job, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant.  I do not like his attitude towards Deputy Dillon's speech.  I could tell the Minister much more than Deputy Dillon told him, but I am not going to do it. We had better forget about what has happened.  There is no purpose served in repeating the things that happened in this country and that everybody knows about.  The Minister is a rugged, stern, honest man who will do his job and restore confidence in this body.  I am not saying that in a flattering way at all.  It is merely a statement of what I believe.</P>

      <P>I did not like the Minister's attitude towards Deputy Dillon.  The Minister will only injure <Col N="1939" /> himself in the job he has before him if he adopts an attitude of that kind. Everyone knows what Deputy Dillon has said, and they know far more; I know more, and if the Minister will only look up some of the documents in his own Department, he will see a lot of things there that will confirm what Deputy Dillon has said in this House, and what many other people know.  I will ask the Minister to adopt all that has been said, and, what is much more important, all that was implied.  No Deputy wants to say here everything that he knows.  We can give plenty of information if we like, but the Minister has it in his Department.  There is no purpose served in blinking this thing, and the Minister will do himself an injury if he attempts to condone the things that happened, and that everybody in the country knows.  Now, that is that, and I do not want to say anything more about it.  The Minister will only do himself an injustice.  The country looks to him as the only man in the Cabinet who has the honesty and the courage to get this force on its feet again.  I support the plea made to the Minister in regard to this new force. So far as I know, they are a splendid body of young fellows.  So far as I know, they were selected from different parts of the country on their merits and with utter impartiality.  I happen to know some fellows who were called up, and I know them to be good chaps.</P>

      <P>Yes, Donegal men, some of the best men in Ireland.  However, that is aside from the question. I look upon it as a disastrous thing that young men like them would be, as it were, a body within a body.  If the Minister asks us to establish these men as part of the permanent force, he will get our support.  Deputies Cosgrave, Dillon, McGilligan and Norton have pointed out that it is a dangerous thing for the State to have a body of this kind outside or within another body, and the sooner that is definitely settled the better.  Some of these men, as Deputies are aware, have been taken out of reasonably good employment and they expected to become permanent <Col N="1940" /> in the Guards.  What is going to happen those men in the course of three or four years?  What will happen a fine body of men taken for three or four years into the Guards and then disbanded?  Does anybody look forward to that situation with pleasure? Seeing that they have been called up, I submit that they should be made permanent members of the force.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask some questions in relation to the sub-heads.  I observe that under sub-head (B) provision is made for plain clothes for members of the new force.  I would like to know from the Minister if some of the members of the new force are doing plain clothes duty.  I am curious to know what special qualifications young men brought up here from different parts of the country have for the performance of plain clothes duty.  With regard to sub-head (E), I understood that provision for the expenditure here outlined had been made in the Supplementary Budget passed about four months ago. Are we to take it that the increase referred to is due to the increased cost of material, or is it because of a miscalculation that the sum set out here is required?  I agree that nothing very substantial is involved.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to do something to restore to Deputies the rights which they formerly enjoyed of making representations touching the Gárda Síochána.  As a result of their constantly reiterated criticisms, the untrue, unjust and unfair statements of the Opposition, any representation made by a Deputy, and particularly a Fianna Fáil Deputy, is damned from the beginning as being untrue.  I am not now referring to representations concerning the administration of the licensing laws or the transfer of Guards.  But there are many matters which crop up from time to time, and in regard to these it does not matter what a Deputy says about them, particularly a Fianna Fáil Deputy, his representations are ignored.  I say that is due to the untrue, unjust and unfair statements that have been constantly reiterated in this House by the members of the Opposition, the effect being to poison the Minister's mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> In one particular instance, a very serious one, I myself had to break through all the rules and regulations made by the Minister and the Government with the object of preventing Deputies from making representations. I was very glad I did it because I believe that by so doing I prevented very serious consequences ensuing in that particular instance.  I am not going to go into details.  I think that Deputies ought to have the right to make representations, and that those representations should not be made by irresponsible people.  As I have said, I am not now referring to frivolous representations concerning the transfer of Guards, or &ldquo;footy&rdquo; things relating to the administration of the licensing laws.  There are many other things on which Deputies should be allowed to make representations.  In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to develop some sense of proportion on this and restore to Deputies the rights that they ought to have as representatives of the people.</P>

I may say that I have definitely set my face against it and refused to give the references.</P>

The position at the present time is that, due to the smokescreen that has been created by the Opposition, any abuse can grow up inside the Gárda Síochána, and Deputies are prevented from bringing it to the notice of the authorities.</P>

      <P>When we were on the Opposition Benches I felt compelled, because of my experience in the County Meath, to pay tribute to the Gárda Síochána for their efficiency, courtesy and attention to duty.  After the speeches that we had from the opposite side this afternoon, I feel bound now to pay a further tribute to the Guards.  Since this Party became the Government we have, I think, increased the strength of the Guards by 300 or 400 men.  From what I have seen of these young fellows on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere, they are an adornment to the force. They are an excellent body of young men.  In view of that I do not think that Deputies on the opposite benches, men who have had some considerable experience of discipline, have been playing fair towards the Guards.  We had speeches made on the opposite side to-night with the very definite intention of destroying that discipline, of creating suspicion and general disruption. It is not fair to the force, the Government or to the Minister that that should go on.</P>
      <P>We have now reached the stage when commonsense should prevail.  Each and every one of us here should make our contribution towards establishing an effective discipline, because discipline is really what is wanted.  In view of what was said from the opposite benches I thought I should make these few remarks.  Whether I heard aright what was said, I, at all events, came to the conclusion that the main object of Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Linehan in their speeches to-night was to create uneasiness and a want of discipline amongst the members of the force.</P>

      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Hickey, and I welcome the regulation issued preventing Deputies from interfering in the matters referred to.  I think it is highly desirable that appointments in the Guards, or matters concerning the administration of the force, should not be subject to influence by any member <Col N="1943" /> of the House.  If any matter comes to the notice of a Deputy that he thinks is important enough to be brought to the attention of the authorities, then the Minister is there to be acquainted with that.  Personally, I should prefer to make my complaint to the Minister. I am certain that most Deputies welcome the regulation that has been made forbidding Deputies to interfere. The proper channel to make representation through is the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that at the start I explained the reason for this temporary force.  I agree with the Deputies who have said that it is most undesirable to have temporary men in the force.  But the trouble was that when the force was first recruited it was to deal with an emergency following the outbreak of war.  At the time we did not know what the situation was going to be.  I think nobody did. At the beginning there was a black-out in the city here, and extra police were required.  Men had to be brought up from stations all over the country until we had these temporary men recruited. It was not clear at the time what places might have to be specially guarded, places in which previously there had been no guard.  In other words, there was an unknown situation here to be dealt with.  When I assumed office as Minister for Justice it was thought by the Commissioner that he would require, ultimately, if things developed in the way it seemed likely they would at the beginning, something like 1,000 extra men to deal with the emergency.  Then, very quickly, it appears, it was found too large and it was cut down to 500; and finally, as I said when I brought it before the House&mdash;in reply to a question, I think &mdash;we were satisfied that 400 would meet the situation.  It is reduced now to roughly, 300.  We are all hopeful that things will not get any worse in the world, but we do not know, and there is therefore necessity for a temporary force during the emergency, undesirable as it is.  I admit that it is undesirable, but I do not see any way out of it.  If we were permanently to take 400 or 500 men whom we did not <Col N="1944" /> require, that would not be right.  I do not know what the position is in other countries, but I believe that in circumstances like this there are temporary police in other countries.  I am almost certain that it is the case in other countries where they are up against an emergency which it was considered would pass.  That is the reason our force was recruited.</P>
      <P>If the ordinary Guards had been recruited&mdash;that is, the 220 which the Minister indicated it was intended to recruit during the year&mdash;they would have been recruited in accordance with the regulations laid down before the House.  It was a sort of Civil Service examination, that is, a qualifying examination, but the actual recruitment was to be done by the Commissioner. There was no time to do that when the emergency arose, as an extra number was required immediately.  I announced here, at the time, what was done: the Commissioner drew men, up to the number he required, from a list registered some time in 1938; he drew them in accordance with the qualifications that the candidates themselves said they had, that is, both physical and educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>That is really what happened; it was to deal with an emergency.  As far as the men are concerned, I think it is very likely that most of them will be absorbed into the permanent Guards whenever the recruitment to the permanent Guards again takes place, though I do not know when that will be.  I should say that, until we are satisfied that there is going to be no abnormal situation here, we will require a temporary force and will probably adhere to that temporary position. Regarding the pay, it is £3 a week, with medical attention and uniform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is testimony to the wisdom of our predecessors that we could not do better than follow their example, and we cannot be accused of bringing in new phrases.  The biggest question of all is the question of confidence, which was raised by Deputy Dillon.  I do not want to be misunderstood now, but I think that a lot of the mistrust started here in this House, when unmeasured language was used here.  There may have been&mdash;and I am prepared to admit it&mdash;amongst the temporary force recruited in 1934 some people who were not up to the standard, as in every body in the world, as there was in the force recruited under the last Government and as in any human society.  However, I will say that, on the whole, they did their job well.  I do not want to raise any trouble at all now, or to refer <Col N="1946" /> to the past, but I must remind Deputies that a very serious situation arose here which had to be dealt with, and which was dealt with.  I am not going to allow the police recruited at one particular time to be pilloried and held up as the worst in the whole force, just because a few may not be up to the standard.  We know that, under the last Government, there were undesirable people in the force.  That is unfortunate, but it happens in human nature that there always will be such a thing.  Is it doing any good to the Guards to hear speeches like those of Deputy McGilligan?  I will not say Deputy Dillon made such a speech, but that of Deputy McGilligan was not at all a helpful speech from the point of view of establishing confidence in the Guards.</P>
      <P>On the question of rumours, I have heard all sorts of rumours, and I know they are prevalent.  I am satisfied there may be something in them, but I know this much&mdash;and Deputy McGilligan has said as much and is satisfied, too&mdash;that the man in charge, the Commissioner, will deal rigidly with any breach of discipline in cases brought to his notice.  But, it is difficult to deal with vague rumour; we must get a concrete case.  I do not want it trotted out here, but I must point out the difficulty there is in dealing with vague rumours of that kind.  I think there can be no doubt whatever that the Commissioner will insist on rigid discipline and will deal with a breach of it wherever he finds it. Certainly, I have not interfered, and I do not intend to.  I do not believe the Commissioner would allow me: if I tried, I believe he would not remain there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Bartley was wrong in the suggestion he made.  It is only right that the Commissioner should be responsible, and as long as we have confidence in him he should be allowed to carry on without interference.  If any Deputy makes representation&mdash;I do not care to what Party he belongs; I think Deputies of all Parties come to me from time to time&mdash;that there has been abuse, perhaps by an officer in charge of a particular district, who may be allowing an abuse to continue without <Col N="1947" /> dealing with it, the Deputy will be within his rights in coming to the Minister and telling him that.  Then it would be my duty to draw the Commissioner's attention to the reports that have reached me.  I think that is one of my duties here; it is my belief, anyway, that I should do that.  However, as far as recruitment or changes are concerned, that is not my job&mdash;it is the Commissioner's.</P>

I should like to draw Deputies' attention to this fact&mdash;it seems to have escaped even experienced Deputies like the ex-President and ex-Ministers &mdash; that the Gárda Síochána are a young force.  When they were recruited, they were mostly very young men.  There were increments in their salaries every year, and marriage allowances have been paid, and those items have considerably increased the cost of the force.  I do not think the actual numbers have increased very much.  The total strength in the year 1931-32&mdash;that is the year this Government came into office &mdash;was 6,873.  In 1939-40 the total strength was 7,122.  There is not a big difference there.</P>

In regard to the Dodge cars, they were believed to be a better <Col N="1949" /> car which would give longer service. I do not want to be drawn into a comparison between the Ford car and the Dodge car.  Of course the Dodge car is a dearer car, but the belief was that it would last longer and give better service.  They are a very steady car. I certainly say they are very steady on the road, but I do not want to be drawn into a comparison.  I have given the reason, and that is all I can say about it.  They are a more costly car, but I do not think that they work out more costly in the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>An additional sum of £11,421 is required to meet expenditure out of the Vote for National Health Insurance for the current financial year.  The principal item in the Estimate before you is the sum of £12,000 in respect of State Grant on expenditure on benefits and their administration.  This is accounted for in the main by the fact that the National Health Insurance Society has in the current financial year paid <Col N="1951" /> from its Administration Account about £38,000 more than was expected in respect of interest on and repayment of the loans which it obtained, at the time the societies were unified, to meet the payment of compensation to ex-officials of the old societies and to pay for the erection of its headquarters offices.</P>
      <P>Under Section 24 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, two-ninths of the amounts paid by the society in respect of interest on and repayment of these loans is provided by the Exchequer.  Accordingly, provision has to be made in the current financial year for additional State grant under this head amounting to two-ninths of £38,000, or about £8,443.  If this amount is deducted from the sum of £12,000 shown in the Estimate it leaves a sum of £3,557.  The expenditure on benefits in the current financial year by the National Health Insurance Society has been higher than was provided for in the original Estimate, and it is expected that the foregoing amount of £3,557 will be required to meet the State Grant on the additional expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining item of additional expenditure in the Estimate is small. A sum of £295 will be paid to 29 assistant inspectors for providing rooms for official purposes in their private residences.  This amount is included in the Supplementary Estimate, as it was not provided for in the original Estimate, the decision to grant the allowance having been made since that Estimate was before Dáil Éireann. The two items of additional expenditure which have been dealt with amount to £12,295, to which has to be added a sum of £1,700, representing a short-fall in receipts to the Vote.  The salaries of the staff engaged on work in connection with the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts are recouped to the Vote by the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund.  Owing to changes in personnel and vacancies the salaries falling to be recouped in the current financial year will be some £1,700 less than the amount for which credit was taken in the original <Col N="1952" /> Estimate.  There is thus a total sum of £13,995 to be provided, against which there is a set-off of £2,574, which is the amount expected to be saved in the current year in respect of salaries, etc. The explanation of the saving is the same as that of the shortage in appropriations-in-aid, namely, changes in personnel and vacancies remaining unfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get some information from the Parliamentary Secretary as to what are his proposals for dealing with what I can only describe as the very unsatisfactory position of national health insurance legislation in this country.  The Department has had presented to it from time to time over the past 15 years various reports on the valuation of the individual national health insurance societies, and recently the Department had presented to it the report of the Actuary on the unified national health insurance society.  The publication of that report is usually accompanied by rather sensational Press headings indicating an alarming increase in the amount of sickness benefit and an alarming increase in the amount of disablement benefit to men and women and an effort is made by a thoughtless examination of the position to create the impression that the national health insurance society is in a very bad way financially.  Of course, anybody who takes the trouble to examine the real position of national health insurance in this country will know that probably the position of the national health insurance society in this country is stronger than in any European country at the present time. In this country the basis of valuation of the unified national health society and of the 65 separate societies which preceded it was the British method of valuation.  That method of valuation provided for the contingency that you had to be sure you had a sum of money on reserve to meet the claims of the last man who would be alive in the national health insurance society.  In the circumstances in Britain that was probably an understandable arrangement because in Britain you had hundreds of individual national health <Col N="1953" /> insurance societies each of them competing for members among the insured population.  A society might have 2,000 members, and after a given date no other person might join that society; the members might flow to all the other societies; the particular society might be left with 2,000 members, and in this circumstance it had to budget for the possibility that there would be last man in that society or a last dozen men.  Therefore, they had to have some actuarial reserves against that person or persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole position has entirely changed in respect of this country. Here you have not the hundreds of societies you have in Britain.  You have not even the 65 societies which preceded the amalgamation.  You have one society, one society only, and legislation which compels the insured population to be members of that society.  Therefore, there is not in our circumstances the need to provide for the last man, that theoretical factor which is a characteristic of valuations based on standards of that kind.  Since our legislation here compels the insured population to join this particular society, so long as the race lives and the legislation lasts, there is never going to be a last man in that particular society.  There is always going to be a flowing in of members, even if on the other hand there is going to be a flowing out of members.  The contingency of the last man is completely eradicated now by the system of having one National Health Insurance Society in this country.  Notwithstanding the fact that the circumstances here are different, we are still maintaining a British basis of valuation, in fact, a basis of valuation which very few people in this country understand, and still fewer can explain.  That system of valuation which exists today is standing definitely in the way of any improvement in the scales of benefits for members of the National Health Insurance Society.  It is a fallacy to say that the society is in any financial difficulties.  Its assets amount to, I think, about £4,500,000.  It is probably one of the very few organisations that has £4,500,000 to its credit to-day.  In addition to that, it is putting aside each year about £250,000. <Col N="1954" /> How a society with that annual surplus and with such substantial reserves can be in financial difficulties passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>If we look at the basis on which National Health Insurance is financed in other countries, we can see the enormous difference between the position in these countries and here.  In certain Continental countries where the scheme of National Health Insurance is very much better than ours, where the benefits are higher than ours, and where the scheme of treatment for sick insured persons is something that we have never yet dreamed of, the basis on which the society is financed affords a striking object lesson to us.</P>

      <P>The best of them, from the standpoint of national health insurance legislation, is Yugo-Slavia, a country with a population of 14,000,000. Take even the former Czechoslovakia, where national health insurance legislation reached a high scale, or take even Germany or Italy.  In fact, take the generality of continental countries where there is a decent standard of insurance legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Italian standard would not attract me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not offered that as my test case at all.  I have offered Yugo-Slavia.  The YugoSlavian standard is something that we are very far short of and officials who have gone out from this country to examine the conditions in Yugo-Slavia have been amazed at the advance there and appalled at how far we are behind them.  In these countries they regard about nine months' revenue from the sale of insurance stamps as providing an adequate reserve against claims for benefits but in this country today we have not nine months' reserve of premium income but about seven years' reserve of premium income. While the other societies, in Czechoslovakia or Yugo-Slavia, for instance, regard themselves as thriving on reserves of nine months' premium income, here in this country, with <Col N="1955" /> about seven years' reserve we get reports that the society is in a very dangerous financial position.</P>
      <P>I do not want to pose as one who sees either a royal or republican road out of this difficult question of national health insurance in this country but I do suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the time has arrived when, with the experience which we have obtained of the Unified National Health Insurance Society, the experience which it in turn has gained of claims by insured persons, and bearing in mind that we have departed radically from the circumstances which necessitated the existing methods of valuation, a committee of experts should be set up to examine the existing basis of valuation and to see whether it is not possible to make much less generous provision for the theoretical last man than is being made today.</P>
      <P>I am convinced from my examination of the matter that, without at all imperilling the structure of the National Health Insurance Society, without in any way endangering its solvency, by drawing on the experience of other countries and by adjusting the position to the altered circumstances here, not only could we maintain the Society in a very healthy financial position&mdash;and, above all, I want to see that done&mdash;but, in addition, we could make available for additional benefits the very substantial sum which is now held in the form of reserves. If we are not going to do that, and if we are going to continue the present method of valuation of the assets and liabilities of the Society, then we shall be faced with the alternative of a reduction in benefits or an increase in the rate of contributions, or both.</P>
      <P>I do not think either of these alternatives is necessary or desirable, if we alter the basis of valuation and if we adapt our scheme of valuation to the altered circumstances of this country, bearing in mind the fact that there is now no need to provide for the last man, a policy which has been the sole inspiration of those behind the existing valuation system.</P>

      <P>Since when has the Custom House grown too small to <Col N="1956" /> accommodate the Minister's staff? Since when has it become necessary to occupy the private residences of officials and to pay £295 for this accommodation? I think the leader of the Labour Party has gone very far afield in this discussion on National Health Insurance and I do not propose to follow him.  But some day, on an appropriate occasion, I should like him to tell me how it is going to benefit the members of the National Health Insurance Association to spend their reserves now and thus suffer a loss of income from the invested funds&mdash;which he wants them to spend now&mdash;for the remainder of the life of the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to have the Deputy's explanation in regard to it.  I know how exceedingly attractive such a proposition can be.  There is no co-operative creamery in the country which has not had to resist during its career the urgent representations of every shareholder to distribute reserves. That is a most attractive policy. It is always pointed out that the going is good, that everything in the garden is lovely and that it is foolish to provide for contingencies that may never arise.</P>
      <P>All these optimistic utterances are forgotten in the bankruptcy that invariably follows.  As sure as we plunder the funds of the National Health Insurance Society, for the benefit of the present generation, the day will certainly come when the State will have to come to their aid and accept as a direct liability&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Deputy that the committee of the society, the chairman of which is the Bishop of Clonfert, has been urging the Department to consider this whole matter, after expert examination of the matter themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from urging the society to distribute their reserves in increased benefits to the members now, <Col N="1957" /> I think they should be asked to consider very seriously whether it is not vitally necessary to supplement their reserves in some way in order to restore actuarial solvency to the fund. This is a very serious question, one which I need not deal with in all its details now.  I do think it right, however, to say that when you are dealing with a fund, which it is your purpose to keep actuarially solvent, you should realise that you are fishing in extremely troubled waters.  You are dealing with a problem entirely different from the problem of solvency as it is understood in an ordinary commercial undertaking, and we should not form an opinion on the appropriate measures to be taken without consultation with competent actuaries.</P>
      <P>I beg the House, particularly the members of the Labour Party, not to be carried away by generalities as to what is happening in Jugo-Slavia or Italy.  I do not know what is happening in Jugo-Slavia, but I do know that, as far as Italy is concerned, if the people of this country were asked to accept the standards of living of the people of Italy or of Italian peasants, they would get convulsions.  If we attempted, in the absence of the Italian sun, to impose on our people the standards of living of the Italian workman, I believe our people would die like flies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are advantages and disadvantages which flow from severing our connection with Britain.  One of the chief disadvantages is that we cut ourselves off from the high social standards which it was possible to attain in that highly industrialised country.  We elected to sever our union with Britain just at the moment when she was beginning to get socially-minded. We stayed in the Union while we got all the kicks, but the moment that Britain began to develop social services, as she had done enormously since the war, we cut the painter, and lost the benefit of these social services. We were quite right, of course, to sever the Union, but there is no use in closing our eyes to the fact that if we were still in the Union, our workers, so far as social services are concerned, <Col N="1958" /> would be very much better off than they are in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but by your indulgence, Sir, the Leader of the Labour Party went very far afield, and it is necessary to say something in answer to his representations, apart from what the Government may say. It is very easy to talk of distributing the funds, but decisions should not be taken on that matter without expert advice as to what the consequences will ultimately be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put this point to the House.  If there is any question of opposition to an Estimate of this kind, the Minister may say that anybody who opposes it is going to interfere with the payment of National Health Insurance benefit, but actually in this Estimate while there is the sum of only £3,557 provided for benefits, there is a sum of £8,443 being provided for administrative expenses, and £295. for office accommodation for officials in private houses.  If we are going to be faced in this House regularly, or irregularly, as has been happening, with additional Estimates of this nature, year after year, I say it is merely an attempt to raise the wind and to get over the difficulty of having to put all your cards on the table at the time of the proper Budget or the proper Estimate.  The reason the Government are asking for extra money is because things have not turned out as they expected, and administrative expenses are costing something more than they estimated in the original Estimate.  I say that is a shocking position, that in the last financial year we had a Budget as usual in April, then, when our neutrality started in September, we <Col N="1959" /> were presented with a Supplementary Budget, and now, within six weeks of the end of the financial year, we are presented with a series of Supplementary Estimates, while later we will have another Budget, all in the course of 12 months.  The real point is that like every other Estimate the Government has presented, no matter who they say is going to benefit, the net result will be, no matter how much is spent, that only those who administer it benefit.</P>
      <P>If we are going to continue to run riot with expenditure on administration, the Lord knows where we will end.  The Minister may explain that he requires this £8,443 because something which was not anticipated happened. I think there could not be a clearer case than that of bad bookkeeping. If Ministers at the beginning of the financial year cannot make up their minds what money they require to fund particular estimates except where there are exceptional circumstances, they should do without that money until the next Budget.  It is ridiculous, bad finance, and a bad principle for the country to be faced day after day with additional estimates, 75 per cent. of which practically goes on administration.  It would look as if the other items are only brought in as a side line to cover up the scandal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say more than that that is the likely explanation. Deputy Norton would like to hear the Minister's policy on a very big issue on this Supplementary Vote.  The Ministerial policy on that matter has not yet been determined.  Deputies who took part in the debate will appreciate that it is a very big question.  The actuaries' report of sickness benefit certainly indicates quite definitely that if the present actuarial basis is to be maintained, either benefits must be reduced or contributions must be increased. There is no doubt about that. The question must be examined, and it is being actively examined at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that there is no alternative, according to the actuary's report, but to increase contributions or lessen benefits.  Surely, one way would be to get the doctors to do their job, and not to mark people on the funds of the society that ought to be signed off, or let the society send down a referee to take off those who should not be on the fund.</P>

I think <Col N="1961" /> we may face up to the question definitely, either of changing the actuarial basis or having to increase contributions and reduce benefits.  That matter is being actively examined.  It may not be very long until the next Estimate is before the House, when I hope to be in a position to give an indication of definite policy in the matter.</P>

      <P>No.  Deputy Dillon raised a point regarding the provision of rooms for official purposes for assistant inspectors in their private houses.  Such provision was made in the past.  The reason for it is that these are outdoor men.  They are on the road all day and bring home files and confidential papers.  They write up their reports in their own homes.  It is felt and, I think, rightly, that they should have a room in their residences that would be a private room, in which they could lock up these confidential papers, and be able to carry out clerical work without interruption, or permitting anyone to have access to these papers except themselves.</P>

      <P>Why the number is 29 I cannot tell the Deputy.  My advisers tell me that 29 of the inspectors, out of the total number, require this particular allowance at the present time. Deputy Linehan made a good deal of play about this Supplementary Estimate and suggested that Supplementary Estimates were a cloak for inefficiency.  I suggest that this Supplementary Estimate is proof of the efficiency with which the unified society administers insurance affairs. Perhaps the Deputy did not catch my opening statement in which I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is accounted for in the main by the fact that the National Health Insurance Society has in the current financial year paid from its administration account about £38,000 more than was expected in respect of interest on and repayment of the loans which it obtained at the time the societies were unified&rdquo;...</P>
      <P>A grant of two-ninths had to be made under the Act by the Exchequer, and were it not for the fact that the society paid more than was expected for a building loan and a loan for compensation to retired officials, that particular part of the Supplementary Estimate would not be required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual sum asked for is £10, but, in reality, the figure we are asking for is £200 as a subscription to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  Deputies are aware that it has been customary for a number of years&mdash;probably since the setting-up of Parliament here&mdash;for a subscription to be given to the local branch of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and the amount of the subscription used to be an amount equivalent to the subscriptions provided by members of the union who are members of the Parliament here.  Some years ago, it was decided that the subscription was not sufficient to enable members to go on delegations and to the annual meetings in different capitals in Europe and, two years ago, the sum was raised to £100.  That was continued in 1938 and, last year, further representations were made to the effect that there were special reasons as to why the cost of sending a delegation was greater by reason of the distance to be travelled and the heavier hotel charges in Oslo.  After consultation between certain members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the then Minister for Finance the Minister agreed to give a maximum subscription of £200 in future, but that no further application was to be made for increased grants in future.  It is on that understanding that the Minister at the time agreed to raise the total maximum sum to £200, and it is proposed <Col N="1964" /> that this subscription should be given every year thereafter.</P>

      <Col N="1965" /> The main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide for bounties payable on unmanufactured tobacco grown in Éire and exported&mdash; sub-head B.  The total amount required for the purpose is £5,000, of which £3,000 will be met by savings on sub-head A.  When the original Estimate for 1939-40 was prepared in December, 1938, it was estimated that of a total quantity of 394,000 lbs. weight, approximately, of unmanufactured tobacco grown in Éire in the years 1934, 1935 and 1936, permitted to be exported, about 180,000 lbs. weight would be exported before 31st March, 1939, and, consequently, would rank for payment of compensation bounty in the financial year 1938-39.  Actually, only 59,000 lbs. weight of the tobacco in question was exported up to March, 1939, so that payment of compensation bounty on the balance of 121,000 lbs. weight became due in this financial year instead of last year, and the money provided in the previous year was carried over.</P>

    <P>The total sum now required is £850. On sub-head A the excess is mainly due to the creation of an additional post of chemical assistant and to an increase in the pay of four temporary chemists.  The above increases of staff and pay were agreed to in April last after a careful review, in consultation with the new State chemist, Dr. Wheeler.  Under sub-head B the additional provision is mainly required to meet the travelling expenses of (a) officers who are required to give evidence in police cases, and (b) the superintending chemist who has been appointed in the current financial year as alkali inspector of the cement factories under the Alkali Works Regulation Act, 1906.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £5,000 provided in this Supplementary Estimate is required to meet expenditure on the following items:&mdash;(a) an extra-statutory supplementary pension and supplement to additional allowance; (b) the gratuities and additional allowances provided in sub-head B of the Vote for <Col N="1970" /> officers retiring or dying, and for female officers on marriage.  The case in which it is proposed to make the extra-statutory award is that of a prison officer who was stationed in Northern Ireland at the change of Government.  He had applied to be transferred to the service of the Southern Government, and negotiations for his transfer were actually in progress when he was suddenly dismissed by the Northern Government in June, 1922.  The Government here were satisfied that he had been dismissed owing to his political sympathies and he was appointed a warder here in August, 1922, the then Minister for Finance deciding that he should be placed in the same position as if he had actually been serving in the South on the appointed day, i.e., as if he were a transferred officer with full pension rights in respect of his previous service.  The Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923 did not, however, give the necessary statutory authority for reckoning the previous service, and when the Superannuation Act, 1936, was passed, the necessity of obtaining a certificate for the warder under that Act within two years of its passing was overlooked.  Had the necessary certificate been obtained, there would have been statutory authority for the reckoning of the officer's service from its commencement in 1903, including the period between dismissal and reinstatement, as one continuous period of service for pension.</P>
    <P>In 1939, the officer in question retired on the ground of age.  It was then discovered that, although the officer himself relied on the undertaking given at the time of his reinstatement as entitling him to a pension on his total service since 1903, there was in fact no statutory authority to reckon for pension any service rendered prior to August, 1922, when he first took up service under this Government.  The exclusion of the previous service for pension would mean a very considerable loss to him, as without it he would receive a pension of only £41 13s. 4d. a year, together with a lump sum of £101 0s. 2d., whereas if it were included his pension would be £104 3s. 6d. a year, and his lump sum £292 12s. 3d.&mdash;<Col N="1971" /> a difference of £62 10s. 2d. a year, plus £191 12s. 1d. lump sum.  It was felt that it would be an inordinate hardship to deprive the officer of such a relatively large amount of money, and I have accordingly decided to seek the authority of the House to the grant to him of an extra-statutory supplement to pension and lump sum equivalent to the difference between the pension and lump sum which have actually been awarded to him under statute and the pension and lump sum which would have been awarded to him had the necessary certificate under the Superannuation Act, 1936, been issued in his favour.  The amount of £52 provided under sub-head A is in respect of the proportion of the annual supplement of £62 10s. 2d., payable from the date of the officer's retirement&mdash;3rd June, 1939, to 31st March next.  In future years the attention of the House will be drawn to this charge by a footnote in the Estimate, so long as the extra-statutory payment continues to be made.</P>
    <P>The sum of £191 12s. 1d. being the difference between the lump sum awarded to the officer and the lump sum which would have been awarded to him had his total service been reckonable under statute, is provided under sub-head B.  It has also been necessary to make further provision of £17,800 under this sub-head, as the original Estimate provision of £46,000 has proved inadequate to meet the charges arising in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>As the charges under this sub-head depend entirely on the incidence of deaths, marriages, and retirements, and are further subject to fluctuation according as these occur among the higher or lower ranks, it is very difficult to estimate exactly for the sub-head. In the present year the expenditure for the first nine months on these items had been higher than in the same period in any previous year, a situation which could not possibly have been forecast when the Estimate was being framed.</P>
    <P>The total supplementary provision required is £18,052, of which £13,052 can be supplied from savings on other subheads, <Col N="1972" /> leaving £5,000 as the net supplementary provision to meet the further sums which it is anticipated will come into charge in respect of subheads A and B up to the 31st March, 1940.</P>

      <P>Sub-head A seems to be a proper payment.  I have to congratulate the Minister on electing to come before the House by way of a Supplementary Estimate to regularise the proceeding rather than what some of his colleagues have done on previous occasions&mdash;stretched quite indecently the meaning of existing statutes to cover cases which they were never intended to cover.  I trust that the precedent here established will be rigidly followed in the future and, if it is, the Public Accounts Committee will be spared a good deal of trouble and annoyance and the Minister for Finance's conscience will be spared a good deal of elasticity in the future.</P>

    <P>The increase on this Vote has been dictated almost entirely by the additional costs incurred in purchasing stocks of paper in advance of normal requirements so as to provide additional reserves to meet the emergency period.  A general instruction was issued to all Departments early in the current financial year advising them to secure adequate supplies of raw material and necessities essential to the discharge of their functions.  Following on this instruction the Stationery Office expended £11,500 on the accumulation of stocks of paper.  The original Estimate was £43,000 for this service.  The revised Estimate will amount to £54,500.  A certain proportion of the £11,500, but a small one, is attributable to the higher costs of material acquired since last September. This material had to bear the increase in price which followed from the outbreak of the war, including increases in freight and insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know where these goods to the value of £17,000 were bought.  Is it all imported stuff?  When this Estimate was originally before the House I objected to these Gaeltacht goods being given a description which would suggest that they were completely Gaeltacht products, whereas the yarn from which they are made is in great part imported. I propose to continue to press that these goods be manufactured from wool that is washed, dyed and spun in <Col N="1979" /> the Gaeltacht.  I feel that, at present, there is a misdescription of these goods.  Moreover, if the work I suggest were done in the Gaeltacht, it would increase employment there and everybody knows that increased employment is required in the Gaeltacht. Huge grants have been given to erect factories for other purposes.  Some of these factories have already failed.  No money could be better spent than in erecting a factory for this purpose. That is, if the work is not done in the homes of the people.  I suggested some years ago that it should be done in the cottages but I was jeered at at that time.  That, however, does not affect me.  I shall not cease insisting that the entire work in the production of these articles be done in the Gaeltacht so that nobody will be able to say that the description applied to the goods is misleading in any way.</P>
      <P>That is essential from the point of view of the description of the goods, and, secondly, in regard to the giving of employment in the Gaeltacht.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he has any influence with the people who have the giving of grants for the erection of factories, he should endeavour to get some of the money to erect a factory for this purpose, so that the wool will be washed, dyed and spun in the Gaeltacht&mdash;either in the cottages or in the factory.  One would think that it should not be necessary to suggest that at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>You would substitute work in the cottages by work in the factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the work could be done in the people's own homes.  It was there it was done in the past.  That is the tradition but, unfortunately, in the past ten or 20 years, the cottage part of the industry has almost completely decayed, though in certain areas it does exist.  Now, we are concerned with a hand-woven product but, as will be seen from the details given by the Parliamentary <Col N="1980" /> Secretary, the yarn is imported washed, dyed and spun.  To that I strongly object, because it is a misrepresentation and because it is not effecting the purpose for which we are voting this money&mdash;the giving of employment in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that if he comes to this House and asks for a Vote of a sum of money to erect a factory for this purpose he will readily receive the sanction of the House.  He could have had that long ago so far as I am concerned.  People abroad are being paid for washing dyeing and spinning this yarn.  That requires immediate attention.  We vote this money to aid these areas and we never question the amount.  Any sum which the Parliamentary Secretary asks is granted.  The wool bought for the factory that I suggest should be of the highest quality so that yarns of the best quality would be produced and we would have in the finished article only one quality&mdash;the best.</P>
      <P>In another Estimate, we were asked to vote a large sum of money as an extra contribution to the World's Fair at New York.  That does not arise on this Estimate but I would be interested to hear what the results of the exhibit there were so far as this industry is concerned.  Was any progress made? Were there supplies of material for sale there or were there samples of these goods ready for handing out to visitors? Were any ladies' costumes and gentlemen's sporting suits, combined with plus-fours, for sale there?  Was there any expert tailor attached to this department in the World's Fair who would take the measurement of an important person or persons, make up a suit and present it to him or them as an advertisement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of business.  There are 120,000,000 people in the United States of America and I take it that at least 6,000,000 of them actively pursue sports of some kind or another.  There is a market for you there; somebody is catering for that market and getting it and why should we not get it?  We are prepared to give the Department any money that may be required for <Col N="1981" /> that purpose.  As a matter of fact, let me tell the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I should like to have a statement from him on this matter as I expect he already has a report about it&mdash;that there were certain people at the New York World's Fair and, in their opinion, the Irish part of it&mdash; that is to say, the handicraft and the sprigging, embroidery and tweed sections of it&mdash;was very poor.  They walked around there and there was nobody at all to show them anything.</P>
    <P>Now, the Tánaiste went out to America to open this stall or stand of ours, or whatever it is technically called, and on his arrival at Cork on the return journey he was interviewed by a number of Pressmen and made the startling statement&mdash;certainly, it was startling to me&mdash;when asked about the position of Irish industries in America, that he regretted to say that they were entirely unknown.  If that is true, it is a scandalous state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that we included all, because this is one of the principal things which we should have out there.  We should have a very extensive market for these things out there in America and I was amazed to read the statement of the Tánaiste to the Pressmen at Cork on his return.  I do not want to keep the House very long, but there is one other item in this Estimate which really makes one despair of this Department.  If the Deputies will look at it they will find that there is an estimated deficiency in the sale of kelp of £3,000.  Perhaps Deputies will observe that some two or three months ago a statement was issued by the Department to the Press offering £5 10s. a ton to kelp gatherers as an inducement to them to save kelp. Of course, the House may not appreciate&mdash;not knowing much about the matter&mdash;that what remained of the autumn kelp that came in on the beaches was half rotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another thing which bears on all the other Estimates to-night.  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is quite correct in his first sentence where he says that the Supplementary Estimate is required to <Col N="1983" /> meet the cost of increased purchases? We can take that as it stands, but looking down further you will find that it could be equally well described as the increased cost of purchases.  He explains further that it is required because things, apparently, are going quite well and up to expectations.  As regards the £17,000 under sub-head D (6), however, how much of that is accounted for by the fact that he is buying goods now that he will require or use or that he is putting into reserve, and could any of that money have been saved by the exercise of some intelligence on the part of the Department?</P>
      <P>They must have realised that there was going to be a European War, as everybody realised, for the last 12 months.  I do not want to press this matter unduly, but I want to know how much of this £17,000 is explained by the fact that the Department may have been careless and whether, if they had used a little business-sense and foresight, they could have put in these increased stocks or reserve stocks beforehand? If I thought for a moment that the Minister in charge of this Department did what, quite obviously, has been done by several other Ministers, and failed to realise what everybody knew for the past 12 months, that is, that we were going to have a European War sooner or later, and that he had let matters slide and as a result was now putting us into the position that we were handing out £17,000 to them, I would not give the Minister this Vote.</P>

      <P>Deputy Linehan has referred to this item under which £17,000 is required for the purchase of woollen yarn and other manufactured materials.  Well, I think it is a good omen to see this money required for this industry.  If <Col N="1984" /> Deputies Linehan and McMenamin were familiar with the subject of the Gaeltacht Industries they would know that, for the last six months at all events, these industries have experienced the busiest time that I can remember, and probably the busiest time since this branch of the Department was set up.

      <P>I think that steps are about to be taken to ensure that work in connection with the manufacture of yarns will be confined to the Gaeltacht. I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary has any definite information for us with regard to a proposal which, I understand, his Department has placed before the Department of Finance relating to the spinning and dyeing of yarns in the Gaeltacht.  If he has information on that subject I think he should give it to the House; he should let us know what progress has been made in that respect, or if any definite step is about to be taken.</P>

      <P>Deputy McMenamin, on the last occasion on which an Estimate from my Department was <Col N="1985" /> before the House, treated Deputies to a remarkable exhibition of cloth tearing. I wonder why he did not resume that to-day.  As Deputy Brian Brady pertinently remarked, there has been an increase in sales.  I am pleased to report that there has been a considerable increase in sales since Deputy McMenamin's effort to advertise our goods here in the Dáil, plus the advertisement which we got from the exhibits which we had at the New York World's Fair, and which Deputy McMenamin so adversely criticised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not criticise them adversely.  I merely gave the report of visitors, people who were there.  I was not in America and I was not at the World's Fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report that the sales have shown a remarkable increase.  That increase, to my mind, is due, first and foremost, to the activities of my predecessor in office, ex-Senator Connolly, who reorganised these industries and put them on a sound financial basis.  The good work he carried out while he was in charge of this Department is now bearing fruit.  These industries are now on a business basis and they are beginning to show signs of prosperity.  Employment is growing, sales are increasing and our difficulty, in existing circumstances, is to provide the necessary materials.  In reply to Deputy Linehan, I am happy to be able to point out that we did anticipate the war. Unlike the leaders of the Opposition, we were not blind to world circumstances. We did anticipate rising markets.</P>

      <P>We anticipated rising markets and we bought large quantities of goods; so much so, that in regard to some lines we had up to nine months' supply on hands when the war broke out.  We could not possibly have anticipated everything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a phenomenal increase in sales, and we could not possibly have estimated for everything. There was a tremendous increase in sales that we could not possibly have anticipated.  Nothing like it occurred in recent years; even when our predecessors were in office there was never such an increase indicated.  As I have stated, we did anticipate the war and we made purchases accordingly. We did not anticipate the increased sales which, I am pleased to report, took place during the last 12 months.  I should also like to point out that there is every prospect that the sales will continue to expand.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Brady and Deputy McMenamin about the use of Irish yarns, up to the present our difficulty is to get all Irish yarns.  If Deputy McMenamin wanted to know, he could easily find out what the situation is like from one of his colleagues; there was no occasion for him to pass his colleague from Donegal, Deputy McFadden.  Deputy McFadden could tell him that it is not possible to get all Irish yarns at the present time. I hope, however, that in the very near future we will be able to instal a spinning mill in the Gaeltacht so as to produce all our own yarns from Irish wool.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The yarns will be completely manufactured there, completed in every detail.  Once again I should like to point out that, despite the adverse criticism offered by Deputy McMenamin when he attacked this particular branch of the service, we are making considerable progress.  Deputy McMenamin represents the Gaeltacht; he represents an area which supplies a good portion of the materials which are used in the manufacture of Irish goods. I am surprised that any Deputy coming from the north-west should show such little interest in the development of Irish industries in his own locality as to single them out for attack rather than provide constructive, helpful criticism. Deputy McMenamin's contributions to the debate here have been anything <Col N="1987" /> but constructive, yet, despite his criticisms, I am glad to say that we are making progress.</P>
