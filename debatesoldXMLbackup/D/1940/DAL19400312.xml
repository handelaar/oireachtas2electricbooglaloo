      <P>As I informed the Deputy on the 8th November last this matter has been under consideration.  The Government's final decision upon it will depend on the financial position as it will reveal itself at the end of this month and when the Budget for the coming year is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not talking about last month, but about the present month.  There is a large amount of pigs at Waterford and in other seaport towns; is the Minister not aware that men have applied for licences and cannot get them?  Is he not also aware that the top price for pigs weighing nine score, in the British market, is 18/6 per score and that there has been a cut of 6d. a score on every 10 lbs. extra?  Is he aware that, with the cost of foodstuffs at present, pigs are &ldquo;white elephants.&rdquo;  Deputies may laugh at that, but they are not in the business, while I am.  The cost of foodstuffs is killing the pig industry altogether.  I am not asking the Minister to do any extreme thing; I only want what is fair to the country.  If you want to increase pig production, you will have to help the pig feeder.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he will state if a <Col N="532" /> colonel of the Army has been relieved of all military duty from the 29th February, 1940, and put on the half pay list as from 12th March, 1940; if this punishment is expressed to be to mark the Minister's dissatisfaction with the conduct of the said officer; if any military court of inquiry made any finding affecting the character or military reputation of the said officer; if under Defence Forces Regulations (A.5) (Courts of Inquiry, etc.), an officer is entitled to be present throughout any inquiry which affects or when it appears probable that such inquiry may affect the character or military reputation of such officer and to produce witnesses in defence of himself; if it is a fact that the officer in question was not afforded such opportunity of being present throughout the said inquiry or of producing any witness in his own defence; if the said officer was afforded any opportunity of making representations against the said punishment; if under the aforesaid Defence Forces Regulations an officer whose character or military reputation is in the opinion of the Minister affected by anything in the evidence before or in the report of a court of inquiry is entitled to a copy of the proceedings of the court, including any report made by the court; if the said officer has applied for the proceedings and findings of the said court, and has been given them subject to any conditions, and, if so, what these conditions are; and under what section, if any, of the Defence Forces Act or of any other Act the officer in question was relieved of duty and put on half pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the first two parts of the Deputy's question are in the affirmative.  The findings of the court of inquiry referred to are confidential, and I do not propose to disclose them. Under Defence Forces Regulations, an officer or soldier is entitled to be present throughout an inquiry which is likely to affect his character or military reputation.  In view of the urgent military situation created by the raid, and the large number of officers and men involved or likely to be involved in the inquiry, it was impracticable to <Col N="533" /> relieve them all from duty for attendance throughout the inquiry.  Furthermore, it was essential that the Government should get at the facts as early as possible; and I am satisfied that had the court adopted any other procedure the delay would have been such as would have created justifiable public concern and be highly prejudicial to the public service.  In view of this, no action has been taken by me on the findings of the court.  The action in this case is based solely on this officer's own evidence.</P>
      <P>This officer has, in fact, submitted a lengthy written defence which has been given due consideration.  This officer has no absolute right under regulations to a copy of the proceedings of the court of inquiry, but he has been issued gratis with a full copy thereof, with a reminder of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act as they affect the proceedings.  This officer was relieved of his duties and placed on the half-pay list under the terms of Section 20 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>20.&mdash;The Minister may place any officer of the forces on a half-pay list for a period not exceeding one year.</P>
      <P>Any officer who is not re-employed before the end of that period may at his own request be placed on the unattached list and await re-employment. An officer so placed on the unattached list shall cease to draw the pay and allowances of his rank, but if he be subsequently re-employed, his services on the unattached list may be reckoned to count as service in the forces on such conditions as may be prescribed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>From this Vote on Account of £10,000,000 one can see the total sum that would be necessary to enable the Government to carry out their expenses in the coming year.  I do not intend to travel over ground that has already been travelled by other speakers.  I should like to state, however, that it is the opinion of a great many people of this State that the cost of Government is very high at the moment.  We find that in the year 1931 the cost of Government of this country was something a little over £21,000,000, whereas to-day it is £30,511,359&mdash;roughly £10,000,000 increase during the past ten years.  I should like at the outset to state that the Minister for Finance can advance good reasons for portion of this increase. For instance, he could point to the fact that old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and <Col N="549" /> many other items here which are conferring a great benefit on the people as a whole, are responsible for £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 of that £10,000,000.</P>
      <P>We have employment schemes, grants by way of supplementary agricultural grants and so forth, which would account for another portion of the increase, but I do not think that the Minister would be just as happy in going through other items that are more or less responsible for this huge increase.  Principal amongst these &mdash; and here, perhaps, I should blame myself as well as other people&mdash;we have an increase of £20,000 in the expenditure on the Oireachtas, an increase in the Taoiseach's Department of over £4,000; and an increase in the amount for commissions and special inquiries of £2,000.  The last-mentioned increase may appear a small item to some people.  I suppose the country could afford it, if the people were convinced that the money was well spent, but I think the experience of the people of this country within the past few years, so far as commissions are concerned, has not been a very happy one.  In my opinion, the less commissions we have and the less money spent on setting them up, the better for the people as a whole.  We have an increase in the amount provided for Law Charges and a very big increase also in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture. I should like to state in connection with that Department, that the changes indicated are of a very violent character.  There is a difference of almost £300,000 in the two years' Votes.  Looking through the items, I tried to find a reason for this wide discrepancy.  Of course it was attributable to the old cause.  During these years the Government were in a very difficult position and they had to set up a great many new institutions. Although that development was of a temporary nature, nevertheless it was responsible for a very large amount of expenditure.  I suppose that is the explanation of why this Vote showed such a great variation during those years, particularly from 1934 to 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the year 1931, the Estimate for the Gárda Síochána was £1,630,000 and <Col N="550" /> for this year it is £1,924,000, an increase of over £300,000.  As one who always obeyed the law, I would say that if that expenditure were needed it could be justified but, in my humble opinion, it was not needed or should not have been needed, if conditions in this country were only normal.  I am not going to blame the Government wholly for that position but still I think they must accept part of the blame, for the reason that they have added very considerably to the numerical strength of that force without improving its efficiency or increasing the services rendered.  We had, I am glad to say, from the setting up of this State, a very efficient Gárda force when one considers their inexperience and the fact that that body had to be built up from the very foundation.  I think it is a body of which the people of the country might well be proud, but it is an extraordinary thing that, as the force became more highly efficient, it should be necessary to add the big increase indicated in this Vote and to add to the cost of the force, mainly by the addition of emergency forces.</P>
    <P>Again, in 1931, the Army cost is £1,249,000, while the Vote for the coming year reaches the huge total of £3,355,000, a difference of £2,000,000. That difference is rather significant, because it is approximately equal to the amount which this country was supposed to get back from the British Government by way of remission of the annuities.  It is strange if that sum instead of being an asset which could be utilised to reduce taxation by £2,000,000, is now being spent on the Army.  I should not like to go so far as to say that that was part of the agreement arrived at with Great Britain, but there is a suspicion held by many people in the country that while it is being spent ostensibly on the defence of this country, it is indirectly being spent to defend Britain as well.  If that be so, I would say that the time has arrived when an effort should be made to get something from Britain towards the defence of the country.  There is the suspicion to which I have referred.  In other words, the people down the country think that so far as neutrality is concerned <Col N="551" /> we are partaking of all the disadvantages without reaping any of the advantages.  On Secret Service, in 1931, we spent only £1,912, while to-day it is costing £20,000.  Again, simple people like myself, who always wish to obey the law, no matter what Government is in office, are wondering why it should be necessary to spend £20,000 on a service of this kind or why there should be this huge increase, representing 16 times the cost of the service in 1931.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in the course of the debate that this extra taxation was necessary, as a large part of it went to provide employment and that the money taken in increased taxation found its way back to the pockets of the people again.  There seems to be an idea prevailing amongst very considerable sections of the people that high taxation is not a matter to be deplored, provided the money is wisely and usefully spent, that high taxation is no harm if it confers a benefit on the people.  One of the benefits that it is suggested might be conferred on the people would be the solution of the unemployment question.  I think every Deputy must agree whether he sits on these benches, on the Labour Benches, or on the Government Benches, that not withstanding the fact that taxation has increased by millions, we seem to be as far away as ever from the solution of the unemployment problem.  I expressed my views on this matter ten or 11 years ago in this House.  I warned the Deputies of the present Government Party, who then sat on the Opposition Benches, and also Labour Deputies, that they would wait a very long time for the solution of that problem if they depended on the Government.  My experience, and I think it is the experience of any man who has given any thought to the question, is that the more the Government tries to solve this problem or to decrease unemployment, the more they increase it.  That is one fact that I should like to impress upon Deputies that every £1 you take by way of taxation, especially in a country like this, must come from some productive source.  It must be earned in the <Col N="552" /> country; that is, it comes from the industry of the people.  As with one £1, so with millions of pounds.  If you gather in £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 to the Exchequer and merely dole it out, it means that that £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 is again put in circulation, less administrative expenses.  You can get an example of that, not alone in this country, but in many other countries. Great Britain has tried the same thing in order to bring about a solution and she has failed.  In the United States of America the President some few years ago started with a great flourish of trumpets and spent hundreds of millions ostensibly to solve this problem.  To-day a solution is as far away as ever; there are just as many, if not more, unemployed in the United States to-day.  The position there would be a great deal worse were it not that the war is on.  That means that there is a great deal of work being given to the United States owing to the fact that it is a neutral country.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that high taxation is no great harm as long as the Government spends the money wisely and well.  But you must remember that apart from the high taxation that is imposed upon the people at the present time, they have to bear many hardships consequential on that high taxation. You have a high cost of living; food is costing more, and that is largely due to Government interference with the ordinary routine trade of the country.  I should like to impress upon Deputies the fact that there are great hardships being imposed on many of our people owing to the high cost of living.  I wonder does it ever occur to Deputies, who are in receipt of a salary of £480 a year, not taking into account the other ways and means that we have of adding to that salary, the great hardships that are imposed on tens of thousands of old age pensioners who to-day are receiving the same rate of pension as was in existence 20 or 30 years ago?  Those unfortunate people face this difference, that the prices of the necessaries of life at that time were much more reasonable than they are now.  I have especially in mind bread, butter, eggs, beef and the other commodities essential to the family budget. <Col N="553" /> To-day these commodities cost almost three times as much as they did 30 years ago.  Old age pensioners had their weekly allowance of 10/- when the loaf was only 2½d. or 3d.  To-day the same type of loaf costs them 5½d.  The pension of 10/- was of some value when the lb. of butter was only 8d. or 9d. To-day butter is costing 1/7.  Eggs that at one time were costing only 6d. or 7d. a dozen are to-day 1/4 or 1/5. There was a time when the old age pensioners could purchase their ounce of tobacco for 3d., but to-day the pensioners have to pay 1/-.  If one might be allowed to refer to the half glass of whiskey, there was a time when it could be purchased for 2d.  To-day the &ldquo;half-one&rdquo; costs 11d.</P>
    <P>This high cost of living is imposing great hardships on tens of thousands of workers who are paid low wages.  I would ask Deputies and those other people who are in a favourable position, who are lucky enough to have a good weekly income, to remember the plight of the tens of thousands of agricultural labourers who, with their wives and families, have to live on a weekly wage of 20/- or 30/- &mdash;the latter figure would be the maximum.  It is important to note that those wages are allowed only when the law so prescribes. If one will just contemplate those facts one will realise that there must be a big change in this country. The people as a whole must recognise that our country has limitations, that she is not possessed of the same resources as nations such as the British Empire or the United States.  The sooner we recognise that fact the better.  There is no purpose served by raking in money by means of high taxation, whether for the solution of the unemployment problem or anything else, unless we first recognise that this little country has definite limitations in what it can afford in the matter of giving employment.  The most important factor in connection with employment is continuity.  We should not pay so much attention to wages and conditions of employment, which are very important things in themselves; we should devote considerable thought to the most important aspect&mdash;continuity. If you pay a little attention to <Col N="554" /> that aspect of the situation it will make matters better for the people generally and easier for whatever Government is in power.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we should urge the Minister to do all he possibly can to reduce taxation.  If he succeeds in reducing taxation he will reduce the high cost of living.  In order to help him to achieve that object, I suggest that he should use his influence with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Supplies to do away with licences and quotas and the irritating delays that occur from time to time.  These things considerably affect people engaged in industry. It is a well-known fact that there are people engaged in industry who are in a position to get supplies from Great Britain and other countries, but they are not permitted to do so.  Only this week a case was brought to my notice where certain articles were required in a hurry.  The people concerned sent to Dublin and they made application to the contractors attached to the Local Government Central Purchasing Department.  The reply came that the Department was not in a position to supply the articles.  These people then went to Belfast and they had the articles the following day.  The cost was something like £23 and they had to pay duty to the extent of £8.  I suggest that is one way in which you can kill trade and industry and hold up work.</P>
    <P>There are many other cases that I could cite, especially with regard to fittings incidental to the building of houses.  As the Minister knows, owing to the high cost of building materials and the fact that the war is on, it will be very difficult to get the supplies we were accustomed to in normal times.  It is therefore more essential than ever that the Minister should place every facility in the way of those who are engaged in the building industry.  The boom that took place here in the building trade during the last six or eight years brought thousands of people into the industry.  While the boom lasted it was advantageous, but you must remember that it also had its disadvantages. Now that the boom has gone, there are thousands unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> There is another aspect that has its own importance.  Whilst the number of houses built under State aid increased, the number built through private enterprise decreased.  There are many people whose families have been engaged in the house-building industry for generations and their positions are seriously affected by the conditions now prevailing.  I make a special plea to the Minister to give particular attention to that aspect of the situation and, if it is at all possible, he should allow many of the articles incidental to house-building, especially sanitary fittings that are not manufactured here, to come in free and he should do away with all the licences and quotas.</P>
    <P>I desire to draw the attention of the House to another aspect of the injury that can be done by high taxation, especially on a section of our people who are engaged partly in agriculture. I refer to the class sometimes described as &ldquo;the old gentry&rdquo;, people living here possibly on the dividends they derive from investments made abroad. Many of these families were in the past fairly large employers, but it has been my experience that, as a result of this high taxation, they are beginning to reduce their staffs.  In fact, that they are doing so was forcibly brought to my notice last week when I was called upon by a young man who had a complaint to make about delay in the payment of unemployment assistance.  When questioned, he told me that for the past 15 years he had been in the employment of a large gentleman farmer in the County Louth. He was a most respectable young man, and it was quite evident that he would not be dismissed for neglect of duty. He had not a word of reproach for his employer.  It was not that he was too niggardly to pay the young man a few shillings a week of an increase.  He told me why he was let go.  What I want to impress on the House is this: that young men and others who are losing their employment, as he has lost his, in ones and twos and threes are not taken much notice of, but it is the twos and the threes that make up the fifties and the hundreds, the hundreds make up the thousands, and <Col N="556" /> when you take in the Twenty-Six Counties you soon arrive at the figure of 5,000 or 10,000 men, such as he, who have lost their employment through the same cause&mdash;high taxation.</P>
    <P>Suppose that a factory, employing 50 people, were in danger of closing down, we all know the big amount of attention it would receive in the newspapers. It would be referred to as a catastrophe, and the announcement would get big headlines and leaded type in the newspapers.  The Government and the country would be called upon to prevent such a thing happening, but when young men of the type that I have just alluded to lose their employment in ones and twos and threes, very little notice is taken of that.  When one takes into account the Twenty-Six Counties, one must come to the conclusion that high taxation has resulted in the disemployment of thousands.  That must be true, because despite the expenditure of millions extra during the last eight or nine years the fact remains that there are as many, if not more, unemployed to-day as in 1931.  I am not going to say that there are more, but certainly there are as many as in 1931.  Therefore, I suggest there must be something radically wrong, and, as I have already said, if any progress is to be made in the solution of this unemployment problem not only will the cooperation and good-will of all concerned be required, but a great many in this country must be men enough to come forward and be prepared to make certain sacrifices.  If that is not done it is only a waste of time for this or any other Government to introduce measures to attempt to cure the problem.  There is only the one way to make progress in dealing with it, and that is by all being prepared to do nationally what at times they are called upon to do in their own homes, and that is to take the necessary steps to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would impress on the Minister and the members of the Government the effect that high taxation is having on the country, and the urgent necessity there is of reducing it to a level that the country can bear.  I <Col N="557" /> hope that the Minister will give special attention to what I have said about housing.  The hope of men being able to get continuous employment in the building industry is not too rosy at the moment.  The only way in which normal building activity can be maintained is by enabling those engaged in the industry to get materials at prices that the industry can afford to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say that in my opinion Deputy Coburn's contribution to this debate was one that struck the right note.  I have listened to the debate on this Vote on Account, and I must say that Deputy Coburn's speech was the only one coming from the Opposition Benches that could be described as constructive.  The speeches from the Front Opposition Bench did not contain a single constructive idea. They were just an onslaught on the Fianna Fáil Administration, but nothing was said to show how, if they were in power, they would better the position. They seemed to forget all the time that they had ten years of office, and that the people gave their decision on how they, as the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration, acted during those ten years.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with some of the speeches made in this debate.  One of the most nonsensical, I think, that I heard came from a Deputy who, I suppose, may be described as a shadow Minister&mdash;Deputy Brennan.  He talked about the constitutional codology, as he called it, in which the Government of this country were, he said, engaged.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It cannot be denied that there has been a very big constitutional advance under the Fianna Fáil Administration.  One need only refer to the various measures in operation here since the passing of the Treaty which Fianna Fáil eliminated. We have also been guaranteed our neutrality in this war by Fianna Fáil. The money that has been asked for in this Vote on Account will be utilised to consolidate the constitutional position, as it exists to-day.  So far as I can gather, the main trend of this debate from the opposite side has been to attack the social services.  In these debates the social services are never named, but all the time one feels, listening to the Deputies opposite, that it is the social services that matter: that if the money that is being expended on the social services could be taken out of the way, then the Opposition would be perfectly happy.</P>

Deputy Dillon attacked every aspect of the Vote on Account and the policy of this Government during the last eight <Col N="559" /> years.  When he indicted the Government he forgot that four times in eight years the people had endorsed the policy of the Government, and would, I believe, endorse it again.  Deputy Dillon availed of the Vote on Account to attack the economic policy of Fianna Fáil.  I maintain that the policy Fianna Fáil has been pursuing is the policy of Arthur Griffith.

      <P>It is appropriate that the last speaker should have intervened in this debate.  He stood for election when a topic the discussion of which is forbidden to-day was uppermost and lost a bagful of votes, as well as I remember.  That particular Constitution did not do him any good.  I <Col N="560" /> understand that Deputies shuddered when they saw the Deputy's position and they did not know what was ahead or behind them.  If I might make one slight reference to the forbidden topic it would be to suggest that the Deputy should visit the camp on the Curragh which has been rapidly reconstructed for a lot of his ex-colleagues.  I think if he went down there he might hear remarks about the Constitution that would not please him.  The thing that strikes anyone about this is that right in the forefront we are faced with figures for two classes of Estimates, for last year and this year.  As far as the bulk figures go for this Estimate and the one discussed last year, there is a small increase of something under £250,000, and when the Minister comes to conclude, I hope he will be able to tell us whether this Estimate for 1940-41, with £30,500,000 put down as a bulk amount on the cover, really represents actuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only interested in one item&mdash;the Army Vote&mdash;at page 327 where I find that the amount for warlike stores is £121,000, after certain deductions which do not matter.  We are told that in comparison, the figure for 1939-40 was £381,000.  When I turn to the page of the current year's Estimate, I find that warlike stores are given as £1,207,000. There appears to be a gap of £1,000,000. The Estimate this year tells us that the Estimate for the current year was something short of £400,000, but when we turn to the Estimate for 1939-40 that figure is nowhere to be found, and if that figure is simply taken out in order to delude the people, it is hardly fair treatment.  If it is taken out because the Ministry does not know whether they want something short of £1,000,000 for expenditure on warlike stores, that is a matter for further inquiry.  The first time we were introduced to this enormous sum for the defence of the country was when the Taoiseach was speaking in the debate on February, 1939, and there indicated that he was going to ask for £2,000,000 under two headings in connection with the defence of the country mainly against aircraft. That £2,000,000 was £207,000 last year, and this year the new sum of £170,000 is required.  We were told it was <Col N="561" /> not an actual Vote or re-Vote, but was only a token Vote, although the Minister had felt it necessary to ask for money for warlike stores that were required. What is the situation?  Was a mistake made of about £2,000,000? Was it that we were prepared to combine forces with England against everyone that attacked us or just because we wanted ammunition and still want it but cannot get it?  It is understandable that the prices of warlike stores have increased, and as there are so many people looking for warlike stores now in the only place that we can get them, which is England, we may be crushed out by competitors.  It may be. I am not suggesting this, but I understand a better solution has been discovered, and that is to put the buying and purchase of ammunition under the present Minister for Supplies in the hope that he will be as effective about it as he was about sugar, because then we will never have to spend any money on ammunition.</P>
    <P>There is also a suggestion which the Minister might take to heart&mdash;that if the present Minister for Supplies was in charge of the Magazine Fort it would be adequate because if raiders got in they would have nothing to get and there would be much more difficulty in getting through the red tape of the Civil Service than in getting through the sentries.  I suggest that the Estimate we have before us has to be compared not on the basis of £30,500,000 for the year we are entering on and the £31,250,000 last year, but with the £31,500,000.  Unless the Ministry will now confess that their ideas of an expenditure of £970,000 were nonsensical, unless they make that confession the people are really being deluded.  Whether it is £30,500,000 we have to subscribe this year or £31,500,000 does not matter a whole lot.  The comparison I would like to have is a comparison with the figures in the Estimate of 1931-32, where the figure for the expenditure of the State as far as these public services are concerned was less than £22,000,000.  Comparing that with the Book of Estimates here, there is an advance of £8,500,000.  I suggest that it is really an advance of £9,500,000 in <Col N="562" /> the demands put on the people. £9,500,000 is a hefty sum.  It is not all spent on social services or anything like it.  There is a vast amount of extravagance going on and a vast amount of diversion of the people's money into unprofitable channels.  If either the waste or the extravagance could be curtailed, there is sufficient money left for the provision of the social services that a Deputy like Deputy McCann wants to boast of.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann should beware about boasting too loudly of social services. There are many people listening to him, including certain clergymen who are reputed to be giving thought to this question of economics in the State, and of having expressed the view that social services are more a badge of inferiority and decay than anything else.  Why should it be a matter for boasting that this State is having to subscribe say £1,000,000 for unemployment insurance?  Surely the State would be much better off if there was no such requirement and if no money had to be spent on unemployment? The only thing one can say is that it is better to have that money supplied to those people if work cannot be found for them.  If nothing else can be done, and if people cannot make provision for themselves, then it is possibly right that there should be some joy taken in the fact that the annual amount of money which we can spare is so big.  These social services are not all on the credit side.  If we had an organisation of society on a proper basis in this country, it is possible and certainly probable, that a lot of the things in the nature of social services which are now talked about in these enthusiastic terms would be outside our ken.</P>
    <P>Despite the social services, despite the vast amount of expenditure that there is, I do not think that any Deputy can say that in his movement through this country he finds any feeling of joy, enthusiasm or brightness at present.  Deputy McCann referred to the people who were attracted to a particular movement by reading the writings of a certain leader of ours. There certainly was spirit and <Col N="563" /> enthusiasm in the country in those days.  But that spirit has departed. There is nothing at present but disillusion, a certain intention expressed on the part of people that they will kick over the traces, and a definite acceptance of disbelief in the value of institutions.  One hears the view everywhere that there is no good carrying on with the present system. There are too many people anxious to take that easy means and to say: &ldquo;Let us have a change of method and of system and the other changes will come.&rdquo;  If we have all these vast social services, if the people are being provided with houses, unemployment assistance, schemes for their betterment and a wise handling of their economics in agriculture and industry, if they are looking after the widows and orphans and everything else that has been pointed to, one would expect a lightness and gaiety in country life at present.  I suggest without any possibility of contradiction that that is not the case.  There is no Deputy, who is in touch with the country at all, who does not get impressed on him that the thing that is most apparent in the people's minds is despair.  They do not see any way out of the condition into which they have been got, and they see no hope from the continuance of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The trouble about that is that if one talks to these people to try and convince them by some sort of argument or reasoning that the picture need not be so blackly painted, that there is, in any event, a resilience in affairs here, and that there is in the background a reserve upon which we can draw and on which a better situation can be developed: when an attempt is made on these lines, one is faced with the fact that there are too many tests to the contrary.  I wonder how many people really can point to any item savouring of hope, of inducing any optimistic expectation when they survey this country and apply the ordinary tests by which the prosperity and good of a country are usually tested.  There is no doubt that, so far as the ordinary assets of the country are concerned in the sense of capital reserves, these for years past have been definitely and <Col N="564" /> steadily wasted.  The argument might be made&mdash;and it is a satisfactory argument&mdash;on that point that one can look with equanimity on foreign assets being brought home if these appear to be lucratively employed here.  There are other tests for that.  If it were simply bringing in a certain amount of money for the bridging of a certain gap which has occurred here, it might not be too bad if it were properly invested here.  Then there is another test, if the money were lucratively invested here there should be some improvement either in national production or in the matter of employment.  That can be surveyed now.</P>
    <P>The population of the country is falling.  Emigration had been always a danger to this country.  In the years following the foundation of the State it was recognised with joy that the annual drain through emigration was steadily lessening.  There came a point when it had stopped, and even where more people were coming back to the country than were leaving it yearly. But then the tide turned the other way. We found people were being attracted outside the shores of the country.  If you take it in periods of five years, there was a period up to 1931-2 when the situation was righting itself and there was a bigger influx than efflux from the country.  Then there was a five years' period in which they began to go again.  There was then the bad period in which the tide of emigration turned once more against the country with the added disadvantage that, instead of our people, as in the olden days, going to a country where they met their friends, where they were at home, though in an exile's home, and from which they sent subventions home, the people were going across the water, going to very little in the way of attractive employment, and they certainly were not going to employment which was such as to enable them to send home the amounts that used to come in here and which counted as a large item in the redressing of the adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the standard of living has been falling.  Two or three angles of view may be had on that. The best angle is that the cost of <Col N="565" /> everything in the country has been steadily mounting for five or seven years.  The costs of agriculture have gone up through the nonsensical schemes imposed on the country.  The costs on industry need only be mentioned. There is no question as to the costs of industrial production having increased.  The only matter that arises is just the exact point to which the increase has gone.  The cost of housing notoriously has increased.  Everything that counts in life has increased in the last four or five years.  That general increase in the price level has meant that the wages on which an unfortunate man is depending for sustenance for himself and his wife and family have not the purchasing power which they used to have.  The increase in the price level all round means that there is a decrease in the standard of living in the country, and it is notable that a decrease in the standard of living in any country, even a decrease beyond the level achieved in any country, which is easy of access, almost inevitably shows itself in a decrease in population. People will fly from a country with a low standard of living to places where there is a higher standard.  That has been the situation here.  In addition to that, we have reached a point that is most conspicuous in these Estimates, an increase in taxation and an increase in expenditure in this State. The matter to be determined is whether or not this money has been expended on social services.  That is a point which it is proper for this House to probe and to probe very fully in discussing the Estimates before us.  In going through these Estimates it will be possible to effect a detailed comparison with the present Estimates and the amounts charged against the people under the same headings in 1931-1932.  In order to get some clarity on that matter one has only to see the percentage of increase in the amounts under these headings.</P>
    <P>There was one point raised on Friday last, and I think the Minister might answer it now.  It is a bad sign of a country when a demand is made for moneys to be subscribed for State purposes and when the people refuse to subscribe these moneys.  When a Government looks for loans it is a bad <Col N="566" /> sign when they cannot get these loans from the people; that they can only get them by going to the banks and get them out of moneys put into the banks by the customers of these banks.  It is a bad sign when the people themselves are not anxious to subscribe.  When the banks subscribe moneys lodged in them by the people, they do not do so willingly.  On this point the Minister can tell us, if he cares, how much money did he get on the last flotation of bonds; what amount of that was taken up by the ordinary subscriber and what was the average subscription. The Minister can tell us what amount was really subscribed by the ordinary people and how much was taken up by underwriters.  If the Minister does go into these details let him tell us plainly and clearly how much of that money was subscribed by the people throughout the country, not including moneys put in by concerns completely or almost completely under Government control where the Government could induce subscriptions which the people concerned might not think it wise to make. In the case of other and previous loans it was easy to find out how the subscriptions to the loan went.  In the case of the last loan the Minister found himself in the awkward position that recourse had to be had to the underwriters.  It was the second time in the history of the country that that happened.</P>
    <P>We are in the mood of sacrifices still in this country.  At least we are in the mood in which the Minister demands sacrifices from us.  Since the Taoiseach came into office the cry for sacrifice has been heard in this country.  Sacrifice has been demanded for some purpose or other.  At one time it used to be sacrifice from the whole community in order to get the national advance towards sovereignty.  Then there was a little bit of a change.  The farmers were asked to make sacrifices.  They were told that when the annuities question was fought to a finish it was eventually going to result in something to their benefit.  At that time certain benefits were thrown benevolently before the industrialists.  Now the cry is new sacrifices.  Sacrifices are now beginning to be asked from the industrialists. They are asked to remember <Col N="567" /> that the agriculturists are the foundation of the whole communal life here; the industrialists are asked to remember all that was done for them in the past years.  They are now asked to play their part and to make sacrifices for the common good.  The sacrifices are real.  They have been imposed but we do not seem to be getting any further.  There was always the bait that the sacrifices were only to last for a little time and that eventually the people who made the sacrifice would benefit much more than they had suffered by the imposition of the sacrifice. They are still asked for sacrifices and the promise of benefit is still in the future.  Nobody except a small group of favoured people appear to be able to cash-in and gain on the sacrifices imposed on their fellows.  There was this small group who got the benefit of the waste and the extravagance.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of favouritism for the last five years.  There has been profiteering in this country on a bad scale for years past; there is no question of contradiction in this.  It is only a question of degree or difference. So bad has this profiteering become that at, I think, the last function which the industrialists of this country held here in Dublin, one found in the papers the next day that a speech was made welcoming that the period of soft and easy tariffs was over and also making the defence that even if there were a few black sheep in the industrialist group it was not fair to have them all tarnished with profiteering. One of the provocations of life in this country at the moment is that everything that the people have to sell is falling and everything the people have to buy has risen.  One is able to see groups of people with life made easy for them, and the means of securing profits and money made easy for them, so easy that the term &ldquo;profiteer&rdquo; is applied to them. Of that there is no longer any contradiction. It is only a question of arguing how far do the profits go and how numerous were the people who availed themselves of profiteering.  The Government themselves established amongst others two commissions.  One <Col N="568" /> of these dealt with the matter of bacon.  There was a report by that commission which indicated profiteering on a very large scale.  That profiteering was accompanied by a still further evil&mdash;that people of business repute who had been put into a position of trust had abused their public trust for the sake of private gain. When that sort of phrase in applied to anybody else it generally has reprecussions in the law courts.  All that has happened in this case is that these people have been held up to odium in the papers and here in the Dáil.  But they can chuckle over that when they can get away with £300,000 profits. The other commission reported on the price of wheat and flour.  The report of that commission is still before the Government.  They have taken no action on it.  Debate after debate has occurred in this connection and the answer of the Government no matter what was revealed by that report is that the position is satisfactory whereas the position has worsened since.  But the Government never denied they had this report.  They casually put forward here an ex-parte statement from the flour interests, but they have done nothing to place before the House figures that could be argued here.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann says that people are very concerned about housing and whether the policy of the present Government as shown in recent years would be abandoned if there was a change of Government.</P>
    <P>The first answer to Deputy McCann is that housing activity has been abandoned or, at least, partially suspended for the very good reason that it was found to be too expensive.  It seemed to me to be a matter requiring more comment than it has, so far, got that, at a recent conference in Dublin, the situation in a country we have often held up to us for admiration and as an example was examined in a paper which was read.  The situation in Portugal was brought under review by a lecturer, and amongst other things, it emerged that the leader of that country, when the country was as clamant for reforms as this country, decided that he would engineer no <Col N="569" /> reforms on this question of housing until such time as the people could earn sufficient money in wages to be able to pay the extra rents which would be demanded for the new houses. We have here, as a sort of sidelight, evidence given before a commission to the effect that people taken out of slum quarters and put into good areas on the outskirts of the city have been found to be creeping back in large numbers to their former slum dwellings because of the increased expenditure imposed upon them by the new houses with which they have been provided, mainly, at the public expense.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the St. Vincent de Paul Society of this city reported in a very gloomy way on the position in this connection.  They gave credit to the people engaged in this housing experiment but, while giving them praise, they said that there was a result which should have been foreseen because a similar result had shown itself when development of the same type was undertaken in England.  The end of the comment of the St. Vincent de Paul Society was that it was found that people who had been able to support themselves in bad-type dwellings and who had been able to pay the rents asked from them in the city, when transported to Crumlin and other places on the outskirts of the city had less to spend on food even in time of illness.  That was the reason why so many of them fled from their better dwellings in Crumlin and elsewhere back into the slum areas. Another searchlight was thrown on this matter in a lecture fortified by figures which have not been contradicted.  A test was made in a city in England, the situation in which is comparable with the situation here as regards this matter.  Statistics were prepared affecting the people while living in these slum areas and after they were removed to their new abodes as showing the impact of the new conditions on their health. The amazing result was shown by the figures that the mortality returns went up heavily when these people were transferred to better houses.  The increase was very heavy so far as the young people and the very old were concerned, but it was heavy <Col N="570" /> enough&mdash;18 per cent.&mdash;in the intermediate ages.  When the returns were analysed, it was found that the increased mortality turned on this&mdash;that these people could not spend as much as they had been able to spend on nutriment and were dying faster.  We have the same situation here, and we have the same situation&mdash;good intentions in the background and bad results &mdash;in regard to all these schemes for which the Ministry have dragged money from the people during the past half dozen years.</P>
    <P>There has been waste, and terrible waste, in regard to schemes that now are, confessedly, failures.  There has been an exchange of Ministers and Departments, and the occupations of most of these Ministers in recent months has been &ldquo;telling the tale&rdquo;, so to speak, on their predecessors, deriding the policy which went before, a turning of the back on the old-time policy and disavowal of most of what the predecessor in office had done.  We, on this side, have criticised things like the sugar-beet scheme, the artificial aid given to the growing of wheat, the amount of money expended on industrial alcohol factories and the ludicrous claims made and extravagant language used in connection with peat development.  So many foolish things were said that it is hardly worth while reminding the House of some of them, but we were told on one occasion by the Minister promulgating the peat device that peat would soon be the second biggest industry in the country &mdash;second only to agriculture.  Some years afterwards, we got a confession of failure in regard to one of these experiments&mdash;the Ticknevin bog&mdash;only to be met a few weeks ago with a demand for more money to carry on this particular blunder a few stages further.  When people talk of social services and the amount of money spent on social services, they ought to turn the other eye to the small resources of this country and to the way in which these have been dissipated during the last half dozen years.  We have glaring examples of cases in which money was paid away without any prospect of a return even from the beginning.  When an attempt <Col N="571" /> was made to substantiate the claim that there might be a return, it was made on figures that the expert brought in to advise had disproved before the experiment was put on foot.  Yet, the experiment had to go on&mdash;to our cost.</P>
    <P>There is one big test in all this matter.  It was dealt with by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon and I want briefly to refer to it.  Vast sums of money have been extracted from the people by the present Government.  It is, I think, an accepted fact that the assets we had invested abroad have diminished.  We had the excuse made that it is a good thing to bring home these assets and employ them at home. We were also told, in defence of the policy of extracting money from the people, that this money was circulated in the country and put to good use. If there is any truth in that defence, then there should be some sign of betterment in the country.  The sign everybody is looking for is improvement in respect of employment.  The test generally applied to the bettering or worsening of conditions here is: how are the figures for unemployment or, in contrast, what are the figures for employment?  Deputy Mulcahy subjected certain figures given us officially to a test and check with such a remarkable result that it is worth while calling attention to them again.  Deputies will know from their parliamentary experience that two sets of figures can be brought in, as a matter of investigation, in order to form a judgment on the question of the growth of employment in the country.  One set relates to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. The contributions to that fund are derived from people in occupations described as &ldquo;insurable&rdquo;.  The other set relates to the National Health Insurance Fund, where the contributors are not so limited.  The contributors to the National Health Insurance Fund cover comprehensively all the workers of a certain standard of employment. The Government have published a number of pamphlets, starting in a particular year and continuing since, under the head of &ldquo;The Trend of Employment and Unemployment in the Saorstát.&rdquo;  The first pamphlet was <Col N="572" /> published in 1935.  On page 29, this phrase occurs as justifying the use of these contribution-income figures as the test: &ldquo;While insurance funds are probably the most reliable indicators of the trend of employment in the aggregate, other statistics are available for analysing the trend in individual industries.&rdquo; Following from that, the &ldquo;other statistics&rdquo; are, to a small extent, gone into but the conclusion is drawn that the first statement is the important one &mdash;that the insurance funds are the most reliable indicators of the trend of employment in the aggregate.  The figure which is specially relied upon in this report published by the Government is the figure of the number of persons employed whole-time as derived from the national health insurance net contribution income.  Taking this test, which the Government themselves say is the most reliable indicator of the trend of employment in the aggregate, it is. possible to make a comparison with the years in which the Government believed that this country was being run into bankruptcy by the evil administration of their predecessors.</P>
    <P>The comparison that would fall to be made would be as between the period ending 1932 and the period since.  It is possible to make that comparison, and to get a certain picture from it. There are one or two things which have to be cleared away at the foundation of this matter before the comparison can be properly instituted.  So far as the National Health Fund itself is concerned, we can take, absolutely without any deduction, whatever is the increase in the fund for a certain period of five years and the increase for a certain period of eight years, and we can put these two periods in contrast. That shows that, as between 1926 and 1931, the number of people, that is, reducing the income to terms of people, in employment increased by 57,000. If you take, without any subtraction whatever to allow for complicating factors, the figure for the period 1931-39, an eight year period, there is shown an increase of 75,000 people.  Without any deduction for any complicating factors, that is what is revealed: that employment increased by 57,000 as between 1926 and 1931, a five-year <Col N="573" /> period, and by 75,000 between 1931 and 1939, an eight-year period.  The average over each of these periods is 11,400 people, who apparently went into employment in that period, each year showing that increase over the previous year.  In the other period, the average is 9,375 people.</P>
    <P>If those two figures, without any explanation, stand alone, there is something for which the Government have to make an answer: that, in a time in which it was said that this country was going into bankruptcy, when no attention was being paid to industry or agriculture, when there was no fostering by artificial devices, as we were told, and when, in fact, we were supposed to be bending all our efforts towards pleasing our ancient enemies, the British, nevertheless and despite the fact that we were not paying any attention to the maintenance of trade, commerce and industry, employment increased at the rate of 11,000 per annum; and that when this Government came in and had a longer period of over eight years in which to bend their efforts towards the artificial fostering of trade and industry, they could only achieve an increase in employment at the rate of 9,375 per annum.  If those figures stand alone, it shows a remarkable situation.</P>
    <P>Remember that the increase of 11,400 persons was brought about with less taxation, less on the Estimates in the way of these grand social services and less hardship everywhere, and in a period in which the emigration problem was being solved and people were being induced to stay at home; while the increase of 9,375 came about in a period in which the people were having their money taken from them for distribution, as we are told, better by the Government than they could distribute it themselves, when people were beginning to fly away from the country and when the population was decreasing. there are two figures&mdash;11,400 persons per annum in the five year period, which was a period of approaching depression, and 9,375 persons in a period in which the world depression was certainly not as effective in relation to this country as <Col N="574" /> in the previous period, and in which the situation in Britain, which has an immediate reaction in this country, was improving, whereas in the previous five year period it had been disimproving.</P>
    <P>There are complicating factors which have to be attended to, and they come under three heads.  It is possible to put people into employment artificially. One of the artificial devices employed was vast expenditure of money on a housing programme.  People can be pushed into employment through vast expenditure on housing.  Whether anybody will ever live in those houses, or pay an adequate or economic rent for them, or whether the houses will ultimately fall to be a burden on the community is outside the present argument, but it is possible, taking the mere test of employment, to get people put into employment by vast expenditure on housing; and there was vast expenditure on housing in this eight year period as opposed to the previous five year period.  It is possible to give another stimulus by voting and expending very big sums on relief works and, in that way, there will be an artificial increase in employment, for which, of course, eventually in the way of added national debt or taxation, the people will pay.  Notwithstanding that, it is possible to get some artificial increase in employment by this means. In addition, there is the third matter, which has to be attended to in a comparison of these years.  It is possible still further to increase the artificiality of the employment.  In our time, we never thought of the device of making people work three or three and a half days, and having that counted as a full week, so far as the fund is concerned. That was left to our successors.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, right through this whole argument, there is the question of how far employment is continuous, but whether it is haphazard, casual, intermittent or continuous, it is very much the same, one year with the other, and the only thing which one has to take account of is whether a device is adopted which definitely increases the artificial or half-time nature of the employment.  These three factors are <Col N="575" /> a complication.  So far as one of them is concerned, Deputy General Mulcahy queried it very often with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  He got a reply which showed that over the year 1939, the average number of people employed on relief works, the average number of people put into artificial employment by the provision of relief money, was nearly 15,000, and it was stated that the average weekly spell of employment given to these people was between three and four days.  It emerges that people who were working only three or four days in the week were being counted in the fund as if they were working the whole week.  A certain deduction has to be made in order to correct that.</P>
    <P>Not to complicate the matter too much; the best way of making the deduction is to look at the amount of money expended on relief works in 1931 and the amount expended in 1939, and to find out what is the employment given by the increased expenditure in the latter period.  The same can be done with regard to housing.  One can easily find from statistical information the number of houses (a) built and (b) reconstructed, in 1931, and, similarly, the number of houses built or reconstructed in 1939.  There is the test which the Department of Local Government ordinarily apply to these houses.  They count one-and-a-half people per house per annum for building and a quarter of an individual per annum for reconstruction. We can get these factors and apply them to the increased money spent in order to get the artificial increase in employment as between 1931 and 1939, and similarly with regard to housing.  If these complicating factors are then dealt with and changes made in the figures, the result comes out that, from the 417,000 people who go into the Table shown on page 28 of this pamphlet, as representing approximately the number of persons employed whole-time in 1939, nearly 15,000 have to be deducted by reason of the increase through relief works, which brings the figure down to 402,000 people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> In regard to the housing figure, the question was asked and we were told that the yearly number of houses built pre-1932 was about 3,350.  The employment given on them was about 5,000. In 1939, taking the average over the years before that, the number of houses constructed was about 10,500, and the number reconstructed was very nearly 4,000.  On applying the test of multiplying by one-and-a-quarter for those two different items, we find there was artificial employment by reason of increased expenditure on housing to the extent of nearly 10,000 people.  If that is deducted from this figure of 417,000, one can get to the proper comparison, and the proper comparison is that there were 57,000 people put into employment in the five years between 1926 and 1931, or an average of 11,000 per annum, and in the eight years between 1931 and 1939 there were 50,486, or an average of 6,310.  Those figures are the result of calculations made in this pamphlet offered by the Government and the result of a Parliamentary Question which established that the absolute figure for employment in the year 1939 as based upon national health insurance contributions is 417,000.  The net result of it is that it is possible to find, in what is called a decaying period, employment increasing in five years by 57,000 people, and when those complicating factors are removed, in eight years under the present Government's supervision increasing by 50,000&mdash;as opposed to 57,000 in five years. Relate that back to the expenditure of money, relate it back to the decreased assets, relate it back to the argument that we have had about bringing back our assets and employing them lucratively at home, and ask if this money was brought back and employed lucratively at home would it not have shown better results from the point of view of employment than those figures given to Deputy Mulcahy and founded on official information actually show.</P>
    <P>The only thing that remains to be brought into the calculation is that matter to which I referred earlier; this country, as far as its economics are concerned, is affected by what happens <Col N="577" /> in Great Britain.  The period that I have taken for contrast is the period between 1926 and 1931, and the period from the end of 1931 to the year 1939. This country is definitely affected by business activity in Great Britain.  It is further affected by world activity, although the effect of world activity is lessened to a certain extent by the buffer that there is as between world depression generally and British activity, in its effects upon this country.</P>
    <P>In the period 1926 to 1931 there occurred the worst economic depression that history has known.  It was referred to by Deputy General Mulcahy in this House as having been described by the late Pope as a plague, the worst that had been known since the time of the Flood.  He referred to its general effects upon mankind, and described it as a scourage and a plague worse than anything known since the time of the Flood.  With that scourge and plague affecting England&mdash;and it did affect England, as shown by the ordinary figures for the business trend in England&mdash;and having its repercussions here, it was nevertheless possible to get, without any of those artificial aids, the employment I have spoken of, and it was possible in those circumstances to produce a result which called for favourable comment by the Economic Commission of the League of Nations, the report of which was published in the year 1931.  I remarked that there were two countries picked out as countries that had avoided the worst effects of the depression, that is Denmark and Ireland. That was because of the natural type of farming economy which the farmers of those countries had in their own best interests and in the interests of their countries chosen to employ.  Then the Government here swept in with its new ideas about how that natural economy was to be changed.  At the time that they did come in the depression had moved slightly down.  It was bad in 1931, and reached a low point towards the end of 1932.  By the end of 1932, business activity in England was higher than it had been in 1931, and by the end of 1933, or certainly by the end of 1933-4, it was as high as it <Col N="578" /> had been at the highest point for the previous five years.  It swung still further: the trend of employment was progressively upwards from 1935, 1936 and 1937, and although there was some decline in 1938, it never reached below the point it had come to in 1939.  One would require some method of illustrating this pictorially to get the full picture of that.  If it were possible here to get a curve drawn showing our decline over the years, and superimpose upon the curve of that decline a picture of the increased business activity in England, we would have the amazing spectacle that at a time when, prior to 1931, business activity was very badly on the decline in England, things were not shaken here to any great extent.  The figure in England then swung upwards to an amazing height, and never up to 1939 dropped below the highest point it had been at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year 1931, there were two countries which had been able to survive the world depression; two countries were picked out as having been able to survive the world depression, and the reason was <Col N="579" /> stated.  That condition has changed. We have got to face it.  The people here have been robbed.  The people's assets have been diminished.  The banks reported year after year that the small farmers in the country were eating into their capital reserves in order to sustain life, in order to build better farm buildings, or to put their money into stock or into the land.  We come to a period in which the war, iniquitous as it may be in other respects, may have given some chance of economic revival here if the people had any reserves, or if the Government, out of the vast moneys extracted from the people, could afford to give them anything to enable them to have some chance of meeting the present situation. The fact is, of course, that their reserves have been dissipated; the farmers have been weakened, individuals have been weakened, and the State has been similarly treated.</P>
      <P>Despite all that, we still have this definite fluctuation of opinion&mdash;first, the farmer being asked to make sacrifices to help the industrialist, and now, apparently, nothing better can be done than to ask the industrialist to turn back and make sacrifices in order to help the farmer, and we all know who is making good out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose there was ever a report which disclosed so blatant an example of profiteering&mdash;and reported so vigorously on it&mdash;or one which met with such definite disdain from the people who asked that particular commission to give a report, as that which the Prices Commission gave as a result of their investigation into the prices charged for wheaten flour.  The comment that the commission makes, on page 32 of that report, is one which should have set the Government scuttling around in order to find some way of saving the situation so far as flour is concerned.  There is some technical language used on page 32 of that report, but the result of it is this: at one time, in this country, the firm of Ranks, a firm very well known outside this country, bought the assets of a certain milling concern here&mdash;Goodbody's. What the price was we do not exactly <Col N="580" /> know, although there was a fair idea as to what it was.  The present Government came into power, after having criticised that particular bargain, which was an ordinary trade transaction. They criticised that transaction when they were in opposition, and if one could get any assurance from their election speeches, one assurance at least was that that particular thing would be handled by them when they got into power.  What has been the net result of their handling of that particular matter?  The result is that that firm owns more milling concerns here than before Fianna Fáil came into power.  How did they use their advantages when they came into power? This is what emerged later: that a company, Messrs. Ranks (Ireland), Limited, was floated, incorporating concerns previously capitalised at a lower aggregate figure, and off-floated on to the unsuspecting Irish public a minority holding.  At any rate, they certainly did not give the Irish shareholders control of Messrs. Ranks (Ireland), but held it themselves, and it is understood that they recouped themselves, if not for every penny, at least for nearly all of the money they spent.  They recouped themselves, if not to the full amount of the capital, at least to something near 100 per cent., on the acquisition of Goodbody's interest, and they control the whole milling concern known as Ranks (Ireland), Limited.  The report points out that their success in disposing of the shares offered to the Irish public for a sum of £533,750, despite the fact that effective control over the company was not transferred with such shares, must have been largely due to assurances contained in their prospectus.  This is the assurance that was contained in the prospectus:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount required annually to pay the dividend on the 350,000 6 per cent. cumulative preference shares is £21,000; on the basis of the average profits for the last three years the dividend on the said 6 per cent. cumulative preference shares is covered more than seven times, and on the same basis the amount available for dividend on the ordinary shares, subject to reserves, is over 38 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Now, that report has lain there ever since, and yet people who are beaten down with the weight of taxation, poor people who find that the purchasing power of their little moneys or their wages is not anything like what it used to be, are asked to believe that a Government is serious in its efforts to bring about an equalisation between the conditions of the rich and the poor in this country, when, in face of what I have indicated, and in face of such a report as that, that Government has allowed such things to take place. How can they ask people to make further sacrifices when the people see before their eyes what has taken place with regard to the bacon business as well as with regard to this particular business of wheaten flour to which I am now referring?  Anyone can see what is written here in this report.  I have given my description of what I read in the report, but here is what the report itself says, on page 32:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The recent flotation of Messrs. Ranks (Ireland), Ltd., is even more eloquent.  Concerns previously capitalised at a lower aggregate figure were incorporated in a new company with a nominal capital of £700,000 and it was possible for the promoters to make a successful flotation on the basis of a market value of £1,452,500. Their success in disposing of the shares offered to the Irish public for a sum of, presumably, £533,750, despite the fact that effective control over the company was not transferred with such shares, must have been largely due to the following assurances contained in their prospectus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there follows that boast, to which I have already referred, that on the basis of the average profits over the preceding three years the dividend on the 6 per cent. cumulative preference shares was covered more than seven times and that, on the same basis, the amount available for dividend on the ordinary shares, subject to reserves, was over 38 per cent.  If that is not an exposure of profiteering, I shall not see any better in my time.</P>
    <P>What activity follows?  In debate after debate here, the suggestion is <Col N="582" /> being repeatedly put up that the matter has got much worse since then and that the Irish public are being fleeced in connection with the price of flour, transmuted into the cost of the commodity, bread, and that the situation has gone from bad to worse.  In answer to that, the best we can get is the example of a Minister having to run, as he has run, to the special accountant that was sent over here in order to enable him to try to make some case on the figures and to enable him to make a better appearance and give a better showing for this firm; and the Minister evidently thinks he has done enough in simply reading out these figures, and then objecting on the point as to whether he got these figures for himself or whether he was briefed by the millers&mdash;the slight, apparently, being that he had got that report on profiteering and yet had done nothing to stop the profiteering.  Yet Deputies are asked after that to agree with the Government that still further sacrifices should be made.</P>
    <P>In connection with these Estimates, the discussion that we have at the moment has to be confined to general topics, but the Estimates are frightening. We have the Estimate for £30,500,000, but no doubt we will have Supplementary Estimates and so on, and I believe that that figure will be increased by £1,000,000 or £1,500,000, or even more.  Then there is this figure of about £900,000 for arms and ammunition, about which we are still in the dark.  As I say, at this particular moment we can only discuss general policy, but it is to be hoped&mdash;and as far as I am concerned, I certainly hope &mdash; that an attempt will be made, when these Estimates come up for discussion, to get a comparison for each Estimate under each head so as to show what was exacted from this country for such services as I have described in the year 1931-32 as compared with last year, and we will then be able to see how far those people, who believe that extra money should be spent on social services, can agree to that.  When we show the Government that, we hope an attempt will be made to reduce the heavy charges on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in connection with this Vote on Account.  I do not propose to follow Deputy McGilligan into the labyrinth of figures which he has presented to the House, as I know well that anything can be proved by figures.  I should prefer to depend on what I see happening around about me and to follow my own experience.  Deputy McGilligan drew a comparison between the amount of people put into employment for the five years ending in 1931 and for the seven years after the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government into power, and he tried to point out that the comparison was adverse to Fianna Fáil, but he excluded the number of people employed in house building and the number engaged in employment schemes; yet, in another breath, he admits that the Fianna Fáil Administration was responsible for putting 12,000 into employment in connection with housing and that they were responsible for putting 15,000 people into employment in connection with relief schemes.  That is 27,000.  If there had been a continuance of the Cumann na nGaedheal régime, when very little housing was carried out and very few minor employment schemes were in operation in the country, would not the position of unemployment have been very much worse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McGilligan when he says that the existence of unemployment in a country is not a badge of happiness; it is a thing very much to be deplored, and brings with it the necessity for legislation to cope with it, such as the Unemployment Assistance Act.  At any rate, it is much better to recognise and admit that the problem is there.  After all, if we are not able to provide work for these people&mdash;and at present we are not&mdash;it is our duty to provide maintenance for them.  Deputy McGilligan followed on the same lines as Deputy Dillon did the last day, when he criticised the flotation of the 4 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds.  They held that a good portion of that loan had to be underwritten.  I have no inside information from the banks as to what was done on that <Col N="584" /> occasion, but at least I have one thing to go on and it is good enough for me. I can go according to the present price of the loan, which is quoted in the market to-day at&mdash;and I am glad to be able to say it&mdash;2½ points above par.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will deal with that when he speaks.  I have pointed out that if Deputies opposite think it is a reflection on the credit of this country that a loan should be put on the market at a discount of one point under the 100, it is a very false viewpoint, since that loan to-day stands at 102½.  However, since Fianna Fáil Government came into power in 1932, we have heard about the economic ruin that the country is facing, and the bankruptcy that is staring it in the <Col N="585" /> face.  If we were nearly bankrupt then, it has taken us a long time to become completely bankrupt.  Those comments were made eight years ago.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy McGilligan when he says that there is despair and disillusionment in the country to-day.  There is no such thing; there is happiness, because of the fact that this country is neutral and that it is far removed from the theatre of war.  It was Deputy Coburn, I think, who said that the people of this country had to bear all the disadvantages of the war situation and did not get any of the advantages. Surely that is not the case, as the greatest advantage of all is to be living here comparatively well off and preserving our neutrality and carrying on business in the ordinary way.  I submit that that is the position to-day. Deputy McGilligan also referred to the standard of living; he said that it had been going down.  If he wants to convey that the cost of living has gone up, that is undoubtedly the case. Neither this Government nor any Government who would be in charge of this country to-day could have much control over those circumstances.  The only thing that can be done is to keep down profiteering.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said last week in the Dáil, the chief cause of the increase in the cost of living is the higher cost of freight and insurance on commodities that come from foreign ports.  Apropos of that, if we were to follow the advice of certain Deputies opposite in regard to the question of self-sufficiency, the situation would be ten times worse.  Were it not for the protection afforded certain industries and the encouragement people got to grow wheat and beet, the situation would be a lot worse, as we would be entirely dependent on outside sources for our supplies.  Deputy McGilligan referred to the standard of living, and said that it was falling; yet last week in the other House a certain prominent Senator said that the standard of living in this country was too high.</P>

Of course, what is meant by a high standard of living is a good system of social services.  And if we were to follow the advice of certain people in this House, when they ask us to reduce taxation at the present time, we would have to prune some of those social services.  That would be a great mistake.  I believe most of the money put into social services is kept in circulation, and that is beneficial to the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>I believe it is the duty of the Government at present, as far as possible, to help the agricultural community and I submit that that is being done.  Whether it is being done to the extent that many Deputies would like is another matter.  At any rate, I for one believe that any money which is put into agriculture at the present time is a very good national investment and that it will be more than repaid.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Agriculture proposes to put approximately one-third of £1,000,000 into the dairying industry in the coming year.  I hold that such a move is very wise.  We have heard a lot about wheat and beet, and of course, it is very necessary to encourage the production of these commodities because they are vital to the life of the nation, but I believe that, side by side with them, the dairying industry should get all the encouragement it is possible to give.</P>

      <P>We know that in Kerry and places like Kerry we cannot derive so much benefit from the growing of wheat and beet.  At the same time, we are happy to know that the beet and the wheat acreage is on the increase and we do not begrudge the farmers what they get in those counties where they can engage in those kinds of crops.  By way of conclusion, I say there is no foundation, in my opinion, for the assertion of Deputy McGilligan that there is nothing in this country but despair and disillusionment.  I believe that the people are happy at the present time.  We may not be as well off as we would like to be.  No people, of course, are as well off as they would like to be.  We have heard many complaints from people who champion the cause of the agricultural community.  I believe that times are improving for the agricultural community and I hope they will further improve.  I know the agriculturists of the country are not very well off nor have they ever been very well off.  I think anybody who has been reared among agricultural surroundings knows that the lot of the farmer was never an <Col N="588" /> enviable one from the point of view of riches but he is happy and independent, nevertheless.  He has always been hard set to make ends meet, in my recollection, and I believe that this is a time when people engaged in agricultural production should get all the encouragement and assistance it is possible to give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main question before the House in this Vote on Account is whether it taxes the people within their means or beyond their means.  Coming from a country district, I have no hesitation in saying that the country at the present time is in a bad way, that the people cannot see how they are going to obtain a means of existence.  The price of necessary commodities has increased 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. over what it was eight months ago.  Every article we are producing for export is controlled, with the result that the people do not know where they are.  They say that they are over-burdened with taxation both by the Government and by local authorities.  It has to be admitted that taxation has increased by roughly £11,000,000 over the taxation in 1930. In 1930 our tax Budget was roughly £20,000,000 while to-day it is over £30,000,000.  The ordinary county rates have been increased.  In the county that I come from the rate is double what it was in 1929 or 1930.  In those years the rate was somewhere between 8/and 8/6 in the £ whereas our rates this year are somewhere between 16/- and 17/-.  The question is, do the farmers get a return for this increase in rates? They say they do not.  There may be districts that get a certain income from this rate but there are certainly other areas that get no return.  The relief schemes do not apply to those areas simply because the farmers there may have a slightly higher valuation than the farmers in other areas.  Even though their families may be fairly big, none of these people is registered for relief schemes, with the result that they get no return for these high rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to the question of the supply of manures this season.  There is a compulsory tillage order for 900,000 acres of land.  Up to the 1st <Col N="589" /> March the proportion of manure manufactured in this country for distribution was on the basis of the production and supply of last year.  If there is going to be extra tillage in the country, where are we going to get the extra supplies of manure?  If we do not get the extra supplies of manure, I do not see how the extra tillage can be a success.  I was glad to see that the Minister has withdrawn this order in respect of imported manures, but when did he withdraw the order?  He withdrew it in March.  I certainly say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Supplies have failed in their duty to the farmers in not making provision for the supply of manures in October, November, or even in December.  If provision had been made then, or if arrangements had been made with the merchants, manures would have been purchased and imported at a price fully 30/- a ton under the price at which they can be imported to-day.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister for Supplies is also aware of the huge increase in the price of manures that took place on 1st January.  Take, for instance, superphosphates, which are very important in the production of crops.  Superphosphates advanced 17/6 a ton on 1st January.  There was an increase in the freightage.  The same thing applies to fertilisers, which advanced 13/- or 13/6 a ton.  The farmers to-day have to meet these increases in the cost.  In addition, there is difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies in the ordinary way to meet their requirements for this year's agricultural crops.</P>
    <P>If the Government had looked fully into this matter, and had made up their minds as to what they were going to do, I am safe in saying that business people in the country would have made provision for the importation of foreign manures during the month of November, or perhaps earlier, but certainly in December.  If that had been done it would have meant a saving of about 30/- a ton on certain classes of manure down to 15/ a ton on other classes. However, the order is coming now, but it is late in coming.  It is coming <Col N="590" /> when Spring is here, when it is possible that the business people and merchants and agents may not be able to obtain a supply of foreign manures for this year.</P>
    <P>Take livestock.  During the months of November, December, January and February, when the farmers went out to the fairs they found that it was impossible in most cases to sell their stock.  They could not sell them at any price because there was no demand for them.  They found that they could not convert them into money at any price, with the result that these farmers were seriously handicapped in the purchase of seeds and other commodities. Everybody knows the value of seed&mdash;such as seed oats&mdash;to farmers who have to purchase it.  There are certain counties in which the people are always seed buyers and not seed growers.  County Mayo is one of these counties.  At least 60 per cent. of the people have to buy seed in the Spring, so that one can realise how badly hit they were when they found they could not dispose of their stock.  Seed oats this year may fetch between 18/- and 20/- per cwt., and, on the average, it would cost a man about £3 per acre for seed alone.  Where are the poor farmers going to get that money?  Most of the registered unemployed in the various areas receive only 3/- per week unemployment assistance, even when they are eligible for it.  I do not see where they are going to get money to defray the cost of seeding their land. Where are they going to get money even to meet the cost of their ordinary household requisites&mdash;flour, tea, sugar and other commodities?</P>
    <P>Quite recently I made out a small calculation showing what it cost a household consisting of a man, his wife and five children in 1930 as compared with 1939 and 1940, for four staple commodities. Take the case of the head of such a household in an ordinary country town.  In 1930 his outlay for a fortnight on four items alone would be as follows&mdash;bag of flour, 10/-; 1½ lbs. of tea, 3/-; 14 lbs. of sugar, 2/6; 4 ozs. of tobacco, 2/4&mdash;a total of 17/10.  In 1939, before there was any war to inflate the cost of foodstuffs, his outlay on the same items for the same <Col N="591" /> quantities would be as follows&mdash;flour, 14/6; sugar, 3/4; tea, 3/-; tobacco, 3/4 &mdash;a total of £1 4s. 2d.  The only factors which could have contributed to that increase were legislation passed in this House and local legislation&mdash;legislation enacted by Deputies who come here to speak in the interests of these poor people.  The bag of flour alone, which the household I have mentioned required for a fortnight's maintenance, has increased between 1930 and 1939 by 4/6, and the poor man was compelled to find an additional 7/- approximately to meet the cost of these four items alone.  He had, of course, also to buy butter, meat, vegetables, clothes and many other things.  All these increases were directly or indirectly due to legislation passed by this House. Then we come to the war period. Taking the month of January of this year, the outlay of that household on the same quantities of the commodities I have given would be as follows &mdash; flour, £1; sugar, 6/8; tea, 4/6; tobacco, 3/8&mdash;a total of £1 14s. 10d. Yet the unfortunate head of that household may still be only in receipt of 3/- unemployment assistance, the same amount as he was receiving in 1930 when his outlay for a fortnight on those items was only 17/10.  Coming from an area where there are many people living under these circumstances, I cannot see how any Deputy could suggest that such people can enjoy life or live under conditions approaching even moderate comfort.  I believe the figures which I have given are accurate and that it would be very hard to contradict them.</P>
    <P>Take again the case of the small farmer living with his wife and five children on a holding of £5 or £6 valuation, which would be the average holding in the district from which I come.  In 1930 when that farmer went out to make his ordinary purchases for a fortnight, say, his outlay was as follows&mdash;one bag of flour, 10/-; one bag of meal, 12/-; one bag of bran, 6/-; 1 lb. of tea, 2/-; 1 stone of sugar, 2/6; 4 ozs. of tobacco, 2/4&mdash;a total of £1 14s. 10d.  These are commodities which he could not produce on his own farm and he is compelled to purchase them.  Coming to the year 1939, we <Col N="592" /> find that that farmer's income has decreased in many ways, owing to increased taxation and other causes.  Yet when that farmer went out to purchase the same quantities of the commodities I have mentioned, he found that he had to pay for flour 14/6, for meal £1 1s., for bran 9/-, for tea 2/6, for sugar 3/4, and for tobacco 3/4&mdash;a total of £2 13s. 8d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>For exactly the same quantities he paid £1 14s. 10d., so that there was an increase of over £1 in his fortnightly outlay on these commodities. Coming to 1940, we find that the increase in prices has been intensified still further, and I believe that we are only at the beginning of these increases in price.  Taking the same quantities as I have given in previous years, we find that that man's bag of flour in the month of February or in the present month costs him £1; the meal comes to £1 7s.; the bran costs 12/-; a pound of tea 3/-; a stone of sugar 5/9 to 6/-, and 4 ozs. of tobacco 3/4, making the total, roughly, £3 11s. That goes to show that in 1930 his fortnight's supply came to £1 14s. 10d.; in 1939 it reached £2 16s. 2d., and in 1940, £3 11s. 1d.  Every year the cost of living has been going up and his income has not been going up; it has been reducing year after year.  As regards the man with a wife and five children living in the country, I do not see how anybody can describe him as in a happy position, seeing that his income is reducing and his outlay is daily going up.  I do not think there can be happiness in such circumstances. There is bound to be something different to happiness as far as he is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have the same thing applying in the case of eggs.  The production of eggs in this country was at one time a very important factor.  Egg production is one of the things that many country families had to depend on.  That industry is decaying.  The production of eggs has declined, not merely by great hundreds but by thousands of great hundreds.  I asked <Col N="593" /> a question regarding the export of eggs in October, 1939, as compared with October, 1927.  My recollection is that there were between 150,000 great hundreds and 160,000 great hundreds of eggs less exported to England on a comparison of those years. If you assume their value at £1 a great hundred, that gives you a loss of between £150,000 and £160,000. That represents the reduced income of certain sections of our people.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of this matter is that the egg production in this country is confined more or less to five or six counties.  The main egg producing counties are Cork, Kerry, Monaghan, Leitrim, Mayo and Galway. If you take £150,000 to £160,000 away from the incomes of the egg producers in those counties, it will show you how serious the position is.  It is a grave consideration for the farmers and their wives, because their incomes go down proportionately.  On the subject of why people are going out of egg production, my opinion is that the meal mixture scheme was more or less responsible.  There was an increase in the price of Indian meal, and it went above the level when it could be economically purchased for the purpose of producing eggs.  To-day eggs are going a good price on the British market.  There is a shortage in the supply there, and we are not able to give a satisfactory supply.  Our supply is nothing like what it was in 1924 to 1926.</P>
    <P>With regard to pig production in this country, it has been declining gradually for the last 18 months.  The Minister replied to-day to a question regarding licences.  I have to complain about the granting of licences in my county.  Pig dealers there last February made application for licences but did not get them.  The pigs were left on the farmers' hands and could not be sold.  When they were sold eventually, it was at a greatly reduced price in comparison with what they were worth if licences were obtainable when the shippers asked for them.  The Minister said that licences were given to the exporters on the basis of the previous <Col N="594" /> year's exports.  I have been informed that in the South a number of old exporters got licences, and they had to return them because they had not the pigs to export.  The reverse is the case in my county.  The pigs were there, and they could not export them because they had not sufficient licences.  This applied principally to heavy pigs weighing from 16 to 17 stones.  These pigs were not within 10/- a cwt. of what pigs under that weight would be worth to the local factories.  The result was that the farmers were anxious to export the pigs because they would be worth more money in that way.  A few of the exporters got licences; one man got round about ten, and another man got something round the same number. Of what use was such a small number of licences in an area such as the one I come from, where pig production is carried on extensively?  I cannot say what happened the fat pigs in Mayo, but I know there was great inconvenience caused to the producers at the time I speak of, and that has not tended to encourage pig production.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to-day that licences were given on the basis of the exports during the previous year. If we accept that basis for my county, and if pig production increases, we will not get sufficient licences, and great numbers of pigs will be left on the hands of the producers.  This whole scheme is not working in accordance with the requirements of the people.  If there is a need for licences in certain areas where pig production is inclined to increase, there is no reason why the exporters should not get the licences; they are entitled to them.  On many occasions there is serious inconvenience so far as supplying the factories is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are times when the quota is filled and the factories cannot take any more pigs.  That may happen to be the time when the farmer has his pigs at the proper weight, but the factory turns him away and he has to wait until the factory gets a fresh quota.  When that time has arrived and he takes his pigs back to the factory, it may be found they are over the specified weight, and he has to take 10/- less for <Col N="595" /> each pig than he would have got if there was a market for them when the animals were ready.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious matter for the farmers.  They do not like being interfered with.  Every farmer has his own way of doing things.  There is scarcely a county or a parish in Éire in which you will not find farmers between £10 and £12 valuation doing things in different ways.  They have their own methods of working the farm and they say that their methods have been successful for years, and it is difficult to convince them that they can be changed.  I got a letter this morning from a man, and it does not bear out that idea of happiness that we hear is existing through the whole country. This farmer owes £23 3s. in rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to and read many of the speeches delivered on this Vote, particularly the speeches of the Minister.  I heard many figures quoted from both sides of the House, with the idea of trying to convince Deputies, and from them one would imagine that everybody in this country was happy.  We were told by the Minister for Supplies that if there was an increase in production unemployment would be reduced, taxation would be reduced, and many other desirable things done.  Realising that our wealth depends on annual production I am at a loss to understand the wisdom of the Government in reducing expenditure on agriculture by £297,000 and by £208,000 on the division of land.  I believe that if that money was given to farmers and cottage holders in areas removed from urban districts there would be a substantial increase in agricultural production and increased employment on the land.  We were told by the Minister for Supplies that unless there was increased production unemployment could not be solved.  I say that without increasing purchasing power, increased production is very little use. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that economic recovery can only come about when it is realised that increased purchasing power is a prerequisite to an extension in the agricultural and industrial fields.  That has been realised in other countries.  The production of the necessaries of life far outsteps growth of population and, as a result, we have thousands of men, women and children looking for bread and insufficiently clad.  Anybody who knows anything about modern methods of production in the different industries must admit that the output surpasses requirements.  A farmer told me last week that he got 12½ acres of ground ploughed, harrowed and the seed put in for £31 10s. 0d.  I maintain that when that is possible with modern scientific methods, we will have an unemployment question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> There has been much comment by some Deputies about the output in this country being far below that of Denmark.  I am convinced that the main reason for that is lack of capital amongst the farming community, rather than any unwillingness on the part of Irish farmers to work as hard as the Danes.  During his recent visit to Cork the Minister for Supplies told us that it did not matter what system of government or what system of banking we had, that it did not matter whether the means of production were controlled privately, publicly or cooperatively, as unless there was increased production and greater output in industry unemployment would remain. I am convinced that unemployment will continue as long as the Government does not control the banking system and the means of production.  I wonder have the people of this country considered how it is that we can run a Government, an Army, local councils, the post office, air services, roads, health services, hospitals and courts yet cannot run a banking system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. We were told by some of the back benchers in Fianna Fáil that the country is very happy and contented.  I am prepared to say from my experience that the opposite is the case.  I am afraid we are looking on unemployment as a regular feature of life.  We should face the fact that it cannot be looked on as a mere accident in the economic and industrial world.  It is one of the social and economic consequences of the power of production.  I tell Deputies that the people are not happy.  Anybody who travels through the country must admit that there is a feeling of depression amongst farmers and agricultural workers.  The people are depressed, and the standard of living is low.  They are poorly clad, poorly nourished, and there is an air of depression about their homes and farms.  We are not looking on the unemployment problem seriously.  I <Col N="599" /> notice in the Estimates that the amounts for unemployment assistance, national health insurance, unemployment schemes and public health services are reduced by £215,417 compared with last year.  Deputy Browne quoted some figures dealing with the necessaries of life, and in that connection there seems to be a great lack of understanding of the position of unemployed people, widows and orphans and old age pensioners.  The Deputy showed the contrast in prices in the past few years.  Having regard to the fact that we have 117,000 people unemployed, some of them with dependents, Deputies should take into consideration the fact that a man with a wife and four or five children gets a pittance of 24/- a week on which he is expected to live, and in the country districts he only gets 14/- a week.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that these are services that require an increase rather than a reduction in expenditure. I am sure that every Deputy has as much contact with old age pensioners and widows and orphans as I have and realises the plight of a widow with 5/- or 7/6 a week or an old age pensioner with 5/-, 7/6 or 10/- with the means test applied.  The position of these people is a very poor one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the farming community, I feel that the standard of living prevailing in the cities and some of the major towns is entirely out of proportion to what the farming community have to live on at present.  I think that there is no justification for the standard of living prevailing in the cities and towns to-day while we have agricultural workers and small farmers and their sons and daughters living on a small pittance.  There is no reason for surprise at these people fleeing from the land into the cities and towns or leaving the country.  I am rather surprised that there should be a reduction of £215,470 in the services I refer to. There are 2,500 persons in this country in receipt of a net annual income of £8,500,000 between them.  I want to say very definitely, and I think it is a matter that requires consideration <Col N="600" /> from everybody, that the standard of living of these people requires close investigation, and that it is on these people the burden should be laid rather than that we should have a reduction of expenditure on the services I have referred to.</P>
    <P>The condition of the more helpless section of the community and the low standard of living that exists, not only in the cities and towns but throughout rural Ireland, are a disgrace to any Christian and Catholic nation such as ours.  Perhaps I will be told by some gentleman in the Seanad that I am speaking as if I were preaching the cause of the Church.  I say that I am trying to get this House to carry out the social teachings of my Church and the terms of the Constitution, which we hear so much about.  I will go further and say that if religion cannot be expressed in the economic life of the nation and, if we are not going to practise it in the manner I am suggesting, then it is almost useless to talk about religion.  If Christianity is to be manifested in this House, in the field, in the factory, or in the workshop, then we must make the routine business of everyday life synchronise with the principles of it also.</P>
    <P>I want to say very seriously to the Minister and Deputies that it is not Christianity that should be scrapped but the sort of politics which does not square with its teachings or principles. I am satisfied that every Deputy is anxious to deal out justice to the unfortunate section of the community that I have referred to, but I am inclined to think that our sin is the sin of fear.  We are too much afraid of change.  I often think that if the men who sacrificed their lives and who made possible the establishment of this State had the same fear and the same timidity about change as we have in this House, we would never have the institutions which we have to-day, and I think our duty is to bring about a situation in this country which will put an end to the poverty and privation that are a disgrace to the nation. I am very much disappointed and rather surprised that the reduction in the Estimates should take place at the expense of agriculture and the poorer <Col N="601" /> section of the community to whom I have referred.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter.</P>

I certainly learned a good deal, but whether I am much the better of some of the things I learned, I am not too sure.  Judging by the sermon we have heard from Deputy Hickey, I am afraid that he is lost here altogether; he should be in another atmosphere trying to teach some of us who very badly need teaching, what Christian doctrines are.  I think he was sincere&mdash;I will give him credit for that much&mdash;when he said that he believes every Party in the House would desire to practise Christianity. I believe that is true.  My friend opposite (Deputy Cosgrave) would agree with the Deputy just as much as we would that we would all like to put it into practice as far as we can. But to say that any Party in this House, or all the Parties working with the best of good will together, would ever put an end to poverty and unemployment in the country, is expecting too much.

I am afraid I will be a long time with my toes up to the daisies before it will be realised.  But we would always like to work as well as we can with the resources we have in order to bring this as near to realisation as possible.  I think the Deputy must agree that in his own lifetime he has seen extraordinary social changes in this country.  He need not go so far back either.  In the last 25 years great changes have taken place here. Great changes have taken place all over the world, but here in our own country there have been very big social changes.  I remember when it was a heartrending and terrible sight to see so many dozens, not to say hundreds, of children walking the streets, going to school barefooted and ragged.</P>

I may not visit parts of the country that Deputy Hickey does, but in my part of the country I know that the men and women, the boys and girls are vastly better dressed and better fed than they were 25 years ago and very properly so.  I hope that will continue.  There is a demand, a very proper demand for better living and better social conditions all round. Nobody will deny that social conditions have improved considerably in the last 25 years.  That improvement need not stop and it will not stop.  But if we are to keep even the standard of living we have got here, without talking of an improved standard of living with the expenditure at the local and national rate we have here, we will have to work harder.  That is my belief founded on a knowledge and study of the figures of recent years.  The country should take note of that.  The country should realise that if this standard is to continue and grow at the rate it has been growing in recent times, we will not be able to keep the assets we have got. We will be eating into capital and the standard of living for everybody will go down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate opened with an interesting speech, so far as the Opposition is concerned, from Deputy Mulcahy.  He is a man who takes great pains to study statistics.  He evidently burns a good deal of the midnight oil.  We can judge that is so from the speeches he delivers here from time to time.  They are speeches with thought and hard work behind them.  A very big percentage of the Deputies of the House do not give half the work that Deputy Mulcahy gives to the digging up of statistics and the studying of reports and published statements.  I would like to say this, however, that he ought to stick to the figures as given in the book and not to try to cook them to suit himself.  Cooking them may be too strong a word. On Friday, I used the word &ldquo;faking&rdquo; in challenging Deputy Dillon.  Arranging them might, perhaps, be a <Col N="604" /> better word&mdash;arrangement and re-arrangement, turning them round and adding things into the published statistics that are not in them.  The statistics as published in our returns given here to the House are fair material on any side of the House for anybody to use in order to point or drive home an argument.  If the Government come out worse in the exchange of statistics as published, well then so much the worse for the Government.  But if we take the figures given by Deputy Mulcahy from the volumes as published I think the Government has nothing to fear.  If we take the figures as manipulated and arranged to suit himself, then he makes out an excellent case to suit himself and to suit his own arguments. It is proper and right to take one set of figures and compare them with an exactly similar set of figures, similarly arranged from the scientific statistics, sample them on a similar basis and compare one with the other. If we take and compare 1926, with 1932, or 1933, that is all right.  But you cannot take the figures for 1926 and say they are correct in the circumstances and take the figures for 1932, alter them and change them and then compare them with those for 1926.  All this debate for the last three days on the Vote on Account has been based on the arguments pointed and driven home on the basis of the figures provided for the House by Deputy Mulcahy who spoke first for the Opposition side.  Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Dillon and other Deputies referred to them.  For that reason I wish to make some remarks on the figures.  First of all Deputy Mulcahy gave us, on Friday, the average annual increase in employment for the five years 1926 to 1931 as 11,400.  He naturally selected the figures that best suited himself and his arguments.  If he took the figures for each of the years 1926 to 1931 up to the time his Government went out of office and took similarly the figures for a number of years, say the first five years after we came into office, it would show up better for this Government but that would not do.  He is quite entitled to use them provided he uses the figures that have been published and if they were published in <Col N="605" /> the latter period by this Government I do not think he would suggest that they were in any way not proper and reliable, any more than I would say that the figures in the Statistical Tables from 1926 to 1931, are not proper and reliable.  The figures for the five years 1926 to 1931 showed an average annual increase of 11,400 and for the five years from 1932 to 1937, the increase was an average annual one of 13,000.  That figure shows that there was an average of 13,000 in the first five years of our Government as compared with 11,400 in the last five years of the previous Government.</P>

      <P>No.  I have no objection at all to any of the figures published; but Deputy Mulcahy, in order to make out that there was very little increase in employment in the six, seven or eight years after we came into office, sets out to reduce these figures as given by the number that he himself computes for himself for the sake of his argument.  He says there was a lot of extra building done in these latter years.  He says there were thousands of people in employment in building, and he asks: &ldquo;Why should these be included?&rdquo;  Then he says: &ldquo;We will slice them off.&rdquo;  The Government should not claim credit for putting people into employment, &ldquo;because they were employed building houses&mdash;they were not employed at all.&rdquo;  Likewise, we are told, he took off so many thousands of other people in employment schemes.  He says: &ldquo;I am basing my figures in this argument on the figures of National Health Insurance and, if we take these figures, the people who are recorded as subscribing to National Health Insurance funds are put down under National Health Insurance whether they work one day or six days and, in this case, they worked three and a half days a week.  There fore, they are not entitled to be included in the figures&rdquo;&mdash;and he cuts these out.  He goes on to show that we have a rotten record as regards the giving of employment and he says that <Col N="606" /> the facts are altogether the other way to the way in which we represent them. Now, in the five year period before 1932, there were also people engaged in building schemes and relief schemes, and there were people who had not full time recorded although their numbers were included in the National Health Insurance statistics.</P>

      <P>The figures which the Deputy quoted of the numbers engaged in building, and of part-time employment, he made up for himself. He deducts those from the total of employment given here.  I shall stand on any of the published figures and, if we have a worse record than the Deputy's Government have, or if we have a bad record as against their good record, we shall take whatever is coming to us, but that is not the story that the figures tell.  The Deputy says that we should deduct the number of people engaged in building.  Many people were engaged in building in the five years on which he based his figures for the last Government.  Admittedly, more persons were engaged in building during the second period of five years for which he took figures.  Why should we not take the figures out of the <Col N="607" /> return for the first period of five years as well as out of the return for the second period?  Then you might be comparing like with like, but the Deputy was not doing that when he gave us those comparative figures.  If we omit the figures in respect of the building industry, why not omit the figures regarding persons engaged in the boot-making, the clothing or the hosiery industry.  Is it not as reasonable to leave out one set as it is to leave out another?</P>
      <P>Anybody on this side of the House is prepared to meet the Deputy on published figures.  If he questions the published figures, we can examine them.  The published figures show in respect of National Health Insurance &mdash; I do not think that the Deputy contests this&mdash;that the average annual increase in employment in the six years 1931-37 was 12,166.  I take the five-year period 1932-37, and I find that the figure is 13,000.  When dealing with statistics, you can, without dishonesty, take numbers and years and averages to suit yourself.  The old phrase is, &ldquo;Lies, damn lies, and statistics.&rdquo;  You can almost make black appear white by the way you place the figures on the chess-board. The Deputy is a good hand at that, and in saying that I do not impute dishonesty to him.  He arranges his figures to the best advantage.  In the period 1932-37, the average annual increase in employment was 13,000, but if I take the six-year period 1931-37, I get the figure 12,166.  If I took the period 1931-39, the figure would be worse for us.</P>

      <P>I shall do that.  I do not want to hide anything.  The figure is worse for us.  For 1931-39, the average annual increase was 9,375. There is no rigging, and no arranging of these figures.  I am giving the worst as well as the best years.  The census of production showed an average annual increase in the numbers employed in the five years 1926-31 of 1,614.  The average annual increase in the numbers employed in the seven years 1931-38 was 7,941.  That figure is in my favour.  If I took the period 1931-37, the comparison would not be so favourable.  Any Deputy can get these figures.  They are published, and any Deputy can arrange them in any order he wishes for the next speech he proposes to make on the Central Fund Bill or the Estimates.  He can make a good argument according to the way he uses his chessmen.  I am not complaining that Deputy Mulcahy used his chessmen to advantage, but I am complaining that he used figures which he compiled for himself.  Neither should Deputy Cosgrave, nor Deputy Dillon, nor Deputy McGilligan pin his faith to figures that cannot be found in any printed volume.  All of them have done that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We all make mistakes. In the National Health Insurance figures, people have always been included who could not be said to be in full-time employment&mdash;that is to say, who did not work every day of every week of the year.  Take the case of dock labourers.  They might work a couple of days a week, and they would have to contribute to the National Health Insurance Fund. They would be included in the total. Is it any more unreasonable to include people engaged on building or relief schemes?  Those engaged on relief schemes during the period of office of the last Government were, I <Col N="609" /> presume, included in these figures, but Deputy Mulcahy did not leave them out when compiling his figures for us.  He ought to compare like with like.  During the past three years, large numbers of those employed on relief schemes were employed only on three-and-a-half or four days, but it should not be forgotten that many others employed on relief schemes were employed for six days in the week.</P>
      <P>There is no way of finding out, without infinite trouble, the numbers who were only part-time employed.  It would be necessary to get every county surveyor and every assistant county surveyor to produce the figures.  They are not available.  There were people similarly employed on short time during the period of the last Government, but what I want to say is that, during the last three years, there were many more people employed on employment schemes and relief works than before the period of this Government; and if we propose to compare the figures for these years with some other period, it would be only fair to take a period which does compare.  The year 1935-36 would compare with the year 1937-38 or 1938-39 on that issue of relief schemes, but 1935-1939, during which there were large numbers of people employed on relief schemes, if we want to be fair, should not be compared with 1926-1931.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons which might be given also with regard to building. The figures I mentioned for the five-year period included the building people, but, during the last half of that year, 1937, in Dublin, where there are very many people employed in building, there was a strike which seriously interfered with the figures.  Were it not for that strike and the very large numbers disemployed in the building and allied trades, the figures would have been different.</P>

      <P>According to the Census of Production, the average number of persons in employment in 1926 was 102,515; in 1931, 110,588; and in 1937, 161,212.  The increase between 1926 and 1931 revealed in these figures was 8,073, or 1,615 per annum.  The increase between 1931 and 1937 was 50,624, or 8,437 per annum.</P>

The figures I have just quoted are round figures, which include those engaged in building, and, according to the Census of Industrial Production, the following are the figures of the average numbers engaged in those same years, exclusive of building construction and services such as employment on public works: in 1926, 57,768; in 1931, 62,608; and in 1937, 99,656.  The increase in employment revealed by these figures between 1926 and 1931 is 4,840, or a rate of 968 per annum.  The increase between 1931 and 1937 was 37,048 or 6,174 per annum.</P>

      <P>What I had to say with regard to the figures on employment mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues on the front bench opposite was that, thanks be to God, <Col N="612" /> there was a very considerable increase in employment during the last six or seven years&mdash;a very considerable increase.  I know that the House, and perhaps even Deputy Mulcahy himself and Deputy Cosgrave, would have been happier if that increase had been greater.  I give them credit for wishing to see people in employment, although it suits them to be able to throw bricks at us by showing that we have not achieved, during the last six or seven years, as much as we hoped to achieve.  The fact remains, however, that we did succeed in increasing the total number employed, as per the National Health Insurance figures, from 1926, when the total given there was 285,000 in round figures, to 417,000 in 1939.  That is a considerable increase.  Everybody would wish that it was more, but nobody can take away from these figures.  Nobody can deny that there was a very considerable improvement in the employment given here during those years.  On the unemployment insurance contribution figures the number given for 1926 is 161,000, and in 1939 it is 256,000&mdash;a considerable increase.</P>
      <P>No matter what way you like to take the figures, there has been a very considerable and creditable increase in employment and, generally speaking, in well paid employment, and we are not a bit inclined to bow our heads with shame.  No matter what Deputy Mulcahy may say as to what we had hoped to do and what we did not achieve&mdash;and certainly we did not realise all that we had hoped to achieve&mdash;none the less we have given employment to thousands of people who, we may take it, would not have got employment if the economic policy carried out by the last Government was continued during the period that we were in office.  These people would not have got the employment that they were given, I take it, and the reason that they got that employment was that this Government took a certain line of policy in order to endeavour to find employment for the many thousands of people who were unemployed.  For many thousands the Government, happily, did provide remunerative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> I agree with Deputy Mulcahy and, certainly, with Deputy Hickey, when they talk about the number unemployed to-day being something around 117,000 people.  I think that is the last figure I saw as to the number unemployed. That is a very big number, and it has jumped very rapidly.  The actual total number of unemployed on the live register on the 26th August last &mdash;that is, 1939&mdash;was 70,961; and on the 24th of last month&mdash;the last figure that I have&mdash;it was 117,394.  That is a very big jump, but there are reasons for that, and reasons for which the Government cannot be held responsible, although naturally, we have to bear the criticism, and rightly so, of those who ask why these people are not in employment.  I think that, in fairness, we are not to be held responsible for that very big and unusual jump in the total number of people unemployed, as exhibited in the figures between the 28th August, 1939, and the 24th February of this year.  Probably a large part of it is due to the war having put people out of employment here, since raw materials are so difficult or even impossible to get nowadays.  Even when you can get raw materials, they are very costly.  That, probably, is one of the reasons that a great many people have been thrown out of employment, and it is up to the Government &mdash; and it is a thing that we will have to face&mdash;to try to find some means of helping these people out in some way or other.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many men have been put out of employment in, let us say, the motor trade and allied trades, but probably there would be a good number.  It is very difficult to see how they can be put back in the kind of employment they were in before the war started, but it is the Government's responsibility&mdash;I do not deny that&mdash;to do all that it can to provide employment of some kind for these people and others who may be similarly situated.  As long as war-time conditions continue, however, difficulties will be there, and I can only hope that they will not grow.  I hope that the numbers on the unemployed list will not continue to increase. <Col N="614" /> I am happy that, first of all, the compulsory tillage scheme will enable employment to be found for a good many people&mdash;may be for many of those who have had to return from England where they were employed in remunerative employment which has now ceased so far as they are concerned.  We know that a good many of these people have returned here as a result of that.  I do not know exactly how many of these people there are, but I think it is in the region of 18,000 to 20,000.  There is a vast increase, for instance, in the acreage under beet this year.  I think that the total acreage applied for was something like 65,000 acres, and that is a very big increase on last year and the year before.  Through that and the other expansions in tillage that will be brought about by the order for compulsory tillage, I hope that many who are suited to that kind of employment will find employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to housing. That is a subject in which I am interested. Deputy McGilligan, late this afternoon, referred to a statement by Deputy McCann where the latter had said that he hoped the housing policy would not change.  Deputy McGilligan said that it was already changed.  Well, it has not changed.  The policy has not changed so far as we are concerned, and even though money is hard to get these times, so far as those areas where most housing is needed are concerned, and so far as a local authority that is most desirous to go ahead is concerned, there is no local authority that can say that they have applied for money in vain.</P>

      <P>No matter what it is that we want to buy these times, we have to pay through the nose for it, because prices have gone up and are going up and, as I said earlier in my opening remarks, there is grave danger that, if that rise continues, if the constant demand for increases in wages, in profits, in salaries, and expenses of all kinds continues, not only one class of the community, but all classes of us will have to tighten our belts and reduce our standard of living or else produce the necessary goods here in greater quantities and at cheaper costs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton, like Deputy Hickey, has been very much interested in high finance and in the control of our money.  I wish to repeat now what I said in the Seanad last week on this point: here in this country we can do as we wish regarding currency; in the Oireachtas we can arrange our currency as we please.  Let <Col N="616" /> me say that to Deputy Belton, for fear he may not have heard it when I spoke elsewhere.  This Oireachtas controls the question of currency&mdash;what it is tied to, if it is tied to any standard, and at what parity it stands.  We control it and we can alter it at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>I do not want to change one figure.  If they are against me, well and good, I will take the consequences.  Another remark made by Deputy Cosgrave was <Col N="617" /> on the subject of the annuities campaign: &ldquo;The Government are welcome to whatever credit they give themselves for stopping that lunacy.&rdquo;  The lunacy was our effort to hold our own money.  I think, if there were lunacy anywhere, the lunatics were those who paid away so many millions a year which they need not have paid, and which they tried to keep out of paying and did not succeed.  I am only dragging that in because of the remark made by Deputy Cosgrave. He ought to have had more sense at this hour of the day, and should not revive discussion of a period which does him and his Party no credit.  On the whole, Deputy Cosgrave's speech, based on the figures supplied by Deputy Mulcahy, was a reasonable speech, as was also Deputy Mulcahy's in general, bearing in mind what I said earlier about his arranging the figures to suit himself.  I used, perhaps, too strong a word on Friday when I said, &ldquo;faking the figures.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should use the figures supplied officially, and then we could argue on that basis. If we do, I think we will come creditably out of the discussion, so far as these figures of employment and unemployment are concerned.  Any Government which would do as well in the next five years as I hope we will continue to do need not bow its head in shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with one other remark made by Deputy Cosgrave, and again I am not sure if I have got him correctly.  He said: &ldquo;The man would be a poor administrator who could not take £4,000,000 off the cost of government.&rdquo; He was making fun of some of my colleagues who promised to take £2,000,000 off; they are charged with <Col N="618" /> having made the claim that they could reduce the then cost of government and give the same services at £2,000,000 less.  I have Deputy Cosgrave's remark here: &ldquo;The man would be a poor financier and a poor administrator who could not take £4,000,000 off that list, which has been increased year after year.&rdquo;  Deputy Cosgrave held up a paper in his hand when saying that, and I am not sure whether he meant to take £4,000,000 off the Vote on Account or off the total of the book of Estimates.  His statement is foolish enough as it is, to say he could take £4,000,000 off the total Estimate; but, if he meant to suggest that, without grave injury to the national services as a whole, £4,000,000 could be taken off a third of that&mdash;that is, off the Vote on Account&mdash;it is not in this institution he ought to be, but in one where he will be held in restraint.  Take the book of Estimates, amounting to a total sum of £30,511,000.  It is a very large sum of money and certainly, I quite admit that for any Minister, and for myself in particular, it is a &ldquo;facer&rdquo; how we are going to get all the money that is needed for these and the other services that are not included in the book of Estimates.  It is a very, very serious task, a serious problem. Deputies from all Parties in the House are clamouring for increases.  In this debate I listened to two Deputies, one from Mayo, the other day, denouncing the Land Commission, in vigorous terms, for its failure in dividing land. There has been more land divided each year, if you take an average over the last eight years, since this Government has been in office, than in three or four years during the period of office of the last Government.  I admit that Deputies on my own side are just as dissatisfied with regard to land division as was Deputy Nally who spoke here the other day.  It is a costly business this division of land.  We have divided many thousands of acres&mdash; some years we went into over 100,000 acres.  That is a very big amount of work.  The cost has increased.  While sitting here this afternoon I looked through the list of services and any Deputy can make out for himself how the cost of all these has increased from 1931-32 to 1940-41.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> May I say another word as a kind of correction to Deputies, particularly those on the Opposition?  When quoting these figures, several Deputies compared the figures of 1931-32 as given here, which are audited figures of expenditure, the figures of moneys actually expended and certified by the auditors, with the Estimates for the coming year.  That is not a fair comparison. Audited figures of expenditure ought to be compared with figures of expenditure, and estimated figures ought to be compared with estimated figures.  Is not that a fair request?  I do not think that anybody will deny that that is the fair way to compare figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect the actual expenditure to be less than the Estimate this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it always is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the whole thing, the expenditure nearly always is less than the Estimate.  That is a fact. It is sometimes less by as much as over £1,000,000.  Therefore, I say that when Deputies are criticising, if they want to make a fair case, they should compare the figures with the figures given for expenditure in another year, where they can get the expenditure figures, or else, say, that they are comparing not Estimates with Estimates, but expenditure figures as audited with a book of Estimates.  Then they will be fair to everybody.</P>
      <P>I was speaking of land.  Looking at that book there, and bearing in mind what I have said about comparing expenditure and audited figures with the book of Estimates&mdash;because so many Deputies followed this procedure&mdash;comparing 1931-32 with the present book of Estimates, there has been an increase of £969,000 in expenditure by the Land Commission.  That is a tremendous figure.  I wonder can we afford it? But there is a clamant demand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can afford to spend £1,000 per family on <Col N="620" /> families in County Meath and County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wonder whether we can or not.  It is a great deal of money, but Deputy Hughes should ask his colleague, Deputy Nally, what he wants done with the people in the congested areas.  He wants them taken from there, so that the people in the congested areas can get a decent holding.  What are we to do?  If we are to carry out Deputy Nally's policy, we must put them somewhere where they can get land.  That is the difficulty. There has been an increase of £969,000&mdash;nearly £1,000,000.  I do not say that good work has not been done.</P>
      <P>Good work has been done.  People have been taken out of the awful congested conditions that some of us at any rate do know still exist in County Mayo, and put into decent homes and holdings.  This Government has done a great deal of that work.  It used to be done by the Congested Districts Board.  We have done a lot.  It is very expensive work, but every Party &mdash;members of Deputy Mulcahy's Party &mdash;demand this just as much as Deputies on my side of the House.</P>
      <P>In that increase that is talked about so much&mdash;some Deputies put it at £9,000,000, £10,000,000, £11,000,000, and so on, there is an increase of £834,000 on old age pensions since 1931-32 up to the present estimated year.  We are proposing to spend in the coming year £834,000 on old age pensions more than was paid in 1931-32.  If I understood correctly what Deputy Hickey said, he claimed that we were reducing the social services.  We are not, not by one penny, but increasing them all round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is high.  There is an item in that book in this year, and has been there for the last two years, that was not there in 1931-32, which goes to make up the total of £9,000,000, as some Deputies quoted it. I refer to the item of £450,000 for Widows' and Orphans' pensions.  That is a large sum of money.  There is unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance&mdash;£1,134,000.  That was not in that book in 1931-32.  There is £1,344,000 more for employment schemes or relief schemes than was in that book in 1931-32.  That is a total of £3,762,000.  I take it that nobody in this House, on the Opposition side or anywhere else, will demand that these social services be reduced. I do not think anybody will.  I think the cry will be, even on the Opposition side, that if we can do anything to improve these services we should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to some of the speeches and the criticism here this afternoon, I took out items in this book where there were big increases.  Added together they make over £9,000,000.  They include increases on public works and buildings &mdash;£655,802.  That is an enormous sum of money.  A considerable proportion of that goes in building schools and in drainage.  Is that going to be stopped? Suppose to-morrow that Deputy Mulcahy were Minister for Education &mdash;it is very unlikely, but suppose it for the moment&mdash;does anybody think he would not give in to the clamours that would reach him from interested parties all over the country who want new schoolhouses built?  He would have to do it.  There are some schools here and there throughout the country &mdash;a very rapidly decreasing number, I am glad to say&mdash;that are insanitary and unhealthy.  The children should not be in them.  They are no credit to us.  Deputy Mulcahy or anybody else, or Deputy Cosgrave, who is so fond of referring to these increases here, is not <Col N="622" /> going to stop building schools or doing drainage work.  Everybody knows that the agricultural community are not half satisfied, or quarter satisfied with regard to the question of drainage. They want more drainage, big schemes of arterial drainage, carried out.  These cost huge sums of money, and the funny part of it is that, when the drainage is finished, experience has shown that the people whose lands have been drained are more dissatisfied than ever. Deputy Hughes can say if that is not so.</P>

      <P>They always object to paying whether it is a big scheme or a minor scheme.  Where land is drained and a certain charge is levied on a farmer's holding&mdash;perhaps not half as much as was expended upon it&mdash;I was going to mention what these farmers say, but even what I have heard said to myself would be unparliamentary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, but that does not stop the demand for further drainage schemes.  Every Deputy in this House knows that that is true.  Therefore, as I say, while the figure for public works and buildings, which includes the cost of drainage and many other things besides, has gone up by £655,000 from 1932, I do not know how Deputy Cosgrave is going to reduce it if he ever gets a chance&mdash;and I do not believe he will.

      <P>I am afraid not. The expenditure on agriculture has increased by £309,000, comparing the estimated <Col N="623" /> figure this year with the expenditure for 1931-32.  The figure suggests to me that the increase there is largely due to bounties.  The expenditure on bounties three or four years ago was very much higher.  It is now down to a comparatively small sum. The increase, as I say, is largely due to the bounty on butter.  I should like to hear what Deputy Bennett would say if any of the leaders of his Party were dealing with the matter and proposed to eliminate the bounty on butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>When the demand was made by the Commissioner to us for increased numbers of men, due to circumstances in recent months, of which all Deputies are aware, I know the Minister went into the matter with great care and did not authorise anything like the increase requested.  If Deputy Hickey, who I am sure is a man of law and order, were dealing with the matter, and if he were assured by those on whom certain responsibilities are placed, that certain additions were necessary, while he might not give in to the whole demand, at any rate he would have to grant a certain proportion, knowing that he would be held responsible if anything took place subsequently that might not have taken place if he had given the necessary protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure on Local Government and Public Health has increased by the enormous sum of £683,933. That is a very big figure.  That includes about £100,000&mdash;I think the <Col N="624" /> actual figure is £92,000&mdash;for free milk. Is that going to be dropped?  That scheme was introduced by this Government. The scheme also includes a sum of roughly £200,000 for housing grants.  Are they going to be dropped?  I think that anybody who suggested dropping these items from the Local Government Estimate would have a very hot time in this House. If it were attempted by the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave would have a very hot time, as I know the present Minister for Local Government, or I last year, would have a very hot time if either of us proposed dropping the housing grants, or dropping the £100,000 for free milk.  While I was in the Ministry of Local Government there were constant demands for housing grants and for increasing the amounts of these grants.  Deputy Hickey and other Deputies who spoke here in the House frequently said that sufficient money was not provided for these grants.  Every local authority in the country asked that the amounts provided for free milk should be increased by 50 or 100 per cent. We could not meet those demands, but nevertheless, although housing grants were not satisfactory, and the provision for free milk is not 50 per cent. of what some people would like to see it, the cost of the Department has gone up by £683,000.  In regard to public health schemes, grants of from 33 to 50 per cent. are given towards the cost of new waterworks and sewerage schemes.  Yet there is not a Deputy who has not gone to the Minister for Local Government asking for higher grants.  I do not know how that expenditure is going to be reduced.</P>

      <P>There are a few in this House that I should like to see less of.  Take the expenditure on education. On primary education there has been an increase of £167,911, on secondary education an increase of £135,000 and on technical education an increase of £139,000.  These are big increases, but I do not see how they are going to be reduced.  Deputy Hughes has reminded us that agricultural production will not permit us to carry the load.  We have got to examine our production, to examine our financial and economic position, to scrutinise it very carefully, because our position is not a very rosy one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>I wish it were, but we hear so many complaints that I do not think it has been.  I have already dealt with lands.  The Vote on forestry has gone up by £169,000, but there are a number of people in this House&mdash;I do not know whether there are many on Deputy Mulcahy's side, but I know there are some on our benches&mdash;who expressed themselves as not half satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no cupboard about forestry.  Everybody has heard Deputy Dowdall, and two or three other Deputies, scarifying the Minister for Lands and alleging that he is not doing quarter enough to plant this country with trees.  We hear that every day in the week; we read it in the Press; but the cost has gone up by £169,000, and I think it will grow. Gaeltacht services have gone up by £96,000.  If there is one item there I am particularly in sympathy with, it is that one, because if you remember the maps that were in the hall&mdash;I do not know whether they are there still, but a year or so ago the parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, put them up in the hall&mdash;showing the areas where unemployment was greatest, all the western seaboard looked very black and unpromising, and anything we can do to help the people there will not be even half enough.  We are now spending £96,000 more in an area where very little, if anything, was expended in 1931-32.  Export bounties this year amount to £339,000, and there is another big item connected with Army pensions.  That item shows an increase of £389,000 over 1931-32.  That is a very big figure.</P>

      <P>As I have said, £389,000 is a big sum.  Would any <Col N="627" /> Deputy suggest wiping it out?  It is there, and it will have to be met.  There was a good deal of talk about the Army, which shows an increase of £2,108,000 over 1931-32.  That is a very serious item, too, and it was not in any light-hearted way that the Government added, as it did add in the last year or so, a considerable amount to the Estimate for the Army.  It was not in a light-hearted way, or with any desire to throw away money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has repeated several times the warning that we are spending at a very rapid rate, and that we ought to reduce this expenditure.  I think the Deputy was most unreasonable in suggesting that there could be £4,000,000 taken off. Whether he meant the Book of Estimates or the Vote on Account I am not sure, but I hope for the sake of his own sanity he meant the Book of Estimates.  Taking the figures I have just read out, showing increases in the last eight years on social services amounting to £3,700,000 and other services amounting to £6,500,000, where are they going to be cut?  I tell you honestly that I wish I could cut some of them.  It would make my task easier, the task I have had since November, and the task I am going to have when I come to this House again at the end of April or the beginning of May with the Budget&mdash;it would make my task a much more pleasant one if I could reduce the expenses there by even half the figure Deputy Cosgrave suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> We will have plenty of opportunity in the next month or two, when we will be discussing these Estimates, of making helpful suggestions.  We will have financial matters under debate from all angles, and I certainly would be glad, and I would regard it as a helpful thing, if any Deputy from any side of the House would help me by showing where there could be a reduction in any of the services I have referred to, leaving out social services for, I take it, no one wants decreases there&mdash; though some of them have increased very considerably in recent years&mdash; services such as public works and buildings, agriculture, local government, education, whether primary, secondary or technical, lands and forests, export subsidies, army pensions and Gaeltacht services.  I should like to know how they could be reduced. As Minister for Finance, having the responsibility of ascertaining how the money is to be found, and coming to the Dáil with a Budget to find that money and to tax the already heavily-taxed people of this country, I would like to have suggestions, wherever they may come from and, if there are any made, I shall certainly examine them sympathetically&mdash;suggestions as to where pruning can be indulged in with advantage to the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to tell us, sometime at his leisure, what that is.  I would not attempt, even if I were to be permitted &mdash;and I do not think I would be permitted&mdash;to make revolutionary changes that might bring grave risk here, but any change within reason that can be shown to be for the betterment of this country and its people financially, economically and socially, I, and the Government, will gladly consider.  I know the Deputy is interested in certain social ideals and I do not think there are many in this House who are far apart from him, on any side.  It is <Col N="629" /> just a question of practicability.  If I am offered practical suggestions I shall be glad to consider them.</P>
      <P>We are in difficult times.  The war, and the state of emergency attending it, have altered things for us.  Even before the war our economy was such that we had difficulty in keeping the value of our pound up to the standard it was at.  We will have some greater difficulty in the times that are coming, especially if the increases I referred to earlier on all sides are demanded and must be met.  We shall have to take care, if the standard of living here is not to be depressed very much, that our expenses are measured in terms of our resources.  Our production will have to be very much improved if anything like the demands that are being made for increases all round are even to be considered, much less met.</P>
      <P>Following are the figures which I promised Deputy Mulcahy would appear in the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>STATEMENT showing for each of the 14 years from 1926 to 1939 the estimated average weekly numbers of persons employed in employment insurable under the National Health Insurance Acts; in employment insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts; and in employment in Agriculture, Private Domestic Service and other occupations insurable under the National Health Insurance Acts but not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>

    <P>&dagger;&dagger;The decrease in the figure for 1928 as compared with 1926 and 1927 is due to the fact that the Prolongation of Insurance Act expired in 1927.  Under this Act certain persons who neither worked nor surrendered National Health Insurance cards were regarded as insured persons.  From 1928 onwards such persons were not included as insured persons.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is usually, I think, the practice to treat this as a routine matter.  The Bill is required to implement the Ways and Means Resolutions which have just been passed, and to enable us to get the total amount of the items set out in the Vote on Account; also for the purpose of implementing the Resolutions providing for the Supplementary Estimate, which have already been agreed to.  It also gives power to borrow any sum that may be required during the period that this Bill will run.</P>

      <P>I think that the House should not agree to pass this measure until we get a little more evidence from the Minister and his colleagues that they appreciate the position put before them on the Vote on Account and until they show that they have a clearer realisation of the present situation than they seem to have had.  The Minister said that much of the discussion on the Vote on Account centred round some figures I made use of, and he characterised my figures as being rigged and arranged and put in a way that suited myself; that they were figures selected to suit my argument, and a number of remarks of that kind.  The following report of Friday's proceedings is given in the <i>Irish Press:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon said these figures were inescapable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) said they were lies.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon said the figures were taken from the official returns.</P>
      <P>Mr. O Ceallaigh said they were faked statistics.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> That is the report in the <i>Irish Press</i>, but substantially the same report was given in the other Dublin papers.  I am glad that, for some reason or another, the statements made on that occasion have been modified in the Official Report.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: I invite them to do that.  I urge them to do it.</P>
    <P>Mr. O Ceallaigh: They will do it. I have the figures here.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I hope the Minister has.  He cannot rebut them.</P>
    <P>Mr. O Ceallaigh: I can.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: They are absolutely true, and nothing that the Minister can say and no wangling of figures can controvert them.  They are taken from the official returns of the Minister's Department, and he will have ample time to answer them.</P>
    <P>Mr. O Ceallaigh: I wish to say this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I do not want the Minister to interrupt.  These figures are taken from his official returns.</P>
    <P>Mr. O Ceallaigh: They are not.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: The Minister can wangle them what way he wishes; they stand, and will be repeated and proved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. O Ceallaigh: They will not.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: &mdash;&mdash;against this foolish and incompetent Government that we have at present.</P>
    <P>Mr. O Ceallaigh: This is a mare's nest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that having made that progress from Friday last, we will make a little more progress in understanding one another and in realising what is being done here.  When speaking on the Vote on Account I stated that the remarks I was making and the presentation I was making were not related in any way to Fianna Fáil promises or plans or anything else like that.  I said that I wanted to establish the facts of the present situation both as regards what had happened and the trend of these facts, so that we would understand what I believe is a fact, that in taking the enormous amount of <Col N="637" /> money that the Government are taking for spending by the Government and the local authorities, over what was taken from the people in 1931, they are taking away the life-blood of the ordinary production machinery in the country, both agricultural and industrial. If the Minister would get it into his head that we here want simply to establish the fact so that both here in the House and elsewhere these facts may be seen and may be realised to be facts unchallenged either by people on this side of the House or on the other side of the House, we would have gone some distance.  I admit we will have to go further.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to accept it, at this stage at any rate, that we are asking him or anybody else to hold their heads in shame because of the facts that we bring out.  We are only asking that when these facts are established and that when the trend arising from these facts is proved, the people who do not develop policies that are going to improve and ameliorate things would hold their heads in shame.  What we seek is to establish facts so that proper policies may be pursued.  I ask the Minister not to use again the suggestion that we are twisting figures, that we are arranging them to suit our own arguments, that our figures are lies or that they are faked. I ask him not to do that or to say such things as these: &ldquo;That if they show a tale which is not creditable, so much the worse for us&rdquo;, that is, for the Government.  It is not a question of whether it is going to be good or bad for the Government.  It is not a question of anything that will come out of our arguments here.  It is a question that this House, if it is allowed to direct the policy of the country according to its best intelligence, will know what the facts are and knowing what they are and whence they have arisen, will know what they ought to do and what they are doing to try to aim by any change to improve production in this country so that the country will not have a larger number of people depending upon the Government to employ them and a smaller number of people able to be employed by the people from whom the Government are taking the money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> Now, on the question whether these figures are rigged or arranged to suit particular purposes, I want to state what fundamentally the figures are.  I maintain that the official figures show that between the years 1926 and 1931, 57,000 additional persons in full-time employment was the increase in employment in the country as shown by the National Health Fund, and that the average annual increment was 11,400 a year.  The Minister accepts that figure.  These five years may be taken together as grouped.  We are taking the years 1931 and 1939, covering the eight years that the Minister and his Party have been in office.  He says that during these eight years: &ldquo;There has been an increase from 342,000 persons in 1931 to 417,000 persons in 1939, an increase of 75,000 persons employed in eight years, or 9,375 of an average annual increase.&rdquo;  The Minister gives us these figures to-day. He says that we ought not to take these figures I have given; that we are taking the figures from 1931 or 1932 to 1937. We now take the years from 1931 to 1939 and, if we take these years, we will see that the average annual increase in these years, taking the figures the Minister has given, is less than the average annual increment in the years 1926 to 1931.  The position is that for every 1,000 of an increase in the average number in the years 1926 to 1931, there was an increase of only 832 in the years 1931 to 1939.  These are the Minister's figures.  I do not want to follow up the argument as to why we selected 1931 to 1937.  From one point of view I will go back to that again.  I simply want to reiterate my own figures and I put his figures that way.  I say even that increase of 9,375 given by the Minister is fictitious for this reason.  Perhaps I should not say fictitious but the figure is inflated in a fictitious way by reason of the fact that a very large number of persons who have not full-time employment are paying National Health Insurance as if they were in full-time employment.  They inflate the number by the figure I have already quoted&mdash;6,247.  So that my argument is based upon the fact that the full-time employment in 1939 was not 417,000 but 410,753, giving the average annual increment of 8,495 or 754 for every <Col N="639" /> thousand that was added to employment annually in our time.  The Minister says that I am rigging the figures. He says that I am making deductions in respect of employment schemes that might equally well be made in respect of dockers.  He said that dockers do not work six days a week no more than persons on employment schemes.  A docker, however, gets 14/- for one day's work while the man working on a relief scheme gets no more than 13/7 for three days' work.  We talk of employment and these are the handiest figures in that connection.  But we mean by &ldquo;employment&rdquo; occupation in such a way that those concerned earn sufficient to maintain themselves and their families.  The figure which the Minister is accepting and relying on for his own achievement between 1931 and 1939 shows an increase of 822 persons for every 1,000 persons additional who went into employment yearly between 1926 and 1931.  The Minister's figure is inflated by a very special class of operation&mdash;the employment of a very large number of men continuously over the whole year on relief schemes.  I do not say that that should be wiped out nor do I say that additional employment on housing should be wiped out. I said previously that, when the inflationary figures in respect of relief-employment are taken away, the average annual increment of 754, for every 1,000 in our time, would be reduced to 658 and that, if additional housing were taken away, the figure would be reduced to 554.  I said that, outside the special type of relief work which did not exist in 1931 or 1926 and outside the increase in housing for the year 1931 and including increased production in industrial employment, additional work on the Land Commission schemes, of which the Minister spoke, and additional work by the local authorities on public health schemes and drainage schemes, the annual increase in employment as against that increase of 1,000 in our time was only 554.</P>
    <P>The Minister has quoted certain figures regarding housing.  There is only one figure that, on examination of the Minister's figures, I might be prepared to modify.  That is the reduction <Col N="640" /> that should be made in respect of increased employment on housing. I should like the Minister to bear in mind that there was no special relief and no special circumstance arising out of the expenditure of Government or local government money in 1931 that did not exist in 1926.  That is why I am taking the increase of 11,400 persons every year at that time as the natural employment-increase through the country carrying on its work in an ordinary and orderly way.  Not only was Government expenditure £10,000,000 less then but the moneys expended by Government and local authorities were decreasing.  I pointed out that while that increase in employment was proceeding the amount of money that came out of the people's pocket to the Government and local authorities went down by £334,000.  The Minister does not challenge that.</P>
    <P>While there has been a 50 per cent. fall in this increased employment as compared with that for 1926-31, if some of the special things are left out, an additional £4,701,000 is coming out of the taxpayers' pockets and an additional £1,607,000 out of the ratepayers' pockets; a sum of £1,850,000, land annuities, is being taken by the Government and spent as revenue and they have the use of £2,000,000 that, pre-1931, was spent on local loans and pensions&mdash;debts to the British Government. That is being spent by this Government and, in addition, there was all the expenditure of the money borrowed by the Government and local authorities for all kinds of schemes. The argument is that the Government are taking the life-blood out of ordinary production in the country and that they cannot by Government machinery or local government machinery do for the country what the country can do by the expenditure of its own money.</P>
    <P>I do hope that the Minister and his colleagues will get out of their minds that these figures are faked or arranged in any special way.  I appeal to them to examine them and to see calmly and quietly the lessons they can learn from them.  One figure I want to correct. At the end of my statement the other day, I pointed to page 28 of the <Col N="641" />&ldquo;Trend of Employment and Unemployment in Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; page 1,852, published in December, 1935.  I said there was a special class of people, as indicated there, employed in agriculture, private domestic service and other occupations not included in the unemployment insurance scheme.  I said that, between 1926 and 1931, 30,000 full-time employed persons was the measure of the increased employment in the country for persons outside the unemployment insurance scheme who paid national health insurance, that the annual rate of increase was 6,000 and&mdash;erroneously&mdash;that there was a fall of 1,000 between 1931 and 1939. The Minister has pointed out the error. The Minister is correct.  What happened between 1931 and 1939 was an increase from 154 to 161.  There was an increase of 7,000 in eight years&mdash;an average annual increase of 875 as against an increase of 6,000 a year in our time. No allowance is made for the inflationary effect of the rotational scheme of employment in that figure of 875. If the effect of that scheme were taken into account, the increase in that period would be only 550 as against 6,000 in the period 1926-1931.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have spoken on the Vote on Account have indicated the way in which in different lines of occupation an individual here and an individual there and a couple of individuals here and a couple of individuals there have been pushed out of employment.  That has accumulated in such a way that it gives the results that are there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies, speaking on Friday, at column 488 of the Official Reports, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Cogan said here that the burden of taxation is too heavy and that it had become more than the country could bear.  That is a point of view which can be seriously put forward and one which, naturally, the Government must take very seriously into account.  It is a question which the Government is continuously asking itself&mdash;whether the burden of taxation is beyond the resources of the country and, if so, whether it is essential that we should <Col N="642" /> reduce that burden, even though it means lopping off services which, in the ordinary course, would be regarded by the people as essential. It is a question which the Government is continuously asking itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have not been told what kind of an answer the Government has given itself. We are putting this matter before the Government so that they will be helped and spurred and stirred to give the Parliament some inkling of what kind of answer it has given itself to that question which the Minister for Supplies says the Government is continuously asking itself.  At column 492, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, therefore, our tax burden is becoming unduly heavy&mdash;and nobody can deny that it is becoming heavy&mdash; we have got to try and make it easier, not by the reckless abandonment of essential services or the unscientific elimination of expenditures which are deemed necessary, but by endeavouring to make it possible for the people to bear the burden by increasing their productive activity, by adding to the national income, by getting an expansion in activity in industry and agriculture.  We are all agreed about that but, of course. we disagree as to the methods most suitable, the methods most likely to be productive of that result.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If taxation were becoming too heavy for the people to bear, they should not be so unscientific as to reduce expenditure. They would not do the scientific thing; they would set about &ldquo;endeavouring to make it possible for the people to bear the burden by increasing their productive activity, by adding to the national income, by getting an expansion in activity, in industry and agriculture.&rdquo;  We will keep that in mind for the moment.  At column 494 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If our tax burden had reached the stage at which it could be said that it was drying up the ordinary sources of employment, then I would agree that we had passed the danger mark.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" />&ldquo;Here and there danger signals appear but, generally speaking, it can be said that the number of persons in employment is increasing, has increased year after year, and is still increasing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is because we see that the tax burden has reached such a stage that it is drying up the ordinary sources of employment and because we see that the number of persons in employment is not increasing for the last couple of years that we thought it our duty to go into the facts, to take the most prominent and most important facts in the situation out, to put them before the House and to ask the House to ponder them and to take them as facts offered to an Irish Parliament by Irish representatives concerned only for the well-being of the people.  It is not a fact that the situation can be treated so lightly as the Minister for Supplies treats it when he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here and there danger signals appear, but, generally speaking, it can be said that the number of persons in employment is increasing, has increased year after year, and is still increasing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We welcome anything which the Minister for Finance thinks is an important figure to put before the House and which he puts in the House records, but, confusing, in my opinion, and unnecessary, he referred to some figures in connection with the Census of Production.  Our point is that in spite of the increase in 1931 and 1939 in the employment review covered by the Census of Production, if you eliminate the increased employment on State-aided housing and on relief schemes, the annual increase in employment for the last nine years has been only about 50 per cent. of what it was in the five years previously, that is, 554 for every 1,000.  The Minister, however, does speak of the Census of Production as providing information that indicates the trend of things.  I ask Deputies to refer to the Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin of March, 1939.  In the first column of page 3, the average number of persons engaged in all the various industries <Col N="644" /> covered by the Census in 1936 is given as 153,888, and for the year 1937, 161,212, an increase of 7,324 in those years.  But page 5 shows the particular classes of employment in which this increase took place, and we find that there was an increase of 7,315 under local authorities and Government Departments, leaving an increase of nine persons between 1936 and 1937 in the whole gamut of industries covered by the Census of Production.</P>
    <P>The year 1937 was the first year in which the employment scheme plan began to operate and on page 10 of &ldquo;The Trend of Employment and Unemployment&rdquo; for the years 1936 and 1937, we see that for the year 1936, there was an average of 7,378 persons employed all the year round on employment schemes and, in 1937, an average of 22,971.  A Parliamentary question on 8th February, 1939, disclosed that, in 1938, the monthly employment on relief schemes was 19,190, and a Parliamentary question on 21st February, 1940, disclosed that, for the year 1939, the number of persons employed on employment schemes every month was 18,112.</P>
    <P>In 1937-38-39 the employment position, as I say, was forced up by an enormous expenditure and enormous employment, every month for the whole year round, on employment schemes, but between 1936 and 1937, over the whole gamut of industrial life covered by the Census of Production, there was an increase in employment of nine persons.  We have not yet got the increase between 1937 and 1938, but I think the Minister ought to have a look at it soon and let us know what the position is.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us on several occasions that we should take the year 1932 as a starting point.  I would ask any of the Deputies on the opposite benches to take any of the four publications that have been issued for the last four years dealing with the trend of employment, and in so far as any information with regard to the National Health Insurance Fund and the equivalent employment for National Health Insurance or the Unemployment Insurance Fund are concerned, they will <Col N="645" /> find that a complete veil is drawn over the year 1932.  Nobody, unless he wants to undertake special research or to ask special questions, knows what the year 1932 is, because these figures work from the year 1926 to the year 1931, but skip deliberately the year 1932, and then go on and give the position for 1933-34-35-36.  Evidently 1932 is a bad year.  At any rate, what we have to measure things from is the employment in the country at the present time or last year as against the year 1931 before a new policy or new policies were introduced, a substantial part of which was the increasing of taxation by £4,000,000 and the expenditure of a lot of additional moneys that were received and held in other ways.  So that I do not know why the Minister should introduce 1932; but let us take him on the figures he quotes for 1937.  He says that it is unfair to talk of comparing 1931 with 1939 and that we should talk about the improvement that took place between 1931 and 1937.  He has told us that he accepts it that there was an average annual increase in employment between 1931 and 1937 of 12,166, as against 11,400 from 1926 to 1931.  That is, on the figures he gives us&mdash;the figures that have been presented to us already, and that I accept&mdash;he says that the average annual increase in employment between 1931 and 1937 was 12,166, as against 11,400.  That was the great change.  It means that there was an increase of 6.7 per cent.  In other words, for every 1,000 of an increase that there was in the years 1926 to 1931, there was, in these boasted years from 1931 to 1937, an increase of 1,067, and the Minister thinks that he ought to get credit for that.  Well, we do not challenge these figures.  That is so.  It was brought about by an enormous increase in expenditure and by an enormous forced development of industrial life here.</P>
    <P>If however, the Minister wants to stop at 1937, he stops really at a point which is the point that drives us to make this presentation to the House, because, after six years of enormous expenditure, of an enormous alleged development of industrial life here, and with the forced development of employment <Col N="646" /> on employment schemes, which I have quoted from these official returns, what do we find that the employment position is, as founded on the National Health Insurance Fund from 1937 to 1939?  We find that, instead of an increase of 11,400 from 1926 to 1931, and of 12,166 a year from 1931 to 1937, there was an increase of 1,000 from 1937 to 1938, and an increase of 1,000 from 1938 to 1939.  The Minister for Finance is shocked at the idea that the Leader of the Opposition should say that there had been no increase in employment in the last couple of years.  He is shocked.  We have the astounding fact that the increase was only 1,000, inflated, remember, by the fictitious exaggeration of these figures by the rotational schemes of the Office of Public Works&mdash;inflated over the year 1937 and the year 1938 and the year 1939.  Taking the superficial picture, however, and not making any allowances for it, there was an increase of 1,000 from 1937 to 1938, and of 1,000 from 1938 to 1939, as against, as I say, 11,400 per year from 1926 to 1931, and of 12,166 between 1931 and 1937, the period that the Minister for Finance asked to be judged upon.</P>
    <P>I think there is actually a fall of 1,000 in the number of persons that were employed in 1939, as against 1938, under the persons who pay unemployment insurance; so that it is not unreasonable to argue that, with the figures shown there in the Census of Industrial Production, between 1936 and 1937, nine additional persons were put into employment over the whole gamut of censussed industry in the country, and the increase of 7,000 odd that was due to increased employment, in 1937, by the Government and by the local authorities&mdash;I think it is not unreasonable to say that since 1937, the normal increase in this country&mdash;its power to add to its own employment&mdash; has been wiped out.  We say that it has been wiped out because the very life-blood that would keep it going, and that did keep it going in the past to the extent of £10,000 in various kinds of ways, has been taken out of the pool available to the ordinary people who carried on ordinary work in this country and the agricultural industry in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> The Minister for Supplies says that, if they saw that taxation was too high, if they saw that it was injuring the situation in the country, they would have to take steps to make it possible for the producing machinery in the country to produce more so that the people could bear the cost.  This year already more than £600,000 above the figures that we quoted here have been taken out of the taxpayers' pocket. £150,000 additional is going to be taken out of the ratepayers' pocket, and a Bill is now being presented to the House which shows the present policy is going to be pursued, and that it is going to be pursued with increasing conviction and determination, under the cover of the necessities brought about here by the fact that a war situation exists in Europe.  The policy that will kill the country's production in peace will kill the country's production in war.</P>
    <P>We ask the Government to take the situation seriously, not to get the feeling that no doubt they deserve to have, that they are in the dock, that, in the words of the Minister for Finance, we are throwing bricks at them, that if our argument goes against them it will be worse for them, that he is certain they will come well out of the discussion.  These things do not matter and, so far as we are concerned here, our argument is not that they should matter; our argument is that the eyes of every Deputy in this House and the eyes of responsible people and of everybody in the country should be opened to what the facts of the situation are, and to what has brought about those facts.  One fact is outstanding; the Government have shown no indication of changing in any way the manner in which they are addressing themselves to the situation.  Glibly, if his eyes are opened, and blindly, if his eyes are not opened, the Minister for Supplies says that the danger signals are not apparent, that employment is increasing.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the present day, I will allow the Minister to take his stand, as he offers to do, on the year 1937; I will allow him to take every blessed credit that he can manufacture or develop to himself or to anybody <Col N="648" /> else connected with him for anything that went from 1931 to 1937.  He may take all the credit that he wishes to for that.  I am concerned with what has manifested itself from 1937 to 1939, and I ask him if he will show anything in the statistics or the figures or the facts in regard to 1937-38-39 which would justify the complacency that the Minister for Supplies showed in the debate on the Vote on Account, saying that the danger signals are not very marked, that employment is increasing and that the time has not yet come when they should sit down seriously and see how they can reduce the demands they are making on the people.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Minister's statement there on Friday that squares in any way with his picture of the situation that I have shown was painted by him at the University on the previous night.  We are prepared to take it for the moment that there may be something in what he says.  We are asking the Minister for Finance to come, as is his duty, to the aid of this House here, and put before the House the facts with regard to the years 1937-38-39 that warrant the optimism or the complacency that the Minister for Supplies showed on Friday last.</P>
    <P>I should just like to make one final remark.  When we look back and see all the boasted achievement&mdash;boasted in the Parliament here, boasted in the Press and in the country&mdash;for the years, let us say, 1931 to 1937, and take the achievement that the Minister claims of an annual increment of 12,166 persons added to employment, and look back at the 11,400 added annually between the years 1926 and 1931, and remember what was said, we would just like to ask, without distracting them too much from the facts of to-day and their responsibilities and duties of to-day, that Ministers would throw their minds back a little bit now and then.  In an odd moment they should consider how much there reasonably was to complain of in the lines on which complaint has been made, when 11,400 were added to those employed every year, when there was a tax bill of £21,000,000 and a rates bill of <Col N="649" /> £4,500,000 and a reducing volume of taxation generally; they should compare that with the increase in taxation that has taken place for the last eight years, and the enormous sum it is at the present time.  I do not want to ask them to go back and think over this in order to strengthen the feeling that the Minister for Finance insists that they must have, that we are trying to make it worse for them, throwing bricks at them, and all that.  No; I am only asking them to do it in order to help them to look with clearer and saner eyes at the facts that exist here to-day, and therefore that they may see plainly and more clearly the dangers sticking out of the facts of to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Mulcahy, I was very interested to find out how the Minister for Finance was going to justify his words on Friday that the figures carefully and in detail worked out by Deputy Mulcahy were lying figures, that they were faked and false.  I find that he has withdrawn from the stand which he took then in an interjection and that he now complains only in regard to the figures. It is well we should have this particular matter on record.  The only complaint he has about the figures is, I understand, in two respects.  He complains regarding the deduction made in respect of housing and employment schemes and, secondly, that it is not fair to make a comparison over eight years.  He wants it stopped short at 1937.  Deputy Mulcahy has gone into details regarding this particular matter and I only want to add this: the present Government came into office on an argument put across the country that the Government then going out of office had paid no attention to the fostering of either trade, industry or agriculture.  They promised they would do so, and they swung into power and started a system of high protection for industrial purposes, a system of subsidies, credit arrangements, everything that could be devised in order to help agriculture. Later they got going on factories, the boosting of housing, they fostered certain industries which it was clear to anybody were not worth fostering, the <Col N="650" /> only excuse being that it was better for people to be employed in some sort of industry, even if it were only in relief work, than for them to be on the dole. Finally, they developed the whole system of relief schemes&mdash;an expensive system at that.  According to our opponents we had nothing: our doing nothing resulted, as the figures show, in an annual increment of 11,400 in the number employed for the five-year period.  They came in with their subsidies, high protection, credits, relief schemes and the boom in housing and, giving them everything the Minister for Finance has asked to-night and stopping short the calculation with the year 1937, the best they can say is that whereas the people who did nothing secured the employment of 57,000 people in five years they had secured the employment of 72,000 people in six years.  Stopping at their best year, the one they want, there is the result of all the activity&mdash;that they really are boasting that they did not completely stop the annual rhythm of employment that had been started in our time.  We gave them a rhythm of employment at the rate of 11,400 a year.  With subsidies, tariffs, credits, boosting in every way, they got 12,000 a year over six years and at the sixth year their efforts are exhausted; they then began to go back.  There is the net result of the whole scheme, of all the moneys that have been spent, of the tremendous efforts, the diminishing of our assets abroad and everything else, even giving the Minister for Finance this point that he wants to stop in the year 1937.  We do not make any deduction in that 12,000 per annum.  We make no deduction whatever for the increased employment by way of increased house building.  We make no deduction for the increased moneys spent on relief schemes and the increased employment that resulted in that way and we give him his year that he asked for&mdash;1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proper surely at that point to ask, why stop at 1937?  Are Government efforts exhausted?  Are all these plans that were to reconstruct this country only to be tried out over six years?  Are they turning something over in their minds and will we have <Col N="651" /> another jump forward?  What is the lag about?  What is the reason for this period of two years' waiting? What has happened that the years 1938 and 1939 should not be counted?  If we do count these in we get the amazing result that Deputy Mulcahy's figures show.  Even allowing the artificially created employment by reason of relief schemes and increased house building you have got a rhythm of employment that is less than the one established in our time.  However, it comes to this, apparently, that giving the Minister for Finance all he wants and stopping two years ago, in 1937, the most the Minister can boast is that he had not stopped the progress by way of increased employment year by year which had been established in our time.</P>
    <P>I think it is proper to make these deductions by reason of these conflicting factors I spoke of early this evening, if for no other reason than that two copies of reports issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce call attention to these things.  In the report for the years 1936 and 1937 (P. No. 3142) the summary that is given, as set out on page 19, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards employment, the volume of employment as indicated by the net contribution incomes of both the National Health Insurance and Unemployment Funds was considerably greater in 1937 than in 1936. The increase was due, mainly, but not entirely, to increased employment on employment schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The pamphlet itself claims that the increase as between 1937 and 1936 was due almost entirely to relief schemes. And the pamphlet issued a year later (P. No. 3572) in its concluding remarks says this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards employment, the volume of employment as indicated by the net contribution incomes of both the National Health Insurance and Unemployment Funds was somewhat greater in 1938 than in 1937. The increase was due mainly to increased employment in the building industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> Their own two pamphlets call attention to the fact that in the last two years, whatever increased employment was effected was due in one of these years mainly to relief schemes, and in the second mainly to building activity.  Are we not entitled to find out how much of this building activity was artificially fostered, and should not be counted as a recurring advantage to the State and, similarly, with regard to these relief schemes, are we not entitled, in order to get a comparison based upon the five year period 1926-31 and any other period that was taken, to remove from the second period the increase that had been brought about by the expenditure of public money first of all on relief schemes, and secondly on housing?  If these things are brought into consideration and if we take the years which we are entitled to take&mdash;1938 and 1939&mdash;we get the situation depicted by Deputy Mulcahy this evening.</P>

      <P>It is scarcely necessary to go over the ground that the Minister for Finance has already traversed. Those Deputies on the opposite side who have spoken on this question of unemployment statistics and increased employment have had special opportunities during their own term of office to understand the significance of these figures.  I think it has never been claimed by the present Government, and certainly it has not been claimed by the Minister for Supplies, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the figures which have been quoted from time to time in connection with the number of persons in employment, in so far as they can be estimated from the yearly total of insurance contributions, are in themselves exact figures denoting the actual <Col N="653" /> amount of employment in a particular year.  What had been claimed, and I think what can be claimed with reason, is that these figures showing the amount of insurable contributions year after year indicate a certain trend in the amount of employment.  The Deputy who first raised this question, Deputy Mulcahy, assumed that the figures which he quoted for the period from 1926 to 1931 represent whole-time employment.  I do not know on what basis he makes that claim.  Certainly it has never been claimed from this side of the House, I think, that the figures in themselves can be construed as meaning full-time employment.  There are, of course, certain persons undoubtedly paying contributions who are not employed for the whole time over the whole period of the year.  The breaks may be great or small but, in any case, the total as shown for each year would certainly seem to indicate a certain trend.  The Minister for Finance has gone into the figures and has shown that at any rate, so far as that legitimate conclusion can be drawn from the figures, during the period 1931 to 1937 the amount of employment given was very substantially greater than during the five preceding years referred to by Deputy Mulcahy.</P>

      <P>Three arbitrary assumptions are made by Deputy Mulcahy in his role of scientific statistician: first, that we are to assume that in the particular year which he chooses to make the best case he can for his own period of office, there was no casual employment, but that during the succeeding period, when this Government was in office apparently, he can take any arbitrary figure he may choose as representing casual employment on relief schemes or otherwise, and subtract it, and not alone that, but he can go further, and take out relief schemes and housing.  Whatever figures may show, everyone knows that there was a considerable amount of employment, fairly regular employment, on housing given throughout the country over that period, but, apparently, because housing has been given special assistance by the Government, that is a reason for deducting it from the figures relating to employment during these years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly cannot understand on what theory these deductions are made.  On that basis, one can advance any set of figures and make any arbitrary deduction one likes. Why not add two or three other trades or industries?  Why cannot Deputy McGilligan say: &ldquo;Oh, this is an industry where the Government gave a tariff of 60 per cent.  That must have cost the community a great deal, so why not exclude the persons who are employed in that industry.&rdquo;  Why not continue eliminating other categories of employed persons, until nothing is left and then you are presented with a minus figure?  Obviously, it would be much more satisfactory for the Opposition to carry this thing a few stages further and&mdash;instead of having to admit now that there was a clear surplus and an increase of thousands in the number given employment yearly under the present Government&mdash;had they carried these theories further, they might be able to show that there was an actual <Col N="655" /> decrease in employment during the period of office of the present Government.</P>
      <P>The net unemployment insurance contribution income in 1926 was 161,000. In 1931 it was 188,000, according to the figures supplied by the responsible branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That is, it had increased by 27,000.  In the year 1932 there was a fall from 188,000 to 136,000. During the period since there has been a practically continuous improvement, except in 1939 when the figure was lower by 1,000 than in 1938.  If you take the figures from 1932 to 1937 there is an increase from 136,000 to 253,000, or an increase of 117,000, as compared with an increase of 27,000 from the period 1926 to 1931.</P>
      <P>In the national health contributions the income figure in 1926 was 285,000, while the figure in 1931 was 342,000. In 1932 it was 349,000 and in 1937, 415,000.</P>

      <P>The figures for the period 1931 to 1937 indicate an increase of 73,000, that is 12,166 per year, or, if you take the figures from 1933 to 1937, there is an increase of 15,000 per year.  The Deputy may laugh but surely these statistics as quoted by Deputy Mulcahy, with qualifications and deductions, mean very little, whereas, as sensible men, we all know that in the last six months of the year 1937 the building industry in Dublin and outside was held up completely. I think the Minister for Finance has made a very big concession in giving them the year 1937.  A great point with Deputy McGilligan is that the official statement of the trend of unemployment reveals that there was an improvement in employment in the building industry in 1938.  The Deputy has completely forgotten that we had this strike, which inflicted very heavy losses on the building industry and during which all the building operatives and workers in Dublin were out for months and months.  He has completely forgotten that.  Surely it is not very extraordinary that during the succeeding period the official publication should call attention to the improvement in the trend of employment in the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Deputy Cosgrave, when I have finished, make whatever points he wishes about the fact that there has been a certain trend in the 1938 period or in the 1939 period as compared with the years immediately preceding them. The House is surely not likely to forget that during the year 1938 there was a considerable period of international tension.  In the latter part of the year, at any rate, it was expected that war would break out in Europe. It was not a period when people were inclined to embark upon new enterprises. They were rather more inclined to economise and to reduce their commitments as far as possible. There was a general belief that war was about to break out.  You had the occupation of Austria and of CzechoSlovakia. Of course these things, according to Deputies opposite, would mean nothing to business men.  Business men would still go on in the old way, feeling that the future was going <Col N="657" /> to be blessed with peaceful progress. We should have regard, at any rate, to the facts of the situation.  I challenge any Deputy on the opposite side to disprove the contention that during that period there was undoubtedly keen anxiety amongst business people.  It would not be unfair to describe it as a year when there was general insecurity, a general fall in the value of stocks for example, and general tension in international trade.  Then, in the 1939 period, the position became worse, culminating in the outbreak of war.  So far as the years 1938 and 1939 are concerned, let Deputies make what play they wish with statistics, but they certainly cannot contend that these two years are in the same position as the years preceding them, because the international situation affected us in ways we have often pointed out and which we cannot escape no matter how much we may try.</P>
    <P>Another noticeable lack in the speeches of Deputies has been their failure to refer to agriculture.  For years we have been listening to long wails about the condition of our agriculture, to claims that agricultural production was decreasing, and that, in fact, the amount of employment on farms was getting smaller.  It is extraordinary that in the present debate, the Opposition at this particular juncture should see fit to change their case from a consideration of the agricultural position to a consideration of the industrial position&mdash;not even the present industrial situation, not even the war situation in industry, but the industrial position of some years ago. They entirely neglected the agricultural industry.  One would have expected that some references at any rate were due to the industry, which we have so often heard was the most valuable from the point of view of creating wealth.</P>
    <P>Surely the Opposition, if they are really interested in employment, ought to have something to say with regard to agriculture?  Is it because they no longer can claim that agriculture is suffering from some policy which the Government had imposed upon it, that farmers are not now able to take advantage <Col N="658" /> of their opportunities?  At any rate, they cannot claim that the farmers have not this market that we heard so much about.  Not alone have they got the free market, but they have got it under conditions that would seem to be rather favourable.  We have a war scarcity and a great increase in prices.  Surely the time ought to be ripe for examining the question whether additional employment cannot be given in agriculture?  Perhaps the Opposition Deputies may come along later, say next year, and show us that there has been an actual reduction in some figure or other in relation to the amount of employment on the land.  What we do know is that a certain amount of machinery is being introduced, that there is a shortage of labour on the land in many districts, but that, nevertheless, if the signs up to the present mean anything, there will be a tremendous increase in agricultural production during the coming season.  I think examining ways and means in which production, either in agriculture or industry, can be increased during the present period, would be rather more useful work for the National Assembly at the moment than putting forward divers views as to the meaning of the statistics of employment from 1926 to 1937.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy, in his closing remarks, said that during the concluding years of office of our predecessors the position was that you had an increase in whole-time employment, with all the attendant benefits that that meant to the country and that, at the same time, you had a reducing volume of taxation generally.  I seem to recollect that at the end of that year we had a Supplementary Budget. Is it not true that from the period 1929 to 1933, if not up to 1935, there was a general world-wide depression from which this country suffered as well as every other country?  Was it not largely as a result of that circumstance, between 1929 and 1931, that the Minister for Agriculture in the previous Administration went down to Limerick and told the farmers at Hospital that the trend of dairying prices, which were then very low, would be still lower?  We had it stated from every platform in the country that conditions <Col N="659" /> were bad everywhere.  That continued over a period of years and I think the fact that our predecessors had to bring in a Supplementary Budget when things were all so rosy, as Deputy Mulcahy would now claim, is a fairly good proof that we in this country cannot escape these international movements.</P>
    <P>We do not claim that the international situation which has existed since 1937&mdash;certainly since 1938-39&mdash;will not have its effects upon this country and, perhaps, they will not be very easy to overcome.  They have already manifested themselves in reduced revenue and in certain additional items of expenditure.  It was for that reason that we, in precisely the same way as our predecessors, had to introduce a Supplementary Budget and had to come here and ask the Dáil to assist us in making up the gap which existed. It seems to me that for a Party that claim to represent rural as well as urban opinion in this country, the Opposition seem to have very little to give in the way of constructive suggestions and very little to show in the way of telling us how, in the present difficult situation, we can ensure that the amount of employment given in the country will increase.  We know that no matter what policy the Government may put into operation, no matter what efforts they may make to maintain the level of employment, if employers have difficulties, because of rising prices, because of increasing costs and higher wages and also higher taxation, inevitably that will affect them in the amount of employment they give.  I think the Minister for Finance showed clearly that, at any rate, the position which the figures revealed as obtaining in 1937 showed that very steady and substantial progress had been achieved up to that period and I think it is a matter for congratulation that the figures for the following two years show that the position that obtained in 1937 has not only been maintained, but has been somewhat improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been just as well, from the point of view of the Government, that the Minister for Lands had not spoken at all.  If we <Col N="660" /> want to find out here what the circumstances are, we are entitled to get a direct answer from a Minister to a direct question.  The Minister knows the answer to the question that I put to him.  Notwithstanding any possible stupidity that he might affect, it is before him in the document that he has what the number is of persons who are calculated to have been registered in National Health Insurance.  Why does he refuse to give it?  He would like to picture himself in his own constituency as intelligent, honest, candid.  Does he reserve his honesty and candour for his own constituency and refuse it here in the Parliament?  There is a very simple answer to the question as to why he would not give the figure.  It would explode his whole case.</P>
      <P>We are not particularly interested in whether the policy adopted by the Ministers was a fake policy or a plan, or merely a theoretical assumption on the part of somebody that they were going to do something.  But we knew it was not any use.  We are not concerned now with politics; we are concerned with the country.  It ought to be everybody's business to see how far it is possible to gain every additional person in the list of those employed in gainful occupations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy gave figures in connection with the numbers of persons registered in National Health Insurance. Nobody suggests for a moment that there is an exact figure for that, but there is a figure upon which there is general agreement that it cannot be improved upon for finding out how many persons are registered year after year.  The numbers increased annually by 11,400 for the years 1926 down to 1931.  An advertisement appeared in the Press here in the end of 1931 and the beginning of 1932 promising employment for 85,000 persons or 86,000&mdash; there was an odd number in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was that an honest advertisement, or was it merely a political statement? It it were honest, and if it were well-thought out, then we had the fallacy of it exposed here this evening from the Ministerial benches.  The Government succeeded in getting an average <Col N="661" /> of 12,166 persons into employment annually for over six years.  That beat their predecessors' figure by 766.  If you multiply 766 by six you get over 4,000.  That is the sum and substance of the entire contribution of Ministerial activity in connection with employment in industry and agriculture throughout this country.  What has been the cost?  Within the last four years we have had three unbalanced Budgets.  I ask Deputies to look at the Estimates, and in particular at the cost in respect to the debt for housing. It is up by £100,000 this year.  The Government have spent money on housing.  Yes, they have spent money that the children and grandchildren of those in this House this evening will be paying for the next 35 or 40 years. I refer to the housing loans.  Their predecessors left no debts in respect of housing, except for what the houses were worth.  If those houses were sold on the public market they would have brought their price.  The houses built by the Ministry, since they came into office, represent a dead-weight debt, and that is going to remain for the next 35 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>These are facts: not arguments or political fulminations.  It would give us all pleasure to see that test come true with regard to the number employed, but we were satisfied from the first day that advertisement appeared in connection with this faked political plan that it was not going to succeed.  It has not succeeded in any country, and never will succeed. It is basically wrong.  Now the Government have to admit that the best that could be done over the six years since they came into office was to beat their predecessors' figure in the matter of employment by 766.  What has happened in the last two years?  A full stop&mdash;1,000 in one year, and 1,000 in the next; 10,000 down in one year and 10,000 down in the next.  Mind you, we all regret that because we have to live here.  We are rooted here, and it is regrettable that in a country like this, a country capable of some industrial and agricultural expansion that we have not got it.</P>
    <P>There never was a more gigantic failure of an economic policy than <Col N="662" /> that which we have had presented to us this evening&mdash;never: a rising debt, a rising cost of living, a rising cost of production, a lower number of persons in employment than we have been accustomed to, lower than it has ever been since this State was established.</P>
    <P>The Minister who has just sat down is concerned about agriculture and wonders why we do not speak about it.  What are the facts in connection with the Estimates before us?  It is quite true that, taking this year as compared with last, we are £250,000 up.  There is, however, a correction to be made in that figure, because the agricultural grant of £370,000 is included in this year's figure and was not in last year's.  Consequently, we have to face a reduction, as compared with last year, of something like £100,000 odd.  But this year's Book of Estimates shows two remarkable figures&mdash;I mean from the point of view of a Deputy who represents an agricultural constituency.  First of all, I find that the Vote for Agriculture is £279,000 less than last year, when we were very much concerned with working up winter dairying.  This year, apparently, we are not so ambitious, because there is only a token Vote. Last year we provided a very considerable sum of money for subsidies and for agricultural exports.  This year the sum of money made available is £260,000 short of what was provided last year.  That is the sum and substance of the interest of the Minister for Lands in agriculture.  The Minister, having been transferred from the Department of Education to the Department of Lands, is presumably getting more in touch with the people of the country, but the sum and substance of his work is represented by a fall of over £500,000 in the provision that is being made this year for agriculture as compared with last.</P>
    <P>Here are some of the larger items in respect of which less money is being provided this year than last.  Unemployment schemes are down by £100,000; unemployment assistance is down by £70,000; Public Works and Buildings, if we include the price of sites, is down by £166,000; the Land <Col N="663" /> Commission is down by £208,000; the Department of Local Government and Public Health notwithstanding the £100,000 that has to be provided for the service of debt on uneconomic houses, is down by £138,000, so that taking all these items together we get a total of in or about £780,000.  Bearing that figure in mind, one can measure, to some extent, what is happening in regard to the remaining services.  At any rate, Deputies can see in the figures I have quoted a shortage of £780,000 in respect of potential employment or social services as they are so elegantly described by Deputies on the benches opposite.  The agricultural estimate is down by well over £1,250,000.  Notwithstanding that remarkable subtraction, the cost of administration is being kept up to what it was last year.</P>
    <P>What is the complaint that we make against the Ministry?  That ever since they came into office they have been squandering public money.  Their policy of squandermania reached its peak point during the last few years, a policy which is eating into and sapping employment activity throughout this State.  The Minister for Finance, during my absence this evening, referred, I understand, to what I had to say about the Estimates.  I believe he described as nonsense the proposal I put up that these Estimates could be reduced by £4,000,000.  I will give the Minister one figure.  I say that the cost of the Army could be reduced by £2,000,000.  According to this Book of Estimates, the Army is going to cost this year £3,350,000.  If the Estimate for the year 1932-33 is looked up, it will be found when we had an Army that was able to hold its ammunition, that was well disciplined, and in respect of which there had not to be an enquiry lasting over weeks or months, it was costing the country only £1,318,000.</P>
    <P>Is there not £2,000,000 that could be saved there?  Not at all.  They must have a big Army.  One country on the Continent had a big army and made a very short fight.  We have not got the money for that sort of experimental militarism, for swelling the number of persons under arms, and <Col N="664" /> then not being able to supply them with ammunition.  Last year the Prime Minister came here and said that he wanted £1,000,000 for aeroplanes and £1,000,000 for guns.  We bought neither, but we have spent the money on a swollen Army.  That £2,000,000 that could have been saved is one item on the list.  Is it not possible to save another £2,000,000?  I believe it is.  It will not be done while Ministers have the views they have, while we have the ex-Minister for Education speaking as he did this evening.  He would not give the figure for last year.  Why?  Because it was against him.  Will he go before the people in Kilkenny and tell them that is not the reason?  Will he tell them that owing to the political decrepitude of the Opposition he is wasting his time in this House?  The Minister should have a little sense.</P>
    <P>So far as the deductions mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy are concerned, I think he was perfectly entitled to give them in respect of the swollen numbers claimed in respect of these years.  There was no policy before this Government, for example giving men two or three days' employment in the week, and charging a stamp for that particular week.  We have £1,500,000 voted annually for unemployment schemes for the past couple of years.  The figure is a simple one to calculate.  It would give employment to 15,000 people, paying them £100 per year for a whole year.  These men were not employed the whole year, or anything like it.  If they got four months' employment in the year it would be the most they got, and 45,000 men could be added on for these particular years on that basis.  These four months would be just one-third of the yearly subscription that had to be provided.  Assuming you gave 5,000 that kind of employment&mdash;everyone knows that they did not get it&mdash;the number could be varied up and down according to the employment given. Is the Deputy not entitled to draw attention to the fact that you cannot calculate men who got three or four days' work as getting full employment for a week?  I make the Government a present of the point.  The country <Col N="665" /> has to pay the extra cost, which is anything from £4,000,000 to £9,000,000.</P>
    <P>So far as housing is concerned, the Minister is scarcely justified in claiming credit for what the children and grand-children of to-day will have to pay.  It is very nice to be generous with other people's money, but that money will have to be paid for the next 30 years, long after most of us have passed over, and there will not be any advantage derived by those who have to pay.  The advantages are in our time.  We have the advantage that people were employed in our time.  Let us hope the houses are well built, and that they will not cost much to keep in repair during that period.  So far as the first item is concerned it is, in my opinion, beyond the capacity of the people with present income and resources to meet the bill.  It is rising and has been rising ever since this Government came into office.  That is demonstrated by the increased taxation year after year, on the figures I have given and on the savings made. It is nonsense to be talking about increased responsibilities and social services. The social services are not responsible for half the additional taxation. The additional cost, with the savings, amounts to £9,000,000 and on the social services, £4,000,000.  Where is the rest going?  On going through the Estimates I find that the person who succeeded to my office has 24 officials where I had 16, and the Department is costing £3,000 more.  That is one indication of the extravagance and squandermania characteristic of this Ministry, and until we get rid of it it is not likely that we are going to improve employment in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were always given to understand that the increased annual expenditure&mdash;the amount of which it would be exceedingly difficult to calculate with any exactitude, varying from £4,000,000 acknowledged to £10,000,000 if we include real taxes of all kinds&mdash;was to be justified under three heads, a more extensive and a higher degree of social services, the starting of industries which would grow naturally and give employment of a productive kind, and <Col N="666" /> thirdly the excuse of the Minister for Finance, which was repeated, I understand, last Friday by another member of the Government, that money that was raised by taxation, was not being taken out of the country, that it was really being kept here; that by taxes and rates the Government was merely redistributing wealth and that that in itself was a good thing.  On several occasions Deputy Cosgrave dealt with the question of social services, behind which the supporters of the Government always tried to hide their extravagant expenditure.  He has shown that to practise big economies it is not necessary to curtail these social services. As that has been adequately dealt with I do not intend to go into it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to what is the main subject of controversy between the two Front Benches to-day and last week, namely, the question of unemployment, let us ask ourselves what did Deputy Mulcahy's figures set out to prove, and what lesson should they teach the country and Deputies?  We have greatly increased taxation under ordinary heads, whether in the nature of tariffs or ordinary taxation to raise revenues, and definitely put on for that particular purpose.  There is private taxation in favour of certain industries so as to enable them to make profits and keep going. That meant considerable cost to the public, a cost that is not set out in the ordinary Budget accounts.  What has been the result of all the immense heaping on of taxation?  Surely, what Deputy Mulcahy set out to prove by his figures has been proved, so far as the employment given by productive industries is concerned.  Take the number of tariffed industries; take what they are costing the country; take the boasts made about the number of people that these industries would put into employment, and what is the result?  Surely the figures of Deputy Mulcahy prove that when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government kept taxation, tariffs and local expenditure down to a reasonable figure, the increase was something like 11,500 per year, and that under Fianna Fáil the immense expenditure of money has led to only a very slight increase <Col N="667" /> on this figure.  Actually, where there was increased employment, it was brought about in two particular directions, building and relief works.  Better housing is useful, even necessary, but not productive, and does not itself ensure that there would be further employment in that particular direction &mdash;it is not economically productive in the ordinary sense.  It is not a factory which is set going and can keep going, producing new wealth.  It is a thing which can be done once and for all, or, with increased public expenditure, for a long time.  Housing may be necessary; it may be highly desirable that the people should be properly housed; but I put it to the House that it is not a productive industry.  It does not produce wealth; it is costly; it means a certain amount of wealth going out of the country&mdash;an argument which ought to appeal to the Government, who continually use the opposite argument about the desirability of keeping wealth in the country.  At most it distributes wealth in the way of giving employment, but it does not make wealth.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, Deputy Mulcahy was perfectly justified in withdrawing from his calculation these two particular figures, the figures for unemployment relief schemes and the figures for housing.  He did not conceal what the total increase in employment was; he made that perfectly clear. When trying to estimate the increase in employment in productive industries there are cogent reasons why these two figures should be deducted.  The result of high expenditure in the shape of new industries has been undoubtedly to put a certain number into employment in some industries, but obviously to drive people out of employment in other industries and avocations.  We are therefore justified in taking out housing and Government relief schemes. The Minister for Lands wondered why we fixed on these.  We did so because these are not industries in the ordinary sense of the word.  The Government's much advertised policy was by means of real industries to put people into employment.  If that was their policy, <Col N="668" /> how far have they succeeded in that policy?</P>
    <P>It is only after a number of years, such as the years through which we have passed, that you are in a position to make up your mind on the value of a policy, and it is a constructive suggestion, in the face of the figures which have been put before the Government in the last couple of days and once more this evening, that the Government should submit their whole policy to a thorough re-examination. I can understand their refusing to do it in the first year or the second or third year, and saying: &ldquo;We shall have to give the thing a chance.&rdquo;  But what is the excuse, with the figures that we have before us now, for their not seriously examining the effects of their policy?  In industry, in the ordinary sense, what have they to show for the enormous expenditure which they have put upon the country?  What is the result even of the policy of distribution of money on diminishing our unemployment?  Is the Ministry satisfied?  I gather that the Minister for Lands is not altogether satisfied, because he wants to lead us back again to the high hopes of 1932.  He asks us not to look at what has occurred, not to be guided in our conduct by the light of our experience, but to hope that once more, and not for the first time, a new day is dawning.  If a new day is dawning, I am sorry to say that the dawn has not yet become visible to the ordinary man in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands was gravely exercised about the fact that no mention was made by our speakers of agricultural employment.  I wonder how he reached that conclusion.  Was it merely because the word &ldquo;agriculture, agriculture&rdquo; did not ring in his ears&mdash; as it so often does&mdash;through every speech made by us?  Did he not grasp that in the figures supplied to this House agricultural employment is included&mdash;they were the figures of National Health Insurance?  He ignored that.  He ignored that we were dealing with figures of employment in agriculture as well as in industry. What then was his grievance?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> If he does want figures for agricultural employment, we have only one set to give him&mdash;the official figures for those engaged in domestic service and agriculture.  What is the comparison to be made there?  We are now answering a question put up by the Minister for Lands who was not satisfied, apparently, because he thought, though we gave the total figures including those in agriculture, we were neglecting agriculture.  Taking those figures for agricultural and domestic employment, what were the facts?  In the five typical years of our Government brought forth by Deputy Mulcahy for which the figures were given, there was an increase of employment in domestic service and agriculture of 30,000. That was an annual increase of 6,000. Take the next eight years, the eight years of Fianna Fáil policy which are under discussion, and what are the figures?  Seven thousand for the eight years.  Whereas, therefore, there was an annual increase in our case of 6,000 per annum, there was an increase under the vast expenditure of Fianna Fáil, notwithstanding all the gifts of millions they say that they have made to agriculture, of 875 per year in domestic service and agriculture.  These are the only official figures available to me.  I give the Minister for Lands these particular figures because he asked for them.  I wonder whether he will find them more satisfactory than those which were given this evening by Deputy Mulcahy; but they are the figures.</P>
    <P>I could not quite follow, I will confess, what he was driving at in his opening statement, when he said that the figures are not absolute, that they do not give the absolute numbers for employment.  Who said they were? The trend is what we are dealing with. I ask the Deputies and Ministers to look at the trend of employment, the rate of employment, and its cost during those last four years of our Administration, when what you might call an orthodox system of finance was pursued and the trend in the last seven or eight years of Fianna Fáil Administration when an unorthodox system of economy and wild schemes of all kinds were adopted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> Compare the trends.  Do they suggest that you have got anything like value for the immense expenditure of money in which the Government has indulged? Deputy Mulcahy's figures are brought forward to show one thing, and they have shown that&mdash; that all your expenditure of money and your taxation can have only one affect, and that is to dry up the ordinary private sources of employment. You may have put people into employment in certain subsidised industries. You may have put people into employment by subsidising housing, at an immense cost, in both cases, to the ordinary taxpayer.  But if there is anything in the figures provided by the Fianna Fáil Government themselves, the only lesson to be drawn from them is that you have driven large numbers out of employment elsewhere, people who would have got employment under ordinary financial workings.  You have grievously upset the ordinary man's employment.</P>
    <P>You have destroyed the private funds which provided employment for him.  What have you to show for it? I do not care whether you add in to your figures the relief workers or the house-building workers; what have you to show for it?  What have you to show for the upsetting of the whole system of finance, and for putting the country where it is at the present moment?  Again and again I have invited the Government to consult their followers and try to draw from them not pleasant answers but the truth.  Let them ask them: &ldquo;If you go to the country generally, what is the position as regards increasing employment there at the moment?&rdquo; What is the improvement in the trade in the towns?  It is practically nil.  I have asked, why is that so?  I got two answers from my local friends&mdash; (1) that the farmers generally have no money; they do not come into the towns because they have no money to spend; there was an increase in prices about last September, but since last September there has been a collapse in cattle prices generally.  That is the obvious explanation.  There is another explanation, namely that the <Col N="671" /> farmers may have scraped together a few pounds, but those who have are so uncertain of their position as a result of the jumping up and down of prices in the last few months that they are afraid to go in and spend the few pounds that they may have got together.  But the fact is there.  There is no distribution of money in the ordinary way of business.  There may be distribution of money by the Government, but if there is, that is largely confined to the Government as an employer, a collector and a spender of money.  That is the unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands asked us to leave out of our calculations the last couple of years, because of the world crisis&mdash;because of the international crisis.  It was only towards the end of his speech that it dawned on him that there was a similar crisis during our term of office, much more serious indeed, as affecting business.  What was the situation over a number of years? We are speaking of the international situation as a fact affecting us here. Let us get down to realities.  The world situation may affect us, but we know perfectly well, so far as we are affected by the trend of trade outside this country, particularly so far as selling our goods is concerned, it is principally the business curve in Great Britain that affects us.  What was the situation there?  There was nothing in that particular situation in the last couple of years&mdash;1938-39&mdash;that will explain the Government's system of putting people into employment being practically brought to a stop.  There was nothing of the kind.  The year 1929 is the one in which the crisis occurred regarding the difficulty of trade.  Taking 100 as the then figure, trade fell rapidly in the couple of years afterwards until by 1931 it came down to 80.  But by 1935 trade was better than in 1929 before the crisis started.  Everything in those years was in favour of the Fianna Fáil Government.  There was the rising trade curve in the case of our principal customer.  Did we take advantage of that?  If so, it is not shown in the employment figures that were before <Col N="672" /> the House to-night and last week.  In 1936 the figure stood at 110; therefore much better than in 1931 and even than in 1929; in 1937 it was 113, but by the end of that year it fell to 110, in 1938 it was down to 100, but in 1939 the curve again went up to 110.  In fact you have this situation that the two years which the Minister for Lands and his colleague the Minister for Finance, want to exclude from their calculations the figures were much higher in the matter of British trade than in 1929, to say nothing of what they were in 1930 and 1931.</P>
    <P>The main question we ought to ask ourselves is&mdash;is it wise to continue the policy of reckless expenditure that the Government has sponsored in order to &ldquo;redistribute&rdquo; money?  Social services are one thing.  It is useless for the Government to pretend that we are asking for economies and that we want economies in the social services. As we have pointed out here several times in the last couple of months, the Government could save not merely useless but harmful expenditure.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition quoted the Army expenditure, and pointed out that it was actually over £3,500,000, a sad comparison with what it was in our time.  But he was actually a trifle too modest, because when you look at the expenditure for the Army you do not find it all under the head of the Army. There is other expenditure for the Army by different departments under other Votes.  We find that the total money to be spent one way and another on the Army for the present year is not £3,355,000, but adding all these things together, £4,400,000.  Yet we have a Government which says, &ldquo;It is rubbish to talk of economy&rdquo;.  We believe that this is not merely extravagance but really harmful expenditure.  Judging by the way in which the money has been spent it is helping to deteriorate the Army and to make it a less efficient instrument for the main purpose for which we want it.  Yet we have this big Estimate presented to us as if this country were passing not through an era of trial but through an era of undoubted prosperity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> As shown by the figures produced here last week and to-night there is undoubtedly a grave interference with ordinary employment.  You have only to consult the employers through the country to find that that conclusion is unfortunately borne out by what they will tell you.  The figures were playfully dealt with by the Minister for Lands until he began to find them awkward.  Then he adopted an excellent expedient.  When he came to a figure that was awkward he hesitated, he simply baulked and did not give the figure.  Other Ministers do not do that sort of thing.  They see the awkward figure afar off, and when a question is asked they reply: &ldquo;I will not tell you&rdquo;.  When the Minister for Lands came to the jump he did not take it.</P>
    <P>It is a serious thing for the country which has had to face the dislocation of business in order that the policy which is now being tried for a number of years should be given another trial in order that the Minister for Finance could, perhaps, in the course of the next few years do penance for his &ldquo;spend and do not stop spending&rdquo; policy.  That policy is leading nowhere except to a situation that everybody in the country except the Government knows.  I think there are members of the Government who know it.  If there are such members their voice is not effectively heard in the Executive Council because it is quite obvious from the Book of Estimates that that same policy is being still pursued.  Where there is a saving, it is a saving in those Departments that might be helpful to agriculture and so on.  It is a saving only in those items that give employment, but there is no evidence of a dawning sense of reality about Ministers so far as this financial policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy's figures are absolutely conclusive even if you refuse to regard them as figures giving absolute numbers of employed and take them as figures showing the trend of employment. Taking them as showing the latter, then the trend disclosed by these figures is the greatest condemnation you could bring forward of the financial policy of the Government over a number of years.  We do not expect <Col N="674" /> the Government to put on sack-cloth and ashes but we do hope that, without making public confession of their faults, they will change their policy. If there were any evidence in this Book of Estimates of their determination to change their policy we might have some hope.  It is because there is no such evidence that we are bound to guide ourselves not by our hopes but by our experience.  A sufficient number of years has now elapsed to enable us to judge the value of the Government's policy for producing employment and increasing wealth in the normal way, even by subsidising industries. By whichever of these standards you judge Government policy, it is clear that, from the national point of view, it has completely failed and ought to be radically changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the excuses made by the Government for the increase in expenditure over the last eight years was that it was mainly due to circumstances beyond their control. Deputy Kissane repeated that excuse in a speech this afternoon.  May I suggest that many of the difficulties we labour under are due not to circumstances beyond the Government's control but to the fact that they tried to control things which rapidly got beyond their control.  I do not intend to go very extensively into statistics or figures.  Perhaps, I would not have got up at all but for the repeated challenges thrown out by the Minister for Lands to the farming Deputies of this side because they did not get up and speak on this occasion.  He hinted that they were afraid to speak.  I should like, however, to make reference to the figure of 120,000 as representing the unemployed.  If Ministers and members of the Government Party had not very short memories, they would recall that eight or nine years ago they declared in no uncertain language that unemployment, which was then much lower than it is now, could be abolished and rapidly abolished and, at the same time, that taxation could be reduced by £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone on for eight years since then and, instead of a reduction of taxation, we have taxation increased by £11,000,000.  If we give the Government <Col N="675" /> credit for the amount they collected in respect of the remission of annuities and local loans, they have, probably, £14,000,000 or £15,000,000 more to spend annually than the previous Government had to spend. If something useful had been done for that money there would not be the grumble in this House that there is.  Is the average Deputy aware that this huge sum would have sufficed to put every single unemployed man in this State at work at £2 per week?  It would have sufficed to put agriculture into such a condition that this would probably be the most prosperous agricultural country in the world.  Instead of that we have a policy pursued which, notwithstanding the expenditure of £15,000,000 additional per year, has left us with a substantial addition to our unemployed and a largely impoverished agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands tried to refute the figures put forward so ably by Deputy Mulcahy.  When he became confused in the mass of figures, his only refuge was agriculture and he told us the Deputies on this side had made no reference to agriculture in this debate. Possibly, for the Minister, it was a case of &ldquo;out of the frying pan into the fire&rdquo; because, if Deputies on the Labour Benches and on other benches are interested in the countless people without work, there is no less dissatisfaction amongst 90 per cent. of the agriculturists regarding their present condition. The main cause of the trouble in regard to unemployment and expenditure on social services is the Ministry's policy in regard to agriculture.  It is not so long since the economic war, and may I remind Deputies opposite that that war, which we won, or are supposed to have won, was a costly war. It cost the agricultural community and, through the agricultural community, every other individual in this country, including the workless, many of the sacrifices which they have had to endure in the last four or five years.  How much the agricultural community lost by that war, which was won, has been variously computed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies cannot, however, dispute the figures furnished by the British customs authorities.  The duties collected by the British customs authorities on our cattle amounted to £26,396,077.  The Minister cannot deny that that money came out of the farmers' pockets.  That takes no account of the cattle exported which paid no duty.  Some thousands of cattle went across the Border into Northern Ireland and escaped duty but the farmer lost on these cattle as well as on the others.  It does not include the cattle sold at home, which are stated to be almost equal in number to those exported.  No Minister can say that the farmer did not lose on these cattle as he lost on the exported cattle because the home price was governed by the export price.  There were millions lost in that way.  Any estimate short of £50,000,000 or £60,000,000&mdash;if I were to make an estimate I would put it much higher&mdash;would be a false estimate of the losses of the farmers during the economic war.  You cannot take £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 out of the chief industry of our country in a limited number of years and expect that industry or other industries depending upon it to prosper.  That is still the crux in regard to the activities of the Ministry now in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Ministry had attempted to assist agriculture in a manner similar to that adopted in regard to industry, the position might be different.  If, instead of setting up countless new industries with every sort of protection it was possible to give them, and with every calculation made in respect of them before they were set up, they had devoted their energies to assisting agriculture, everything might have been different here.  I think a wise suggestion came from Deputy Childers. It is a suggestion which I myself made at another period, that the farmers' position should be that his production costs should be assured and a certain small interest on his capital investment also assured.  I think Deputy Childers made reference to that point, but if he did not, I apologise for attributing it to him.  I heard, on the wireless last night, the British Minister of Agriculture saying that the British agriculturists <Col N="677" /> must definitely be assured their costs of production and an amount necessary to pay their workers a reasonable wage, with some small profit for themselves.  That is all we have ever demanded, and that is what we now demand and which failure to grant will leave this country in possibly a worse position than that in which it has been for the last five or six years.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to the attempts which the Government have made to bolster up every little artificial industry that could be bolstered up?  Every investigation was made as to their prospects and if there was one chance in a million of success, an industry was started.  The capital of the people proposing to set it up was investigated and, if they had not enough capital, capital was placed at their disposal.  Costings were made out as to the probable expenditure necessary to put an industry on a proper footing, and arrangements were made eventually for protection to such an extent that there would be a reasonable profit given on the money invested and provision made to pay a fair wage to all workers employed, and also that if the investors happened to be directors, they also would get a reasonable salary.  What is the position with regard to agriculture?  Did the Government ever take any pains to investigate whether the farmer got anything near his cost of production, whether he got enough to pay his labourers a reasonable wage, or whether he got any profit on his capital investment?  I make bold to say that there is not a Deputy even on the Fianna Fáil benches who will say that even if, in the luckiest event, a farmer was able to pay a reasonable wage to a fair number of workers, he ever got anything at all as interest on his capital investment.  Ministers will argue that there was no room for such an investigation in this country.</P>

      <P>If the Chair wishes that I should make no further reference to agriculture, I shall not do so.  I am always ready to obey the rulings of the Chair.  With regard to unemployment, Deputy Mulcahy gave certain figures to show the effect of Fianna Fáil policy in reducing employment as compared with the effect of the policy of the previous Government.  I think he proved his case to the satisfaction of every Deputy and of all the Ministers.  There was an attempt by the Minister for Lands to challenge me to speak of agriculture when he was trying to refute Deputy <Col N="679" /> Mulcahy's figures.  He began by reading statistics and when he found them beyond him, he dropped them, and it was then that he flung his challenge to me and to other Deputies here.  One interesting reference he did make was to Deputy Mulcahy's argument that the number employed should be reduced by the number engaged in housing as the housing figures would be non-recurrent. I think that argument was sound and I do not think any Deputy can refute it.  The Minister put forward the argument, however, that if Deputy Mulcahy deducted the figure for housing, he might just as well have deducted the figure for building industries.  I hope <Col N="680" /> the Minister has not so poor an opinion of the eventual success of the industries which have been started under huge tariffs and of the employment they will give that he thinks that that employment is going to be of as temporary a character as employment in the building of a house.  I hope the Minister for Finance has a better opinion of the ultimate prospects of some of these industries than the Minister for Lands.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
