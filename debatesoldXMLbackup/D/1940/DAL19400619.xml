      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, having regard to the threatened closing down of the Dublin United Tramways Company's workshops at Inchicore and the consequent disemployment of a further batch of skilled and unskilled workers, he is in a position to state what progress has been made towards obtaining supplies of bus materials; and if, having regard to the fact that several hundred members of various trades have been discharged during the past few months owing to the shortage of materials referred to, he can state what prospects there are of the re-employment of these workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as regards the supplies needed by the Dublin United Tramways Company for their 'bus building programme has been receiving the attention of my Department for some time past.  The Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate the very serious difficulty in the way of getting supplies of this kind in the present circumstances.  I regret it is impossible for me to give any assurance in the matter or to express an opinion as to the prospects of the workers in the Inchicore workshops being re-employed, but every effort is being, and will be made to assist the Company in getting their requirement of imported materials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if there is any material available at <Col N="1730" /> the present time at the North Wall, and is he in a position to say if there is any reason, other than that of the materials, for the discharge of those men?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he has considered the desirability, in view of the difficulty of the supply of material and the prospective difficulty of the supply of fuel for buses, of representing to the tramway company that it might be desirable to postpone for the present the completion of the change-over from trams to buses, and of restoring a number of trams, which depend on Shannon current, to the lines off which they have been taken in recent months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That aspect of the matter has been fully considered. There are many arguments for both courses.  We decided that the arguments were in favour of permitting the change-over to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, while admitting that the matter has been considered and a decision taken, see that the tram lines and overhead wires are not removed for the present, so that if some new contingency should arise the alternative of returning to the trams will still be open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that in some cases the tram lines and overhead wires are not in a good state of repair and probably would have to be renewed in any event which, of course, is one of the difficulties of maintaining the tramway system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will consider the matter of preserving trams <Col N="1731" /> on perhaps a few of the lines, even if they are to disappear altogether on other lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will also remember the greater mobility of the buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in normal times the advantage is with the buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that many manufacturers and merchants are desirous of laying in reserve stocks of essential commodities to meet serious eventualities, but are precluded from doing so owing to their inability to get any cover in the form of war risk insurance; and if he will seriously consider this position with a view to inaugurating a scheme of State-controlled or State-aided insurance against war risks for such stocks as may be stored within the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had definite evidence that manufacturers and merchants desiring to buy reserve stocks have been precluded from doing so owing to inability to get insurance cover against war risks, but recently the Federation of Irish Manufactures has suggested that this danger exists. I have asked the Federation, in consultation with the Chambers of Commerce or other interested bodies, to consider what scheme of commodity insurance would, in their judgement, be best in present circumstances.  I have promised to give careful consideration to any such proposal.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, with deep regret we learned, since we met here a week ago, of the unexpected death of Deputy Seamus Moore. Go ndeanaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy was associated with the movement for Irish Independence for many years prior to his entry into this House where, for the past thirteen years, he represented the constituency of Wicklow.  The Deputy had the keenest sense of his responsibilities as a member of Dáil Eireann, and gave devoted service to his constituents. His interventions in debate were always marked by sound common sense and constructive suggestions, especially when industrial development and agriculture were under discussion. Deputy Moore's last public meeting was in support of the measures for national defence agreed upon by all Parties in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that item No. 8&mdash;Saint Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill&mdash;is controversial business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just been informed that some matter has been raised with regard to that being controversial business.  I understand that refers to the Local Government Bill as well as to the Saint Laurence O'Toole Bill.  I had not an opportunity of discussing it with my colleagues, who represent this side of the House on the Defence Conference, when the matter was raised.  But with regard to the Local Government Bill I cannot for the life of me see how this measure can be regarded <Col N="1734" /> as controversial.  Certainly there is no Party interest involved in it.  Some questions might be raised with regard to the matter of the representation of local authorities or perhaps the setting up of parish councils but with regard to the other matters all we are doing is bringing the law into line and removing doubts that existed.  With regard to the St. Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill, the position is that the Bill was introduced into the House last March; its Second Reading was passed on the 24th April without a division; it went on to the Committee Stage on the 9th May and was again taken up on the 22nd May in Committee.  The main contentious amendment had practically been disposed of so far as I am aware.  In addition I might point out that there had been a good deal of consultation with the representatives of the local hospitals and I felt certain that I had satisfied these representatives of the local hospitals on the points raised. The question of the site was a matter that could not be settled but they were satisfied with the assurance given that every aspect of that matter would be carefully gone into and considered before any decision would be taken by the Local Government Department on the matter of the site.  I am not prepared to tie myself down to any particular site but every relevant matter will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest, before a decision is taken that the Local Government Department would, at least, discuss the matter with us outside the House and we may be able to arrive at a <i>modus vivendi?</i>  The Minister naturally takes his view as we take ours.  I do not doubt that in a short conversation outside a <i>modus vivendi</i> could be arrived at.  At this juncture it is desirable that matters that may raise any sort of controversy should, if possible, be avoided, but if it is impossible to avoid them and if it has got to be done it has got to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the St. Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill is concerned I want to point out that my recollection <Col N="1735" /> is not at all in accordance with the recollection of the Minister&mdash; he said that the Bill passed the Second Reading without a division.  That is not my recollection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but it is not mine.  As regards the second point, in this matter I might say that the Parliamentary Secretary is the Minister and he has not agreed with anybody as regards the site.  In respect of this Bill the Parliamentary Secretary is the Minister and he has laid it down that the present site of the Richmond Hospital is not to be the site of the St. Laurence O'Toole Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, our recollection is again at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The present site is not excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered it was. Now, as far as that Bill is concerned, on that point there are two questions at issue, (1) the site and (2) the constitution of the board.  I have not been in touch with anybody in connection with the hospital since the Third Reading and I am satisfied that no matter what the particular board may be or what the Government may do the people affected, the people of that part of the city, want no site but the present site.  I submit that point to the Minister.  Does the Minister agree with that?  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that the present constitution of that board was perhaps the best of any hospital in the country at the present moment. Now as regards the other measure our objection to it was from a different angle.  It is quite true with respect to the Local Government Bill that from the political angle the present is not the time to consider it.  It is not because there is political controversy in connection with it but rather that it was introduced at a time which was <Col N="1736" /> unsuitable having regard to the circumstances that exist in Europe and that, therefore, the Bill would not get that close consideration which a Bill of that kind ought to get.  I was not aware that there was anything controversial in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage there is one thing the Minister might be able to settle and that is with regard to the position of the Local Government officials.  That matter might be settled and if that were settled it is quite possible there would be no objection to the Bill as such except the point made by Deputy Brennan&mdash;that this was not the time for considering a Bill of that sort-With regard to the St. Laurence O'Toole Bill, I want to say again that I am in disagreement with the statement made by the Minister&mdash;that it passed the Second Reading without a division; secondly, that the Parliamentary Secretary who is the Minister in this Bill said he would not accept the present site and thirdly, that he is going to have three boards&mdash;the present board, No. 2 board and the elected board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that in respect of the Local Government Bill it represents a divergence of viewpoint in respect of what is the best method of local government in this country. To that extent it may be said to be on an entirely different plane from the scheme of management for the hospital. I have been strongly opposed to the scheme of municipal government envisaged in the County Management Bill and apparently envisaged by this Bill.  I imagine that at the present moment the Government will be anxious to avoid anything controversial in the matter of local government. Nobody bothers about this Bill but the officials of the Local Government Department.  If at the present stage of the world they can find time to discuss that I envy them their complacency of mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable sort of Bill and it embodies a viewpoint with which we are in agreement. It may not be possible to hold them before that date, not even then.  But would the Minister treat himself to an extensive flight of imagination and tell us why it is necessary to pass this Bill now if it is not intended to hold local government elections before September, 1941?  I am aware that some people have an excessive sense of tidiness in this matter.  I strongly urge the Minister not to proceed with this Bill.  I have tried all the time to get a discussion outside the House.  There is no need for this Bill if it is not intended to hold the elections before September 1941.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, to add at the end of Section 4, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring that an instalment order shall provide for payment of the whole of the debt and costs within the period during which such order continues in force.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to make it clear that the justice is under no obligation to fix instalments at such an amount as would ensure payment of the debt within the period of six years in a case where he is satisfied that the payment of such instalments would be too heavy a strain on the debtor.  As I have already explained, the intention is that in the case of a very large debt the justice should order the debtor to pay as much as he can during the period of six years and that if a balance is left over at the end of the six-year period the creditor should forego that amount unless some remedy other than the instalment order procedure is open to him.  I think that meets the point Deputy Cosgrave raised on the last occasion.</P>

      <P>In page 3, Section 6, line 39, to delete the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to delete the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; so that at the end of the six-year period if an instalment is still outstanding the creditor could pursue the debtor for 12 months instead of six months.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the second amending Bill to the Emergency Powers Act.  Although a very small Bill, it is a very important one.  Section 2 proposes to delete certain words from the Principal Act.  These words are:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or the making of provision for the trial by courts-martial of persons not being persons subject to military law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I had better read Section 3, which is self-explanatory:</P>
      <P>The Government may, by an order under Section 2 of the Principal Act, make provision for the trial, in a summary manner, by commissioned officers of the Defence Forces, of any person alleged to have committed any offence specified in such order, and, in case of the conviction of such person of such offence, for the imposition and the carrying out of the sentence of death, and no appeal shall lie in respect of such conviction or sentence.</P>

An order will be issued when this Bill is passed setting out the procedure under which this court will be set up, and, <Col N="1740" /> if Deputies wish to raise any question about that order, of course, it will be within their right to do so.  The Bill simply deals with this one matter.  It is, however, very important, but I can assure the House that the Government would not have brought in any such Bill if they did not think it was absolutely essential in a time like the present.</P>

      <P>On the Fifth Stage it is expedient to say as a matter of record that the gravity and the character of this Bill are not lost sight of and that in normal times, when the nation was not threatened by great danger, no representative assembly would give powers analogous to those now being given to the Government.  It is with a full appreciation of the magnitude of those powers and the distance we have been asked to go that we consent to this Bill.  We do it only because we are assured by the Government that these wide powers are necessary for the safety of the State.  In that knowledge, we give them those powers, believing that this democracy is capable of using such powers for the protection of the State and the ultimate preservation of the liberties of us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is an amending Bill, and the principal provision is to fix the compensation to minor and other curers who went out of business as a result of legislation that was brought in formerly.  We thought in our last Act we were fixing the compensation, but evidently there was some difference of legal opinion.  In the particular case that came up as a test case, two out of the three arbitrators agreed, but legal opinion was divided and some lawyers thought that even a majority could not decide the question. It is laid down in this Bill that if there is a majority decision that decision will hold.  If there is not a majority decision, that is, if three arbitrators <Col N="1742" /> disagree the Minister may appoint one to decide, and that one will not be the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission. I might say that awards have been made without going to the commission where there was agreement between the board and the applicants. and in nine cases they amounted roughly to about £13,000.  There are still three claims from minor curers, and four claims from those who did not qualify as minor curers.  I think the majority will be going to arbitration. Apart from that, there are some minor amendments which might be regarded as oversights in the last Act.</P>
      <P>In Section 3 it is proposed to delete the word &ldquo;half-year&rdquo; which was inadvertently included for the words &ldquo;levy period&rdquo;.  These words were used all through that Act but in former Acts &ldquo;half-year&rdquo; was used.  The proposal here is to bring the wording into line.  Section 4 will amend Section 37 of the Act of 1939.  In sub-section (1) the term used with regard to the collection of levy refers to where bacon is brought on to the premises.  In sub-section (3) which also deals with the levy the words used were &ldquo;bought or purchased by the bacon curer&rdquo;.  It is conceivable, although it will not happen often, that a bacon curer might be liable for levy under one sub-section and not under another sub-section.  It is better to have the wording uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to remind Deputies that the reason there are two sub-sections is that there was a fixed levy of 9d. towards an insurance fund for condemned offals, and that was deductible from the producer, but it was laid down in the sub-section that if 9d. was not sufficient a supplemental levy could be made, and would be taken from the bacon curers.  Section 5 deals with the question of subsidies on bacon sold &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;.  As a matter of fact there has been no subsidy since the Act was passed.  If a subsidy is payable that is a matter that must be settled.  At the present time bacon curers sell their bacon net, f.o.b., but legally that might be held to be bacon sold within the State. The amendment is necessary, so that bacon must be sold and consumed <Col N="1743" /> within the State in order to qualify for that type of levy.</P>

      <P>Section 6 deals with a matter about which there was some doubt legally.  It was doubtful if it was legal to pay insurance on condemned offals.  This section removes any doubt of that kind.  If it is passed the insurance fund will be held to cover condemned offals.  Deputy Dillon asked for information about the bacon position.  There is nothing new. Deputies are aware that when the Minister for Supplies and I were in London, amongst the questions we wanted settled was a bigger quota for bacon.  We did not get agreement with the British Government on that occasion.  Certain points were to be dealt with by the British Government. Our position is very simple.  We asked them to take more bacon.  They requested some time to consider the matter from various view points, and they are still considering it, although we have been pressing them, as much as we possibly could, for a decision. When answering Deputy Dillon this day week I thought I would be certainly in a position now to say what the decision of the British Government was.  I am sorry to say I have not yet got a reply.  I had hopes for the past two or three weeks to have it every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that there is quite a lot of bacon in the curers' hands.  Our export quota is not sufficient to absorb the output of bacon, in addition to home consumption.  The only thing we can do to meet the situation is to try to have some more live pigs exported. Unfortunately, during the past four or five months a good many of the licences issued to live-pig exporters were returned.  I met the live-pig exporters yesterday and discussed <Col N="1744" /> many points.  They told me they could not possibly make their business pay during the last four or five months, but that they could make it pay now, and additional licences are being issued this month.  As well as that, the Pigs and Bacon Commission are taking pigs where they hear there is a glut.  If there is a glut in a particular market or at the gates of any particular factory they are taking the pigs and exporting them.  Admittedly, that does not deal with every case.  It deals in a fairly satisfactory way with markets where there is not likely to be sufficient purchasers, but it does not deal with centres far away from factories. It does not deal with out of the way places where there may be only a few pigs owned by a couple of farmers.  From that point of view we recognise that the only satisfactory way of getting this dealt with is to try to get an enlarged quota, so that there would be demand for pigs from producers. We are doing everything we possibly can in that way.</P>

We may have overdone that.  We were, however, only 7,000 cwts. or 8,000 cwts. for the month short of the quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes in the situation from day to day are of such a microscopic character that, for the first time, I am not prepared to find grave fault with any error into which the Minister may fall.  I think that it is virtually impossible to keep track of the situation from week to week or intelligently to anticipate what is going to happen.  However, there are certain over-riding activities that, I think, we should maintain here&mdash;sometimes losing money and sometimes making money on them&mdash;in order to ensure the maintenance of pig production.  I think that these measures are requisite during the period of adjustment which must be lived through until forces outside this country which we cannot control shall have stabilised themselves. The first consideration is to keep the people in the production of pigs <Col N="1746" /> because, taking the long view, that is the right thing for the people in their own interests to do.  It is very easy, if you have ample capital, to take a long view in your business but the man whose capital will permit him to buy only two pairs of pigs is very frequently not able to carry a transient loss in order to reap the profit which he may reasonably expect to get in the distant future One of the things that will drive our people out of pigs more quickly than anything else is the experience, when the pigs are ready for sale, that they cannot be readily cashed.  There is no use at this stage in going back on the old controversy as to whether or not it was wise to break up our fairs and markets.  I do not want to do that but the effect of our factory purchasing has been to destroy the fairs and markets in a great many centres and to facilitate every kind of abuse in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister is right in ensuring that buyers will be sent to every centre where he anticipates a surplus and that he is right in taking these pigs and exporting them himself or exporting them through the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board.  I think that he ought to go a little further. He ought to take the almanac and study the list of fairs.  There are certain districts which are pig-producing districts.  West Cork is one.  Donegal ought to be another.  North-west Cavan is a third.  Mayo and, I think, parts of north Galway would be readily recognised as a fourth. Monaghan&mdash;my own constituency&mdash; would be a fifth.  Parts of Louth might also be properly described as preeminently pig-producing areas.  I should like the Minister, for a while in any case, to provide that in each of these fairs, as a precautionary measure, he would have a buyer.  That would mean that there would have to be five or six fairs attended every day of the week.  You would want five or six men on the road all the time.  I do not think that that will be necessary for long.  But take the case of the town of Roscommon.  At the last fair in Roscommon, there was no buyer at all and the whole fair of pigs went home.  That has a deplorable effect. The Minister may find that his buyers <Col N="1747" /> are standing at fairs day after day at which their intervention is unnecessary but I think that the expense would be amply justified by the certainly that, if an emergency arose, there would be a ready vent through which it could be liquidated.  I deliberately urge on the Minister the desirability of doing that now&mdash;promptly, without protracted investigation or excogitation.  Try it and, if it proves hopelessly impracticable, you can drop it.  These are times of quick decisions. Quick decisions can occasionally prevent great losses, even if you have to amend your decisions after experience. You cannot deal with this matter as you would deal with it a few years ago&mdash;by examination, excogitation and providing against all possible contingencies.  You must deal with the matter at once and, if something unexpected arises, you can mend your hand to meet the new contingency.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  Perhaps my daring in this matter will give the Minister courage.  There was no more zealous critic of the maize-meal admixture scheme than I, and I pride myself that I killed it.  I am going to ask the Minister to embark on a maize-meal admixture scheme now on the right lines.  This matter is obviously tied up with the maintenance of pig supplies. It is vital to the maintenance of pig supplies and I think the Chair has indicated that it is prepared to allow a general discussion on the pig question on this occasion.  We must face the fact that although Indian corn is getting cheaper every day and although there is a glut in the Argentine as a result of Denmark and Holland and other European countries being excluded from the markets, freight rates are still high&mdash;not as high as they were, taking war risks into account, but bottoms are scarce and may be more scarce.  We may be confronted with a situation next autumn in which there will be virtually no maize meal at all.  When you see ahead of you a situation such as that, two things must occur to you at once. In the first place, it is very difficult to get people to change the ration they are accustomed to give to their live <Col N="1748" /> stock and, secondly, it is very difficult to get the pig to adjust his digestion to the new type of food.  We have got to make a change next autumn whether we like it or not and we ought to put our hands to it now.  The way to run a maize-meal admixture scheme is not to bring your materials together and then go through the expensive process of mixing them but to notify every retail distributor that he cannot buy from a mill a measure of maize meal without accepting in the same delivery a proportionate measure of barley meal or Sussex ground oats.  If that regulation is made, every retail distributor in this country will raise a frantic clamour that it is impossible, impracticable, tyrannical&mdash;in fact, that it is all cod.</P>
    <P>If I order a ton of Indian meal and I am offered a ton of Sussex ground oats and barley I will make the welkin ring, but I will sell the ground oats and the barley meal rather than burn it; I will sell it if I have to sell it. Instead of handing a man out one cwt. of meal when he asks for it, I will give him a sales talk on the food value of Sussex ground oats and barley meal and, if I am not fit to do that, the sooner I am out of business as a retail distributor the better it will be for myself and for the country.  It involves no extra expense whatever; there is no additional expense.  The barley meal will have to be sold at an economic price; Sussex ground oats will have to be sold at an economic price.  The oats may be prepared in some other form.  Sussex ground oats is probably the most acceptable form in which to offer oats as an animal foodstuff because, though you could incorporate the hull in oatmeal for many types of live stock, there are other types of live stock that it will not suit.  Sussex ground oats will suit a fattening fowl or a milch cow.  There are certain forms in which you could give oats to a milch cow and it will do her a considerable amount of good, but you could not offer them in that form to a pig.  Sussex ground oats is good for live stock in the due proportion that is suitable for the particular animal.  You cannot give a pig more than a certain quantity of oats, but that is not true of a cow or a fowl. <Col N="1749" /> These are things to be borne in mind by those actually raising the stock.</P>
    <P>My point is that that ought to be done now, because at this stage we can make it incumbent on the shopkeeper to impose on his customers a very small proportion of their orders in the form of barley, meal and oats and so they can slowly adjust themselves to the new mixture which they will have to use next autumn.  We can increase the proportion of barley and oats in July and again in August and again in September until we are able to keep a proper balance between the domestically-produced foodstuff and the imported article.  Furthermore, to take that step now will relieve the situation that has arisen in regard to the oat crop.</P>
    <P>For some strange reason, the nature of which I do not quite understand, no farmer bought seed oats this year.  The Government did not foresee that contingency, with the result that they permitted the oat meal manufacturers to import about 5,000 tons of Canadian oats last April, thinking the Irish oats would all be consumed as seed.  The Irish oats were not consumed as seed and there is an immense carry-over of the oats from last harvest.  If that carry-over is allowed to remain there until the new oats come in, there may be a collapse in the price of oats.  It would be purely artificial and transient, but it would be very undesirable, because it would hit the smallest man, the man who has to sell his oats as a cash crop.  He is the man who will be forced out into the market when the market is smashed by the carry-over from last year, and the &ldquo;wise guy&rdquo; who can carry his oats over until the spring and finance that operation will get the higher price that will obtain when the carry-over surplus has been absorbed in the normal course.  I want to absorb that surplus now before it becomes a carry-over.  I think a substantial part of it could be so absorbed if the feeding value of oats was exploited and if oats were made a compulsory part of every diet for live stock between now and the next harvest.</P>
    <P>Subject to those two suggestions, my advice to the Minister is to do the best he can.  If any of us can fly a kite for him or help him in any way to improve <Col N="1750" /> business relations with the British Government, he should let us know, and, in any way we can do it, we will be glad to assist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he met some of the licensed exporters during the week and they told him that, while during the last few months they were not able to make the business pay&mdash;and I think he will agree that it was not possible to make it pay in that period&mdash;they have a prospect of better conditions in the future.  I should like the Minister to give us more information as to what is happening in regard to this industry. During the past week or so, large numbers of pigs have been offered for sale all over the country, but no sales were effected.  Very few pigs have been bought in any market, and the position is becoming most serious.  It is very detrimental to the pig industry that that state of affairs should exist.  It is very costly to produce pigs, and it is very easy for the producer to lose heavily in the matter of pig production. There is no surer way of putting a man out of production than to allow that condition of things to exist.  We were told by the Minister that where the commission anticipated that pigs were not going to be bought up, they sent buyers down to purchase the animals.  In my part of the country I am not aware that any representatives of the commission attended fairs in order to buy pigs.  I do know that pigs have been left wholesale at various markets, and they had to be brought home again by the producers.  That means that these pigs will get heavy and over the standard weight, and that will reduce them considerably in value. The situation is becoming so serious that I think the Minister will have to tackle it right away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that it would be wise for the commission to have a representative at every pig fair throughout the country.  It would not follow that that representative should buy pigs, but, in the event of there being a surplus of pigs, he would be in a position to take them over from the producers.  That is the only way to protect the industry.  I do not know the position in regard to cold storage, but <Col N="1751" /> if we have sufficient cold storage, the problem ought not to present any great difficulty.  The Minister indicates that there is no difficulty about getting licences.  If we have not used all the licences, it means that there are not sufficient people to use them.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister should not confine the issue of licences to any particular individual. If a man is prepared to export pigs he ought to get licences.  If a man brings pigs to the North Wall, and applies for the necessary licences, he is entitled to them and should get them.  Why confine the issue of licences to people who were in the business last year?  If a man wants to enter into the export of pigs, under that provision he cannot do so, simply because he was not exporting last year.  I think you are giving those people who were exporting a certain amount of protection by doing that and the position is that the pigs are left on the farmers' hands. It is a dreadful state of affairs to find that when pig producers arrive at a market there is no one to buy their pigs.  That is the extraordinary position at the present time.  Vast numbers of pigs all over the country were left on the producers' hands during the last week or ten days and that matter should be remedied right away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will see his way to relieve the situation in regard to the surplus of pigs. He must know that this imposes a very <Col N="1752" /> severe hardship, particularly on the smaller people.  There is a more serious matter to be considered at the moment, and that is that the present prices are not by any means remunerative, having regard to the cost of feeding. There is no margin of profit for feeding pigs at the present time because feeding stuffs are costing up to 14/- per cwt.  The necessary steps should be taken to organise supplies of feeding stuffs during the next few months. The Department should consider the desirability of organising both imported and home-produced supplies.  I think farmers would welcome any measures that may be adopted, no matter how drastic they may be, because otherwise the pig producing industry cannot be carried on.</P>
      <P>With regard to compensation for small curers, there are quite a number of them in my constituency who have been unable to procure any compensation whatever.  I should like to know from the Minister if it will be possible, under this Bill, to meet the claims of those who have been applying for compensation during the past five or six years.</P>

      <P>Two principal points were raised in the debate on this Bill, the first with regard to the marketing of pigs, and the second with regard to the feeding of pigs.  The commission have made up their mind to attend in future every possible market where they think pigs will be on offer.  They may have made a mistake in not attending a market like that at Roscommon to which Deputy Dillon referred.  Deputies could help a good deal if they would give a list of the markets which they think the commission should attend.  If that list is furnished, I am sure the commission will attend.  As a matter of fact they have attended markets in the last few weeks.  In one place, I think, they got only one pig, and in some others only two or three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter well worth attending to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is better to make a mistake in that direction than not to attend.  I <Col N="1753" /> simply mention that to indicate that they have been going to places where they were not too sure of getting pigs. Naturally, they would go to a market which they had been asked to attend by a Deputy and where the Deputy feared that, otherwise, pigs would not be taken up.  With regard to licences, a certain number of them were issued. There was a general understanding with the British Government that the export of live pigs would not be increased. We were told that, if there was an increase, the export of live pigs would have to be controlled.  The object in issuing these licences was to keep us roughly within the number that it was desired should be exported. It does not make a lot of difference if we do 400 or 500 pigs more this month than we did in the corresponding month of last year, but what it means is that we have to give out licences.  We found that the best thing to do was to give licences on the basis of exports in the same month last year.  That is the basis on which licences have been given out up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any individual who wants to export his own pigs, I think it would be just as well that he should do so through the commission.  The commission would do that on either of two bases.  For example, if there is a live scales available, they will purchase the pigs at the live weight, pay on that basis for them, and then take the chance of exporting them, or, if the producer wishes, in a case where there is no live scales available, the commission will take the pigs from him and export them as his agent.  Personally, I think it would be safer for the producer to get the commission to do that for him rather than that he should do it himself, because at the present time there are certain regulations to be complied with as to the particular agents that the pigs must go to on the other side.  There are also matters to be attended to in connection with insurance. The commission will do all that for the producer, and will then give him what he is entitled to for his pigs, after deducting the expenses incurred on his behalf.  The producer, of course, would, in any event, have to pay those expenses if he exported himself. <Col N="1754" /> The advantage of getting the commission to do it is this, that there will be somebody there to do the business who will not make any mistake so far as complying with the regulations is concerned.  Really, I do not think there is much object in giving licences to producers, or farmers, in view of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The weakness I see in the Minister's case is this: that if there are only five or ten pigs to be exported from a centre the transport charges will be too high, because with that number a man will not be able to fill a wagon.  On the other hand, if you give a licence to a man in a district to export he will be able to fill a wagon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man has only five or six pigs to export the commission will not victimise him by making him pay extra transport charges.  With regard to the second point raised by Deputy Dillon, there is no doubt that there is a danger that we may not be able to get as much feeding stuffs as we would like into the country in the coming months.  We have discussed that question interdepartmentally.  I should also say that we had some preliminary discussions with the millers on it. This really is more a matter for the Department of Supplies than for my Department, though, of course, both Departments are very much concerned in it.  In my discussions with the maize millers, about this time last year, when we were dropping the maize-meal admixture scheme, it was visualised that something like this might happen in the event of an outbreak of war.  The maize millers expressed the wish that they might be permitted to work a scheme like this, something very much on the lines suggested by Deputy Dillon. Hence, I do not think there would be any great difficulty in getting the maize millers to adopt a scheme <Col N="1755" /> like this if we told them that the time had come for it.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that, on account of the position with regard to seed oats in the last sowing season&mdash;last spring&mdash;there may possibly be a rather poor price for oats in the beginning of next harvest.  The small amount of seed oats purchased last spring by farmers was rather extraordinary because undoubtedly a bigger acreage of oats than hitherto was sown.  The explanation, I think, must be that farmers were afraid of not being able to get it, and that they sowed either oats which they had kept themselves or bought from a neighbour and did not, as formerly, go to the seed merchants for their supplies. There is a good deal of oats on hands. That is a matter that has been causing us anxiety for some time past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves this question of the carry-over of oats, which amounts to a crisis in certain parts of the country, I would like to make an observation or two. The Minister knows that there are big oats buyers and small oats buyers. The big fellows will be able to finance this.  They will be able to suffer the loss and carry on.</P>
      <P>If you take the small oats buyer, the fellow who takes 400 or 500 barrels of oats in the season, there is this position, that as much as 400 barrels may be left on his hands.  Such men may be put to the pin of their collar to keep their business open.  The banks are pressing them for money and they cannot cash this oats.  Will the Minister be prepared to allow them to export to the North of Ireland or to Great Britain or, if he has made up his mind against that course because of its being dangerous, would he institute some pooling system if he wants to keep this oats in the country and offer to take it off their hands for cash? These men would hold the oats for him or they could consign it to a central depôt.  I know there are numbers of people who have invested money in oats who are now gravely embarrassed by their inability to cash the oats. These people would be prepared to take a little risk but they want to avoid that if it is possible.</P>

      <P>We considered that.  The only other point was with regard to these small curers.  In the original Act there was a section dealing with compensation, and those in the trade, and I think that covered practically anybody who was in any way regularly in the bacon trade.  It did not require a person actually to kill the 52 weeks in the year.  If he killed for the greater part of the year he would be entitled to compensation.  The only thing I should advise is that those particular people who do not know exactly whether they are entitled to compensation or not should write to the board. They need not go to a solicitor to do it; if they write to the board they will get a fair, honest reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  For some time it has been considered possible to form a mutual insurance against shipping risks. The advent of the war brought that more to a point.  I should say from the time the war started a scheme has been under consideration but it took some time to hammer out a proper scheme. It is a pity we had not this scheme going from the beginning of the war because we would have got a proper, decent fund now.  This is not the time to bring in a mutual scheme but considering the position in which we now are, we think it is right to bring this in but not to have it brought into operation until the appointed day. No one would think of fixing the appointed day under the present circumstances. We have to wait for either stable war conditions or stable peace conditions.  This measure is modelled on the lines of the Slaughtered Animals (Compensation) Act, 1928, which has since been amended by two other Acts.  The board itself would be entirely responsible for the working of this scheme.  The present rates of insurance between here and Great Britain are very high.  The rate from port to port varies from 7/6 to 10/- per head for cattle; the rate for sheep from port to port varies from 7/6 to 10/- per head, store cattle 7/6 to 10/- per head, and pigs 12/6 to 15/- per head.  This is for war insurance and it includes ordinary insurance as well.  Roughly, the numbers of cattle exported would be about 600,000; sheep 350,000 and pigs 55,000, so that any Deputy can make a calculation of what the total amount is.  This Bill provides for a board of eight elected by the National Executive of the Cattle Trade Association.  They will be appointed by the Cattle Trade Association for a period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least one of these eight must be a pig exporter, and at least four must be cattle and sheep exporters.  They will create a fund by levying what they consider is a fair amount per head on cattle, sheep, lambs and so on.  The <Col N="1758" /> levy will be fixed by the Minister for Agriculture after consultation with the board.  This leavy will be payable by stamps, and the stamps will be supplied to the shipping companies and will be affixed to the shipping documents. The stamps will be printed by the board and supplied.  There are the usual penalties for those trying to use false stamps and so on.  The exporter declares the value of his animals.  He must declare the full value himself; if he does not declare the full value nobody is going to interfere, but if a claim arises he will be paid on the declared value.  There is no great danger as far as that is concerned.  If he does not want to insure his live stock at the full value he is not compelled to do so, but he uses his own valuation and he is paid on that valuation. He will not be paid more than the value, so that over-valuing is not going to do him any good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the usual rule of insurance relating to the average apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply so much in this case, but it is hard to say.  It is either a total loss or nothing in a case like that.  In war it is a total loss or nothing.  If there is no loss they will be paid nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there provision for insurance for live stock injured in transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there will be partial loss there.  They are insured from the time they leave the port here until they reach their destination.  Where cattle, sheep or pigs are sold at the other side by auction they will be covered by insurance until they reach the auction yard or until they reach the farm to which they are sent, but not for more than 72 hours after landing.  That is quite a reasonable time to give for the cattle to reach their destination.  Then the board will appoint a committee of three assessors or they will ask the live stock trade itself to appoint these assessors; in the case where the committee has appointed an assessor to value the cattle or sheep, the person <Col N="1759" /> so appointed must be an exporter, but not the person concerned in the claim. The same thing applies in the case of pigs&mdash;the person must be an exporter of pigs but must not be concerned in the particular claim.  We are departing from the ordinary insurance law here, inasmuch as we are making the assessment final and there shall be no appeal from the award of the assessors.</P>
      <P>Under the Foot and Mouth Act, on which, as I said, this was based to a great extent, there is a provision under which the Minister for Agriculture can suspend the levy if the fund reaches a certain amount.  As a matter of fact, that levy has been suspended for some years.  When the fund reached £40,000, I think it was, the levy was suspended, and I am glad to say that there has been no claim on that fund for some years past.  We do not propose in this Bill to suspend the levy, because I think the claims would be much more frequent than under the Foot and Mouth Act.  But we have power to lower the levy to a very small amount, if the board becomes prosperous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>£40,000.  I think that gives an outline of the Bill.  I should like to say again that it would have been a very good thing if we had had this Bill ready when the war commenced, as we would have had a very fine fund.  The present is not a very good time to bring this Bill into operation, but it is just as well, I think, that the Bill should be passed, so that we will be able to bring it into operation when the time arrives <Col N="1760" /> for doing it.  The cattle trade intend that this Bill should be permanent, and when the war is over they mean to go on with their own mutual insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With the general scheme here outlined we have no fault to find. But I want to make this quite clear from the very word &ldquo;go&rdquo; There are certain individuals whose livelihood will be destroyed as a result of this scheme being adopted.  There are only two or three men concerned, but they are men who have been doing an honest trade in canvassing and arranging insurance for the live stock exporters of this country.  They are men with family commitments and they have given useful service to the live stock trade when their services were badly wanted.  I am prepared to help in the improvement of this Bill by such suggestions as may be necessary on the Committee Stage; but I would help in the passage of no Bill designed to destroy the livelihood of honest men unless and until proper provision is made for them.  I believe that work could be found for these men within the four walls of this scheme, and I want the Minister to give me an undertaking on the next stage of the Bill that that has been done, or that compensation, which is fair and just in all the circumstances, has been arranged for them.  It may not be possible for the Minister to say that compensation will be found out of State funds; it may not be possible for the Minister to say that he himself will employ the displaced persons; but if he comes before the House and says that he is satisfied that the legitimate interests of these men have been safeguarded, that is good enough for me.  I think the Minister will sympathise with my anxiety to ensure that these men will not go unprotected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Live Stock Traders' Association will derive very considerable benefit under this Bill.  I am glad that they should derive that.  I have always tried to champion their cause in this House and outside, not because I love them particularly, but because I believe they are valuable public servants and that they have built up and sustained the <Col N="1761" /> live stock industry in Ireland.  But, much as I appreciate their past services to this State, and much as I hope from their services in future, I do not think I am asking too much when I ask that they should safeguard the positions of these men.  I do not believe in making requests based on the &ldquo;old school tie&rdquo;.  I think there is no use making requests unless you put a few teeth in them.  I am prepared to play ball and to help this business along if they will play ball with me.  But, if they want to get rough, I can get rough too.  I hope there will be no &ldquo;rough house&rdquo; in regard to this matter, seeing that we have so much &ldquo;rough house&rdquo; going on elsewhere in the world at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think it is probably the best and cheapest form of insurance that we could have at the present time.  I agree with the Minister that it is a pity we had not this sort of insurance protection since the inception of the war.  However, it is not too late to start.  There are just one or two points mentioned by the Minister to which I wish to refer.  The Minister told us that the consignee could declare his own valuation.  I wonder whether that would be a wise measure or not.  The exporter might decide at a particular period that the risk was not very great, and during that period he might declare a very low valuation.  Then, in a particular week, when the risk appeared to be very great, he might declare the full valuation, or even more than the full valuation.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to that.  I am doubtful whether you can rely absolutely on an exporter to declare the valuation.  The tendency on the part of some people will be, during a period when the risk is not very great, to declare a low valuation, while the more honest type of exporter will declare a fair valuation all the time.  There must be some protection afforded and a reasonable contribution made by all to the fund.  You cannot do it by that method.  I think the Minister ought to look into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another question.  We are liable at present for the risk until <Col N="1762" /> the cattle arrive at their destination. In the case of store cattle, their destination may be far inland on the other side.  Taking the present situation into account, and the fact that we may anticipate an increase of air raids and bombings on the other side, there will be a tendency to bomb railheads where the store cattle may be left for a period of three or four hours during the busiest part of the day.  Therefore, this risk may prove to be enormous within the next few months. That we should be asked to bear the risk and pay the war risk insurance on cattle to their destination at the other side is, I suggest, unreasonable.  It is a matter which, I suggest, should be put up to the British Government immediately.  At the very most we should be only expected to pay the war risk insurance until the arrival at the port of disembarkation.  In the next few months there will probably be intense aerial activity, and there is no doubt that we shall lose any amount of live stock at many railheads on the other side.  I think it is unreasonable to expect that we should provide against that loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the title of this Bill is &ldquo;Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Bill.&rdquo;  Apparently, the Minister intends under that title to cover war risks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that war risks were not covered under insurance. If there is anything wrong with the title, perhaps the Minister would look into the matter.  War risk is expressly excluded under other insurances. I agree with what Deputy Hughes said about the 72 hours after stock is landed at the British landing stage.  Under Section 18, there may be heavy premiums wanted for such risks. There is a terrible risk in covering stock for 72 hours after arrival in British ports.  Does after the stock is landed, mean after the ship has arrived, or when beasts are actually ashore, because minutes or even seconds may count?  Apparently, stamps are going to be affixed in connection with this insurance. That seems to me to be a <Col N="1763" /> clumsy way of doing business.  Anybody who has to lick a great many stamps knows that.  Could the Minister not find a better way, so that the value would be declared and the amount of insurance settled?  The Minister apparently envisages damage being caused to live stock.  I suppose that is the ordinary shipping risk.  Some people may want to cover that risk and not cover war risk.  Has the Minister taken power in Section 17 to have different rates for various risks?  There is, for instance, the question of total loss, apart from war risks, and there would also be a question as to whether delivery would be taken when beasts were driven ashore or later.  There should be power in the section to vary the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the question of making it a condition that they should be insured, of making a charge and dealing with it accordingly?  Are the animals the property of exporters until they are taken over, or do they belong to the purchasers?  The Minister ought to consider seriously the question of insurance. It is possible when the war is over, if we ever see such an eventuality, that the price of cattle will <Col N="1764" /> diminish, and as it diminishes the incidence of this charge increases.  If this provision is ever going to work it ought to work during this period.  If he wished, the Minister could after the Bill so as to ensure that insurance carried only as far as the landing stage.  It is other people's business to insure over there.  It ought to be worked on that basis or there should be some agreement to that effect.  It seems, if we are going to pass this Bill now, that we should decide, in view of what is happening, to put it into operation.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the extent to which some people are going to suffer as a result of this Bill.  Deputy Dillon mentioned people who are making a living, presumably by canvassing exporters, by the insurance of live stock.  These insurances are done altogether by foreign companies.  We have no native companies doing marine or war-risk insurance.  I presume that the agents who canvassed for that business are also canvassing for many other things, and that this line would be only part of their income.  I promise to look into the matter before the next stage. As Deputy Hughes stated, a person may try to size up the situation, by taking it that there is not going to be an accident, and insuring fairly low, but if he thought that there might be a probability of accident, he would insure on a higher scale.  He may be wrong, but he has to take the risk if he insures low, and if an accident happens.</P>

      <P>There might be something of that kind.  The cattle trade representatives put up a scheme to the Department.  It is not the sort of scheme by which the cattle trade could do any injury to producers.  It is a matter for themselves, and on that account the Department would not interfere very much.  We discussed this scheme and made suggestions, some of which were adopted, and others they persuaded us that it was better not to adopt.  On the whole we took their scheme.  They are satisfied with the <i>ad valorem</i> basis.  They think it will be an easy scheme to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount is declared and they accept the <i>ad valorem</i> basis. If that is not accepted it would be costly, because you must have someone to assess value.  We will meet the cattle trade representatives again to discuss the matter.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Hughes and by Deputy Cosgrave, as to the length that the cattle may be on the other side, and if that will be our liability, that is another question.  All this Bill does is to provide that if a person here has cattle at the other side he is insured up to 72 hours.  It is really a matter for the Government to negotiate with the British Government as to how long we should accept liability.  We have been inquiring into it.  In the case of fat cattle, when they are landed they are taken over by the controller. If stores are sent over, perhaps they go to an auction in the midlands or on to a farm.  They are the property of the exporter until delivered and the British Government or this Government cannot interfere there.  As they are the property of the exporter then they are covered by him.  The question of whether it is fair or unfair for people at this side to carry the risk at the other side is not one to be dealt with by this Bill.  The two Governments have to try to get as fair an arrangement as possible.  I do not feel that I could put up a good case to the British Government that they should carry the risk until our cattle are sold. I am afraid that we will have to carry that risk.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But they have bought the stuff.  They are taking our bacon at the port here and they are taking the risk across the Irish Sea.  They are taking our fat cattle at the port.  Our store cattle are consigned to be sold on the other side and, that being so, I do not see how we could put up the argument that we are not responsible until these cattle are sold.  The British are fairly good at arguing these points. As to the exact time from which the 72 hours commence, perhaps it is not defined very well.  I must look into that point.  Deputy Dockrell may take it that the benefit will be given to the exporter whenever a doubt arises. You have three members of the cattle trade to decide the issue and they are not going to be too hard on one of themselves.  If there is any doubt, they will probably give the benefit of it to the exporter.  If we can, we shall define it a little more precisely.  As to the stamps, they will be of various denominations.  They will be issued for sums of 1/-, 5/-, 10/-, £1 and, perhaps, £5.  A person will not, therefore, have to lick so many of them.  If a man exports 50 head of cattle, he will only have to use four or five stamps to make up the exact amount.</P>
      <P>The Bill does cover both war risk and marine insurance.  It does not refer to war risk.  It refers to insurance, whatever the liability may be. Whatever exporters require will be covered by the Bill.  It will cover war risk as well as marine insurance and, if there is no war risk, it will cover marine insurance.  I do not know whether &ldquo;marine insurance&rdquo; is a proper term or not, but if we say it is a proper term then it becomes a proper term, whatever the dictionary may say.</P>

      <P>As to the size of the board, I distinctly remember discussing that matter with the cattle trade. I had the same opinion as Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;that <Col N="1767" /> it would be better to have a small business board.  They explained that they had to cover various interests&mdash;fat cattle exporters, store cattle exporters, sheep exporters&mdash; though few people are engaged solely in sheep export&mdash;and pig exporters. There was a geographical difficulty as well.  Cork is important as well as Dublin, and they thought that, to have a representative board, it would be necessary to have at least eight members.  I did not object.  I did not object to anything they thought would be best for themselves.  Deputy Cosgrave raised the point that, when the war is over, cattle values will probably go down.  Insurance is on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis and will also go down. If the fund gets fairly sound, and, if we can afford it, we may lower the rate by order at any time.  It can be either raised or lowered.</P>

      <P>The Banking Commission made a recommendation which would affect Section 2 of this Bill.  I do not remember the number of the paragraph of the Commission's Report which dealt with the matter.  From the commencement of the State, Section 2 of the Appropriation Bill has been phrased in the form in which it appears here&mdash;that the Minister may borrow from any person, or the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister, any sum or sums not exceeding the whole sum involved.  It has never been necessary to exercise that particular power to its full extent.  It is strange that, after so many years, we have not been able to get a phrase more in accordance with the facts of the case. By the time the Bill becomes law, over 20 per cent. of the revenue of the year <Col N="1769" /> has been collected.  Although this £19,000,000 is only a moiety of that revenue, it seems strange that it should be necessary to have included a provision to collect the whole of the sum involved.  One of the drawbacks in connection with the wording of this clause is that, in giving power to raise money, the authority of Parliament is used in a peculiar form.  I am merely raising the point for the purpose of finding out if the matter has been considered by the Government, and when it is intended to alter the phraseology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised an important point.  He, no doubt, is aware that the phraseology of this section has been devised to meet a peculiar situation whereby the Bank of Ireland is, under its charter, forbidden to lend to the Government except with the express authority of Parliament.  That is the real purpose of the peculiar wording of the section. It is true that the Banking Commission drew attention to the wide borrowing powers conferred by the present phraseology on the Minister for Finance and recommended that some limitation should be imposed upon them.  That matter, together with other recommendations of the Banking Commission, was under consideration by the Minister for Finance some time ago but I presume the Department has not been able, in view of the peculiar circumstances existing since September last, to come to a definite decision as to what should be done.</P>

      <P>There are certain matters that I should like to mention to the Dáil with regard to the Saint Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill and the Local Government Bill.  My only anxiety with regard to the Saint Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill was that if it were passed there might be certain preliminary work that could be done. With regard to the Local Government Bill, there are certain preliminary steps that could be taken in order to implement it.  I thought it might be possible that we could go ahead with preliminary surveys in connection with the building of the hospital.  So far as the Local Government Bill is concerned, it was complementary to the County Management Act and the <Col N="1771" /> Public Assistance Act of last year.  It might be possible to bring the County Management Act into operation without holding the elections, but I have to consider that matter yet.  However, the question has been raised in the House that perhaps these are measures <Col N="1772" /> that might give rise to some controversy and it might be better to leave them over.  I am quite agreeable to leave them over, in the circumstances, until September.</P>
