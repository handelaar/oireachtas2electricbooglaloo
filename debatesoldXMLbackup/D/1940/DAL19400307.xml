      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that, owing to the failure of his Department and the two public bodies concerned to agree in the matter of maintenance charges in the T.B. Hospital City Home, Limerick, the accommodation in this institution, though suitable, is not availed of by people suffering from tuberculosis, and that consequently those people are put to serious hardship by being compelled to enter the county home at Newcastlewest, where the accommodation is most unsuitable; and whether in these circumstances he will take steps to bring about a satisfactory agreement between these bodies.</P>

      <P>It is to be regretted that agreement on this matter has not been secured between the two local bodies.  Any failure on their part to come to an agreement cannot be attributed to my Department, which has done all in its power to bring about agreement.  I am still hopeful that the Department's efforts will meet with success.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress last night I was asking leave of the Chair to deal with the matter of tanker accommodation for supplies of petrol and the Minister intervened to say that he was not responsible for the industrial alcohol factories now.  I rejoined that I knew that, but I felt that inasmuch as he required the community to submit to a petrol rationing which he described as drastic I was entitled to make suggestions to him whereby he might be able to make available ampler supplies of petrol to the community by constraining persons, citizens of this State, who were chartering tankers to use those tankers for the transport of petrol in preference to treacle.  I do not want, Sir, to avail of the fact that you are now in the Chair and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was there last night to invite you to make a different ruling from what was made on that occasion, and if you feel that this is irrelevant I do not wish to pursue it.  I feel, however, in the light of what the Minister says that it is very relevant. The Minister dwelt on the inconvenience that scarcity of petrol must specially create for commercial travellers, men who depend for their livelihood on their ability to move about the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I have already referred to the difficulties experienced by merchants in getting supplies of china and delph and the prospective difficulties that concern country blacksmiths as a result of the cost of shoeing iron at present being offered from Irish sources.  Quite frankly, I have not had any dealings in Irish shoeing iron since supplies became available, but prices have been quoted which suggest to me that it would be impossible for a blacksmith to get the price of a set of shoes if the cost of his iron is raised to the level that has been suggested so far.</P>
      <P>No supplies of fuller shoeing iron are available from Haulbowline but plain shoeing iron is.  I should like the Minister to examine this question with a view to determining whether the supplies that will be available from Haulbowline are really reasonable for our blacksmiths.  If he makes up his mind that they are not, then I suggest to him that he should busy himself to get supplies of this commodity before a number of respectable men are driven out of business, because every Deputy knows that if a blacksmith closes his forge and his custom goes elsewhere, it is very difficult for him to get that custom back.  If the cost of supplies rises unduly, certain blacksmiths may be constrained to close up and go out of business.  It will be no relief to them if the price of shoeing iron should subsequently be reduced, because by that time their trade would be gone and they would simply have to become journeymen, looking for employment with any smith or foundry that has work to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we come to the position of firms which are supplying cheap knitted socks and stockings, which are principally purchased by the poor. Most Deputies in this House who come from the country are familiar with the coarse 1/- sock and are also familiar with the women's black four-in-one ribbed worsted hose.  These are manufactured from the low-grade yarn to which the Minister made reference yesterday.  I think a similar, if not <Col N="313" /> identical yarn, was employed in the manufacture of cheap blankets.  We all appreciate the Minister's difficulties in procuring supplies of this commodity because it is undoubtedly true that the British have purchased the entire wool clip of more countries than one and are in a position to dominate the situation so far as we are concerned. But, as he very properly observed yesterday, the Minister has found that the British Department of Supplies are reasonable and have no desire to blackmail him any more than he has to blackmail them.  We are sending to Great Britain at the present time a very considerable quantity of coarse wool.  The Minister is using his licensing powers to hold in the domestic market so much of that wool as is suitable for our trade here.  Might I suggest to him that a more effective means of remedying the difficulty would be to approach the British Department of Supplies, in the same spirit as they approached him, and without using his licensing powers to detain in this country part of the wool clip, offer to give it to the British, saying to them at the same time: &ldquo;Look here, if you get wool from us, will you go as far as you can to require your spinners to send us back a fair proportion of the low-grade yarn that we require for certain purposes, a yarn which we have used in the past?&rdquo;  We are not asking them to send us yarns of this class to start a new industry in this difficult time but just to keep going essential industries that we have always had and to supply essential demands that were always there.  I think on that basis a reciprocal agreement could be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, in connection with matters that arose between our Department of Agriculture and the British Department of Agriculture, that I thought a more satisfactory arrangement could be made, if the negotiations were conducted between Minister and Minister.  The negotiations could be carried on on more flexible lines and could cover a wider basis than was originally intended.  I suggest to the Minister for Supplies now that if he could meet the British Minister for Economic Warfare and the President of <Col N="314" /> the British Board of Trade, he might be able to solve the difficulties in connection with the yarn problem without any serious trouble.  This is an urgent matter, because already the price of these commodities has gone up immensely, and it will become a matter of very considerable embarrassment if supplies are no longer available.  Many Deputies may think that a suitable alternative would be for the women of the country to get out their knitting pins and go to work knitting the stockings and socks they are unable to buy, but the Deputies to whom that occurs cannot be familiar with the drapery trade or they would know that the worsted requisite to knit such articles would cost more than the finished article, the stocking or the sock, that these people have been in the habit of buying.  We are in no serious difficulty about the better-class end of the trade.  It is the cheap stuff that is the bother, and it is a bother that is not of the Minister's making.  It arises out of the situation, and I believe it could be satisfactorily overcome by a reciprocal agreement with the British Government.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should bear in mind also, in using these licensing powers to prevent the export of wool from this country, that the sheep farmers have already had to make their contribution through the Fellmongers Act which, undoubtedly, for a considerable period, resulted in the sheep hides fetching a lower price in Éire than that at which they could have been sold in Great Britain or Scotland.  It may be argued, of course, that the English and Scotch fellmongers were paying an artificially higher price in order to wipe the Irish fellmonger out.  It is unnecessary to go into that question now, but the net result was that the Irish sheep farmer had to take less for his skin than he would otherwise get.  I put it to the Minister that if the effect of restricting exports of domestic wool is to make the price realised for that wool lower, he should think twice before he acts drastically.  I understand that the fleece of one of our sheep weighs about 7 lbs.  If the Minister reduced the price of wool by 1/- per lb. as a result of these restrictive measures <Col N="315" /> it would mean a reduction of 7/- per head on the sheep of the country, and 7/- per head represents the profit that many a man makes on his sheep.  I would urge the Minister to keep in constant touch with the Department of Agriculture before he acts drastically in that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the difficulty of getting supplies of bags and sacks. I do not know whether the Minister realises the boundless ocean of empty sacks and bags that floats about this country and that could be tapped if the people were given to understand that these bags were worth money.  I have experience of it practically every Friday and Saturday of my life. Practically every farmer who comes into my shop buys a broken parcel of manure, meal, flour or something of that kind.  After he has made his purchases he is asked: &ldquo;How are you going to take it home?&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;Cannot you give me a bag?&rdquo;  There is then a long wrangle and, at the end of the wrangle, he says: &ldquo;We have dozens of bags at home but we never thought it worth while to bring in one with us.  If you give us one to-day, we will bring it in some other day.&rdquo; I do not give him the bag and, in the end, he produces a bag from somewhere and takes away his purchases in it.  It is astonishing, but nevertheless true, that if you offered such a farmer 2d. for a bag, he would bring along the following Friday about 15 bags and ask you for 2d. for each bag.  They proceed to sell the bags to me and, if the Minister could bring home to farmers throughout the country that bags are worth money&mdash;say, worth 6d. a piece, and I think they are nearly worth that now&mdash;he would be smothered in a deluge of bags.  But, of course, it will require a little organisation to get them collected.  At the moment I cannot think of a plan, but one way he might do it would be to fix a price&mdash;and he is very fond of fixing prices.  He might fix a price for so much a bag and, if he would undertake to accept delivery at a depôt in Dublin, I think a great many shopkeepers in rural Ireland would be glad to act as his agents and collect the bags for him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> Let me give him this warning.  I frequently send bags to sack makers in this city.  I go through those bags scrupulously and I see no torn or dirty bag is despatched, but when they arrive at the sack merchants and I get my returns, out of 100 bags there are always about seven torn, three useless and 22 dirty, on which I am substantially cut, with the result that sending bags becomes an uneconomic operation.  It may be their view of what constitutes a torn bag is different from my view, but there is that difficulty, and the Minister's whole scheme for collecting bags might be aborted if it transpired, when the bags arrive in Dublin, that they are described as torn and dirty when, in the opinion of the consignors, they were perfectly good and entitled to the fixed price for the particular class of bag to which they belong.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the difficulties of getting supplies of aluminium blanks as a result of the sinking of the ship <i>Rhynanna,</i> which was on its way with supplies of that commodity.  Was the ship <i>Rhynanna</i> registered in this country, or was it British?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a war casualty, but there was another ship to which the Minister referred which was carrying oil cakes and which was attacked.  It survived the attack, staggered in, and delivered its goods. Surely he has considered the desirability of making representations to the Government responsible for these attacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a function of the Minister; it concerns a different Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will consider co-ordinating his Department with the others with a view to safeguarding those ships against further attacks?  I think the whole House heard with great relief the Minister's description of the success which attended his efforts to get supplies of sugar and, I believe, the success which attended his efforts to <Col N="317" /> get supplies of wheat.  May I direct the attention of the House to one interesting fact?  There are two commodities in respect to which we have sweated for four years to achieve self-sufficiency. There are two commodities to achieve self-sufficiency in which we spent millions of pounds in the last four or five years and when the hour of crisis comes these are the two commodities in regard to which we have very little difficulty in getting adequate supplies.  Is not that a strange thing?  We urged everyone to grow more wheat and to grow more beet and now it emerges that we have ample supplies of wheat and apparently can get as much as we want, and that we have ample supplies of sugar and are getting it in ample quantities since the beginning of the emergency and we see no probable prospect of those deliveries being suspended in the future.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, animal feeding stuffs are in very poor supply.  The Minister told us that so far as oil cake is concerned, he can hold out very little hope, and so far as maize is concerned, the price is going to go higher and higher as a result of circumstances over which he has no control.  On essential commodities, such as animal feeding stuffs, of which there is an acute scarcity, we have not spent a penny in the last five years towards stimulating production.  I ask Deputies to remember how frequently in this House we have urged on the Government the policy of one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough&mdash;one more acre of tillage devoted to the production of animal feeding stuffs&mdash;because it seemed clear to us all through that the big, bulky thing that it would be hard to get control of in a time of emergency would be the feeding stuffs wherewith to maintain our live-stock export trade. We pointed out that if we could not maintain that, the whole economic fabric of the State would collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we find ourselves in the crisis. There are abundant supplies of wheat coming in, and not at prohibitive prices; there is an abundant supply of sugar coming in, and not at prohibitive <Col N="318" /> prices; but there is very little maize, and there is going to be less.  There is no oil cake, very little concentrated feeding stuffs, and there is going to be less.  I do not want to rub into the Minister unduly the fact that we told him so for the last four years, but I would be glad if he would say to us to-day that he sees the emergency in its true perspective now, and that, in addition to exerting himself to get supplies from abroad, he is going to make urgent representations to the Minister for Agriculture to relieve the difficulty of the Minister for Supplies by getting from our own farmers adequate supplies of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us quite honestly, if the Minister for Agriculture were to ask him to-morrow morning: &ldquo;What is your greatest difficulty &mdash;is it animal feeding stuffs or is it wheat and sugar?&rdquo;  what his reply would be?  Would he not be bound to say: &ldquo;Well, in regard to wheat and sugar, I can see my way; we are getting supplies and, unless the situation greatly deteriorates, we may reasonably hope to go on getting supplies. But, in regard to animal feeding stuffs, we are in a terrible difficulty.  We cannot get them.  There are currency difficulties in providing credits to purchase them outside the sterling area, and, superimposed on them are the transport difficulties and the prohibitive charges that are being made by neutral shipping to carry grain from the Argentine and concentrated feeding stuffs from their countries of origin&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Political face is an important thing in this country.  I listened with admiration to the Minister last night in another place pointing out how vital it was that there should be courageous co-operation without regard to past differences in order to secure the survival of democracy in this country.  I suggest here is an opportunity to instruct us not only by precept, but by example, and if he will soft pedal in regard to wheat and beet for the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister spoke at some length on maize and linseed cake and meals and animal feeding stuffs.  I am putting it to him that all he told us yesterday means that his source of supply is going to fail, and he has to fill that gap somehow. Now is the time to do it, and I admit the only effective means of doing it is going to cost him some political face.</P>
      <P>I think he has got to face that.  I think he has got to accept that difficult position and meet it in the spirit which he advocated so eloquently in University College last night.  The sooner he does that the better, I think, it will be for the country.  I have nothing to add to what I have already said, but I trust the Minister will confront the problems that I have put before him as energetically as he hopes that some of his neighbours may confront other problems that embarrass them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister's statement yesterday. He made a point, I think, about prices and the control of prices.  This is a very important subject and was dealt with at some length yesterday by other speakers.  Deputy Hickey, a moment ago, tried to elicit some information with regard to prices.  I came up against cases recently in the course of my public duties where ostensibly very serious over-charging took place.  One case in particular made me suspicious of the rather hurried way in which prices are inclined to be <Col N="320" /> jumped up on the pretext that the war situation is the cause.  At one of the public boards in Cork with which I am connected, we had a demand very soon after the outbreak of war for an increase of 10/- per ton on the contract price for coal.  Naturally, to the ordinary layman the demand seemed to be terribly exorbitant.  We had not the machinery to investigate such a demand because it required a very technical and deep knowledge of shipping rates, insurance rates, etc.</P>
      <P>We sent the matter on to the Minister's Department, or some subsection of it, for investigation, and after some time got a reply which was not at all satisfactory.  It was in the nature of an evasive answer.  We were not satisfied with it.  In fact, some of us were very dissatisfied, and I think had very good reason to be so.  We sent the matter back to the Department for further investigation, and about the 8th February, I think, we had a rather astonishing reply from the Department which said that, after very careful investigation, both in the Department itself and on the spot locally through inspectors, it was discovered that the suggested increase of 10/- per ton on the coal was reasonable by reason of the fact that this importer had got the coal from some obscure port on the east coast of England, and that the freight and insurance rates, etc., justified the increase. But, following on that, here is an astonishing fact, that as a result of an investigation into an increase in coal prices in Cork, the Department had come to the conclusion that there had been an unreasonable increase of 2/- per ton in coal prices in Cork, and directed that the price be reduced by 2/- per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, naturally coming up against a thing like that at one public board, one is rather inclined to be suspicious. At another public board we got a demand from various contractors, who are on the approved list of contractors, for increases in the price of their commodities. In this case again we sent the matter back for investigation.  It turned out to be a case of going from Peter to Paul and from post to pillar. <Col N="321" /> We did not get any satisfaction on the matter.  We were told that we should investigate those complaints ourselves. I want to suggest to the Minister that the Department over which he has control must have the necessary machinery to carry out such investigations, and that it is their function to see when cases are reported to them, as they have been by the bodies I speak of, that these cases get a very thorough investigation because the position with regard to rising prices is very serious. Anybody who has experience of family life knows that costs are mounting very seriously.  When complaints are made by public boards about increases in price, and when these are sent on to the Department, the machinery at its disposal ought to be put into operation and a thorough investigation carried out.  I say that because it is at the public boards that the headline is set for the ordinary purchasers of commodities in this country.  If prices to public boards are allowed to be increased, then naturally the ordinary consumer has no grievance because the headline has been set for him.  I want to suggest to the Minister that that is a side of his activities he should give very serious attention to. There are increases which can be justified, but there are others which cannot.</P>
    <P>In another case at a public board, of which I am a member, we had the price of oatmeal raised to a very exorbitant figure.  In that case the investigation carried out by the Department consisted of this: that it sent down to the local miller asking him to tell them what price he paid for oats on such a date before the outbreak of war, and what price he paid for oats some time after the commencement of the war. By a very simple calculation they decided that the increase was justified, never adverting to the fact that this miller had the oats in his mill from the previous harvest.  He had bought it at a time when there was no increase in the cost of it to him.  Yet, he was allowed to get the increase from the committee of the public body that I speak of.  That is why I say this is a side of the Minister's activities that will require his very serious attention. If a serious attempt is made to control <Col N="322" /> an exorbitant rise in prices, the consumer will be safeguarded in a way that is very necessary.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to bring these points to the Minister's notice because the cost of living in this country has serious reactions on the social problem generally.  When the cost of living goes up, it naturally is followed by demands for increased wages.  Then we are told that the spiral starts the upward trend.  I am suggesting to the House and to the Minister, that one of the ways in which he and his Department can contribute to control the position is by putting into operation the machinery that he has at his disposal, and by doing so in a rigorous fashion.</P>
    <P>We have heard from time to time in this House that profiteers are trying to exploit a position with regard to prices that, in the case of ordinary people, would be looked upon as a very serious offence, but if one complains to the Department, and if one feels that they are dealt with as I have seen complaints that were put up, I am afraid we will begin to lose faith in the necessity for a Department of Supplies or in the one-sided activities of such a Department.  I am putting these points definitely to the Minister and, if necessary, I can produce evidence to show that everything I have said is a fact.  I am very seriously perturbed at the lack of rigorous dealing that his Department has shown in these matters.  If public bodies can be exploited and if certain prices can be extorted from them what protection has the ordinary individual? A suggestion has been made to the Minister's Department that a prices committee should be formed amongst local people to draw attention to any exorbitant rise in prices.  That would be a very good step.  That suggestion has been put up by various bodies, including Cork Corporation, and is one worthy of attention, because the ordinary working man or woman, or poor person, will not go to the trouble of sending in details of their grievances to the Department.  If local committees were appointed with some kind of authority to be an intermediary between the Minister and the <Col N="323" /> public, it would be a very wise and useful step.  Unless the Minister and his Department are more active in that respect, I am afraid they are not fulfilling the full functions that it was expected would be performed by them.</P>

      <P>It is a notorious fact that the millers here have been making huge profits.  I know that one well-known miller boasted a couple of years ago that his profits were beyond his wildest dreams, and that he did not know what he was going to do with his money.</P>

      <P>Bread is the staple food of the people, of those living on the dole, on home assistance, and lower-paid workers with big families.  They live, I might say, altogether on bread and tea, and we are forced to conclude that it is the responsibility of the Government to make bread available at the lowest possible price.  This matter has been dealt with by Deputy Dillon, and I do not propose to go further into it now, beyond mentioning that I believe in the last few months, taking into account the conditions under which our wheat is purchased and delivered, the price of flour has definitely been tightened up.  I believe Deputy Dillon, in view of his complaints and criticism, deserves a great deal of credit for bringing about the improvement. I believe there is room for further improvement, and I ask the Minister to spare no efforts in that respect. In the statement he made yesterday, the Minister told us that 1/- per sack is charged to pay for the cost of conserving a wheat supply here.  I have worked out the figures, and believe that would cost the country £137,500. If it is assumed that the millers can borrow money at 5 per cent. to pay for that conserved supply, there is a capital of £2,750,000 invested in our wheat reserve.</P>

    <P>It appears to me that that is hardly right.  The Minister also told us that there was a wheat supply available now for 20 weeks.  I do not think 20 weeks' supply of wheat would cost £2,750,000, <Col N="324" /> and I suggest to the Minister that the amount could be reduced.  It is hardly likely that it costs 1/- per sack now.  I appreciate the fact that storage costs something, and that possibly our storage facilities are old-fashioned. The method of handling wheat is mostly by man power, and that costs something more than it should to maintain a reserve supply.  It appears to me that a charge of 1/- a sack is rather high.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has asked how he could account for the difference between the prices farmers get for wheat and the actual cost of Irish wheat when ready for grist.  There is a big discrepancy there and room for improvement.  There is no proper organisation for the distribution of Irish wheat.  Very often we find it going from Wexford to Donegal.  The transport charges are very high and storage charges are also high.  There are big profits made on the handling and storing of wheat, and those costs could with more attention be reduced. The price paid to farmers last year was 30/6, and by the time the wheat was ready for milling the figure was at least £2.  The difference between 30/6 and £2 is certainly too great a margin to cover handling and distribution charges.  In my opinion there should be better organisation as regards the distribution of Irish wheat between the various mills.  It does not seem right to be bringing wheat from the South of Ireland to Donegal.</P>
    <P>On the question of the price of bakers' and household flour there was always a difference in prices, but within the last few weeks the price fixed by the Minister has the same level as for bakers' flour.  I realise that there is a difficulty in getting the right type of wheat to manufacture household flour. The Minister told us that there was very little Pacific, Californian and Australian wheat available, and that we were depending mostly on Manitoban and Plate wheats.  Now that the wheat supply is pooled is any attempt made to supply the softer varieties of wheat to mills catering for household flour? After all, what is necessary for bakers' flour is strong gluten content that <Col N="325" /> absorbs more water but has a higher production of bread per sack.  The wheat that went to make household flour was always of a weaker variety and had not the same power of absorption and the production was not as good, but it produced an excellent bread for the household.  Again, if we get the strong Manitoba wheat for household purposes it will make a very sodden kind of bread; it will not be spongy and soft like the bread made from white wheat.  You might possibly differentiate between Manitoba and Plate wheat.  I am sure the Minister realises that in some districts the percentage of household to baker's flour produced is very much higher than in others.  In some parts of the country you will get millers producing 50 per cent. of household and 50 per cent. of baker's flour, while in other districts, like the city here, I imagine the output of baker's flour would be as high as 90 and over 90 per cent.  I think very close attention should be paid to that, and, if we can classify the Plate wheat and the Manitoba wheat, the Plate wheat should be sent as far as possible to districts where the demand for household flour is greatest.</P>
    <P>If you send Manitoba wheat into districts where there is a big demand for household flour, you may give a bad article to people who are used to baking bread, an article which will not produce the best results with milk.  It produces first class results with yeast, but the people do not use yeast; they have no experience in the production of yeast bread.  Close attention, therefore, should be paid to that matter, now that there is a definite shortage of soft wheats for household purposes.  I suggest that the Minister might also look into the question of better organisation in the distribution of Irish-produced wheat, as I think that some money could be saved in that direction.  There should be a very determined attempt made to reduce handling, storage and distribution costs.</P>
    <P>As to the question of sugar, the Minister told us that he had been purchasing a good deal of raw sugar; that we have actually 50,000 tons of <Col N="326" /> manufactured sugar in stock and 58,000 tons of raw sugar, and that there are 24,000 tons on the way.  I understand that there was some difficulty about the extraction of the impurities in raw sugar, that we had not the right type of machinery.  I take it that has been got over and that we have now the right plant to extract all the impurities, because the Minister told us that we are now manufacturing 240 tons of sugar per day.  He told us that this raw sugar was purchased below the ordinary f.o.b. price.  I should like to ask if the consumer is going to get the benefit of that purchase below f.o.b. price.  If the consumer is not going to get the benefit, who is going to get it? Will the beet growers get the benefit, or who is going to get it?</P>
    <P>Then the Minister told us that it is likely we will have 65,000 acres this year under sugar beet, producing 97,000 tons.  I have some experience of beet production, and I should like to impress on the Minister that beet is a crop above any crop produced on the farm which requires an intensive dressing of artificial manure, and superphosphate is the basic manure required.  If there is any shortage, therefore, this crop is going to suffer severely as a result of that.  It is probably the last crop the farmer puts in. All the available phosphates there are at the moment will be already used up on cereal crops such as wheat, barley and oats, and root crops like potatoes, and if there is a shortage of phosphates this crop is definitely going to suffer severely.  It is a crop which wants an intensive dressing of artificial manure more than any other crop and, in my opinion, if we are going to go short of superphosphates for the production of beet, the crop will be a wash-out.</P>
    <P>We cannot produce good beet without superphosphates.  For 65,000 acres, at 5 cwt. of superphosphates to the statute acre, you would want 325,000 cwts.  That crop is going to be put in at the end of the sowing season when, if there is a shortage of superphosphates, it will reflect seriously on the crop.  I want to impress on the Minister again the necessity of making every effort to secure all the phosphates that are available anywhere, <Col N="327" /> to make representations through diplomatic and other channels if necessary, but, at all costs, to use his influence to secure any supplies, either of raw rock or manufactured phosphates which are available in any country, and which can be secured.</P>
    <P>I have had several complaints from blacksmiths that there is an enormous increase in the cost of horse shoeing iron, fullered iron especially, and that there is a pretty stiff tariff on it pending production in Haulbowline.  The Minister told us that he is experiencing a good deal of difficulty in getting pig iron.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is wise to have that tariff in force. If there is a difficulty in getting pig iron&mdash;and, if the difficulty is going to increase, the raw material for Haulbowline is likely to run short or dry up &mdash;would it not be well that we should secure supplies of the fullered iron that is available at the moment?  I would ask the Minister to use his influence with the Minister for Finance to have that tariff removed and to secure the supplies while they are available, if we are going to run short of pig iron.  I am sure the reserves we have at Haulbowline are limited.  We cannot have big reserves there because they are not long in production.  It is somewhat analogous to the fertiliser situation. We may take off the tariff when it is too late and when we cannot secure any fullered iron anywhere.  I shall leave it at that.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance; but I ask the Minister for Supplies to use his influence with regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of agricultural machinery, we asked the Minister early this winter to secure supplies of agricultural machinery, especially machinery suitable for tractor purposes, tractor ploughs, disc harrows and tractor implements of all sorts, and the supply I must say was very unsatisfactory. I am not saying that the Minister is responsible for that.  There must have been difficulty in securing supplies owing to the big increase in tillage on the other side, because, naturally, they gave preference to their own people.  We did secure tractor implements from American sources, and <Col N="328" /> tractor plougns, but they were very unsatisfactory.  They are not good implements. I suggest to the Minister that any further agricultural implements which are available from the other side ought to be secured.  It is unlikely that we shall see the end of the war within the next 12 months.  It is probable that we will have another year or two when increased cultivation will be necessary.  Therefore, any agricultural machinery, any ploughs, or tractor implements, that are available ought to be secured when they will not be so much in demand from now on.  I understand that the supply of fuel oil for agricultural purposes has been satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As to the question raised by Deputy Dillon on the cost of sacks and bags, there has been an enormous increase in the cost of sacks and bags, some of them manufactured here.  I do not know whether that increase can be justified or not and I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to it.  I know that jute has gone up considerably in price but, at the same time, I do not know whether the increase in the price of jute can justify the increase in the price of bags.  For instance, we have developed in recent years here an export trade for seed potatoes. We have beaten the Scottish exporters in the English market in that respect but the cost of the bags this year is operating against us.  Last year the cost of a bag for the export of potatoes was 5½d.  At present it costs 1/1½.  Now, when it is considered that you have to supply 20 bags for a ton of potatoes this is a very big increase in costs.  I am doubtful if that increase can be justified by the increase in the price of raw material.  That is all I have to say except again to impress on the Minister the necessity of making every possible effort to secure an increase in our basic artificial manures supplies.</P>

      <P>I think we will have a complete failure in the sugar beet crop if we do not get adequate supplies of <Col N="329" /> artificial manures.  That will be the crop that will suffer most.  At the moment we can only bank on getting 75 per cent. of last year's supplies of artificials.  There is a tremendous increase in the acreage under sugar beet this year.  That is a crop which demands a very heavy dressing of these manures. Now without any increase in the acreage under beet the demand for artificial manure would be considerably more than last year's level.  With the increase in the acreage under beet I ask the Minister what he thinks is going to be the position of beet growers if supplies are not available.</P>

      <P>When discussing this Estimate one has some difficulty as to where the Ministry of Industry and Commerce ends and where the Ministry of Supplies begins.  There would seem to be some border-line cases.  In fact, in some instances the Minister as Minister for Supplies appears to overlap into every Department.  While no doubt the Department is doing its best for this country I would like to appeal to the Minister to give some idea as to the continuity of the supplies that traders and manufacturers are expecting. It is no good to get one consignment if that consignment is going to be the last.  A person might just as well shut up now as in a couple of months' time.  As an instance of some of the things that appear to be unobtainable I might mention what was said on the Fire Brigades Bill when passing through the House.  There was the question of the 2¾-inch bores and the 2½-inch bores and the hose attachments. I mentioned that that was unobtainable for the whole of this year. I was then invited to look to the Ministry of Supplies and I replied that I did but though I could get one part I did not happen to be able to get that hose.  I mention that because we have just passed the Fire Brigades Bill and, presumably, they are going to provide stand pipes, etc., but there are no hose attachments for those fire-fighting appliances for the whole of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned timber supplies. Timber supplies, I think, can be left to the timber people if they can get the ships.  The Minister said he <Col N="330" /> would use his good offices in obtaining shipping.  I will tell you how he may use his good offices and how he might not use his good offices.  The Minister spoke about the rise in the price of freight.  I think the timber freight has risen by 700 per cent.  English ships apparently are available at round about £7 10s. per ton.  Foreign shipping would be about £16.  If the Minister could get us £7 10s. shipping we would be glad, but, if he is going to look to neutral countries for shipping at £16 in competition with the people who are already on the search, the consequence will be that it will be £17 and not £16 that will be paid.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I wish to touch in connection with the Minister's opening statement is the Prices Commission. That is under the control of his Department in order to prevent profiteering.  I suppose his Department cannot prevent profiteering to the limit of 100 per cent.  I take it we would all give the Department our provisional blessing in their efforts to stop any profiteering.  But there are other phases of their activities that I would like to bring to the Minister's attention. The Prices Commission regulate the price as between the manufacturers in this country and somebody making a complaint from a neighbouring country as agreed under the recent financial settlement.  When a complaint such as that takes place an investigation is undertaken, and it is on that I want to make a comment.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that one of the most important bodies in this country are the distributors. They give more employment than the manufacturers.  In many cases they have been manufacturers themselves in former years and have been driven out by economic circumstances in the distributing trade.  The present position is that when an inquiry is held by the Prices Commission between the manufacturer and the complainant, the distributor is not even invited to the inquiry nor is he heard.  It is not the ordinary person who complains of an overcharge in the price of a commodity. This is a complaint where the intention is to have the tariff investigated. <Col N="331" /> The distributor, as I say, is not even admitted to that inquiry nor is he heard.</P>
    <P>In fact, I understand that the law is so framed or so interpreted that he cannot be heard.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a monstrous state of affairs, that if the distribution of goods is to be undertaken in this country, all sides are entitled to be heard, and, not least, the distributors.  I have heard complaints about foreign invaders who landed in this country and drove out the native Irish.  They were dispossessed from their lands, but they fiercely resisted, and the Government of that day&mdash;whatever sort it was&mdash; gave those people who were driven out all the assistance they could.  That they were driven off their lands, outlawed and dispossessed, was not their fault.  I suggest to the Minister that a new technique has been evolved in which the distributor and the other parties engaged in trade in this country can be driven out of their business, because they will have no say as to the terms on which the trade is to be carried on.  A frightful Nemesis awaits the Government that continually betrays its own nationals for some other group of individuals who seem to offer a more favourable set of conditions at the time.  Perhaps the Minister will say: &ldquo;What have I got to do with this?  The distributor can look after himself.&rdquo;  Formerly, the distributor could protect himself.  If one manufacturer behaved badly, he could transfer his custom to another.  In most cases now, there is only one manufacturer in this country, and the merchant is delivered over in chains and left to the tender mercies of that manufacturer who, since there is no alternative, can treat him exactly as he likes. I put this simple question to the Minister: Have the Government made up their minds that they are going to do away with the whole distributing class in this country?  If so, they might as well say so.  We have heard about certain classes being &ldquo;liquidated&rdquo; in other countries.  The Government have arrived at a stage at which they ought to lay down some machinery for a person who, by Government action, is left <Col N="332" /> without the means of carrying on the trade he may have been engaged in for generations.  By the Government putting somebody else in control of his business, he is left without any means of earning a livelihood.</P>
    <P>It is quite fair that the Prices Commission should review the profit that certain individuals or classes of traders have, but I suggest that they should not seek to alter age-old trading terms, especially since there are people doing business here who, since they are not domiciled here, can give any terms they please.  One of the results of this policy will be that the distribution business of this country will be done by people who are domiciled in other countries, who pay flying visits to this country and send over travellers, and that warehouses, stocks, etc., which, in my opinion, are equally important to the manufacturing end, will be done away with in this country.  Is it any wonder that a feeling of uncertainty pervades a large part of the community? People do not know how they are to carry on business, and, when they are treated unjustly, they have no remedy.  I have heard of people who, when rain comes down on them in one part of a building, merely shift to another part.  They do not get the building repaired.</P>
    <P>Is that the Minister's idea of how unemployment is to be cured and a stable economy reared up?  I ask that the Minister provide some machinery by which sections of the community who are engaged in the business of distributing goods and have been carrying on that business for many years will be enabled to make their case for an equitable distribution of the trade.  I am not asking a favour from the Minister, and I am not suggesting that anybody should be put in a privileged position, but there is an idea abroad that the Irish entrepreneur is to be liquidated, and that a new system of trading is to be established.  If the Government desire that, I suppose they will have to go through with it, but in practically all other countries it has been found that the distributor is essential.  Where he has a choice, and where he can purchase his goods competitively, the distributor can look after himself, but when he is left with <Col N="333" /> only one source of supply, and when the manufacturer dictates the terms on which he will do business, it is not long until the distributor finds that he has no business to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to one point.  It is in connection with control of maize supplies.  It was found necessary to restrict the issue of licences, and to prevent anybody from grinding maize into maize meal who did not have a licence and was not operating on a particular date.  The date was, I think, the 31st July.  I can readily understand the necessity for some control of that kind, but I fear that hardships may have been inflicted by the too rigorous interpretation of that order.  A man may have been grinding maize into meal on a date prior to the 31st July. For some reason or other, he may not have been operating on that particular date.  I do not think it would be reasonable to treat the order too literally and to cut a man like that out of the right of grinding maize subsequently.  I have a case in mind which I have taken up with the Minister's Department. I was forcibly reminded of it by the story told by Deputy Dockrell. This man was in the distributing trade for 50 years, and his people were in it before him.  In recent years he took up the grinding of maize at a mill a couple of miles from his premises, under licence from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He applied for a transfer of the licence to save the expense of bringing the maize out to the mill and back again to the shop, and, having got the licence from the Department, he set up plant and premises, but he had not got it ready for the magic date 31st July. He was actually in operation and grinding before the order came out, but nevertheless he has been closed down, and his premises and plant are no use to him although he had received a letter from the Department sanctioning his operations.  I ask the Minister if that case, or similar cases, could possibly get his sympathetic consideration, because I gather that, in the particular instance I mention, no possible disturbance in regard to distribution could take place because this man's <Col N="334" /> clientele is the same for the past 50 years.  The only difference is that he gets the maize from the combine and whatever profit there is, is made by them.  He could grind the maize himself and, as he is a native, it seems to me that he is entitled to consideration, so that whatever little extra employment is involved in it may be given because somebody has lost employment by reason of its being ground in the big mill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look sympathetically into cases of the kind, and I ask him further whether he could say if licences have been granted since that date, to any person who has never ground before, because while this man has been put out of business, I know one case of a man who has got a licence who never ground maize in his life.  I have heard of others, but cannot vouch for them, but, in connection with the case I mention, I have authoritative information.  I should like the Minister to say why the position in which a man who has been grinding for some years with authority from the Department, who is technically caught out on a particular date, who was grinding subsequent to that date and who was then closed down by the Department of Supplies, should be allowed to continue to the hardship of that man, and furthermore, if that is so, why licences should have been issued to anybody who had not been grinding before, as I have information as to a licence being granted in at least one case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to raise three questions on this Vote.  The first came to me in a roundabout manner from the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, Ltd.  The information I have is to the effect that the managing director and chairman of the hosiery groups of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers wishes the question put: to ask the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that stocks of low cross-bred yarn and wool tops normally imported from England for the manufacture of the cheaper grades of hose are running dangerously low, and that, if substitutes are not easily available, it will have the effect of raising prices to the consumer while <Col N="335" /> restricting employment in the industry. He goes on to add that &ldquo;in view of the fact that there is a large potential export surplus of wool from the country to England, there is a case for making some effort to negotiate for the returns of the yarn and tops in question on an exchange basis.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The other matter is in connection with timber supplies.  This businessman writes that he knows that &ldquo;the Minister for Lands is anxious to avoid the slaughter of our woodlands such as occurred in the last war, but the position we are faced with is that we must decide whether we are to import timber at famine prices or slaughter our own woods&rdquo;.  &ldquo;It is quite apparent that this question,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;is not one to be decided by individual Ministers. It would be very useful to our trade if we could find out what was the Government policy.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister will not take the line that this does not concern him.  It is a Ministerial matter and we cannot get them all here to decide it.  There is a case for using the Irish timber if it is available and saleable at a high price.  The only condition which I would be disposed to insert, in giving the necessary permission, is that a similar number of trees should be planted.  If that had been done during the last war we might have got some money then for saleable timber, which has since probably become unsaleable.  This businessman continues: &ldquo;The cost of timber we are importing is already running into colossal figures, and, later on, it is apparently going to run into fantastic figures.  As an example, the freight from Canada last year was £3 5s. per Petersburg or English standard, and to-day's corresponding figure is in or about £20 per standard.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third matter which I desire to raise is in connection with the allocation of quotas to petrol users.  I have been informed that accountants are restricted to the lowest distribution made and that no increase in their quota will be given.  It seems strange that one particular branch of the commercial community should be singled out for such a restriction.  Accountants <Col N="336" /> have business in various parts of the country and it is necessary for them to get to those parts.  It is certainly essential to business people that they should be facilitated in seeing their accountants whenever they require them, and I think the Minister should reconsider the distribution made in their case and review the decision come to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to make representations with regard to the Minister's order in connection with the fixed price of bread.  I have already referred this matter to the Minister's Department.  It affects the outlying districts of Kerry, and every other county, I expect.  An order was made prescribing a fixed price, and this has worked out, in practice, to the detriment of towns which are far removed from the distributing centres.  For instance, bakers in Limerick and Cork can manufacture bread at a much lower cost than bakers operating 60 or 100 miles from Cork or Limerick, and the result, of course, is that the price to the poor people in those areas is being driven up to a high level.  No account is taken at all of costs of freightage and transit of raw materials from Limerick, Cork or Dublin to these outlying districts.</P>
      <P>While making these representations, I realise that it is a difficult matter to adjust but something should be done, and I appeal to the Minister to arrange some plan, in the shape of an allowance for transit or freight charges to enable bakers in the outlying areas to produce the finished article on somewhat reasonable terms.  They are handicapped as compared with the bakers who reside adjacent to the milling centres and distributing centres, and I think that, if the matter were examined, some scheme might be evolved which would meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us yesterday that the object of control was to regulate profits.  He also told us that there was a prohibition upon the export of hides and skins.  I wonder how he proposes to regulate the profit in that case as between the producer <Col N="337" /> of hides and the producer of the finished article&mdash;leather.  The producer of hides is entitled to the cost of production, and he is entitled to a profit also on the goods he produces, just as much as the producer of leather is entitled to his profit.  The manufacturer of leather should be effectively protected, in my opinion, by the tariff on imported leather, which I think is about 33? per cent. or 35 per cent.  If he got that for his part of the work, I think that should be an effective protection, and the producer of hides should be entitled to a similar protection, in my opinion, if the Minister were to deal equitably as between the two classes of producers.  The man producing the hides is entitled to 33? per cent. if the man manufacturing the leather gets that much protection, but it was not enough for the Minister to deny the producer of hides protection. Instead of protecting the producer of the hides, the Minister prohibited him from getting the world price for his hides and simply transferred the ownership of the hides on the backs of the cattle from the farmers to the Irish tanners, subject to whatever these people wished to pay for the hides.  In other words, a monopoly of all the hides of cattle killed in this country, or half of all the hides, was given to these people.</P>
      <P>I do not see how the Minister can justify that control, nor do I see where the regulation of profits comes in in that case.  It seems that it is a continuation of the old policy of crushing and destroying one section of the community. In my opinion, it is absolute robbery to hand over all the hides from the backs of our cattle to the Irish tanners subject to whatever they may wish to pay for these hides.  Not only that, but the Minister and the Government are acting as slave drivers in compelling the farmers, at their own expense, to treat these hides, by paying inspectors and so on, through the county councils, to go out and see that they are treated for warble fly.  The fact is that the hides do not belong to the farmers, in effect, but to the Irish tanners, subject to whatever the latter wish to pay for the hides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the country <Col N="338" /> should continue to put up with that state of affairs, or with such treatment from any Minister or any Government. I think it is time that one class of producer should be given as much consideration as another class, and the very least the Minister might have done would be to let the Irish producers get free competition, even without any protection.  The producers of hides did not ask for any protection, but they were certainly entitled to whatever free competition Irish tanners or other home producers had from abroad.  In that case, what would be the position of Irish tanners?  They would still be getting 94 per cent. profit on the raw material of their leather.  Assuming that the cost to their competitors of removing these Irish hides to their factories was 20 per cent. ad valorem at the present time, that means that Irish tanners could purchase for £80 what is costing their competitors £100.  That is the advantage that the Irish tanners would have as competitors with foreign manufacturers. For every £80 they would pay for hides&mdash;that is, for the raw material of their manufacture&mdash;they would be getting £155 without using any workmanship whatever.  They would also be getting the advantage of the tariff and the other advantages on their own manufactured work, but upon the raw material alone, if there were no interference by the Minister and if the producers of hides were to be given a fair chance of world competition, the Irish tanners would still have that advantage of 94 per cent. and be getting £155 for every £80 worth.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to deny that, I may not be quite right as to the exact figure in regard to transport costs, freight, insurance, and so on. but I am allowing 20 per cent. ad valorem both ways on the raw hides and the manufactured leather.  I may be right or wrong in that.  It may be more than that, but in any case the profit Irish tanners have been getting on Irish hides produced by our farmers is enormous.  The position is such at the moment that, when hides are offered now to local purchasers, the farmers will be given nothing worth while for them.  I shall give the Minister <Col N="339" /> an instance of what happened in my own case only about a month ago. Owing to a flood a two-year-old bullock was drowned and cast up upon my land along the river.  The Guards notified me that the beast should be buried, and I offered the hide to anyone who would skin the beast.  I sent word to the people who were dealing in skins to get somebody to take the hide off the beast.  Nobody would do so, however, as I was told the hide was not worth it, and the animal lay there for about a day until another flood came along and settled the matter by taking the beast away into Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Now, that is the position.  I know of hundreds of cases where these animals are put down with their skins, even after all the money that has been expended and all the trouble of the inspectors under county councils and so forth, but when anything happens to a poor man nobody will take the hide off the beast, and even the butchers, when buying an animal, will tell you that the hides are of no value and that they are getting nothing for them.  The middleman may be getting, perhaps, half price, or £40 instead of the £80 mentioned, but the farmer is getting practically nothing.  In the case of the Irish tanners, however, for every £40 that they put into the raw material they are getting £155 for that portion of the leather represented in the raw hides, without counting any work whatever put into the thing, and they are also getting protection.  I should like to ask the Minister whether or not he thinks that fair.  How does the Minister propose now, since he is so keen on control, to regulate the profits, and so on, as between these two classes of producers?  I think it is about time that the primary producer got some consideration in this country.  The Minister should not wait until there is a revolution, until they get up and go on strike and have to be brought before the Military Tribunal.  It is not so very long since they went on strike, and for very good reason, for something like this, though it was not as bad as this.  Instead of being treated as other strikers are, they were sent before the Military Tribunal.  That is <Col N="340" /> the sort of treatment meted out to one class of the public as compared with others.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to go into this.  If he does believe in control and wishes to regulate prices, let him do it more equally.  It is nothing short of confiscation. He has confiscated the hides of the whole country and handed them over to the tanners, while the rightful owners are buying them.  There can be no benefit to anybody in that way. The cattle are breaking their bones and falling in drains, and so far as these are concerned they are buried.  I do not know whether the butchers' hides are all sold: they have to take them off, and I suppose they get something for them.  In any case there is a complete confiscation.  There are other matters to which I could refer, but one example is sufficient to show the sort of control the Minister is operating since he got the power.</P>

      <P>Yesterday we were treated to a very interesting debate between the Minister for Supplies and Deputy Dillon in connection with the price of flour.  Some of us are not in a position to know whether it is the Minister or Deputy Dillon who has the true facts of the situation.  Certainly, it did appear to a good many members of this House that Deputy Dillon's arguments were very convincing.  So far the Minister has not, I think, given an answer which could be considered as satisfactory to the allegations made by Deputy Dillon.  However, no matter what the position is between Deputy Dillon and the Minister for Supplies, I think it will be admitted by everybody that the price of flour is too high, and that it is absolutely impossible for householders with very limited incomes to provide themselves with the necessary amount to enable them to nourish their bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that bread is the staff of life, but it is very hard at the present time for a person with a large family to get an adequate supply of flour, at a cost which he would be able to meet.  I suggest that, no matter what the position is at the present moment&mdash;whether Deputy Dillon is right or the Minister for Supplies is <Col N="341" /> right&mdash;something will have to be done by the Government to ensure that cheaper flour and cheaper bread are given to the people.  We have been told that, in England at the present moment, the Government is subsidising flour to enable the English people to secure cheaper bread.  I suggest to the Minister for Supplies that something on those lines will have to be done in order to secure adequate supplies for the very poor of this country.</P>
    <P>Take the position of a person drawing unemployment assistance at the present time.  His income has not been increased since the outbreak of war, but flour and other necessaries of life have increased enormously in price, with the result that such a man is unable to secure a supply of bread and other such necessaries.  Even people with comparatively decent incomes are finding it hard to meet the increased cost of food stuffs.  Bacon and beef have also risen enormously in price in recent months.  I wonder if the farmer is getting the benefit of the increase, or if it goes to the middleman.  The shopkeepers deny that they are profiteering, and it is not easy to ascertain whether they are or not.  Deputy Hurley suggested to the Minister that local committees be formed under the agis or auspices of the Minister for Supplies, with a view to drawing the attention of the Government to cases in their areas where they consider profiteering is taking place.  I do not know what the Minister's reaction to that will be.</P>
    <P>About a month after the outbreak of war, the Wexford Corporation appointed a committee to take complaints from people, as numerous complaints were coming in to the corporation regarding profiteering.  A list of commodities was sent up to the Minister, setting out against each item the prices that prevailed pre-war and those prevailing at that particular time.  The only answer which has been received to that is that the matter is having attention. That does not coincide with some of the things the Minister said yesterday in his speech.  He said these things would have attention.  Very definite details were sent up on that occasion, <Col N="342" /> and a letter was received a few days afterwards&mdash;that was four or five months ago&mdash;saying that the matter was having attention.  I suggest to the Minister that that is not giving sufficient attention to a matter of that kind and, like Deputy Hurley, I would urge that local authorities be set up to keep the Minister informed of the position in so far as profiteering in their areas is concerned.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that something will have to be done in regard to the supply of flour and of what may be considered the common foods.  I cannot understand at all how unfortunate men in receipt of only a few shillings unemployment assistance eke out an existence at this moment.  Either unemployment assistance will have to be increased or there will have to be a curtailment in the rising cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A large amount of the time taken up in this discussion has been devoted to the price of flour. That fact is easy to understand, because, of course, the price of flour is of very definite significance for most people in the country.  Bread being the staple article of food, the price of flour is of daily interest to everybody. Deputy Corish's contribution to that discussion was particularly futile.  It is fairly easy to say that flour is too dear and that something must be done. Any of us can say that and risk nothing, as everybody would agree with us; but it is getting us nowhere.  If Deputy Corish wishes to suggest that we should subsidise the price of flour, then he is dealing with a practical possibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be a wise course to adopt.  To subsidise flour to any appreciable extent would cost an amazing amount of money.  Does Deputy Corish realise that?  A subsidy which would reduce the price of flour from 47/- to 46/- per sack would cost very nearly £150,000 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A subsidy to bring down the price of a sack of flour from 47/- to 46/- would cost that amount. Even that reduction is too small to be reflected in the price of the loaf.  To bring the price down sufficiently to reduce the price of the loaf by ½d. would cost £600,000 to £700,000 a year in subsidies.  We can do that, but it would mean simply taxing tea, sugar or bacon, or some other commodity, in order to obtain that amount of money. Where is the benefit to the community and of what advantage is it to a person consuming those commodities if he is to get flour cheaper and sugar dearer, or flour cheaper and tea dearer?  There is no means of doing this other than that of taxing something else.  The net result would be an increase in prices because the process of collecting a tax on one commodity for the purpose of paying a subsidy on another would mean a certain amount of administrative expense, which would mean a net loss to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of the price of flour is one about which we have had a number of acrimonious discussions here, and I think that is due to the fact that a number of people think they know all about it.  They think it is easy to understand. It is a fact well known to anybody who has had any contact with the flour milling industry that the costing, the determination of the actual cost of producing flour, is a very difficult matter, involving a very high degree of knowledge of the industry, and training in that particular work.  Those who undertake the business of determining the cost of production in flour mills are very highly skilled individuals and command very high salaries.  When amateurs step in for the purpose of showing how easy it is, and make rough and ready calculations for the purpose of establishing comparisons, they get themselves inevitably into the same muddle that Deputy Dillon got into here yesterday.  I am not going to <Col N="344" /> say that if I prove that the price of flour is now reasonable&mdash;and by &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; I mean merely sufficient to recover the price of the wheat that goes into it, the cost of manufacturing the wheat into flour and a reasonable profit for the miller&mdash;I am at the same time proving that the price of flour 12 months ago or 12 years ago was also reasonable.</P>
      <P>That does not follow at all.  Neither, I submit, does Deputy Dillon's quotation from the Prices Commission Report of six years ago, to the effect that some excess profits were made by the flour millers as a whole during a particular quarter of that year, prove that the price to-day is unreasonable. If we use arguments of that kind we will get nowhere.  Whatever the position may have been last year or six years ago the fact is that the price of flour to-day is rigidly controlled. Within a few days after the war started, an Order was made which fixed the price of flour at the level that it was before the war, and no increase has taken place since then which has not been thoroughly investigated by skilled accountants in the service of the Department of Supplies and approved of by them as being completely justifiable in all circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I defended the fixed price for flour here yesterday, and was immediately accused by Deputy Dillon of defending the flour millers.  He even went so far as to say that I was speaking from a brief prepared by the flour millers, which was completely untrue.  I was not defending the flour millers here yesterday, nor am I defending the flour millers here now.  I am defending my own action in fixing the price of flour which is now in operation.  That price was not fixed by the flour millers.  It was fixed by me.  That price, in the opinion of the flour millers, is too low, and they have frequently come to my Department and sent their officers to my Department to urge that we are not making sufficient allowances for their cost of production to enable them to get a reasonable profit from their business.  The flour millers are entitled to make whatever representations of that kind they see fit to make to my Department.  They have made these <Col N="345" /> representations continuously and these representations, naturally, have the most careful consideration.  But, to argue from that that the Department is completely in the pocket of the flour millers and must do whatever they say is just nonsense.  That type of statement may impress very stupid people who want to believe the worst about everybody, but it is not a useful contribution to the deliberations of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a price for flour fixed now at 47/- a sack.  That is the maximum price fixed.  I assure the House that that price was fixed after the most careful examination of the accounts of millers and all the relevant factors concerning which information could be procured and on my authority and my authority only.  It is not possible for individual Deputies or persons who have not got the same facilities that the officers of the Prices branch of my Department have to check that figure.  They cannot go and examine the accounts of individual millers.  They cannot apply the same expert skill that the accountants in my Department possess to the examination of the various factors and, consequently, they will have to take my word for it that the figure is a reasonable figure.</P>
    <P>There is one rough and ready check that can be made&mdash;the rough and ready check that I made here yesterday&mdash;by comparing that figure with the commercial price of flour in Great Britain.  The price at which flour is being sold in Great Britain is being subsidised by the British Government to the extent of £500,000 per week and, consequently, the actual sale price of flour there has no relation to the price here, which is a commercial price, but the Chancellor of the British Exchequer did state that the commercial price for flour in Great Britain was 41/- per sack.  That is the price which would have to be charged for flour if they were trying to do what we are doing, that is, to cover the cost of the wheat, the cost of manufacturing the wheat into flour, and give reasonable profit to the millers.  We know that when we buy flour in England and we have bought some flour there&mdash; it is a special type of flour used mainly <Col N="346" /> by biscuit manufacturers&mdash;we have to pay 43/- a sack for it and, in addition, pay the cost of freightage to this country and the charges of the various factors who handle the flour.  There is a difference between what is the commercial price of flour in Great Britain and the maximum price fixed here but that difference is explainable.  The British price is a price for flour independent of the sack.  The fixed price here includes the price of the sack, that is 2/-. There is the fact that we are subsidising the production of wheat here to a slightly heavier extent than the British are subsidising the production of wheat in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a different system.  The British allow the farmer to sell his wheat at a commercial price and then give him the balance due to him, getting the sum for that purpose by a levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fluctuation all the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We fixed a price here but apart altogether from a difference in the amount of subsidy, there is the fact that native wheat here represents 35 per cent. of all the wheat we use, whereas in England it only represents 20 per cent.  The result is that over and above the element of subsidy for native wheat in the British flour price we must allow 2/- in the price of flour here for the cost of the sack, 2/- additional subsidy to native wheat, 1/- representing the cost of maintaining the reserve stock of wheat which is still being charged, leaving 1/- as the only unexplained difference between the two prices.  That 1/- is easy to explain.  Imported wheat costs more here by reason of the fact that we have to pay higher freightage.  The actual milling costs here are higher because wages are higher and certain other charges are higher here than those obtaining in English mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a rough and ready calculation, but it is sufficient to show that <Col N="347" /> the price of flour here is not unreasonably high, and that it contains within is no element of excess profits.  The only reason I want to emphasise that is because it is important that the public should know that there is not any prospect of the same type of profiteering arising during the course of this war as occurred in the last war.  If the public can be convinced of that, then a number of difficulties which are being experienced now and might be anticipated in the future will be removed. If there is a feeling in any quarter that some people are able to feather their nests and to secure their own interests irrespective of the effect upon the interests of the country as a whole, then everybody will try it.  If there is a feeling that some people are profiteering, other people will be induced to attempt profiteering.  If there is a feeling amongst the workers that employers are getting away with excess profits, they will be formulating demands for increased wages.  It is important that there should be public confidence in the system of price control that we have got, and so far as it is humanly possible to make that system effective, it is effective, and is working to ensure that no excess profits will be made, at any rate, in respect of any of the essential articles which have come under review, and no excess profits are, in fact, being made at the moment.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here to the difficulty that has arisen in connection with the supply of the cheaper types of woollen yarns.  Reference was made to it yesterday by Deputy Dillon, and to-day by Deputy Cosgrave.  I dealt with that matter in my introductory statement yesterday.  It is a fact that there is considerable difficulty in getting supplies of the cheaper type of woollen yarns, but that difficulty does not arise out of the fact that somebody has cornered supplies and is now sitting on them.  It arises out of the fact that in every country in the world woollen mills are working overtime making military uniforms for which that cheap woollen yarn is required.  It is that extraordinary increase in the production of certain classes of cloth <Col N="348" /> which has caused the shortage.  We are producers of wool here.  That fact was referred to by Deputy Dillon yesterday, and again by Deputy Cosgrave. We use only a comparatively small part of our production of wool, and we export the balance.  It is necessary to get some clarity of thought concerning the disposal of that surplus wool.  Deputy Dillon to-day said that we should try to make a bargain with the British to secure supplies of the cheaper grades of woollen yarn from them in consideration of our selling our wool surplus to that country.  He said at the same time that we must ensure that we take no action which would prevent our wool exporters getting the maximum price available.  The position at the moment is that, because the price of wool in Great Britain is controlled by the British Government, we are selling practically no wool there at all.  I mentioned that on the outbreak of war the British authorities bought up practically the entire wool production of the world.  Because of the action they took, there now is a scarcity of wool in the United States, in Holland, and in other countries, and consequently the price of wool in these centres is much higher than in Britain. It is to these centres our wool surplus is now going.</P>
    <P>Prices are being paid there far in excess of anything that could be procured in Great Britain.  I said the disposal of our wool surplus is bound up with getting supplies of woollen yarns.  Deputies must appreciate the fact that if we are going to place any restrictions upon the disposal of our wool surplus, it means inevitably that we shall get a somewhat poorer return than might be procured if we allowed wool to go to whatever part of the world prices were at the moment highest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the surplus be very small at this time of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the year as a whole.  I gave the figures yesterday. We produced about 16,000,000 lbs. of raw wool, of which we normally use about 3,000,000 and of which we could use about 6,000,000.  The balance could <Col N="349" /> not be used here, and must be exported in any event.  Deputy Dillon had what he thought was a good crack at our self-sufficiency policy by mentioning the fact that we had concentrated for a number of years upon getting increased production here of wheat and beet, and he then said that it was in relation to these commodities the least difficulty had been experienced, so far, in time of war.  That is a very superficial view to take of the position.  It is true that up to the present we have been able to get large supplies of wheat, but it would be utterly unsound to conclude from that that we can always get large supplies of wheat.  On the contrary, it is obvious that it is going to become increasingly difficult to get supplies coming from abroad.  Not merely is it going to become increasingly difficult, but it is going to be increasingly expensive. We have now reached a position where a very small rise in the cost of delivery of foreign wheat here will make it dearer than Irish wheat, although in normal times there was a substantial difference between the guaranteed price paid for Irish wheat and the price at which we could buy imported wheat.  That difference is now almost entirely wiped out, and if the price of foreign wheat continues to increase at anything like the rate at which it has increased for the past six months, it will soon be much cheaper to grow all the wheat we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty of obtaining foreign supplies is not due to any scarcity in the countries of origin, but to circumstances connected with their transportation here.  The war, so far, has been mainly a war on shipping.  Apart altogether from the actual losses during the war, other factors have operated to make the arrangements for shipping very difficult.  You have the entire German mercantile marine tied up. You have the American mercantile marine ordered by the American Government to stay out of these waters. You have a large part of the British mercantile marine immobilised by the convoy system, which involves that where convoy is given, the ships must arrange their days of sailing to suit the convenience of the convoy, and the largest ship must reduce its speed <Col N="350" /> to that of the smallest.  All these factors tend to make the arrangements for shipping, particularly in relation to goods which have to be transported over long distances, very difficult and very expensive.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, in connection with the plans made in relation to the shipping of fertilisers, that long ago we purchased in North Africa a certain quantity of rock phosphate to enable us to make here all the superphosphates that we might require this year, but up to date we have only been able to ship 25 per cent. of the quantity of rock phosphate which was purchased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that due to shipping difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due to the difficulty of arranging for shipment.  In the course of time we shall get in these supplies, but the difficulty is to get them in within the time in which we require them.  Some Deputies speaking here emphasised the importance of getting adequate supplies of superphosphate.  It is easy to speak like that, but emphasising the importance of it does not get it.  There are only limited sources of supply.  In practice, we may take it that, during the course of the war, whatever supplies of compound manures and superphosphate we use here will be made here either from our own raw materials or from imported raw materials.  In times of peace, supplies of superphosphate were available in Belgium, but the Belgian Government have now prohibited their export.  It is easy for Deputies to say that we could make diplomatic representations to get the Belgian Government to remove the ban in our favour.  We could make representations, but does anybody think that by doing so we would get them to remove the ban?</P>

It was suggested here that we could make diplomatic relations to the Belgian Government to get a removal of the ban on exports in our favour.  We can do so, but it would be foolish to imagine that we are going to get any result.  It is just as important for the British, or the French, to get the ban removed in their favour as it is for us to have the ban removed in our favour, and I am quite certain that our influence with the Belgian Government does not exceed the influence of either the British or the French Government.</P>

      <P>Some years ago we set up a committee to decide whether that rock in Clare was capable of being used for the manufacture of superphosphate. The committee left the position more or less indeterminate.  Some people on the committee thought it could not be used economically; others thought it could, and there was a third view which seemed to suggest that it was technically possible, but, in the circumstances of that day, impracticable. The matter is being considered further.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about shoeing iron.  We have experienced very considerable difficulties in procuring supplies, even at any price. I have in mind now supplies of steel sheets, steel bars or even the billets which can be manufactured into sheets and bars here.  I presume that was to have been anticipated.  The steel industry of Great Britain is concentrating upon the production of armaments. The same thing is presumably happening in Germany, and Germany and England were two of the greatest exporters of steel in the world.</P>
      <P>The position is that supplies are procurable only from Belgium and the United States.  In the case of Belgium they are deluged with orders from all over the world.  It is almost impossible to get supplies from them, and when you do they can ask any price they like.  In the case of the United States, prices are extraordinarily high, because of the demand for steel, the dollar exchange rate and the cost of transporting the material.  It is inevitable that steel of all kinds is going to be scarce and dear, and although we have been able to make arrangements which have enabled essential requirements to be met so far, we cannot say that it is going to continue.</P>

      <P>I said that in the case of wheat and sugar it was taking a very superficial view of our position to say that because we have been able to get supplies so far we will continue indefinitely to get them.  In the case of sugar it is true we have been able to arrange for the importation of a <Col N="355" /> quantity of raw sugar this year which will meet our requirements, but when I said that so far as we can see, unless there was some very exceptional development, we were secure so far as our sugar supplies were concerned up to the end of the war, I had in mind the fact that we would be able to arrange for the keeping up of the beet acreage and the manufacture of sugar from Irish beet.  It is utterly wrong to think that there is no difficulty in getting sugar.  I cannot understand that attitude at all.  In Northern Ireland and Great Britain supplies of sugar are rationed.  Fortunately, we have been able to have our requirements met so far.</P>

      <P>I cannot enter into details of that kind.  I said that we got it favourably.  Deputy Hughes said there was difficulty about the refining of the sugar.  The contrary is the case. Not merely is there no difficulty, but there has been a fortunate development which indicates that whether we get beet grown here or not the sugar factories here have a useful economic purpose to serve.  Raw sugar can be purchased and imported cheaper than refined sugar.  That is very useful information to have learned.  It is also a fact that the refinement of sugar gives a substantial amount of additional employment which is very welcome.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the making of a protest concerning an attack on a neutral ship conveying materials to this country.  In the ordinary course if information was received that an act of war was directed against a neutral vessel or a vessel of our own nationality bringing supplies to our country, it would have been the function of my Department to bring it to the notice of the Minister for External Affairs with a view to having a protest made.  But before we would do so we would have to have the information verified, because we could not act simply on newspaper reports.  In the case the Deputy referred to, a neutral ship was carrying a cargo of animal <Col N="356" /> feeding stuffs and we applied forthwith for a report from the master of the vessel as to what happened.  That report was, in fact, only received to-day.  In matters of that kind one must be very certain that an attack did, in fact, occur before rushing in to make protest.  In the case of that particular ship the captain alleges that torpedoes were fired at it, but that none of them hit it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the availability of the supply of second-hand sacks in the country, which might be collected and reconditioned for use.  It is, of course, not practicable to use second-hand sacks for flour.</P>

      <P>However, to meet Deputy Dillon's point, I may say that there are in the country a number of firms engaged in the business of buying and reconditioning second-hand sacks, and I presume that they have established as efficient an organisation as could be created for that purpose. I am certain that if there is no agent purchasing supplies in Deputy Dillon's area, or in any other part of the country in which supplies are available, if some of the firms engaged in the business are notified they will make the necessary arrangements to collect them.  In any event, we think that this is a matter which might be left to the commercial firms engaged in the business.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hurley referred to matters affecting price control.  I spoke yesterday at some length concerning the principles which we are endeavouring to apply to matters of price control.  The Deputy mentioned certain incidents which, he said, had occurred to his own knowledge.  He mentioned that an investigation had been taken up by my Department at the request of a local authority in Cork into the price quoted them for coal by a local merchant.  The result of that investigation was that the price quoted by the merchant was a reasonable price, having regard to the circumstances. The coal in question was transported from a port on the East Coast of Great Britain.  Subsequently, arrangements were made for the merchants in Cork to get their coal from ports on the West Coast of Great Britain, with the result that the price went down by 2/- per ton.  That is the explanation of the two cases to which Deputy Hurley referred.</P>
      <P>The price of coal has been regulated in discussions with the Coal Merchants' Association in each of the principal importing districts, and I must say that they have conformed very well to the agreement that we made with them. The aim of price control is to ensure that such merchants, or other merchants handling similar commodities, will not get their gross profit increased as the result of an increase in prices caused by war conditions. As I explained yesterday, if the same percentage margin of profit were to apply to the inflated prices of war time, then, of course, the gross profit secured by merchants would be substantially increased.  Our aim is to secure for them that their total remuneration will be the same, and to regulate prices to that end, which means that, assuming there is the same volume of business, if there is a substantial increase in prices the percentage margin of profit will be somewhat lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hurley also referred to a case where an oatmeal miller was permitted to increase the price of oatmeal <Col N="358" /> because there had been a rise in the price of oats as compared with the period before the war.  He said this merchant was making an excess profit on oats that he had in stock.  I do not think that happened.  I explained not merely yesterday, but shortly after the war began, that it is the concern of my Department to ensure that pre-war stocks are disposed of at pre-war prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>How could the Minister manage to do that in the case of oats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing now with the question of stocks.  I agree that in every case it was not possible to apply that principle.  But, in the case to which Deputy Hurley referred, the whole transaction came under the review of the prices branch of my Department, and the Deputy's contention was that it agreed to pre-war stocks being disposed of at post-war prices.  I do not believe that happened.  Deputies will remember that another policy was possible, and was, in fact, urged upon the Government.  Amongst those who urged it was Deputy Dillon.  Those people contended that, after the war ended, there would be a slump in which stocks purchased at high prices would have to be disposed of on a falling market, and that merchants should be allowed to accumulate reserves now against that anticipated slump by permitting them to charge post-war prices on their pre-war stocks.  We did not accept that view.  We think that it will be possible, in the circumstances that will arise when the war is ended, to take special action in this country which will preserve traders against undue losses.  I think it is unwise to build entirely upon the experience of the last war in this country which is neutral in this one, and which now has a native Government capable of and concerned to preserve the interests of its citizens.  The experience gained during the last war may not work out precisely similar at the end of this war.</P>

      <P>I know that.  In the case of the principal oat merchants in the country we are, in fact, examining their books weekly and fixing the prices at which they can sell their stocks. There are various grades of merchants. I understand there are intermediaries who buy from the producers and sell to other merchants, but the people we have been dealing with are the larger merchants who sell direct to consumers of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes, I think, is peeved that there is a war on.  He gave me the impression that he was not facing up to the difficulties which the war is creating.  We all know it is desirable that the sacks which are required by the exporters of seed potatoes should be made available at as low a price as possible, but merely to say that does not get them.  After all, we have to remember that one third of the adult population of Europe is, at the moment, filling sand-bags, and that the demand for jute sand-bags is so enormous that it is inevitable there is going to be a scarcity of jute and canvas for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the increased price of jute did not justify the price charged for bags.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that the increase in prices that took place had not been fully justified by the increased cost of jute.  With regard to agricultural machinery, it may be true <Col N="360" /> that American agricultural machinery is not as good as British, but if we cannot get British machinery we have to buy it in America.  Deputy Dockrell said that it would be an advantage to get our timber supplies imported in British ships.  The British, of course, are subsidising freights on timber, and if the Deputy can give me a good argument why the British should subsidise the freight on timber to this country I will use it.  It must be a good one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking that into account, it is a great deal below the other way.  Can he get it in British ships?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite clear that the British have not sufficient ships for their own requirements, and are chartering neutral ships for that trade.  Deputy Cosgrave raised a question regarding petrol rationing, and said that no additional allowance was given to accountants.  It is true that an additional allowance was not given to accountants as such.  The mere fact that an individual is an accountant does not entitle him to an additional supply, but if he can show to the satisfaction of the officers of the Department that he requires an additional allowance for the conduct of his business, then he will get it.  In other words, the merits of the individual case must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be considered. It can be taken as a general principle, upon which the distribution of an additional allowance is based, that all those persons who require to use a car for their business, or to facilitate their business activities, or in some other way in connection with their professional or other avocations, will get an additional allowance of petrol.  That is to say, taking the case of the commercial travellers, without examining individual cases, we can give them an additional allowance if a car is insured as a commercial traveller's car, as it is a reasonable assumption that it is required for his business.  We give a similar allowance automatically to <Col N="361" /> doctors and to other professional people in respect of whom it is reasonable to assume the use of a car is essential to them.  In the case of accountants, they did not get an additional allowance merely because they are accountants.  They have to show, as well as those in every other class of business, that the nature of their business is such that they require to use a car.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn referred to a matter that does not arise out of the war situation, and, on that account, it was a relief to hear it, namely, the fixing of the same maximum prices for bread in the larger centres as in the outlying rural districts.  The Deputy may be assured that before the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act was brought into operation, and the price of bread fixed, that question was very fully considered, and it was deemed equitable to fix the same overriding maximum price for bread under various conditions of sale as set out in the order for the whole country.  In fact, the position before that Act came into operation was that, in a number of outlying rural areas, the price at which bread was sold was lower than in the larger centres.  Their labour and other costs being less, they could compete quite effectively with those in other areas.  I do not think any point raised has been left untouched.  I assure the House that it is not the policy of the Government to put distributors out of existence.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hurley and I raised a point about having local committees to help the Minister.  What was the Minister's reaction?  We have got no reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after the outbreak of war I considered the desirability of taking steps to establish local committees, and I came to the conclusion, eventually, that it was desirable to postpone action, at least, for a while.  In a period when prices are <Col N="362" /> rising everyone is alleging profiteering. That is inevitable.  People do not like to see prices rising.  They do not like to have to pay more for commodities they buy, and would like to feel that it is due to some cause which can be remedied, whereas, in fact, most of the increases that took place were due to causes outside the control of anybody, the increased cost of imported materials.  It was felt that it was desirable to allow people to adjust their minds to the circumstances of the war, and to appreciate that a certain higher level of prices was inevitable in respect of some commodities, and to get them to understand that there was in operation machinery for investigation and control which my Department operates.  We have, in fact, been able to procure sufficient protection in the case of complaints received from a very large number of areas, and arranged for the investigation of these complaints by inspectors. As a result inspectorial visits have been very much appreciated in the areas concerned.  At any rate, it is obvious that the visit of an inspector to a particular district, and his activities in investigating prices charged for commodities, have aroused considerable public interest, and it has made known to the public that there is machinery for such investigation which they can avail of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a feeling that local committees could be more effective on principle I would be in favour of any device which would help to secure the co-operation of the public with the administrative authorities. I do not know if Deputy Corish suggests that the committee set up in Wexford by the corporation did not do effective work.  That committee sent in a list of prices which the people thought too high.  It did not follow that these prices contained any element of excess profit.  Prices may have been too high without it being possible for anyone to remedy that situation. The officers of the prices branch can tell, almost at a glance, in relation to <Col N="363" /> any prices whether they are likely on investigation to be too high, because they have already investigated similar prices on more than one occasion in many other parts.  If there is a feeling in any district that such a committee could be really effective, and that it will not be effective for a short while and then fade out, I am quite prepared to take the necessary steps to set it up.  I have no objection to that.  The only reason I have not taken action is that I had some doubt whether it would work, and I did not want to appoint officers or a secretary or undertake other expenditure for something which would disappear in a short time.</P>

It would be well if there was some connecting link in a town with the in spector when he arrives.  That would help the public to feel that the Department are doing something in that respect.</P>

      <P>The Prices Commission has had additional functions given to it in relation to the carrying out of tariff reviews.  An Act was passed following the trade agreement with the United Kingdom, and its administration is under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The legal position is that the Control of Prices Act is administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Department <Col N="364" /> of Supplies is working under the Emergency Powers Act.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that the point I have raised apparently cannot be answered by the Minister, because he says it is a Prices Commission (Department of Industry and Commerce) point.  I would be precluded from raising that on the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce will say that it has already been debated on this Estimate. I spoke before about my difficulty in appreciating the difference between the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce. Apparently there is a Prices Commission (Department of Supplies) and a Prices Commission (Department of Industry and Commerce), and the Minister has made that clear to us here.  I am perfectly satisfied with the answer if I am allowed to raise the point on the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote.  But I submit it is most unfair that the Minister should say it is not his business to answer it, and that then on a technicality it should be ruled out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination of the cost of production in flour mills here, as I explained, is a highly technical and expert job.  The actual cost of production of a sack of flour varies from mill to mill and from day to day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained yesterday how the price of flour is determined. Deputy Dillon mentioned that the Prices Commission six years ago reported that, for the first quarter of the year during which they investigated the accounts of the flour millers, an excessive profit had been made.  They drew up a formula on the basis of which they said the price of flour should be determined.  That formula provided for variations in the price of flour with variations in the price of wheat.  But over and above the price of wheat, it was based upon the average cost of production in Irish mills.  That formula is still in operation to some extent, but had to be modified because of variations in different charges.  But it is on that basis that the price of flour is fixed, and that means that it is on the basis of the average cost, and not on the basis of the cost in the least efficient mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the production is at the port mills.  When I say the average cost, it is the average cost per sack, and the bulk of the flour produced is produced in the highly-efficient mills at the ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying. The danger is that that is why their profits are so high, because it is produced in the port mills in Cork, and we have five outside mills as against two port mills.  It is easy for them to make excessive profits, because the production is based on the average of the mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister probably knows, in a number of other neutral countries, particularly in Scandinavian countries, which are neutral like ourselves, and which have problems arising out of the war akin to ours, the Governments have found it advisable to set up representative committees in industry consisting of employers, on the one hand, and trade unions on the other hand, with the assistance of liaison officers from various Government Departments. Although the war has only been on for six months, the reports so far received from these committees have indicated that they have rendered very valuable service in husbanding the resources of industry, in planning industry, and in looking ahead for the necessary raw materials for industry.  Will the Minister indicate whether he has given consideration to the creation of similar committees here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the matter from the standpoint of supplies, rather than management or suggestions even <Col N="368" /> in an advisory capacity for industry, I think the Minister has power to suggest, in respect to the activities of his Department, that he would like to have the views of anyone in respect of supplies.  Surely it is within the province of the Minister to take the initiative in having committees set up in various important industries with a view to advising him from time to time on the position in those industries in respect of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so. It is the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to keep in touch with industries, and if, in the course of doing so, he discovers that difficulties in connection with the supplies of materials are arising, then the fact is communicated to my Department which endeavours to see that these difficulties are removed.  That is why I say that the particular idea which the Deputy has in mind is one for consideration, in the first instance, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and possibly he has considered such an idea.  I know there are some committees in existence which bear that out, but the question must be answered by him and not by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as the Minister would get the viewpoint of the industry from the standpoint of the employer and the worker would he consider the necessity of discussing it with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see whether any committee could be set up with a view to seeing if anything can be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have prohibited the export of native timber.  We are granting licences for the export of such classes of native timber as cannot be usefully used here.  The question of cutting native timber is, of course, a matter for the Department of Lands, and I understand that they require four trees to be planted for every one <Col N="369" /> cut.  The matter the Deputy had in mind is adequately safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. The price of timber has been advanced and, at the present moment, it is colossal, and is likely to reach a fantastic figure.  Freight has gone up from around £3 5s. last year to £20 this year. That is the freight that has been paid for wood from Canada.  I want to know whether the Minister is aware of the efforts that have been made to deal with the situation?  The suggestion has been made that we should slaughter our own woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have set up three organisations for buying timber abroad.  One is for the Dublin and eastern area, the second is for the southern area and the third is for western counties.  All these corporations have the sole right of buying timber and importing it here, the idea being to effect the greatest economy in the purchase of timber and its transport here.  These corporations are now functioning.  Although prices have risen, there has not been any difficulty about supplies.  The stocks of timber now are as high as were the stocks this time last year.  So far as prices are concerned, we are considering what action has to be taken to reduce freights and to effect economies in shipping. We realise there will be very large increases in prices.  That is unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation is that the man who cuts a tree must plant four trees for it.  Anyone who has experience of any sort in agriculture knows that that is a ridiculous regulation. I am putting this to the Minister, that it is his business if this timber is there growing in this country to allow it to be cut.  There is an idea abroad amongst people in cities who do not understand these matters that when once a tree is planted it remains there for ever.  Now, even though a tree is a beautifying addition to the countryside it is a national loss unless it is cut at the time when it is mature. It so happens that one of the reasons why farmers object to timber on their land is that the roots grow out beyond <Col N="370" /> the tree and make tilling difficult. Another thing is that the leayes and branches of the trees in the summer keep off the sun.  The situation now in this country is that we are short of timber, and I am putting it to the Minister that it would be a judicious thing if timber rises beyond what one would conceive to be an economic price, that the slaughter, as they call it, of our native timber should be permitted. That is my view of the situation as regards timber so long as freights and the cost of importing timber from abroad are as high as they are at present. I trust that the Department of Lands will give permission to loosen the regulations with regard to the cutting of trees.</P>

    <P>The Order Paper and the White Paper in connection with this have been circulated to Deputies.  Deputies are aware that the purpose of this Vote on Account is to enable sums to be made available for the carrying on <Col N="375" /> of what are termed the Supply Services during the interval which must elapse in every financial year before the Dáil has had an opportunity for discussing each Supply Service Estimate in detail. Normally, the greater part of the first four months of the financial year has elapsed before all the Estimates have been considered by the Dáil and the Appropriation Act passed into law.  It is, therefore, customary to provide in the Vote on Account sufficient moneys to cover the working of the various Departments and Services for the period from the 1st April to the 31st July.  The amount necessary in most cases approximates to one-third of the total net estimate for the year, but in some instances a departure from that proportion is necessary. The various items comprising the Vote on Account of £10,630,000 are set out on the Order Paper and in the White Paper which have been circulated.  As Deputies will already have observed from the volume of Estimates, the total net provision for the Supply Services in respect of the year 1940-41 is £30,511,359.  The net provision for 1939-40, including Supplementary Estimates, is £31,422,626.  The original net provision for 1939-40 was £30,248,897, but to this figure we must add £370,000 for Supplementary Agricultural Grants, giving a new total of £30,618,897.  This £370,000 was taken into account in the 1939-40 Budget and, after the necessary legislation had been passed, was provided by Supplementary Estimate.  As compared with the revised total of £30,618,897 (i.e., excluding all Supplementaries except that for the Agricultural Grants) the provision for the coming financial year is down by £107,538 or, making allowance for the fact that the Estimate for the Tariff Commission was not moved last year, we find a net decrease over the whole Supply Services of £106,788, as at the outset of the two years.</P>
    <P>In considering this decrease it must be remembered that arising out of the war substantial increases in expenditure have had to be provided for in various directions.  For instance, the increase in bonus payments to civil <Col N="376" /> servants, as compared with the current financial year, has meant an additional provision of, roughly, £150,000.  New services, such as the Department of Supplies and Censorship Service, have had to be instituted, and rising cost of materials has been reflected throughout many of the existing services. Notwithstanding all these factors tending towards increased expenditure, I am happy to say that the activities of the Economy Committee, coupled with a rigid scrutiny in my Department of all items of expenditure, in co-operation with other Departments have resulted in a reduction instead of an increase in our total requirements as compared with the current financial year.  Taking into account the Supplementary Estimates in the current financial year, the total of the decreases in the various Votes amounts to £1,360,849, while the total of the increases amounts to £449,582.</P>

      <P>There is a motion down in my name to reduce the entire Vote by £350,000.  That figure of £350,000 was as good a calculation as I could make within a certain limited time of the amount I thought should be withdrawn from the Government in relation to the Volunteer portion of the Army.  It was intended, therefore, to give rise to a debate on this question of the Army&mdash;a debate which would, of course, arise more suitably on the motion in the names of Deputies O'Higgins and MacEoin.  I understand that an arrangement has been come to whereby time will be given for that particular discussion after Easter.  I should like to know if that is so.</P>

      <P>This matter has already been raised several times in <Col N="377" /> this House.  A debate took place on the 3rd and 4th January, when the matter was passed over on the basis of an inquiry which was going on.  The implication was that the report of the inquiry would be tabled, and that it would be discussed.  The matter was again raised by question by Deputy MacEoin.  When he endeavoured to raise it on the adjournment, he was advised by the Ceann Comhairle, I understand, that it was not a matter which should be raised in a casual way, that it should be raised by way of motion.  A motion was put down.  The Government were asked if they would give time for discussion of the motion, and there was delay in answering that question.  In these circumstances the Vote for the Army came on and, on the understanding that time would be given for the motion, Deputies refrained from discussing the raid on the Magazine Fort, the court of inquiry, and certain repercussions from it.  The Vote was allowed to go through without discussion on these matters.  At the same time, Deputy Norton had a question down, and, when he attempted to raise the matter on the adjournment, a certain point of view was put to him which he accepted.  Deputies on this side were then informed that time was not going to be allowed for discussion of this motion.  Accordingly, the next step was taken of putting down this motion to reduce the Vote on Account by this amount.  That motion was specifically aimed at a particular part of the Army, but not the whole, in order to give rise to a general discussion on Army policy, and to allay the public mind regarding that scandalous episode at the fort.  I was informed to-day that the Government had changed their point of view, and had definitely promised time for discussion of this Army matter after the vacation.  With that record, it will be understood that I cannot lightly abandon the right I have to speak&mdash;perhaps for a considerable period&mdash;to-day, and to discuss on the Vote on Account this Army matter without having a specific assurance that the debate will take place on the motion at a time to be arranged, but specifically stated to be as soon as possible after Easter.</P>

      <P>It is accepted that the Government are offering Government time to discuss this motion at a reasonably early date after Easter, that date to be suitable to the Opposition Party and the Government.  The suggestion has been made from the Government side that only three hours of Government time should be allowed. A number of speakers desire to intervene in this matter, which is considered important.  I had not an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Government Whip, but I consider that three hours is not a reasonable time, and I think it would be possible to arrange for a reasonable time&mdash;a day, if necessary&mdash;for this discussion. Perhaps the Tánaiste will agree that, if the matter is to be discussed in Government time at all, it cannot be satisfactorily discussed in three hours and that a reasonable time should be given so that Deputies will not feel that they are being choked out in argument.  I ask the Tánaiste if he can assure us that a reasonable time will be given for the discussion of the motion.  It would not extend beyond a day.</P>

      <P>I am not one of the Whips, and I was not intimately concerned with the details of these discussions. I understood that discussions <Col N="379" /> were proceeding between Deputy Mulcahy and the Whip on our side and that general agreement had been reached to give time for discussion also this Army matter.  I understood also that the discussion on the Army business would not take place on this Vote. That is as much as I know, but I am sure that no obstacle will be placed from this side of the House in the way of any reasonable proposition put up from the opposite side.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything at all about the discussions which have taken place or are alleged to have taken place, but I assume that, this being a Vote on Account, it is permissible for any Deputy to deal with the question of the administration of any Department of State, including the Department of Defence, or the Department for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, and that the right of individuals in the House is not in any way affected because one group may arrange with another group to discuss a particular matter at some time in the future.  If I want to discuss the administration of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or the Department of Defence, I presume that I can do so on this Vote on Account.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat in a dilemma now.  Deputy Norton has raised a point which does not specially affect me at the moment, interested as I am in finding out what is the position of the debate on the Army.  As a preamble to my main point, may I suggest that if a remark of yours, Sir is to be taken as a binding ruling in advance which would limit the debate beyond what we are accustomed to, I would, for instance, understand that it is possible to make a speech here giving reasons why salary should not be paid to a certain Minister because of his policy in connection with his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that <Col N="381" /> has been the ruling generally accepted and generally adhered to.  On this other matter, which is, to my mind, the more important matter, I have a motion down to reduce this Vote by £350,000, and as I am placed at the moment, I am entitled to talk and Deputies of other different Parties are entitled to speak for a couple of days on that motion alone.  As I intend that motion, it is specifically aimed at the policy of the Government in regard to the Army over a number of years, culminating, as I suggest it did culminate, in the weakness which led to the scandalous episode in connection with the Magazine Fort.  I am in the position, placed as I am now, that I can have that debated over the next couple of days, and I am asked to surrender that.</P>

      <P>I have no monopoly of the fish trade or anybody in it. That is the Government's job at the moment.  It has been suggested that I should surrender that right which I have at this moment, because it is considered that a debate on the Army should more properly take place on a definite motion, and there is a definite motion on the paper.  With that point of view, as so expressed, I agree.  The only thing in the balance now is when will the debate on the specific motion take place and over what period will it range.  I am quite prepared to accept that it should be arranged by agreement between the Whips after Easter, with the provision that it should be as early as possible after Easter, that, <Col N="382" /> of course, however, subject to agreement; but, on the matter of limitation of time, some period of three hours has been mentioned.  Personally, if any agreement is made, I will submit to it, but I understand that no agreement was made on that point, and I suggest that a three hour period for a debate on this motion is ludicrous.  I am prepared to waive the rights which I think I have at this moment on the understanding&mdash;I state it here now to have it contradicted or accepted&mdash;that this motion, in the names of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy MacEoin, will be given Government time at the earliest possible date after Easter, and that there will be no three hour limitation, but that the Whips will try to get together to see what reasonable limitation can be put upon that debate. On that specific arrangement, I will withdraw this motion, but I want to know if that is the specific arrangement.</P>

      <P>The only familiarity I have with the position is that I was expressly told last night, on behalf of the Government, that they were not going to allow this time for this motion.  I, therefore, when advising the Ceann Comhairle in accordance with precedent as to what matter was to be discussed on the Vote on Account, told him that the policy with regard to the Army in certain aspects was to be discussed.  It was then communicated to me by the Ceann Comhairle, having been in touch with the Government, that the Government had changed their mind on the matter and that it was possible to make an arrangement. I said that I entirely agreed that the only type of satisfactory discussion you could have on the matter was on a formal motion, that anything else was injurious to Parliamentary institutions, and I completely accepted the offer to have the discussion on the motion, but I did not agree with the idea of restricting the discussion to three hours.  I had neither the <Col N="383" /> time nor the opportunity to get beyond that, but I take it that the Tánaiste would agree with me that a discussion on this matter could satisfactorily be carried out only on a formal motion which led to a decision, and that he would also agree with me that if a discussion on the motion is going to lead to a decision, however unsatisfactory it may be to Parties in the House, reasonable time ought to be allowed for it.</P>

      <P>The very important fact to which we think it necessary to draw attention at present is that the Government is a poor substitute as an employer for the ordinary employing machinery, either industrially or agriculturally.  In bringing the House down to consider certain facts in connection with that matter, I have been encouraged, firstly, by an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 3rd March last, wherein is discussed that increased taxation means more unemployment and less security for <Col N="384" /> workers and, secondly, by the type of speech made by the Minister for Supplies, who for so long was Minister for Industry and Commerce and was responsible for unemployment, at the University last night.  The Minister for Supplies last night said that our public life required &ldquo;the stimulus of a new challenge to the assumed facts and accepted theories upon which all their political policies and theories were based&rdquo;.  He thought that we were facing a real danger now; that it arose out of the unemployment position, and the fact that the machinery of the present system was not dealing with the unemployment situation; that the only hope that some light might be thrown on the matter was that the younger generation would wake up and take interest in public affairs; and that neither the industrial leaders nor the Labour leaders at the present time appeared to have any clear appreciation of the parts they must play if we are to cope with unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Supplies who, as I say, has been for so long a time Minister for Industry and Commerce, who started with a plan to deal with unemployment and who, together with his colleagues in the Government, succeeded in getting a very substantial sum of money&mdash;all taken from the pockets of the taxpayers and ratepayers of this country&mdash;went to the Commerce Society of University College, Dublin, last night, and said that we were in very great danger and that we wanted something in the present situation in the way of the stimulus of a new challenge to all concerned: a challenge to the assumed facts and the accepted theories of the situation.  So far as we can see from his remarks, the challenge that he seems to expect is a challenge that youth will throw a brick through the national parlour window and thus make people wake up inside in order to see what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It paints the Minister for Supplies as being in a very hopeless position, but the Minister for Supplies, more than anybody else, is one of the people who is responsible for &ldquo;the assumed facts and the accepted theories&rdquo; in <Col N="385" /> the present situation, and one of the assumed facts, belled and bellowed from one end of the country to the other and rammed down the throats of the people here in this House and in the country&mdash;and the outstanding fact &mdash;is that ever since the present Government took over the handling of substantially increasing portions of the people's money, and spent that money themselves, employment has been increasing and continuing to increase, and that everything, so far as the increasing of employment in the country is concerned, has been going on splendidly.  That is one of the assumed facts, and the only theory that I can see operating on the situation since Fianna Fáil came into office was that the Government were the people who could best spend the money that our people have.</P>
    <P>Now, I think it is nearly time that we got some kind of realisation of the facts so as to pin them down definitely for everybody, and that we should ask the Government, with regard to certain facts, whether they do accept these now, because for the many years we have been placing facts before the Government, it has been rammed down our throats that we did not know what we were talking about, that we were inexperienced and did not understand figures, and that figures were dangerous things in the hands of inexperienced people.  What is the outstanding fact with regard to employment and expenditure when we look back over the last few years?  One of the outstanding factors can be judged by the National Health Contribution Fund.  We can come back to the significance of that later on, but the annual increment in employment, from 1926 to 1932, was 11,400 persons in full time employment. That was the annual increment every year from 1926 to 1931.  Judged by the same standard, what was the average annual increment from 1931 to 1939?  It was 8,594.  In other words, the average increase in employment in the country, expressed in terms of a certain number of people in full-time employment, was 2,806 per annum less for the last eight years than it was for the previous five years.  During all that time you had thousands of additional men employed on housing, thousands <Col N="386" /> of additional unemployed on relief schemes, and you also had large numbers of persons employed in new industries.  Yet, in spite of the additional employment on housing, in spite of the additional employment all the year round on relief schemes, and in spite of the increase in industrial development here, the annual increase in employment, as measured by the National Health Insurance Fund, was 2,806 less per year for the last eight years than it was in the five years before that.</P>
    <P>During the last eight years, however, the Government was spending huge sums of money more than the previous Government did.  When abstentionism ceased in 1927, we set out to carry on this Dáil with a full representation. Let us take the period from 1927 to 1931; that is, from the first election of 1927 to the end of 1931.  Let us have a look at that period from the point of view of taxation&mdash;at least, I will not say from the point of view of taxation, but from the point of view of the amount of money taken out of the pockets of ratepayers and taxpayers throughout the country and spent by Government machinery&mdash;and let us take the same period and the amount of money taken annually out of the pockets of the people from 1931 to 1939.  We shall see an enormous difference.  I have pointed out what amounts to this: that for every 100 persons put into additional employment annually, between the years 1927 and 1931, there were only 754 persons put into employment annually in the last eight years.  In other words the natural increase in employment in the country was reduced by 25 per cent.; and in what circumstances, so far as the spending of money is concerned?  The total amount of money taken out of the pockets of the ratepayers and taxpayers combined, in the year 1931-32, was £334,251 less than the amount of money taken out of the pockets of the people in rates and taxes five years before that. It was less by £334,251, and during that period there was a natural increase in employment equivalent to 11,400 persons additional per year in full time occupation.  Between the years 1927 and 1938, there was taken a sum of <Col N="387" /> £4,701,000 extra in taxation out of the people's pockets, and £1,607,675 extra in rates.  So that, between rates and taxation, in the year ended March, 1939, there was £6,308,675 more taken out of the people's pockets, and to be spent by official machinery, than was taken out of their pockets before the present Government came into office. They spent that amount of money.  In addition to that they had for spending £1,850,000 land annuities paid up, they had the £2,000,000 which, out of the taxation of £21,000,000, the previous Government paid to Great Britain for repayment of local loans, pensions, and some debts of that particular kind.  As well as £6,308,675 rates and taxes, they had £1,850,000 land annuities and £2,000,000 extra.  That was taken from the people and spent by the Government over and above the moneys that were in the hands of the previous Government.  With that enormous additional amount of money spent through Government and official sources, not only was the normal growth of employment in the country not maintained, but it was reduced by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>If you look at the trend of employment publications issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce for the year 1936-37, page 10, you will get some impression there as to the average number of persons employed month by month for every month in 1936 and 1937 on relief works.  They were in 1936, 7,378 and in 1937, 22,971.  A Parliamentary question on the 8th February, 1939, gives the information that during the year 1938, for every month of the year, the average number of persons given employment on employment schemes was 19,190; and, in column 1086 of the Official Debates of 21st February, 1940, the same information is given for the year 1939 and it is indicated that for every month of the year an average number of 18,112 persons were employed on employment schemes.</P>
    <P>I asked the Department of Public Works whether those figures for the year 1939 meant that 18,112 persons were given full-time employment over the whole year and they said they did <Col N="388" /> not, that actually the men were employed on an average from three or four days.  With a view to finding out what influence that position had on the figures also published in the trend of employment publications by the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;a sample of it can be got in page 28 in their first issue, dealing, I think, with the year 1934-5&mdash;I asked in respect of how many of these national health insurance payments were made monthly and in respect of these how many unemployment insurance payments were made, and the figures quoted are as follows.  In respect of the 18,112 persons employed monthly on employment schemes during the year 1939, the number who paid national health insurance payments was 14,992; the number who paid unemployment insurance payments was 8,985 and the average number who were not liable was 3,120.  Therefore, the figures that are given as the full-time employment equivalent of the national health insurance figures in the publications with regard to trend of unemployment are actually inflated, by reason of the fact that a full payment of national health insurance is paid for a person who works three and a half days in the week.</P>
    <P>That correction has been made&mdash;at least, I have made that correction&mdash; and the position, therefore, with regard to employment equivalent of the National Health Insurance Fund&mdash;I want to record it here, as it is a matter that will have to be referred to from time to time in the future&mdash;is as follows.  The National Health Insurance Fund, reckoned as full-time employment for a certain number of people, shows that the equivalent for 1926 was 285,000 persons; for 1931, 342,000; for 1933, 355,000; for 1934, 370,000; for 1935, 384,000; for 1936, 399,000; for 1937, 415,000; for 1938, 416,000; for 1939, 417,000.  The point has to be made that the figures for 1938 and those for 1939 are inflated, by reason of the fact that persons who worked for three and a half days per week in very large numbers throughout the country are set up in the National Health Insurance Payments as if they <Col N="389" /> were full-time payments.  When we apply the necessary corrective for that, that is, when we eliminate from the figures quoted for employment in the year 1939 the exaggeration of those figures due to the part-time work on employment schemes, we find that the full-time employment equivalent of the National Health Insurance Fund for the year 1939 is 410,753 persons, as against 342,000 in 1931 and 285,000 in 1926.  So much for employment schemes.</P>
    <P>I have indicated also that a very large number of persons&mdash;an abnormally increased number of persons&mdash;has been employed on housing.  The total number of persons employed on housing over the year 1939, more than were employed in the year 1931, was 9,522. The House should know how these figures were arrived at.  It has been accepted, and is still accepted, that the building of one house gives employment to 1½ men for 12 months.  Deputies will find, from information that has been provided by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, that the total number of houses built in the year 1932 was 3,349; that the total number of houses built in the year 1939 was 9,004; and that 4,173 houses were reconstructed during the year 1939.  That meant that, on the basis of 1½ men for a year, to build a house, and a quarter of a man for a year to reconstruct a house, the employment on housing in the year 1931 was 5,023 men over the whole year, and the employment in the year 1939 was 14,545.  So that 9,522 persons were employed on State-aided housing over the whole of the year 1939 more than in the year 1931.  That takes us back to this: that whereas in the five years ended 1931 employment in the country increased by 11,400 a year in terms of the National Health Insurance Fund, and in the eight years ended 1939 increased only by 8,594, it would only have increased by 7,501 if the relief scheme employment was not counted in and it would only have increased by 6,311 if the additional expenditure on housing was not counted in.  So that, for every 1,000 of an increase in employment in the five years ended 1931, there was only 754 of an increase with housing <Col N="390" /> and relief schemes counted in, in the last eight years.  That would have only been 658 but for the relief schemes and it would only have been 554 but for the relief schemes and housing.  It brings us to this, that but for relief and for housing the natural increase in employment in the country over the last eight years was only 55 per cent. of what it was in the five years before and that the taking by the Government, and through local bodies, in the increased rates, of £10,000,000, and the expenditure thereof did nothing as far as increasing employment in the country except to reduce the natural increment by 25 per cent., and, outside housing and relief schemes, to bring it down to 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>Now, that is not taking into consideration the amount of money that was taken out of the people's pockets by millers, by bacon curers, by the butter subsidy, in order, we were told, to improve and increase the prosperity of this country.  These are not taken into consideration.  We are not going into these things at all.  We are simply taking the amount of money spent by the Government and by local authorities. In spite of that huge amount, that was the result.  Everybody who is endeavouring to keep employment going, and, on the other hand, endeavouring to meet the amounts of money that are being taken out of the people's pockets by the Government, knows only too well what is more and more being pointed out by speakers and writers throughout the country, that the spending of money by the Government is the most inefficient, the most wasteful way in which money can be spent, and that we have reached a point now that makes it impossible for this country to keep up, through its normal machinery, the normal growth of employment.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Supplies indicating yesterday that neither among the industrial leaders nor the Labour leaders does there appear be any clear appreciation of the part that they must play if we are to cope with unemployment.  He raises the question as to whether democracy suits our needs and what should replace it. <Col N="391" /> The fact is that we have not been having democratic methods of Government operating in this country for the last four or five years&mdash;you can go back to 1932&mdash;the last seven years&mdash;when the people who are the producers, the people who are the vital centres from which production must come and around which increased employment must grow, year in year out, were being robbed more and more of the vital thing that is necessary for them to keep their production increasing and to keep their employment increasing, that is, their capital.  And here we are.  We are being presented with increasing bills.  The amounts of money that I have already quoted as having been taken from the people were amounts of money up to March, 1939.  The <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of, I think, 6th March, shows that £693,000 was taken out of the people's pockets in taxation up to the 6th March this year more than last year and, as far as the ratepayers are concerned, the county councils alone have issued for the year we are passing through at the present moment a bill for £150,000 more than last year.</P>
    <P>What has been the result on the population position in the country? The Government came into office at a time when the population of this country was rising.  It continued to rise for a few years, but, under the impact of the policy which takes money out of the people's pockets and spends it inefficiently, the population was quickly driven down.  We can take three periods since 1926 when we consider the population.  The first is from the year 1926 to the year 1932.  The population figure for the year 1926 was 2,971,000; 1927, 2,957,000; 1928, 2,944,000; 1929, 2,937,000; 1930, 2,927,000, Then the population began to rise: in 1931, it was 2,933,000; 1932, 2,949,000. In that particular period the population which had been falling all along stopped falling and began to increase, but the net fall in the population over these six years was 22,000.</P>
    <P>The next period that we ought to look at is the period from 1930 to 1935, when there was a rise in population. <Col N="392" /> In 1930, as I say, the figure was 2,927,000; in 1931, 2,933,000; in 1932, 2,949,000; in 1933, 2,962,000; in 1934, 2,971,000; in 1935, 2,971,000.  The increase had stopped and we were about to turn.  During that period the population rose by 34,000.</P>
    <P>The third period that should be looked at as a separate period with regard to population is the period 1932 to 1939.  In 1932, the population was 2,949,000; in 1933, it was 2,962,000; in 1934, 2,971,000; in 1935, 2,971,000; in 1936, 2,967,000; in 1937, 2,948,000; in 1938, 2,937,000; in 1939, 2,934,000.  So that we have the position that although the population was rising when the Government came into office, and continued to rise for three years afterwards, by the time we had reached 1939 the population had fallen.  It had fallen by 15,000 persons as compared with the year 1932 and during the period from 1935 to 1939 the population fell by 37,000 persons&mdash;that is during the last four years.  A factor which had a special bearing on that was the recurrence of emigration from this country, which had stopped in 1931 and 1932.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies says that the situation is dangerous and that he wants a challenge from somebody to bring us back to facts, that the industrialists and the Labour people are not going to make any contribution towards a solution of the problem.  In the meantime, as apparently in the past, the only people fit to do anything, fit to work, fit to spend, are the Government of the day.  I want to give the Minister for Supplies and his colleagues a challenge.  When the taxation of this country was on the 1926-31 level and was kept steady at that level, when the burden of rates and taxes was diminishing rather than increasing, employment in this country was steadily rising, emigration was fading away, the fall in population was being arrested and the population was being, in fact, increased.  All that was done at a time when there was a very considerable economic disturbance in the world.  We were able to weather that disturbance because of the policies that were being pursued here.  Such <Col N="393" /> was the condition of affairs at the end of 1931 that in reviewing the world's position Our Holy Father the late Pope Pius XI, in the Encyclical, <i>Caritate Christi Compulsi</i>, issued on the 3rd May, 1932, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we pass in review the long and sorrowful sequence of woes that, as a sad heritage of sin, mark the stages of fallen man's earthly pilgrimage from the Flood on, it would be hard to find spiritual and material distress, so deep, so universal, as that which we are now experiencing; even the greatest scourges that left indelible traces in the lives and memories of peoples struck only one nation at a time.  Now on the contrary the whole of humanity is held bound by the financial and economic crisis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The circumstances of 1930 and 1931 were such that our Holy Father could write these words.  They were such that two years before that, the League of Nations set up an economic commission to report on the economic depression of that time.  A year before the Encyclical was issued, that is on the 14th May, 1931, the Report of the League of Nations on economic depression was issued.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has already been pointed out that Europe suffered less than most other parts of the world, especially up to the autumn of last year.  The national income of countries largely dependent on the production and export of cereals has been reduced more than that of manufacturing countries.  Countries such as Denmark and Ireland, whose principal exports are animal food products, were relatively slightly affected by the depression until the autumn of 1930.  The fall in the price of animal foodstuffs up to that time was not great and was largely offset by a reduction in the prices of fodder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The special committee set up to investigate the world-wide depression by the League of Nations had to report that Ireland was one of the two countries that out of the whole world had succeeded in weathering the depression. That, I maintain, was attributable to <Col N="394" /> the policies that were being pursued here.  Our employment had increased in a natural organic way year after year to the extent that full-time employment had been found for 11,400.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to the present Ministry?  It was only, I think, about 1933 or 1934 that the present Ministry began to find out that there had been a depression in 1929-30. They found that out after the effects of that depression should have passed, as far as this country was concerned. Every year from 1932 to 1938, the index of business activity in Great Britain has shown a steady increase in such activity.  It was down to 80 in 1932, but by the autumn of 1937 it had risen to 113&mdash;a steady rise.  It fell somewhat in the year 1938, but it has gone up again now and is somewhere near the 110 standard.  By a steady rise over that period, economic conditions in Great Britain showed an improvement of 30 points.  As even the Ministry are appreciating more and more every day recently, economic conditions in Great Britain have a very important bearing on economic conditions here and the improvement that started from 1932 in Great Britain should have reacted favourably on conditions here.  The improvement that has taken place in Great Britain since 1932 is such that people there who are examining the question of how they are going to pay for the war, consider that among other things consumption has to be reduced in Britain, but that the standard of living has risen so much since 1932 that they need not bring the standard of living down to the level at which it was in 1932 and they will be able to pay for the war at the same time. That is, the British people can pay the enormous cost of the present war without bringing the standard of living below the 1932 figure.  While there was nothing in the general situation that should react in an adverse manner against employment here, whilst we had headlines week after week referring to the great industrial development and what the Government were doing to create employment here, the fact remains, in spite of all they have done for the relief of unemploy ment, that the increment of employment <Col N="395" /> is reduced by 25 per cent. below what it was during the five years before they came into office.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the present situation here, is there going to be a facing of these facts?  Will the Minister for Supplies and his colleagues, instead of looking for somebody with a youthful outlook to come and throw a brick in through the window or a spanner into the economic or social situation here, accept the challenge of the records that are written in their own Departmental history?  Will they accept the challenge of these facts and will they understand why it is that industrialists and others find it difficult to carry on their business, the main difficulties being that the Government, as I have stated again and again, think that they can spend better than anybody else, and that there is not a pocket in the country in which they have not had their hands for several years?</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect that I should like the Minister and his colleagues to consider.  Not only was the annual increment reduced, but for the last two years there has been no increment of employment shown in the country by the National Health Insurance Contribution Fund.  I would like to draw attention to this particular aspect of things.  On page 28 of the report on the trend of employment and unemployment in this country there is a reference to the conditions of employment up to the year 1934-35. This particular report was published in September, 1935.  On page 28 there are two columns showing the employment equivalent in the case of the National Health Contribution Fund and the Unemployment Insurance Contribution Fund.  Then it shows the difference and indicates that in the year 1926 there were 124,000 persons who paid National Health Insurance Fund but did not pay Unemployment Insurance Fund; that in 1931 there were 154,000 persons in the same way, so that between 1926 and 1931 there was an increase of 30,000 persons who paid National Health Insurance Fund but <Col N="396" /> did not pay Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question on the 21st February last it was indicated that in the year 1939 there were 153,000 persons who paid National Health Insurance Fund and did not pay Unemployment Insurance Fund, so that between 1931 and 1939 instead of an increase there was a fall of 1,000 persons.  A footnote on the page says: &ldquo;The following are the principal classes excluded from the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts which are included in the scope of the National Health Insurance Acts: (1) Persons employed in agriculture, horticulture and forestry; (2) persons employed in private domestic service; (3) female professional nurses for the sick and probationers undergoing training as such; (4) outworkers not employed under contract of service; and (5) crews of fishing vessels wholly remunerated by shares in profits or gross earnings who are not excluded by special order from the health scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the past five years from 1926 to 1931 there was an annual increment of 6,000 persons in that class added every year.  Not only has there been no increase in that particular class, but there has been a diminution of 1,000 during the last eight years.  Here we have some indication as to the kind of people who have been hit; that is, people in agriculture and horticulture, people in domestic service and outworkers or people not employed under a contract of service.  While there has been a building up on relief schemes, on housing and in industry, you have the wiping out of any increment of employment in these other directions, and I submit when you have that, that the ground is being dug from under your industrial structure; that that is just the sign that all the forced developmen of employment carried on for the last few years cannot last except something is done to reverse the policy which is hitting employment of that kind in the way these figures show.</P>
    <P>I submit that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants a challenge, he will find in these facts <Col N="397" /> that challenge, and I suggest that it would be much cheaper, that it would be a much more satisfactory political and social and economic development, if persons with Ministerial responsibility would accept the challenge of facts, the accumulated experiences of themselves and their Departments over the last eight years, and would work from that challenge and not wait, not carry on the policies that are bringing these dangers about until a challenge of a different kind comes.  If the policy is going to be pursued which brought about that situation, then the challenge will come.</P>
    <P>Under war circumstances there is a natural tendency to drive the Government to accept greater responsibility, to do additional spending.  When the tendency is like that, because of the war situation, it makes it all the more essential that these facts will be looked at and that more strenuous efforts than might otherwise be made would be made under present circumstances to redress and counteract the tendency that is shown in the policy at the present time and that the Government would make up their minds strenuously and effectively to try and leave more of the people's money in their pockets and see if the people would not, as in the past, make a better use of their money than the Government have made of it when they were handling it for the last eight years.</P>

      <P>We are being asked in this Vote on Account to vote a sum of £10,000,000 odd for the purposes of supply services for some months to come.  I think it is appropriate, therefore, that not merely should we review the general economic position of the country, but this Vote also provides the opportunity of ascertaining whether the functions of the various Departments are being carried out equitably, and with due regard to the high responsibilities which reposes in Ministers.  There is one Department in the State in respect of which I have very considerable ground for misgiving as to the manner in which it has been administered, judging by recent affairs concerning it.  I refer to the Department of Defence where we have a <Col N="398" /> Minister responsible for the conduct of the Army, a Minister in whom the House reposes considerable authority and from whom it is quite entitled to expect a very high standard of efficiency, and, may I say, entitled at the same time to expect a very high conception of fair play from that Minister in his dealings with persons under his control.  But we have seen some actions by that Minister recently which certainly do not justify the House in assuming that the Department for which he is responsible is being efficiently administered by him, or that fair play is being meted out to those who are subordinates of his.  I want to direct the attention of the House to certain facts concerning the administration of that Department which arise, I submit, from the fact that we are now being asked to vote a salary for the Minister under this Vote on Account, and which, consequently, brings under review the question of the ability of the Minister to function in that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an example recently of a raid on the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park.  I do not want to go into the details of the raid because, I suppose, judging by the publicity which the matter received, the circumstances of it are familiar not merely to Deputies but to the public.  We were informed by the Minister that a military inquiry had been set up to ascertain whatever degree of deliquency arose out of this particular raid.  In the course of its investigations this same military inquiry required certain officers to attend before it for the purpose of its inquiry into the affair.  A number of officers were summoned to attend before the inquiry and did attend.  Bear in mind this was an inquiry.  This was not a court martial; this was not a court of law; this was not a tribunal before which officers were arraigned as defendants; this was not a tribunal which preferred specified charges against officers.  This was merely a court of inquiry, and no charge whatever was preferred against any person brought there as a witness. The court of inquiry held its meeting. Officers attended as witnesses, and, much to the astonishment of some <Col N="399" /> officers, when the court of inquiry had finished its deliberations, or perhaps even before the inquiry had concluded, notices were served on certain officers in these terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Defence has had under consideration your conduct on the night of the 23rd December last when an armed raid occurred at the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park. The Minister feels that it is not in the interests of the Service that you should retain your commission.  He is satisfied that your conduct on the occasion in question would merit retirement for misconduct or inefficiency, but, before taking the necessary steps to that effect, he is prepared to give you an opportunity of tendering your resignation voluntarily from the service, and to recommend acceptance of your resignation. Your reply to this communication should reach the adjutant-general not later than five days from the date hereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If any totalitarian State in Europe were guilty of methods of trial of that kind, I think it would justify the severest condemnation by people who still believe in preserving the basic elements of justice in dealing even with an opponent.  But note the terms of this particular letter: &ldquo;The Minister feels it is not in the interests of the service&rdquo; that this particular officer should retain his commission, and he is satisfied &ldquo;that his conduct would merit retirement for misconduct or inefficiency&rdquo;, but before he acts finally the Minister will give him five days in which he must reverse the entire process by which the Minister arrived at a conclusion of this kind.  That notice was served on an officer who was only recently promoted for exceptional efficiency, and his promotion was confirmed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Another officer has had a very tender experience at the hands of the Government in being notified that the Minister for Defence was satisfied, on the evidence given by this particular officer at the inquiry, that he should be dismissed the service.  The particular <Col N="400" /> officer who has been dismissed the service has been employed as a stores officer at the Magazine Fort for many, many years, but merely as a stores officer&mdash;merely as a caretaker in other words; and during the period of his control there, with the exception of this isolated incident, not a single charge could ever have been preferred against him for the manner in which he discharged his duties, and not a single pennyworth of military property has gone astray.  Yet, on this particular occasion, when the guard at the Magazine was reduced to negligible and indefensible proportions, a raid takes place and this officer who has served the nation from 1916 onwards gets an abrupt, brusque note intimating to him that he is being dismissed the service because the Minister for Defence is satisfied on his evidence at this socalled inquiry that he should be dismissed. The officer, in fact, was not on duty in the Magazine on the night in question.  The officer, in fact, was at Confession in a city Catholic church on the night in question.  It might have been better for him, in the eyes of the Government, if he had not been either at Confession or in a church.  It might have been better for him had he been in the Magazine.  He might now be in the Army, but because he made an unfortunate mistake, from the service point of view, of being in a church instead of being in the Magazine, the officer loses his position, and loses all the service which he has rendered to the State from 1916 to date.</P>
    <P>Another young volunteer lieutenant has been similarly treated.  What I would like to do is to call the attention of the House to certain facts which emerge from this situation.  The first thing is that since the raid on the Magazine the guard there has been considerably strengthened.  Picked troops are now being employed there. Additional officers are now on duty there.  The whole place is now being defended as never before, all of which proves conclusively that the Government clearly realise that their previous method of defence was entirely inadequate to protect the place.  But <Col N="401" /> yet, because of the fact that a raid took place while it was not securely defended, those to whom a nominal responsibility had been assigned, and those who had no responsibility whatever, are now being treated in this manner only to save the faces of people who imagine they have untainted political faces.</P>

      <P>We have here a Vote on Account for £10,630,000.  It is right perhaps that we should draw some attention to this expenditure.  From 1932 until now the increase in expenditure and taxation has risen by something like £9,000,000.  Outside of that we have indirect taxation imposed amounting to about £3,000,000 at least. There are, in addition, numerous items added to local taxation the effect of which has been that the national income, and certainly the national income of a great portion of the population of this State has been considerably reduced.  Obviously, one cannot go on extracting ever-increasing amounts from the ordinary pockets of the people without making the economic position something desperate.  That is to say, except in cases where you have by the Government methods or otherwise increased the income of the particular person you tax.  Now, in regard to the bulk of the people of this State the reverse is the case.  I do not think that any Deputy in any quarter of the House will get up and say that the incomes of the great bulk of the population have been increased or that they have been able to hold their own in the last eight or nine years.  Yet in face of that additional taxation, direct and indirect, amounting to probably £15,000,000 to £16,000,000 has been imposed.  There has been direct taxation in local bodies and there has been concealed taxation in the case of such things as wheat and beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government cannot go on with schemes of extra taxation without playing have with the ordinary economic life of the country unless, of course, the income of the people is being increased.  But the fact is that the incomes of the people of this State have been steadily reduced.  One of the particular effects of this taxation has perhaps been the reduction in employment.  One might have thought with the advent of the present Government, the unexpected increase in taxation that has followed and the <Col N="408" /> huge expenditure of public money generally that the direct effect, at all events, would be a reduction in unemployment. If anyone ever believed that the reckless expenditure of public money could reduce unemployment that belief has now been falsified.  We have had eight years of that experiment and the result has been a clear proof that the unemployment problem cannot be helped in that way.  To-day we have far more unemployed than we had in 1932.  We have possibly a greater addition, too, in those who are only in receipt of part-time employment. One of the most deplorable things in this whole business is that employment on the land has been steadily reduced.  There are to-day fewer men permanently employed on the land than there were eight years ago.  There are fewer now than at any time perhaps since the institution of this State.  It could not well be otherwise.</P>
    <P>When the times grew worse the farmers were bound to economise in something and the only thing they could economise in right at the start was labour.  The farmers could not meet the whole of the local taxation, the increased price of all commodities purchased and at the same time spend the same amount of money on labour. There had to be drastic economies effected by the agricultural holder and one of the things he had to do was to reduce expenditure on labour.  Very many farmers throughout the country, though they regretted it very much, had to fall back on reducing the number of their labourers.  They could not cut their outgoings in any other way.  Their taxation, rates and annuities had to be paid and then there was the increased cost of the ordinary necessaries of life to be met.  The ordinary implements for the farm cost more.  The one thing left to them to cut was their expenditure on labour. Consequently we see everywhere around the country sad evidences in the deterioration of the land and the condition of farming generally.  One has not to travel very far to see this. One has only to go into any farming community and see the condition of the moist land everywhere.  One has only <Col N="409" /> to look at the fields that ten or 12 years ago were in fairly good condition to find them now over-run with rushes, flaggers and other weeds that grow on damp lands.  That is because there has been no attempt made by the individual farmer to drain these lands or to clear out the openings of the drains during the last eight or nine years.</P>
    <P>The farmer can find whatever labour he can afford to pay for essential work on the farm&mdash;to save his hay if he is a dairy farmer, or to put in his crops if he be a tillage farmer.  But work that should have been essential but which could lapse for a few years without any dire results he neglected. No attempt was made to keep the lands in proper order by drainage. Drainage is expensive work.  It requires a great deal of expenditure by an individual farmer to keep his farm drained.  Where drainage has not been carried out, lands which were once fertile have, in some cases, deteriorated into swamps.  Again, you find that on farms where you used to see well-kept farm buildings and well-kept fences these are not now in a proper condition. The farmers could not attend to them.  In many counties there are practically no fences and there are, consequently, differences between neighbours because one man's cattle trespass on another man's land.</P>
    <P>At a time when a great effort was being made to house the people, the farmers' buildings went into dilapidation. The housing policy of the present Government was one of the items that did give employment.  If it had not been for that, the position in regard to employment would have been disastrous.  But for the number of people put into work by housing, a position which was deplorable would have become disastrous.  The unemployed would have overrun us.  In a period when huge sums of public money were being spent on housing&mdash; useful work which was giving employment&mdash;farmers' houses and out-offices fell into a state of dilapidation because the farmers had not the wherewithal to keep them in proper condition. There is little help for the farmer in that respect.  He has got <Col N="410" /> either to do the work himself or to leave it undone.  If he had been fairly prosperous he would not have regretted expenditure on labour for the doing of these things, but virtually every Deputy knows that he was unable to afford the necessary expense.</P>
    <P>Many Acts have been passed to provide help for other sections and to assist in providing employment.  These efforts did not succeed very well.  They were experiments.  While farmers were letting workmen go because of their circumstances, we had sums of money&mdash;in one case one-third of a million&mdash;dumped into a bog.  That sum, spread over a number of farmers, might have enabled them to put a big hole in the unemployment problem. We had various other examples of wilful extravagances in experiments.  We have had Acts passed recently for the development of social life.  We have had Acts passed to provide fire brigades and other amenities for people in the towns, partially at the expense of the local rates.  It is possible to provide light and water for people in the towns at a certain expenditure.  The State bears its share and local bodies the other share, but the farmer has to dip his hands into his pockets all the time.  There is nobody to give him light, water or drains.  He has got either to provide them himself or to go without them.</P>
    <P>We are asked to point to any item in respect of which these Estimates could be reduced.  It is not our job to point out to the Government where they can retrench.  That is there job.  This country was run on £9,000,000 less than it is being run at present.  If you take indirect taxation into account, it was run on £15,000,000 less.  Let them take a lesson from the manner in which it was run before.  The manner in which it was run then pleased a number of people.  The people were better off and there were fewer unemployed. They have a headline there.  Now, we are setting a new headline.  The Government have refused to economise but they are asking local bodies to economise.  Recently, a circular was sent to the local bodies advising economy.  It went so far as to suggest <Col N="411" /> that they should riddle the cinders so that there would be no loss.  A Government that put £333,000 into one bog as an experiment and that spent countless other millions in helping financial hogs to extract the last penny from people asks local bodies to riddle the cinders. We are asked to point out to that Government where they are to economise. If we come down to such small things as cinders, there are in this Vote some cinders to which one could point one's finger.  The President's establishment has gone up from £3,600 to £3,900.  That is not much.  It is only a flea bite but is the President to be asked to riddle the cinders in his Department and effect some reduction.  The Oireachtas is costing £1,000 more than it did last year. We might riddle the cinders here to some effect.  The Department of the Taoiseach is up by £300. These are infinitesimal increases but a Government which has increased expenditure in respect of nearly every item and which has increased the number of officials has no right to go to the local bodies and ask them to riddle the cinders.  They themselves should pass things through a sieve and riddle not only the cinders but some of the small coal and some of the turf.</P>
    <P>You cannot go on squeezing the people all the time and, yet, expect that a case can be made by anybody in this House for the reduction of the number of unemployed.  It is impossible to go on squeezing the people unnecessarily year after year, extracting the last 1d. from them with a forceps, and expect that, by some miracle, circumstances may so alter that the farmers who own the land may be able to employ a few extra men.  We have had recently adoption of the principle put forward by us that, when all is said and done, it is to the land we have to look to for any improvement of the position into which we got during the last six or seven years.  That is generally recognised now, I am glad to say.</P>
    <P>There has been an all-round conversion to the belief that the experiment of bolstering up every section at the farmers' expense has failed, that many <Col N="412" /> of the wild-cat schemes, such as bogholes and others, have failed, that there is little hope for such schemes as alcohol factories and other such schemes and that, in the end, we have all of us, Government, Opposition, Labour, Independent and every other section, to recognise that the only hope of resurrection for this country depends on the prosperity you bring to agriculture and that the only hope there is of reducing the number of unemployed is in bettering the conditions of agriculture.  You will not better the conditions of agriculture, or of any other class, until you get a fairly big sieve and drastically riddle the expenditure of one Government Department after another and try to lop off about 33 per cent. of this expenditure of £10,000,000, and of the total expenditure of some £30,000,000.  Then, perhaps, with the expenditure of some portion of that money in the direction in which it ought to have been expended long ago, in aiding the agricultural community, the class which, it is now admitted, is the only class to which we can look for any hope for the country, there may be some chance. It is idle for any Deputy to spend his time going through item after item in this huge list of expenditure, and the best thing I can say to the Government is, in their own words: &ldquo;For God's sake, start riddling the cinders.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Supplies, speaking at University College last night, said that if there was one thing more than another that might make a discerning person uneasy about the future of the Irish race, it was the apparent absence of interest among the young generation in public affairs, the apparent absence of any movement of thought amongst them, of any of that questioning of accepted theories which preceded the emergence of new facts. Evidently, the Minister is becoming distrustful of his own policy and is looking for a new movement to bring new ideas to the surface, and he is amazed that the younger generation is not producing such a movement.  Does the Minister not realise that Government policy, during the last seven or eight years, is responsible for the <Col N="413" /> present state of despondency, hopelessness and inactivity amongst our people?</P>
      <P>During their period of office, we have had a huge increase in the cost of administration, an increase, as Deputy Bennett pointed out, of approximately £9,000,000, together with an increase in the cost of local administration, and side by side with those increases, a catastrophic fall in agricultural production, our main industry.  Production in agriculture fell from £63,000,000, in 1931, to £48,000,000 last year, and when we compare that with our competitor countries, our competitors in the market which everyone is beginning to realise is the only market available to this country, and when we see the tremendous strides which they have made during that period&mdash;in Northern Ireland, agricultural output increased from £10,000,000 in 1931 to something like £16,500,000 last year&mdash;we begin to appreciate the problem with which the country is faced at present.  The difference between the Government's policy and ours is that the Government believe that the only solution of unemployment, or for any of our social or economic problems, is piling on new burdens of taxation and giving the people some sort of direct dole or Government employment.  We are diametrically opposed to that policy because we firmly believe that the solution of unemployment is to be found in encouraging private enterprise.  The best employer to be got in this or any other State is the private employer, and the man who is going to get the best value for money spent is the man who puts money into enterprise and produces something which is a national asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking of expenditure here, one is struck by the fact that when one compares the services provided last year with those provided in 1930, there is no apparent improvement in any of them.  Services, so far as the people are concerned, were as good then as they are to-day, and yet there is an increase in the cost of these services of approximately £9,000,000.  In other words, not only had we to pay through the nose for those services, but we got <Col N="414" /> damn bad value for the money.  One does not always grouse if an article is costly, provided it is good, and sometimes if you get good services, although the administration is a little expensive, there is some compensation, but I suggest that the services which the people of this country have got for the money expended do not at all justify the expenditure of that money.  What is really wrong?  To my mind, what is wrong is the problem of unemployment. As I have said before, the Government felt they were going to solve the problem themselves, but any sort of prosperity which we have had during the régime of the present Government has been purely artificial.  It was created by various schemes&mdash;unemployment schemes, minor relief schemes, housing, water and sewerage schemes. Some of them, I admit, were good and useful social works, but they were nonproductive and they were a continuous drain on the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>I submit that if you propose to tackle big social problems, the safest and best time to tackle them is during a period of prosperity, and in order to provide the wherewithal to tackle these problems, it is the responsibility of the Government proposing to tackle these social problems to promote the necessary prosperity side by side with their attempt to solve these problems.  It is only by doing that, that you can preserve the resources, and particularly the financial resources of the country. That was completely lost sight of by the present Government.  They completely lost sight of the fact that we here, as an agricultural country in competition with the keenest agricultural producers in the world, Denmark, Holland and other countries, had to be free of all these burdens, and certainly of any heavier burdens than our competitors had to bear, if we were to compete in that competitive market.  That principle was completely ignored by the Government.  Tariffs and burdens of all sorts were piled on the backs of the agriculturists of this country&mdash;piled on the back of the main industry of this country.  The burdens and charges on production here were higher than in Denmark, Holland and Northern <Col N="415" /> Ireland, with the result that we were unable to compete and our production fell, and that fall in production&mdash;that catastrophic fall&mdash;was inevitable under Government policy.  Time and time again our people, in a desperate effort to try to husband their resources and to preserve their means, lost money as a result of this.  They were producing an article with an increased cost of production and they had at the same time to sell below the economic level because their cost of production was too high.  As a result, eventually, their financial resources were drained and dissipated by the policy of the present Government and they went out of production.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, side by side with that situation you had the Government going in for wholesale relief schemes and social work, which was not sound economics.  For instance, you had £1,500,000 doled out directly from the Department of Industry and Commerce for unemployment, and you had, through the Office of Public Works, another £1,500,000 for minor relief schemes.  You might add to that another £500,000 by way of a contribution from public bodies, making £2,000,000 from the Office of Public Works, and you might also add about another £3,000,000 for housing, waterworks schemes, and so on.  In any case, you had something over £6,000,000 a year for such things.  Now, I admit that some of the work on which that money was spent was good work, but none the less it meant a continual drain on the resources of the country, and yet, during that period, agricultural production was falling and no responsible person in the Government appeared to show any concern about it. That was the situation that obtained when this emergency arose and when this present conflagration broke out in Europe.</P>
    <P>I submit that, notwithstanding the gloomy picture I have tried to paint, it is not yet too late to undo the damage that has been done to agriculture, and that this present situation affords this country an opportunity of rehabilitating the agricultural community and <Col N="416" /> marshalling the resources of agriculture so as to build up a sounder and better economy within the State.  Now is the time for a bold and courageous attempt to be made by the Government, and to go in intensively for agricultural production and, by a proper agreement with the British Government, to secure a market for our produce, not only during the war but also in the postwar period, and, if possible, to secure a preferential treatment for our produce there and, at least, get rid of that vicious quota system which was the product of the economic war.  There is an opporunity available to get rid of that system.  That opportunity has not been available up to the present, but I am convinced that it is there to be availed of now, and I say that it ought to be availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out, Sir, that there is an opportunity offered here for remedying this situation and that the masses of the people are coming to a realisation of the fact that the economic structure of this country rests absolutely upon our main industry, which is agriculture, and that there is a responsibility on the Government to rehabilitate that industry that has suffered so much during recent years.  That can only be done, in my opinion, by making available ample credit facilities for our farmers, and by reducing the existing burdens of taxation.  I think there are some signs that the Government are beginning to appreciate the danger of the situation. The Minister, in introducing this Vote, referred to the economy committee that has been set up and said that, in the face of increased war costs, he had managed to save the situation in so far as there is no increase for this coming year.  The Minister, however, will need to go much further than that and will have to pull down these burdens within reasonable limits and within the capacity of our people to pay.  He will have <Col N="417" /> to drop a lot of these attempts at any other new-fangled ideas such as peat schemes, alcohol factories, and the huge expenditure on an Army, that is unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, expenditure on torpedo boats, coastal watching, and all that kind of nonsense, that has not been justified in this House and that cannot be justified in this House. Drastic retrenchment is necessary and a helping hand will have to be given to agriculture.  As I have said, an opportunity is now offered and assistance is urgently needed.  We feel that that assistance has not been given, or is not likely to be given, to the extent that is necessary.  The Government must mend its hand if it is going to save the situation.  It must reduce this huge expenditure in view of the type of administration we have now as compared with what we had in the past. That is the first thing that must be tackled&mdash;a reduction in the huge cost of administration in this country, and, side by side with that, we have to develop and to get into production all our people, and a good deal of that can be done on the land.  With regard to the amount of money that is spent directly on minor relief schemes and so on, I personally would not question the amount spent on such schemes if that money were spent on productive work, but the fact is that we are spending too much money on work of a nonproductive nature, and that is what is draining the resource of this country and crippling the economic position of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather extraordinary that more interest is not taken in this debate.  If the country could see the sparse attendance at this debate in the House, it would not reflect great credit on political enthusiasm when a general election comes along.  We are called upon here to vote £10,000,000 on account of a sum of £30,000,000 odd.  I wonder if the Government responsible for putting up this demand have considered the real situation which obtains in the country at the present time.  As a Government in the present emergency <Col N="418" /> they fail lamentably.  When an emergency occurs in any country that is free, the busiest man in that country, and the man who is requisitioned immediately, is the Minister for Finance; but our Minister for Finance, when the emergency broke on this country, might as well have been on a holiday in Hollywood as Minister for Finance here.  He did absolutely nothing, and he confessed in this House that he had no power to do anything.</P>
      <P>The bank rate of interest went up. In no country in the world but this does the bank rate of interest go up without the knowledge and consent of the Minister for Finance; and it went up in this country.  I put a question to the Minister subsequent to that period as to who was responsible for the increase and as to whether he was consulted. He said he had not been consulted and that the people responsible for the increase were the Banks' Standing Committee.  This country is a business and there is nobody looking after it.  I am not blaming the Minister for Finance personally; the powers of his office do not extend to control of the bank rate, though they should.  We hear a lot about formulas of freedom, but that is the essence of freedom.  We have the power to have it but we have not taken it; we have left others in control of our money, in control of our credit; and while others are in control of our credit, while we have not taken control of it, we cannot have anything but the condition we have&mdash;thousands out of employment, unemployment growing and unemployment assistance a deadweight on the backs of the taxpayers and the ratepayers.  That has been a growing burden since the present Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, one would expect to see some signs of improvement, to see the Government surveying the situation and preparing some machinery to amend the present situation and to look to the future.  We are confronted now with a war situation all around us. What has the Government done?  A spectacular thing: five torpedo boats to defend our shores, a few bombing planes, millions of pounds spent on an Army.  From a military, naval or aerial <Col N="419" /> point of view, it is absolutely a waste of money.  If anybody wishes to attack us, our few torpedo boats which cost us such a lot of money, our Army which cost us a lot of money and our bombing planes which also cost us a lot of money, would be worthless in the defence of this country.  There is only one way to defend it within our resources.  That one way is to produce here what we want during the emergency. If the money spent on bombing planes, on the Army and on torpedo boats were pumped into agriculture we might not be afraid of any unemployment as far as foodstuffs is concerned.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister for Supplies speak here to-day.  I do not think we have a supply of anything.  We are growing more corn this year, but will we have sacks to put it in?  Will we have binder twine to tie it with; will we have wire to truss the straw?  I asked the Minister for Supplies that question to-day; he was certain that we were all right regarding that.  I said to him&mdash;and I knew what I was taking about&mdash;&ldquo;merchants are not satisfied that they will get supplies.&rdquo; Then the Minister jumped to another position, he shifted his ground and said: &ldquo;Well, whatever will be there will be equitably distributed.&rdquo; Is it of very great use to me, if I have 100 acres of corn to reap and tie and I get my full share of the binder twine that is available, but can only get enough binder twine to tie ten or 20 acres? What is the Minister for Supplies doing?  He gets his whack out of this £10,000,000.  What are we paying him for?  I wonder if he realises the position we are in.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture sits down in his office and makes an order &mdash;I presume, under the Emergency Powers Act which we foolishly gave him&mdash;that the owner of every holding or farm in the country must till 12½ per cent. of the arable land.  The effect of that will roughly double the area under tillage.  To break up land that is growing grass is only preventing it from growing good grass, unless there are fertilisers, manures to put into that <Col N="420" /> land to cultivate a crop.  Have we those fertilisers?  We have not.  Where is the sense in breaking up land that is growing something and leaving it to grow nothing but weeds if you have not fertilisers to put into it?  Notwithstanding what the Minister for Supplies said here to-day on another Vote about all that is being done with the Belgian Government, it must be remembered that the Belgian Government had, when war broke out, unlimited&mdash;so far as our requirements were concerned&mdash;superphosphates for sale and available for use.</P>
    <P>We had a tariff to protect our own manure works here.  Should it not have been the first steps of both the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture to see what were the supplies of manufactured superphosphates and other manures, and also to see how the raw materials for our manure factories stood?  What are we told to-day?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies, who expects us to vote this money to him, told us that they bought phosphates in Africa&mdash;an adequate supply for the factories&mdash;but that only 25 per cent. has been delivered and they cannot get ships to deliver the balance.  I am a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board; I have no other knowledge of shipping, but, from time to time, new information and intelligence comes up and is debated by people who are practical shippers, and who are very largely in that line of business.  There was no trouble whatever in getting ships.  In fact, thousands, perhaps millions, of tons of shipping were lying idle.  We are a neutral country. After the war broke out we declared our neutrality.  Some countries have ships perforce lying idle.  They dare not put them out on the seas.  Why did we not buy them and ship those phosphates from Africa to Dublin? Would it not have been better than buying the torpedo boats or the bombing planes or spending millions on an Army?  It was not done. Although it is not exactly the province of the Minister for Finance&mdash;it is the responsibility of the Minister for Supplies&mdash;I would like when the Minister <Col N="421" /> for Finance is replying that he would inform the House if he got any requisition from the Minister for Supplies for money to buy ships to transport to this country the necessaries of life that this State requires if it is going to survive as an independent neutral State during the present conflagration.  I think the Minister for Supplies has lamentably failed in providing the materials that we require. He talks about wheat and beet.  Does he not know that they will not grow by pressing a button?  Does he not know that they have to be fertilised? He was in charge of the Ministry and it was his job to make fertilisers available. He did not do it.</P>
    <P>We have not government by an individual here; we have government by an Executive Council and I take it that when the Cabinet meets inter-Departmental controversies and discussions take place.  I wonder did the Minister for Agriculture consult his colleagues on the Executive Council before he made that tillage order.  I am sure he did.  Surely, the ten or 12 members who constitute the Executive Council would not require to be practical agriculturists when discussing a matter of such far-reaching importance and such essential national importance in the present emergency to discuss it from a business point of view.  They know that if they are only growing a head of cabbage or a drill of potatoes in their own gardens it requires manure. Did they not ask the Minister for Agriculture, or did he not explain to them, that manure was required if this tillage order was going to be of any national advantage?  We all know that you can increase the area under tillage but have less production.  There is a certain amount of fertilising that has to be done for crops.  It is better to have a small area with adequate manuring than a large area without manure.  The question of breaking up the land did not meet the national emergency.  The only thing that would meet the national emergency from a food point of view would be to break up more land if there were manure to fertilise it.  The Minister for Agriculture should know from statistics available that there is less farmyard <Col N="422" /> manure this year than there was last year, thanks to the policy of the Government in practically killing stall feeding.  There is less farmyard manure to manure a larger area this year.  So far as superphosphates are concerned, the most that we are assured of is 80 per cent. of last year's supply which was not at all adequate for the area under cultivation.</P>
    <P>From a social and a national standpoint, even apart from the national emergency, the greatest danger threatening this country is unemployment. Here there is the necessity for more food production.  You cannot produce extra food without extra employment. So there you had at hand the dual purpose of increased tillage; to provide more food that is necessary for the nation to carry it through the emergency and to create more employment in producing that food.  These two purposes both hinged on more fertilisers being available.  The provision of fertilisers has been neglected.  It is such culpable negligence that it almost amounts to treason.  It is astonishing that the Government did not meet that situation and it is more astonishing still that the country is lying so quietly under that neglect by the present Government, that Government which coolly comes along and says they want another £30,000,000 for the coming year to neglect the national business equally as well as they neglected it last year.  Now they are asking for £10,000,000 on account to neglect the nation's work.  Should not the Government consider the appalling situation that is confronting this country?  I am sure they did, but they are not taking any steps that I can see to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>There are about 120,000 people unemployed while all around the country there is work waiting to be done. There are thousands of acres of land in this country&mdash;perhaps millions&mdash;that could be brought into production.  The Government should lay it down as a law that no able-bodied man or woman will get money without earning it.  It is time that was done.  Otherwise, how can the few who are producing continue to carry the day to day maintenance of the State and carry the <Col N="423" /> thousands who are perhaps doing necessary work but not directly productive work, in addition to carrying the old and the young and 120,000 unemployed and their dependents out of a population of less than 3,000,000? The thing is an economic impossibility.</P>
    <P>And consider the future.  Consider the young boy and girl growing into manhood or womanhood, who have seen their father going week after week to draw the dole.  When they come into manhood or womanhood they also set out to draw the dole.  They never think of work.  Before long, we will have a large population in this country who do not know how to work, who never worked and who will not work. I think the position is terribly serious. I would appeal to the Minister that the time has come when something big and bold and drastic must be done. Take, for instance, an activity that gave a vast amount of employment here in the last ten or 15 years, in which the Minister was personally interested and, when he was Minister for Local Government, did all a man could do in that capacity to help forward&mdash;that is, house building.  Practically all housing operatives are idle at the present time.  Thousands of pounds weekly are out of circulation and all those who used to benefit, when that money was in circulation, if not actually unemployed, are next door to it.  This city feels the poverty caused by the breakdown in housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now Minister for Finance, the Minister for the public purse in this country.  I said a moment ago that such an office in any other country in the world would carry with it the inherent control of the banking system of the country.  I am not going to preach bank robbery or inflation, but I am going to advocate some forward move that will put the people working.  Ministers come in here and guarantee prices, but no power on earth can guarantee prices in this country if you are going to have hundreds of people idle.  How can you guarantee prices if you have hundreds of people without the money to buy the commodities for which you guarantee these prices?  The guarantee that <Col N="424" /> our farmers want is the provision of whole-time employment for the workers of this country, not a guarantee to cover prices.  We do not want any price fixed in pounds, shillings and pence.  We want to see the people of the country working and no other guarantee is worth the paper it is written on.  In this country we have all the materials, with the exception of timber, necessary to build ordinary houses.  In Dublin we have thousands of skilled operatives.  Many of them are idle; many more have gone to Wales where they are making huts for the British Army&mdash;at less wages than those for which they would work here at home.  That in passing; that is a detail.  While we have all these materials available, there are at least 20,000 additional working-class houses required in the Dublin City area.  I do not think the Minister will dispute that figure.  That does not take into account houses that would be built by ordinary speculators for middle or higher-class people&mdash;if we have any such in this country.</P>
    <P>Why should we not have our workers employed in assembling the materials we have here, and erecting houses for the people who are clamouring for houses?  There is one man in this country who should be able to answer and he is the Minister for Finance.  He controls the public finances.  He should control the national credit and the banking system in this country and he should be able to give us a definite answer.  I hope he will deal with that when the time comes.  I hope also that neither he nor anybody else, in discussing this matter, will say that I advocated in any way social credit or inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall meet him then on another Vote.  I am just putting the unemployment problem to him and, though in local politics and as Minister for Local Government, I crossed swords with him on many an occasion, I pay him the tribute that he has always shown a very great personal interest in the point I am developing, in housing.  I think that if there is one activity which provides employment, as the Minister knows, it is housing.  Surely he must ask himself the question: how cannot we in this, a creditor country, get money to build houses?  Surely a creditor country should have great national credit?  It certainly beats me to know how this creditor country with all the materials, with the exception of timber, necessary to build the thousands of houses that are required cannot go ahead with the building of these houses.  We export our money, we export our operatives, we leave people in the slums and those who will not emigrate go on the dole, while the few who are working will have to pay for that dole.  I would appeal to the Minister to start, but then I cannot appeal to him, I suppose, to initiate new legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I leave him to his own devices when I appeal to him to consider this problem and the solution of it.  If there is any trouble about new legislation, let the Minister face the racket.  I shall not, in face of the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider another aspect of this matter.  Much public and private money, the credit of the country and the credit of individuals, have been pledged to start new industries and on the whole I agree with that.  These industries have been fostered, nursed and brought to the vigour of full maturity, by the sacrifices made by all <Col N="426" /> the people in the shape of tariffs which they have borne and with which I agree.  Some of my colleagues may not agree with them but I do, 100 per cent. Would it not be a pity to let these industries decline when we have gone to the expense of bringing them to the stage of development which they have now reached?  The Minister knows, first hand, that many of these industries manufacture materials for house-building. If house building declines or ceases, have not the factories to close down?  Have not the operatives in these factories to get out, go on the dole or emigrate?  The factories cannot pay the interest on the money advanced to build them and to purchase machinery.  You have them there as white elephants.  Such instances will grow and multiply, if you do not continue the industry that requires the finished articles of these factories as the raw materials of that industry.  In other words, the new factories that provide the materials for the building industry cannot survive unless the building industry goes on.</P>
    <P>In the building industry all that is required is the provision of money&mdash; that is, as regards the speculative side of the building trade.  What is most required is money to help private individuals to purchase their houses.  The Minister knows that the facilities that were given and that were found to be satisfactory and safe have been withdrawn. He may say that that is not quite accurate, but from the point of view of a practical business proposition I may say they have been withdrawn. I appeal to the Minister to consider restoring those facilities in order to help the building trade.  If we find difficulty in getting essentials into this country, the Minister should consider advancing money or credits to provide ships that would fly our flag and bring in essential commodities, the raw materials or the finished articles that we require here.</P>
    <P>Looking down this list, I can see all that is paid out for unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance. There is here an item relating to pensions.  This State is not 20 years of age, and yet there is £500,000 going <Col N="427" /> out for pensions.  No wonder the people in the country are asking why should they work and what are they working for.  Where did all the pensioners come from over-night, as it were?  If any one of us was down the country and read this list of items representing the handing out of money for which nothing is given in return, I do not think he would feel very much like throwing off his coat and waistcoat and tucking up the sleeves of his shirt.</P>
    <P>I hope we will get something by way of a formulated programme from the Minister.  I hope that some attempt will be made in the near future to grapple with this question of unemployment. Why could not some machinery be set up?  Why could the Government not take over certain public works, let them be connected with either land reclamation or bog reclamation?  Why do they not provide areas where work can be carried on and why not try to meet unemployment within large areas? They could schedule those areas and anybody who found himself unemployed in a particular area could go to the local Gárda barracks, or the local post office and there get a travelling voucher that would take him to where the Government would have State employment for him and where the Government would maintain him.  If he is an able-bodied man he would work for his maintenance.</P>
    <P>If something like that is not done soon a serious position will arise.  The time will soon come when something like it will have to be done or you will not be able to feed the hungry.  Why not do it now?  The Government could adopt some scheme that will make it compulsory on able-bodied people to earn their living, if they cannot get a chance in the ordinary way.  We have society organised and you may call it a capitalist system, or whatever system you like, but, as it is organised, in the ordinary course of competition, if some people find themselves crushed out of employment, perhaps you cannot blame them.  It would be a bad country that would allow anybody to starve, but he would be equally a bad citizen who expects his country to keep <Col N="428" /> him idle.  He cannot make the work, the Government can, and it should at once set about establishing the machinery that will carry out the dual purpose of maintaining those who find themselves crushed out of employment and not able to earn their own maintenance, while at the same time, if the State maintains the citizen, that citizen will render some service to the State for the cost of his maintenance. Is there anything wrong in that?  Is it not essential that it should be done?</P>
    <P>We all know there is a good deal of malingering.  Many people who have been drawing the dole have come to me and said: &ldquo;I suppose you have not a job?&rdquo;.  That is the way they start looking for one.  If you ask them why they are looking for a job they say: &ldquo;We will be knocked off the dole&mdash;it is only a few shillings, but it is useful&mdash;if we cannot assure them in the labour exchange that we are making an attempt to get work.&rdquo;  They then ask you to sign a document for them and they add &ldquo;If you sign that for me I will be all right and I will continue to draw the dole.&rdquo;  That sort of thing has been going on.  If a fellow is turned out to starve he will stretch his conscience before he will starve.  It is the Government that should provide the machinery so that those men will not have to stoop to that type of subterfuge.</P>
    <P>The Government can undertake land reclamation, but no individual can. Land reclamation will pay for itself at any price, but it will take a long time. When land requires a lot of labour to reclaim it, it will take such a long time, when reclaimed, to repay the money expended that the ordinary individual cannot afford it, but the State can.  On the one hand, the State would be giving out money for nothing and on the other hand it would be keeping people accustomed to work and making them better citizens.  I think it is the greatest evil we have in our midst and every effort should be made to try to cure that evil.  It is disheartening and nauseating to be observing every year the giving of large sums towards unemployment assistance when we all know that home <Col N="429" /> assistance is paid out as well.  From the Government Benches they have boasted of the provision that is being made towards unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It is the greatest condemnation of the Government that one could have when they have to admit the necessity for increasing the amount in that respect.  It would represent much better government and it would be a better sign of prosperity if a proud Minister for Finance could come in here and tell us that no unemployment assistance was being budgeted for because all who wanted work were working, and anybody who found himself temporarily out of employment would be provided by the Government with work whereby he would be able to contribute to his own maintenance. I need not moralise on the benefit to young people growing into manhood and womanhood to be put into work at that age instead of wasting their lives as many of them are doing at present.  I hope when the Minister for Supplies gets this money his Department will make better use of it than it did last year, and that he will look further ahead and buy essentials, even if the price has gone up; that he will endeavour to get money or credits to buy all essentials before they get dearer still.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Agriculture, with the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Finance, will get together and make sure that the essentials for producing food for man and beast will be made available in adequate quantities.  From information that I have received in the last ten days from all over the country, I am afraid that there has either been some misunderstanding or that someone has failed to honour promises made.  Correspondents&mdash;farmers&mdash; from places as far apart as Donegal, Cork, Kilkenny, Wexford, Leix, Westmeath and Roscommon have written to me to say that the Minister for Agriculture assured a deputation of farmers in the beginning of February of this year that adequate credits for agriculture would be placed at the disposal <Col N="430" /> of every farmer.  I do not know how true that is, but I am giving the information to the House as I have got it.  We know that if the promise was made it has not been honoured, but whether it was made or not it is something that the Minister for Agriculture should apply himself to.  We heard a good deal about credits yesterday.  I would develop that now but for the fact that we heard enough about it yesterday, and that there will be another opportunity next week to speak on it.  All that I will say on the matter is this, that if the Minister for Agriculture makes an eleventh hour or a death-bed repentance and comes to the conclusion that he must supply adequate credits for agriculture, I hope that when his appeal goes to the Minister for Finance it will be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Vote on Account the Government are asking for a sum of over £10,000,000.  If a comparison be made between the total sums estimated for the current year and for the year 1940-41 it will be found that, instead of a reduction, there is an increase of over £250,000 foreshadowed for next year.  It is true that more has been spent than was estimated for last year.  That happens every year, and we may expect the same thing will happen this year. Since I became a member of the House, seven years ago, the Estimates presented year after year show an increase, although the present Government got into power by promising that they would cut down all extravagant and unnecessary expenditure.  They used to remind us of the time, some 30 years ago, when the taxation for the 32 Counties was about £10,000,000, and tell us that there was no justification for the increase in expenditure here. They promised that if they got the chance they would reduce taxation by at least £2,000,000 a year, that they would provide for all the unemployed and make this a land flowing with milk and honey.  But, unfortunately, we have had eight years' experience of that Party, and find that, instead of achieving the happy results they foreshadowed in those days, they are <Col N="431" /> simply marching with the times, so that to-day taxation in the State, instead of being £10,000,000 a year as it was for the 32 Counties in 1910, is almost £40,000,000 for Twenty-Six Counties. That is the sum that is required for national purposes, including Central Fund services and the provision made by way of Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>That being the position, we can say that we are marching with the century, because the figures I have given show that on the average there has been an increase of £1,000,000 a year in the last 30 years.  If that continues for the next 30 years, I wonder will the State be able to bear it?  While the present policy is in operation, I am afraid there will be a need for a steady increase in public expenditure.  Think of what unemployment is costing, of all the ill-spent money there is, and of the increased expenditure on officialdom as well as the money that has been wasted on wild-cat schemes.  If all that continues the expenditure will go on increasing year after year, but where, I ask, will this money be found?  I am afraid that the Minister has reached the bottom of the taxpayers' pockets. I pointed out to him some months ago when he came in with his Supplementary Budget imposing new taxes on tobacco, stout and other things, that, instead of deriving any benefit from these taxes he might lose, because owing to the high prices charged for these commodities, people could not afford to buy them, and consequently their consumption would go down.  I think the Minister will find that to be so at the end of the financial year. When you have that state of affairs in a country the position is very serious. Expenditure is increasing, but the ability of the taxpayer to meet it is being lessened year after year.  That shows that we are reaching a very critical point.  We find that production is not keeping pace with this increased expenditure.  In the case of the principal industry of the country, agriculture, there is less profitable production to-day than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking to a man engaged in the egg trade recently, who actually <Col N="432" /> lives in Northern Ireland, and who ships eggs, and he told me that the price there was 30/- per cwt., while the price in Éire is 21/-.  There has been some change made since last week, but I do not know how it has affected the position.  The price of lambs is also affected, as here again the Irish producer has to sell mutton under the price paid in Northern Ireland.  There is no value at all placed on hides. There is complete confiscation of hides owing to deliberate interference by the Government.  The position with regard to agriculture is that while farmers are expected to increase tillage, and are making every effort to do so, they have not the capital necessary to provide seeds, labour and manure.  Those who have capital cannot get the manure because of the failure of the Minister to provide the necessary phosphates. We have been urging the Minister to provide the necessary supplies, and while we have a Minister for Supplies, just as the great nations at war have such Ministers, yet the supplies are not being provided.  Phosphates have been purchased in Africa.  They could have been got from alternative sources but the Minister did not want these phosphates.  The only kind of phosphates he wanted was rock phosphates, which would keep the factories here going.  Every farm is a little factory, and it could produce plenty of food.  If raw phosphates could not be got manufactured phosphates should have been provided from another source.  The Minister made no attempt to provide manufactured phosphates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>That was only a passing reference.  The most serious thing is the unemployment problem, and the burden that it is imposing on the taxpayers, apart altogether from the demoralisation that it is causing <Col N="433" /> among young and old, who should be engaged on productive work, instead of reporting week after week at the local police barracks.  I know people who travel four miles to the local barracks to report themselves for the purpose of receiving 2/-.  It is hard to expect that people reduced to that position are ever going to be good citizens of this or any other State.  It is a sad commentary, after eight years of office by the present Government, that we have 120,000 able-bodied citizens being supported week after week on nominal pittances to keep them from starvation.  The production of agricultural stuffs has been going down, while prices are not at all comparable to the prices that people have to pay for their necessaries.  What agriculturists have to sell is sold at reduced prices, but they have to pay inflated prices for what they buy and no profit is left.  there is a constant struggle to make budgets balance and make ends meet in every household, but nothing is left the people for the improvement of their position generally.</P>
      <P>I hope Ministers will make some attempt to provide employment by introducing some scheme to put those relying on unemployment assistance into productive employment that will also give a return to the nation for the money that is being spent, and train these people to be good workers and good citizens.  I notice that some Ministers have promised to consider bringing forward some such scheme.  I hope it will not be neglected, because the country is at present becoming demoralised and impoverished.  This should be a very favourable opportunity. As Deputy Belton pointed out, there is need for increased production and an assured sale for what is produced on the land.  It should be a suitable time to devise a scheme to put idle hands at work on the production of food.  That cannot be done successfully without manures.  I do not want to refer to that matter now, but I hope the Minister will consider having something done with the least possible delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his observations on this Vote this evening <Col N="434" /> Deputy Mulcahy crystallised into short space practically a wholesale condemnation of the economic and financial policy that has been pursued during the last seven or eight years. The general impression one gathers from supporters of the Government in various parts, is that Ministers have learned that the theories they held some years ago, and for many years previously, have generally proved to be unsound.  When we come to consider the actual results of the policy pursued, as announced this evening by Deputy Mulcahy, we have now arrived at the point when there is no annual increase in the numbers of persons registered for national health insurance.  That is surely a warning not only to the Government but to the country, regarding the danger of pursuing that particular line of policy.  There had been an average increase in the numbers of persons registered from 1926 and 1927 to 1932, of 11,400.  A new economic, financial, and agricultural policy started in 1932, and now after eight years, notwithstanding all the efforts made&mdash;and they were many&mdash;notwithstanding all the industries which Ministers boasted had been established, and notwithstanding the huge sums of money collected over and above the annual revenue and expenditure each year for the previous five years, we have to record that there has been an actual deterioration in the progress of the country.</P>
      <P>It is all the more remarkable having regard to the statements made last night by the present Minister for Supplies who, up to a few months ago, was Minister for Industry and Commerce. He was the Minister charged with the responsibility of inaugurating a whole new series of industries of one kind or another.  With a sound and sensible policy for the starting, maintenance and extension of industries everybody would be prepared to agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is disagreement, however, is in the practical application of that policy to the special circumstances of a country such as this.  It is quite true that the Government's policy in connection with industrial expansion <Col N="435" /> was cut across by their agricultural policies during the period.  However, they learned the evil of their ways in that connection and stopped the nonsense which had been in progress for some five or six years, and they are welcome to whatever credit they give themselves for putting a stop to their lunacy.</P>
    <P>The prosperity and the possible continuance of an industrial arm in this country is dependent more upon the prosperity of the agricultural industry than on anything else, and the policy of the Government should be directed in every possible way towards improving the agricultural industry.  Taking this Vote on account as a case in point, the very few agriculturists that I have come across since the publication of the Book of Estimates have directed my attention to the fact that, notwithstanding the increase in the sum that is estimated to be spent this year as compared with the sum that was estimated to be spent this time 12 months, the estimate for agriculture is down by £279,000.  If that had been at the same level as it was last year, this Book of Estimates would record on its face £500,000 more money than was on the Book of Estimates last year.  It is quite true that there was a marked increase in the number of persons contributing to unemployment insurance during the years that were taken by Deputy Mulcahy from 1932 to 1938 as compared with 1927 to 1932.  It is quite true that there would be a difference of something like £4,500 a year, so that a section of employment in the country is greater than it was.  The annual increase was greater than it was during the years preceding the change of Government.  Then the question arises, at what cost; whether it is likely to be continued; how far we can be sure that its continuance is in accordance with a sound economic policy throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If, owing to the extension of our industrial secondary arm, we throw out of employment or out of business people who are engaged upon the land, one has to make up the advantages that are derived, on the one hand, from the industrial <Col N="436" /> secondary policy and, on the other hand, the disadvantages to the agricultural policy.  It does not require any very close examination of the general trend of agricultural prices to come to a definite conclusion that there is not much money in agriculture in any country.  The most successful agricultural countries are the countries of Northern Europe.  We have Denmark as an example, Norway, I suppose Sweden to a certain extent, and Finland. We had before us a short time ago measures dealing with pigs, bacon, etc; but the Minister will find that we have scarcely ever exceeded the sum of £5,000,000 per year for our export of pigs and bacon to the British market, whereas the lowest figure for Denmark in recent years has been about £20,000,000.  There is evidence there of an agricultural country, and an industrial country also, making money out of its export of pigs and bacon to the British market, selling them in competition with others, in that country, while the balance of trade between Great Britain and Denmark bears no comparison whatever with the favourable position that we occupy in that connection.  In my view it would be far better if the trend of the economic expansion of this country had been directed towards agriculture with as much zest, industry and persistence as has distinguished the Government's effort in connection with the industrial expansion.  The only objection that agriculturists or other people in the country have to the extension of the secondary industrial arm is whether the cost is beyond the capacity of the people to bear; whether the results are commensurate with what it has cost the people; and whether these costs have any reaction upon our agricultural production and economy which outweighs the advantages which have been derived from the industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>A question arises at once in connection with our population figures.  It must be remarked that while there was a greater emigration figure for the years 1923, 1924 and 1925 than for the last few years, nevertheless there was this remarkable distinction between the two, that there was not only a gradual but a remarkable drop in <Col N="437" /> emigration in the years from 1923 down to 1931.  In 1932 it had stopped altogether, whereas lately it would appear that we are getting back to the emigration problem again.  If that be the measure of our success within the last few years, then one can only say that the Government's economic and financial policy has been a gigantic failure.</P>
    <P>The second test that I would apply is the fact that we have now reached a point where there is no expansion whatever in the number of persons recorded in the National Health Insurance. We come to a dead stop.  We are there at a point; for a great number of years we had added to it each year but now there is a dead stop. There may be an explanation of that. It may be that the disrupting circumstances prevalent in Europe may have some effect.  There may be another&mdash; that even the figures of the last six or eight years were swollen by reason of the capital costs of starting quite a number of industries throughout the country and that once those capital sums had been spent we had reached a point where employment must be on the down-grade.  Obviously there has been quite a sufficient list of facts presented by Deputy Mulcahy this evening to warrant the closest attention and scrutiny of the Minister.  It is true that we have this satisfaction in connection with the Book of Estimates presented to-day and for the last few years, that the increase in the previous years had been much more marked. We have also satisfaction in noting that while the Government itself causes year after year increases in its demands upon the public for money, nevertheless it keeps its eye upon the smaller local authorities throughout the country; that it takes them to task and notifies them that they must reduce expenditure.  When one compares the Book of Estimates for 1931-32 and for 1932-33 with the Book of Estimates to-day there will be found to be an expansion of 50 per cent., whereas if one looks up the corresponding increase in local taxation it will be found that the figure has gone up from £5,000,000 to only <Col N="438" /> £6,800,000, an increase of £1,800,000 on £5,000,000.  The local authorities could send back a memorandum to the Minister saying: &ldquo;We realise the necessity and the responsibility upon us of economy and the essential reason for reducing our expenditure but, at any rate, we are not as bad as you are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy disclosed in the course of his observations all the money that has been spent which has been collected in taxation over and above what had been collected in the years 1927-1932. But he omitted just one item and that was that there were other moneys than those which had to be collected in taxation.  We have undertaken a liability in respect of housing and I suppose other matters.  But the Minister and himself are at loggerheads over one particular item.  The Minister holds that the Budgets have been balanced in the last few years.  I hold that in the last four years there has been balanced only one Budget.  We have, by reason of bad finance, added £1,500,000 to the dead-weight debt of the country.  It is past history now as to whether the Budgets are or not balanced.  The question is what is to be the policy of the future?  The Government policy has failed according to the two tests and two very fair tests which have been mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy (1) the decrease in our population, and (2) we have not been able to add any people to the list of those who are registered each year under the National Health Insurance. But when we take that figure of National Health Insurance we must bear in mind that the man who earns three or three and a half days' pay in the week is being qualified for a week by reason of these three or three and a half days and that it is not fair to compare that man with the man who gets six days' work in the week.</P>
    <P>We are entering no objections whatever to certain new services that have been provided such as the unemployment assistance and the money for the relief of unemployment.  The objection that I would urge in connection with the housing problem that has been undertaken is that it is bad financially <Col N="439" /> and bad economically to add to the dead-weight debt of this country because of that housing programme.  If you want to carry out social services, carry them out by all means, but carry them out by paying for them and not by borrowing for them.  We are committing a very serious error in this country if we compare our social services with those of other countries.  The social services themselves could be divided into two classes&mdash;the class of social services that one would normally expect in a sound country and the one that is bad financially.  Those social services should include hospital accommodation, the care of the infirm, looking after widows and orphans, and persons entitled to the old age pensions. But when you go further and provide money for unemployment and claim credit and generosity for that, you are indicting your own country for your own inability to provide economic employment for those people.  The higher those figures, come to and the greater the charge they impose on your public, the greater they reflect on your charity financially and the greater they reflect on your capacity and business efficiency.</P>
    <P>Now looking over these large increases in the Estimates for public expenditure one is naturally struck by the fact that while social services are generally charged as the reason for the great increase in the cost of running the country, nevertheless the social services do not account for more than half the extra cost in the Book of Estimates.  We have got to this position where we have interfered so much with business one way or another that the increased cost of government exceeds by approximately £500,000 the money spent on social services.  We are in this position that we are now the most costly run country in Europe and for our size the country that has to provide most for social services.  The present economy of our country is unable to get our people any gainful occupation.  If we mean to make any effort towards increasing the prosperity of our country we have to direct our attention to finding out in what way that is best accomplished.  In my view&mdash;<Col N="440" /> I have explained it year after year, before and while this Government has been in office&mdash;the only exports that are worthy of our maximum efforts are agricultural exports.  I have explained that we will not get the agriculturists to go in for expansion in exports unless they are doing business that pays them and unless the Government contributes to the lessening of their costs.  The Government can help them by reducing their overhead costs. To cut down expenditure was the promise of the Government.  They said before they got into office that they were capable of reducing the cost of government here by £2,000,000 a year. The man would be a poor financier and a poor administrator who could not take £4,000,000 off that list which has been increasing year after year.  If the Minister would bend his attention towards that he would do more towards retrieving prosperity in this country than he could achieve by any other steps that could be taken.  The present position while it has many warnings is perhaps not just dangerous at the moment.  It may become dangerous. The point is now that because of the increase in the cost of living, raw materials and so on, there has been an interruption in employment.</P>
    <P>When the war ends, if it ever ends, there is bound to be a slump in those prices and it is unlikely that, just at that time, when there is a slump, we are going to have great industrial expansion.  It is all the more necessary to save all we can and to make an effort to reduce the costs of this country, to expend special moneys only where there is going to be a real result and to keep them from being thrown into bogs&mdash;to invest these moneys in good, sound land schemes and, above all things, to reduce the bill of costs with which we are blistering the people at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has made a very interesting speech and has given a good deal of thought to the subject.  At the same time, to say that the figures relating to National Health Insurance and the figures regarding population are a clear indication of further collapse in our economic position <Col N="441" /> is to say what would hardly stand examination.  It could be shown clearly that there is no decrease in the birth rate, that there is actually an increase. The same thing would apply to emigration. To my mind, the real indication of the difficulties we have to face is furnished by the increase in unemployment. The increase in unemployment is, I believe, directly connected with the unfortunate slump which occurred in agriculture.  Unemployment quickly followed that.  That took place some time after the war.  It is quite possible that it would have taken place before the war but for certain other factors. Be that as it may, if that depression could be removed here, it would solve all our problems.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there is a commodity produced here which we could not buy more cheaply elsewhere.  That was the way ten or 12 years ago and it is the same still.  We may examine the position of Denmark and deal with its exports to the British market but I prefer to examine the position of the Danish farmer.  How much are they involved?  Are they more involved than the farmers of this country? What are their debts?  It is quite easy to quote total figures and say that all is well with the farmers there but the farmers could have sold all their stock and the result might be a large figure which would by no means be advantageous to them.  The real question is: What is the position of the individual farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position of the farmers in Great Britain?  Take, for example, meat.  What would be the price of our cattle if Great Britain was not paying a bounty of 5/- or 7/6?  Could we continue to sell butter at 9d. on the British market?  As to eggs, mentioned by Deputy McGovern, we are getting the second highest price on the British market.  Evidently, it is not a good price but still it is the second best. These are some of the things we have to consider.  Suppose we had to compete with others in the British market how much would we have to lower the cost of production to farmers?  Would complete de-rating affect the matter? If we removed all the annuities and <Col N="442" /> other charges on the farmers, would they still be able to sell butter at 9d. and beef at 7½d?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this Vote prevents it.  Deputy Belton spoke about the building of houses and said that no money could be got for this purpose. I am sure money could be got for building houses but the point is: Will you get tenants who will be able to pay the rent?  There may be some item in the costings attention to which would allow these houses to be let at an economic rent.  I take it that the difficulty is that that has not been possible.  However, there may be a way of doing it and labour costs might not constitute all the difficulty.  What Deputy Belton said is no indication that credit is lacking. There is a difficulty about agricultural credit.  The difficulty is in being able to dispose of agricultural produce at remunerative prices.  It may be a little bit worse than it was. Beef is rationed in Great Britain. What effect that will have, I cannot tell.  If the war lasts, the whole situation may be much more difficult than it is to-day.  People may reduce the consumption of meat and turn to something else.  One thing this Government can be satisfied with is that, if this war produces the results that quite a number of people say it will produce, and if it happens that the ships cannot operate, we took every step to produce all we possibly could here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can pride ourselves on this much, anyhow, that the bulk of the farmers <Col N="443" /> have had an opportunity of learning something about the growing of wheat. It was a forgotten art when we took over.  It had almost disappeared, and if this war had taken place before we took over, what would be the position? We were then importing almost everything we wanted.  We were importing lamb, beef and other things, but by the policy we pursued, we assured the people that at least they cannot die of starvation.  The bulk of the commodities the people need can be produced here.</P>

If the Party opposite had been allowed to continue their policy to this day, I wonder what would be the position of the country in the matter of food, or even in the matter of shelter?

      <P>The silence on the Government Benches has at last been broken and by a Deputy who is talking through his hat.  If he were honest with himself and with the House, he would realise that the situation we have in the country to-day has been brought about by sheer hypocrisy and high falutin nonsense for the last eight or ten years.  Millions of pounds of the people's money were squandered, not alone on unnecessary officials and increased salaries, but on bog holes.  The people to-day realise where they stand and they also realise that Fianna Fáil has let them down. We have this Vote put before us to-day in the usual nice fashion, and we see that agriculture is left in the same starved condition, while salaries, buildings and so on must get their full amount of taxation to keep them going. The country realises now that the Fianna Fáil policy has failed, and the Government also realise it.  It is their duty to change that policy and to devise a policy which will meet the national emergency which exists to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to meet a war situation at present which will bring many more problems than we have at the moment. In a war situation, what the people want is production from the land and to-day the people on the land are neglected by a so-called Irish Government that fiddles here and there with all sorts of schemes, but will not face the fact that the salvation of this country depends on the production from the soil.  Give agriculture a chance and you will not have any trouble with the unemployment problem.  The land will absorb all our idle men, if only given a chance.  We have had too many experiments and the time has come for the Government to put a stop to them.  We have had bog experiments, and others, but <Col N="445" /> if there is money to spare, the place to put it is in the pockets of the agriculturists and let the unemployment problem be solved by the private enterprise of our people.  Huge amounts of money are being wasted all over the country in taking out turns and widening roads.  We have too many officials and red tape of all sorts in connection with the few people who are doing this work.  The money should be left in the pockets of the farmers so that they may employ those who are unemployed, and so that the turns may be taken out by private enterprise; but, of course, that would be bad policy, because it would not afford an opportunity for the giving of employment to all the hacks and political &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; who have to get employment on those schemes.</P>
    <P>This country is cursed in that it has thousands and thousands of officials doing jobs which they do not know how to do, but who are drawing big salaries week after week for the sole purpose of bolstering up Fianna Fáil régime.  It is time that Fianna Fáil realised that they have been a blister on the people for the past ten years. We hear a great deal about neutrality, and we boast of our neutrality.  Yes, we are proud that we have neutrality, but we must realise that our neutrality will cost us a huge amount of money and worry.  Whether or not we have neutrality, we have this one fact, that there are between 120,000 and 130,000 idle young men in the country who cannot get a day's work and who have to live as State paupers.  We, of the old régime, who brought freedom to this country, did not fight to bring the country to the position it is in to-day. We meant to see every man earning his living in his own way, and we did not mean to see a horde of State paupers cringing, crawling and begging for a living.  No, we would rather have died than have lived to see such a time.  We have this patriotic Irish Government who will not face facts, but who twist and turn like eels.  They will not face the national position, the economic position or any other position.  The whole thing is governed by: &ldquo;Hold your seat while you can and let who likes clear up the mess&rdquo;; but, thanks be <Col N="446" /> to God, there are men in this country, valiant, strong and noble, who are not afraid or ashamed to say that they will step into the breach and save the country from the downward trend it is taking to-day.  Yes, Ireland can always throw up sons, and she will throw them up again, who will take over the reins of the Government in the country and give peace and prosperity to a long suffering people.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly was the only backbencher of Fianna Fáil who stood up to defend the policy of this great national Government.  He spoke for five or ten minutes and said absolutely nothing.  He told us about Denmark and he told us nothing about Denmark. He started off to say something and wound up by saying nothing.  He knows that in the county he comes from there is destitution in every farmer's home and poverty in every workman's home.  He knows that he has been silent for the past seven or eight years, while destruction of all kinds went on in that county.  He saw land torn up and given out in uneconomic patches to men who never intended to work it, and for the majority of whom he signed letters in order that they might get that land. I say that it is his duty boldly to face the facts to-day.  It is he and Deputies like him who have brought the country to its present position by their cowardice in sitting behind the Government and allowing his own county to be destroyed by bringing men from God knows where at huge cost to take land from the sons of the real farmers.  Yes, he will defend his policy here, but he will also defend the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party on the platform in his own Royal County of Meath.  It is a disgrace to see that county, the only county in Ireland that could save this country to-day from destruction, being used in the way in which it is being used and where the best land in Europe is being divided up amongst a lot of wastrels who would never work it.  You have ditches and fences raised and a lot of that land has gone back again to the old 11 months' system.</P>
    <P>I say to Deputy O'Reilly that there <Col N="447" /> is a wastage of hundreds of thousands of pounds, but he is silent.  It is good policy to be silent&mdash;there may be votes in it&mdash;but I say that the curse of an angry people will follow those who see what is going on around them in the country at the moment and who remain silent in face of it.  The country is in a sad and sorry plight because we have men in power who are hypocrites. They came into office in 1932 and they said, from every platform and on every poster throughout the country: &ldquo;Give us power and we will give work to everybody; we will set the wheels of industry turning and every man will have a living.&rdquo;  What have you to-day? Has every man got a living here?  No, but you have half of the people scrounging on the other half, and the farmers carrying a huge amount of taxation in order to bolster up unemployment and carry idle men on their backs.  I say that they are unable to do so and that it is unjust and unfair of any Government to ask them to do so.</P>
    <P>We have plenty of young men looking for work who cannot get it.  Why? It is because the money is gone.  What we want is a bold and national front and not to approach the problem in the &ldquo;slingeing&rdquo; and cowardly way of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Oh, leave it to us and we will solve the problem of Partition and the problem of unemployment, and we will tackle John Bull, as you said you had done.  You certainly have throttled and strangled agriculture here and filled your own pockets with money to which you were never entitled.  There is not a half-a-dozen of you on those benches opposite who are honest men.  The country has found you out.  It has found out that you were deceivers.  You go around to your secret meetings and clubs but you will not go around and see where we will get more employment on the land, the land of Ireland that is quite capable of holding far more people than are on it to-day.  Why do you not make a bold attempt to put money into some method of keeping men from the street corners, the dole and the labour exchanges, and getting them back on the land to till and drain the farmer's <Col N="448" /> land?  If we have to get money to relieve unemployment, then let it be given through the farmers and not through the thousands of officials who are paid to keep these exchanges going. Private enterprise has been killed in this country, and the only thing to do is to give private enterprise the place that it should have in this nation because any man who is working in a private capacity is a man who knows what he is doing.  He is working in his own interests in the first place and he is not going to squander his own or other people's money.</P>
    <P>Wipe out all the different schemes that you have been going on with, and all that type of nonsense, and give any millions that you have to spare back to the land from which you took it. Let the farmer look after his own work. He does not want any officials or anything else.  He will work his land if it is a paying proposition and he wants no officials, but he cannot make his land pay at the moment because you have strangled agriculture.  The farmer has not the wherewithal to stock his land or to work it.  He has to beg and scrounge from his neighbour to pay his rent and rates, and he is the whole year round borrowing from his neighbours.  Is that the freedom that we fought for?  If it is, perhaps we should not have fought for it.  We would not have fought for it, I think, if we thought that a lot of hypocrites would seize the reins of power.  Away with you, you lot of hypocrites, because you are nothing more.  There you sit on those benches with your long, silent faces, but we will fight tooth and nail until you face the facts.  You draw your salaries&mdash;and a good many of you never saw a salary in your lives before&mdash;not for the purpose of fattening and battening at the State's expense, but to do right for this country, and that is to see that every man should be working for his own rights and in his own way.  Do away with your horde of officials that have agriculture strangled at the moment.  Do away with all these weed inspectors, tillage inspectors and so on.  We want none of them.  If a national endeavour is needed and you call on the agriculturist and tell him what to do and give <Col N="449" /> him the wherewithal with which to do it, he will do whatever is needed without compulsion.  It is compulsion that has been the death of this country.  You have used compulsion for the last eight years and it has strangled agriculture. There is not an agriculturist in the country who is not honourable and patriotic, and he will do his duty without any officials.  Do not drive him, and he will give a good return, and the only return that will be of any real benefit to this country will come from the farmer on the land. You are building up big cities and towns, with sewerage schemes, waterworks, lighting schemes, and all the rest of it.  That is what is destroying our nation.  I would rather see our cities and towns lit with the old candle or lamp than to see the tens of thousands you are spending in drawing our people from agriculture.  You are not lighting the homes of the farmers.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  The farmer has got to pay for all those things, and that is why you have the flight from the land, and you will have it so long as you pamper your big towns and cities.  Give back to agriculture that which you have taken from it.  Give agriculture its rightful place in the Irish nation, which is the first place. No other industry is entitled to it, but you have given it the second place and started your monopolies and so-called industrial development.  I say that our so-called industrial revival is held in the grip of foreigners, and Englishmen, and people from Czecho-Slovakia and other places, but the poor old Irishman must take second place for this so-called Irish industrialisation.  We want Irish industry to spring from Irish enterprise, and I certainly do not want to see one penny of foreign money coming into it.  We had what Deputy Dillon told us about the flour industry and all those things.  The Government Party is deliberately throttling Irish industry by allowing foreigners to come in and strangle us.  I say to the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party now, in 1940, to do their duty honestly, that <Col N="450" /> is, to stand up and say to the Government: &ldquo;If you nine men on the Front Bench do not do what the country wants, we will not stay behind you.&rdquo; They have not done that so far; they have been sitting in silence behind the Government, and that is the cause of the country's downfall.</P>
      <P>It must be realised that those nine men on the Government Front Bench do not know the first thing about agriculture; they are men with the usual city minds and mentality, accustomed to going around the usual social society circles.  They will not go down and look around the countryside, either on Sundays or week-days.  They go at 80 miles a hour in a high-powered car, when they have to go; and they will not look to right or left and will not see the impoverished farmers and the tumble-down homes, and the land devoid of cattle or stock of any sort. Ah, no; they stay in the social circles in Dublin; and why not, while there are sheep on the back benches to allow them to stay there.  All that should be changed, they should get up, they should close this House and take a month's circuit of the country and see the destruction which has been wrought during the last ten years.  If they do that, then there will be no need for the country to tell them to get out, because they will be honest, and they will walk out.</P>

      <P>First of all, I wish to appeal to the Minister&mdash;if he has anything to do with it, and on this Vote he has&mdash;to endeavour to get the Land Commission to speed up the acquisition and division of land in County Mayo.  They have lands on hand in that county for the last ten years which have not been divided yet.  The reason that has not been done is simple. Lands were acquired in a place called Ballyvary in County Mayo, but all the people in that neighbourhood who would ordinarily get that land were supporters of Fine Gael; so not one perch of it has been divided.  The Land Commission has given the excuse that they intended to take over other lands and have a comprehensive scheme.  The farm I refer to was taken over nine years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>Five years ago they took another farm near that and that land was divided; but the other one which was taken over nine years ago has not been divided&mdash;it is there still.  That land has been let in grazing by the Land Commission since, and the net loss the Land Commission had by running it on their own responsibility for the last nine years has been £560.  This is the way the money of this country has been expended.  I intend to vote against this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is only one case in Mayo.  I know, of course, that I will not be allowed to go into details and to give particulars about various areas, but I would like to appeal to the Minister also to divide the 5,000 acres of land which the Land Commission stated here about a month ago they have on hands in the County Mayo.  I would appeal to him to see that, if the Land Commission does not divide that land, they cultivate 12½ per cent. of it, as any farmer would cultivate it.  I also want to appeal to the Minister to see that, when the Land Commission takes over land and acquires it, they pay for it just as anybody else would.  I know of a farm taken over in County Mayo, over seven years ago, the owners of which have not got anything from the Land Commission for it yet.  I know several such cases.  In one certain case in the parish of Crossboyne, there were about 3,000 acres of land and the Land Commission have been asked to take that over for the past ten years, but they have not taken them over.  Also in the same parish there is a poor unfortunate woman with only six acres of land. They took over those six acres and put her practically out in the street.  The price that that woman was to get for the land was £185&mdash;it was put up and sold by public auction for £185.  The Land Commission stepped in, an inspector came the next day and served a resumption order.  That was two years ago.  They prevented the sale of that land; they took it over from that woman two years ago, but nothing has been done there since.  She has not got a penny of the £185 which she was supposed <Col N="452" /> to get if they gave her the auction price.  That poor woman has been drawing home assistance for the past year.  That is the conduct of the Land Commission, and it is conduct of that kind that puts the Government in the position it is in to-day.</P>
    <P>We all remember that, some years ago, we had a great deal of difficulty ourselves, when our own Party was in power, with certain Departments, and I think Fianna Fáil will find themselves in the self-same position if they do not keep an eye on those Departments and make them do their duty, for which they are being paid.</P>
    <P>There is a townland in the parish of Aughamore with about five or six holdings of untenanted land which the Land Commission has been requested to take over for the past four or five years, and they have not done so.  I appeal to the Land Commission now, even at this late stage, to go in and try to relieve congestion and take over these lands which have been practically derelict for the past nine or ten years.</P>
    <P>There is also a place called Ranahard near Claremorris where there are ten tenants whose poor law valuation is under £5.  Petitions have been sent in to the Land Commission time and again to give these people economic holdings.  They have said that they will migrate; here, for more than ten years, the Land Commission has absolute power to migrate these people or to give them additions in the locality, but they have not done so.  They have all the powers they want.  They should remember that, under the old Congested Districts Board we had the late Sir Henry Doran, who had charge of it.  We all know what he did when he was in charge.  If that Board had been allowed to continue, the whole Gaeltacht area would have been fixed up by now and the land question would have been fixed and settled to-day.  It appears to me that the Land Commission is out for one purpose only, that is, to continue the well-paid officials in their jobs.  If we send up complaints about certain districts, or an application to acquire land, we have an inspector coming down, coming out in his car, in about a week or ten days; then we hear no more for about six <Col N="453" /> months; then another inspector comes, though nothing has been done.  That is what I would appeal to the Minister to look after.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, there are very many complaints about it round the country, that is, when the free grants are given for housing.  A number of complaints have come to me that persons who build a house and put in a claim cannot get the money, even the first instalment, or the second instalment, for a considerable time.  In the past I have not had very much trouble with the Department, as a general rule.  Whenever I sent in a report to the Minister for Local Government or to the Housing Department, they gave it attention.  Recently, however, there has been great difficulty in getting payment, when the work is done for which a certificate has been issued.</P>
    <P>I would like to learn also from the Minister, before this vote is taken. exactly how much of the last £7,000,000 loan was subscribed, and what has been done with that money since it was subscribed around November.  I am sure the Minister would be able to tell exactly what he has done with it, and exactly how much of it was subscribed. The great difficulty we have down the country at the present time is that people are under the impression that the Fianna Fáil Government is in practically a bankrupt condition.  I do not say that, nor do I think that they are.  There is one thing we have to admit: the taxation which the present Government have put on the people cannot be borne by the people.  I cannot see that the Government is running the country any better than the Government before them.  Yet they have increased taxation by about £15,000,000 a year since the old Government left in 1932.  The people are economically poorer.  The Government say that they know the conditions before us; that they know the conditions of farmers; yet they are asked to cultivate more land, to break up about 900,000 acres more than they did last year.  If they cannot get as much manure for the land as they got last year, how are they going to do that? <Col N="454" /> There is no possibility that the farmers can do it.  They will not do it. They would like to do it if they got the service which the Government should give them and is paid to give them.  If the Government had looked out in time, there would have been no difficulty in getting the manures and phosphates which they cannot get at present.</P>
    <P>I see also that the cost of the Gárda Síochána is tremendous.  When the previous Government was in office it cost £1,583,000.  Now it is costing £1,888,000&mdash;an increase of £305,000. The conditions in the country are not better than they were seven years ago. The Gárda Síochána may be very efficient, but I do not think they are anything to boast of, if we can judge by the condition of affairs we see around us in the City of Dublin and what we have been reading in the Press.  We know very well that what we read in the Press is probably censored before we read it, and does not exaggerate things.</P>
    <P>Look at the Army pensions.  The Estimate for that is £586,000, an increase of £394,000 since Fianna Fáil got into power.  The Army is only established about 16 or 17 years, and its cost is increased by over £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>There are various other services which I do not want to go into now. All the other services we see here comprise, I think, at least an increase of £15,000,000 since Fianna Fáil came into office.  With the high taxation and with the high cost of living, with the cost of rates all over the country, and with the services which we get from the Government, I am very much afraid that we are very near national bankruptcy, and I think it is the duty of the Government to economise in every direction. There are certain attempts to economise in this, but when the entire State was run for about £11,000,000 in 1915, there is no great economy when three-fourths of the country has to pay in taxation £36,000,000 a year and borrow a lot more.  Every Deputy knows the taxes we have to pay and the price we have to pay for flour.  The Minister told us yesterday that we were paying almost the same as Britain was paying. To-day the price of flour in <Col N="455" /> Britain is 22/6 a sack.  In this country it is 47/6 a sack.  We have to pay twice as much as they pay in England. Just imagine, one of the poorest countries in the world has to pay double the price for the flour they use than England has to pay, which is the wealthiest country on the face of the earth, or was the wealthiest country&mdash; I do not know how she stands to-day.</P>
    <P>Take sugar.  When Fianna Fáil came into power 2½ per lb. was the price of sugar.  It has now gone up to 5d. per lb.  There is an increase in the price of tobacco, but notwithstanding the increase you have put on tobacco and the increase on whiskey and stout, you are getting less revenue from them to-day than you were getting six months ago, before you put on the increase at all.  Look at the cost of maize.  That is all due to the inefficiency of the Government.  They did not look out in time.  They could have got cargoes of maize from whatever countries it comes from, from Liverpool for that matter, if they wanted to and had looked out in time.</P>
    <P>At the present moment about 145,000 people are unemployed in the country. Fianna Fáil when they came in had a plan to absorb all the unemployed and put them to work and give them good jobs.  I am afraid that plan did not work.  I suppose they put their plan over until the next election.  They will have another plan then to induce or misguide the voter into putting them into power again, but I am afraid the eight years of office of Fianna Fáil will mean that they will never be able to get back again.  In fact, people down the country would simply say that the front bench is nothing but a plunderbund, out to plunder the people of this country, and they have plundered the people of this country ever since they came into power.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O'Reilly a while ago, and I was moved to make a comparison between Deputy O'Reilly's pessimism to-night and Deputy O'Reilly's optimism in 1932 or 1933, when he and I addressed the same audience in County Galway.  Apparently, to-night, <Col N="456" /> from Deputy O'Reilly's point of view, there is no hope for this country.  There does not seem to be any.  He says that we cannot do anything about cattle, about butter, eggs or pigs.  What do we want to do?  I remember when he promised the people of Newbridge an El Dorado if they returned Fianna Fáil. Do you know how that was to come about?&mdash;by abandoning the British market altogether and by concentrating on the home market.  That was the El Dorado Fianna Fáil were going to bring us in 1932.  To-night, of course, we have changed from all that.  The Deputy told us to-night that, as a matter of fact, only that Fianna Fáil was in office this country would probably starve during the present war, that the art of wheat growing had been lost when Fianna Fáil came into power.  I did not know there was an art in wheat growing because, as a matter of fact, I always grew wheat and I did not think there was any art in it; but Deputy O'Reilly is evidently not a wheat grower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell you that there is an art in growing wheat economically in this country.  We have not been able to do that yet.  That is all that was in question at any time.  I always grew wheat and I am still growing wheat.  I did not grow it for sale. I grew it for my own farm and for use in the house and I think it was good. I always advocated wheat growing and advocated it here.  Deputy O'Reilly thinks that only that Fianna Fáil was in to reorganise or make some attempt at reorganising the resources of this country and, apparently, reviving the lost art of growing wheat, we would all die of hunger.  Is not that mere rubbish at this time of day?  Is Deputy O'Reilly, as a representative of the farming community, satisfied that this Vote on Account as presented here to the House represents any kind of advanced programme under the present circumstances?  Is there anything in that to cope with the present situation? Is it not just simply a repetition of what we have had, of the old expenditure? <Col N="457" /> That is all it is.  We have nothing new in it except to make accommodation for a Minister for Supplies and a new Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. For the defence of what?  If Deputy O'Reilly is satisfied with that in the <Col N="458" /> interests of farming then he is easily satisfied.</P>
