      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware of the delay and difficulty experienced at Belfast by County Donegal migratory labourers and others crossing to England and Scotland, who despite the fact that they are in possession of travel permits endorsed for travel via the Six Counties, are generally delayed there for days before being permitted by the authorities to proceed, and in some cases are forced to return and embark from a port in the Twenty-Six Counties; also, whether, in view of the fact that holders of travel permits sailing from ports in the Twenty-Six Counties are admitted without delay by the authorities in Great Britain, arrangements could not be made to ensure that similar consideration will be shown to our citizens sailing from Belfast by the authorities at that port.</P>

      <P>The British regulation at present in force requires all persons leaving ports in Great Britain for Ireland and ports in the Six Counties for Great Britain to have a travel document, i.e., either a passport or travel permit, which must bear an exit permit stamp.  Persons holding a travel permit or passport from the Irish Government when travelling from Six County ports are not exempt from the rule requiring the affixing of the British exit permit stamp.  I know that hardships and inconvenience have been caused in a number of cases and <Col N="148" /> discussions have been taking place with the British Government with a view to removing the present difficulties. I am hopeful that these discussions will have a successful issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, in view of the prevalence of rheumatism in many parts of the country, he is prepared to arrange with the local authorities for the establishment of itinerant clinics for the treatment of rheumatism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Francis Constantine (Dr.) Ward">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of how far special provision for the treatment of rheumatism is required is being considered, but in view of the present stage of development of the public health services in regard to dealing with more prevalent diseases and physical defects, it is not practicable to provide itinerant clinics for the purpose mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this matter will the Parliamentary Secretary bear in mind the enormous <Col N="149" /> number of work days lost through what has become a national disease&mdash; rheumatism&mdash;and will he expedite the consideration of measures calculated to reduce the incidence of that disease so as to avoid the heavy loss of work days in consequence of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that measures are already in operation that are calculated to reduce the incidence of the disease.  Improved housing conditions, improved sanitary conditions, our school medical service scheme, medical inspection, dental treatment, and the treatment of tonsils and adenoids&mdash;I feel sure that it will be admitted that all these steps combined are a very serious contribution towards a solution of the problem the Deputy has in mind.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Malnutrition.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, in view of the evidence of malnutrition in many parts of the country revealed from time to time in the reports of the county medical officers of health, and the absence of any reliable statistical data in regard to the prevalence and incidence of malnutrition in this country, he will set up a commission of inquiry to ascertain the facts in relation to malnutrition, including the minimum quantity of food required to ensure adequate nutrition, and, if so, when it is proposed to set up such a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigations so far made in regard to the dietary of the people would not enable any definite conclusions to be drawn as to the state of nutrition.  There is, however, no reason to believe that malnutrition exists to any great extent among the rural population.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that with the spread of knowledge as regards food values, mainly through the school medical service and other welfare schemes, and as a result of instruction in gardening and cookery which is being made available through the vocational education schools, an improvement in dietary will be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> Reports from county medical officers of health tend to show that where school medical services and free milk and school meals schemes have been put into operation, the results can be seen in a short time in improved physical and nutritional condition of children.</P>
    <P>The problem of malnutrition is not of such extent as to warrant investigation by a special commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that reports which I have read from 22 county medical officers of health indicate that there is prevalent in the country an alarming degree of malnutrition, and that fact is commented upon by most of the 22 county medical officers of health in their annual reports?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that it is not possible to obtain in this country any statistical data to indicate what minimum quantity of food is required to maintain in reasonable health a man, his wife and any defined number of children, although that statistical information can be obtained in respect to other countries?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider appointing some commission or committee in conjunction with the medical profession to ascertain, for the information of public representatives and the nation generally, what minimum standard of food is required to maintain the bodily health of an average Irish family?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion to be drawn from reports submitted to the Department by ten medical officers of health, who function in areas predominantly rural, is that whilst there is no reason to believe that malnutrition exists to any great extent amongst the rural population, the general dietary calls for variety.  There is not enough cream, vegetables, wholemeal, wheaten flour and fruit being consumed. The consumption of milk is low.  From the information available in my Department, it appears that what is popularly looked upon as malnutrition is more often due to faulty metabolism rather than the absence of <Col N="151" /> nutritious food.  The Department have kept themselves fully acquainted with the work and investigations carried out under the auspices of the health organisations of the League of Nations.  One of the medical inspectors in my Department was in fact assigned the task of making a preliminary investigation and report on the matter.  I do not think that at the moment at any rate anything more effective can be done than we have done in relation to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary reply to the last portion of the supplementary question, namely, can we get an inquiry to ascertain what minimum standard of food is required to maintain in bodily health an average Irish family?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention was directed to the statement of the County Dublin coroner, as reported in the newspapers on the 24th February, concerning the inadequacy of the arrangements for the immediate treatment of patients in Dublin hospitals; whether it was brought to his notice that the coroner, when inquiring into the death of a seven months' old child, expressed the view that if a house surgeon had at his disposal a central bureau which he could ring up and ask whether there was a vacancy for a patient, there would be little delay, and also stated <Col N="152" /> that the delay in this case could have been an influence in causing the child's death; and whether in these circumstances he will state what action he proposes taking in the immediate future to organise a bed bureau system in connection with the Dublin hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with regret the published report of the circumstances connected with the child's death.  I have received no other information bearing on the case and I have no comment to make on any implications which the Deputy may desire to draw from the published report.  The possibility of setting up a hospitals' bureau in Dublin to facilitate the admission of patients to hospitals has been under investigation, and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement thereon at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that several firms which in previous years imported superphosphate from Belgium endeavoured during the past few months to obtain supplies from that country, but were unable to do so owing to the fact that the Belgian Government has refused to grant export licences.  I understand that these firms have again approached Belgian manufacturers, presumably in anticipation of the removal of the import restrictions (duty and quota) which only becomes effective to-day. Pending the outcome of these further approaches, it is not possible to indicate the steps, if any, which it may be found possible or desirable to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, has he approached the Belgian Minister in Dublin with a view to facilitating the release of supplies from a country with which we dealt <Col N="153" /> largely in this commodity for years? Surely the Belgian Government is not going to close down on us completely in view of our past trade with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the Belgian Government has prohibited the export of superphosphates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister approached his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, and asked him to make vigorous diplomatic representations to the Belgian Government to get licences for the export of quantities of superphosphates to this country, the general prohibition notwithstanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a shortage of superphosphates in the country, a definite shortage compared even with the amounts required last year?  If tillage is to be doubled in this country, how does the Minister think we are going to manure the increased tillage this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Will the Minister now ask his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, to take up this matter with the Belgian Government at once, requesting that Government to make a way, despite their general prohibition, in favour of this country, as the British Government have done in respect of many commodities for the benefit of this country, in view of our protracted trading relations with Belgium? Surely what the British Government have been prepared to do for this country the Belgian Government ought to be prepared to do for it, especially in view of the trade which the Minister has been responsible for putting in the way of the Belgian State during the last seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy does not think his idea is original.  The fact is that the Belgian Government has refused licences, and has persisted in refusing licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Have representations been made to the Belgian Government that the British Government, although they had made a general prohibition in regard to certain commodities, made a special concession in regard to this country in view of past trading relations, and that the Belgian Government should at least do that much? Have any such representations been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

These portions of the gratuity have not yet been paid, but arrangements for payment are now nearing completion and it is hoped to make the disbursements at an early date.  It is not correct to say that these amounts were due on the 31st December.  Actually no particular date is specified for payment.  The relevant regulations provide for payment at the first overnight camp or special parade held subsequent to the termination of the training year.

      <P>The purpose of the motion is not to ventilate the circumstances surrounding this.  That is not our purpose.  We understood the Government took the view that it was an undesirable course to canvass this matter widely and indiscriminately across the floor of the House.  With that view we had a certain sympathy, and so we have put down a specific request that the whole of this matter should be removed from the arena of casual debate and referred to a committee. That is a simple net proposal. It is not our intention to make this debate an occasion for ventilating the whole situation or for a long acrimonious debate.  We simply want to put the case for the necessity of an inquiry into the whole matter with a view to allaying any undesirable misapprehensions that may be abroad.  Surely it is an extraordinary course on the part of the Government, not only to resist the <Col N="165" /> motion, but to refuse to discuss it.  We are trying to be reasonable in accordance with Parliamentary practice, and the Government ought to be the same. Will the Tánaiste take the matter into consideration again?</P>

      <P>I do not think so.

It must be remembered also that a number of courts martial are to be held in connection with the Magazine business.  I do not know whether they are actually taking place, but if not, they will be held in the immediate future.  It would not be a proper time, therefore, to have a discussion on this matter.</P>

It was pointed out to me that the only way in which the matter could be adequately discussed was by a substantive motion.  Accepting your ruling, I urged the putting down of a motion such as this in the belief that the Government would realise that it is a matter of urgent public importance and that they would facilitate the Opposition, and the other Deputies who are anxious to have the matter dealt with, by granting Government time for a motion of such urgent public importance.</P>

      <P>If the Government are going to claim Private Deputies' time to dispose of the financial business for the remainder of the year, and possibly for part of next session, surely they ought to give the principal Opposition two or three hours of Government time in exchange for all the Private Deputies' time they will be asking for, for a specific matter which the official Opposition consider to be of grave importance.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> The Estimate before the House is for a new Department.  Consequently, though it is a Supplementary or Additional Estimate, I think that an opportunity must be taken of explaining to the House the organisation of the Department, its method of working and the policy by which it is directed. Deputies will have noted from the Estimate that most of the officers of the Department have been transferred to it from other Departments of State and that their salaries are borne on the Votes for the Department from which they were transferred.  That fact emphasises the temporary nature of the Department of Supplies.  The total amount required this year for the Department is £3,819.  The work of the Department of Supplies falls naturally into three main divisions. For convenience they may be described as supplies, distribution of supplies and prices.  I propose to outline the work of the Department, the problems which have arisen and the methods adopted for their solution in their order, taking first supplies, or the problems that have arisen in connection with supplies; secondly, the distribution of the commodities, and thirdly, the problem that has arisen in connection with prices.  Generally speaking, our imports of essential raw materials both for industrial and agricultural purposes have not been interfered with to any great extent by the war.  That is as might have been expected.  There has, of course, been many difficulties arising out of transport delays.  These have so far been found capable of adjustment.</P>
    <P>I will mention in greater detail the difficulties that have arisen in respect of particular commodities, the present situation surrounding the supplies of these commodities and the action taken by my Department to improve that position.  As a preliminary measure towards securing our position and with a view to ensuring that supplies of essential commodities in the country would not be exported to the detriment of the needs of the country, an order was made shortly after the war began prohibiting the export of certain articles except under licences.  Lists of the articles so prohibited from <Col N="169" /> export have been published in the Press from time to time.  Licences in respect of the export of agricultural commodities are granted by the Minister for Agriculture, and licences in respect of all other prohibited articles are issued from the Department of Supplies.  Licences in respect of industrial articles are issued at the rate of about 300 a week.  Under the terms of an open general licence granted by the authorities of the United Kingdom, goods from Ireland are admitted into the United Kingdom free of restrictions. Under our export licence regulations steps are taken to ensure that the favourable position we enjoy as regards our goods going into England is not abused by reason of traders importing foreign goods into Ireland and then re-exporting them to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In our discussions here shortly after the war began considerable anxiety was expressed by some Deputies concerning the possible effect of the war upon the supply of building materials and consequently upon activity in the building industry.  Perhaps those Deputies will be glad to be informed of the present position in respect of such supplies because, of course, the requirements of the building industry in the matter of supplies have been engaging the constant attention of my Department.  A substantial part of the goods used by the building industry is produced within the country from raw materials of which a plentiful supply is available from home sources.  The most important materials upon which that industry is dependent on outside sources of supply are timber, constructional steel, pig iron, pig lead, copper, bitumen and sanitary fittings.  Imports in most cases have been maintained at an adequate level.  While it is, of course, impossible to guarantee a continuance of that position, the fact that the demand for materials has been below normal owing to the curtailment of activities in the industry, has operated to case the position.  As regards timber, an order was made which came into operation on the 1st January prohibiting the importation of certain classes of timber except under licences.  The order relates generally to hardwoods and softwoods for building <Col N="170" /> and constructional purposes but it does not apply to every kind of wood. The order was not made for the purpose of restricting the imports of timber, but to ensure by the elimination of excessive competition amongst importers in the exceptional circumstances which have arisen within the country, and out of war conditions, that the greatest possible economy would be exercised in restricting competition in the purchase of timber and other cargoes from abroad.</P>
    <P>Licences for the import of timber of the kind covered by the order are generally granted only to three importing organisations which have been set up for that purpose.  These are three non-profit making companies which have been incorporated for (1) the Dublin and south eastern area, (2) the southern area and (3) for the western part of the country.  The working of this arrangement has been supervised and careful consideration will be given to any representations that may be made by those claiming that, in practice, the arrangements have operated to the detriment of any substantially representative importing interests. It is proposed to amend the order at an early date to provide for the import of timber in small quantities without licence.  That is to facilitate residents along the border who may require to import small lots of timber for their own use.  Up to the present it has been possible to make supplies of timber available.  No substantial difficulty has been experienced.  In fact, I think it is correct to say that the stocks of timber in the country at present are greater than they were at this time last year. The export of native timber has, of course, been prohibited under the general order and licences are granted only for such classes as cannot profitably be utilised here.</P>
    <P>Supplies of structural steel are reasonably good and importers consider that they will continue to be able to meet requirements in the belief that the demand will be rather below the normal.  Minor difficulties have arisen in regard to particular types of steel and, while the position shows signs of deterioration there are no grounds for serious concern at the <Col N="171" /> moment.  Considerable difficulties both in the matter of supply and price have been experienced in obtaining steel billets for Irish Steel Ltd., at Haulbowline and steel sheets and steel rods.  To some extent, these difficulties are being solved by supplies from Continental sources and from the U.S.A. My Department are taking every possible step that may lead to an improvement of the position.  There was a scarcity of pig lead but action taken by my Department has resulted in current needs being met.  We require about 2,000 tons per annum.  There is no shortage of pig iron at the moment in the country and, so far as can be foreseen, the position in regard to pig iron supplies will continue to be satisfactory for some time.  Special attention is being paid to a particular variety of pig iron required by manufacturers of agricultural machinery.  No serious difficulties have been experienced in obtaining supplies of sanitary fittings or small hardware, such as locks and bolts, and, at this stage, there is no reason to anticipate that the position will worsen to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of the war there has been difficulty in getting adequate supplies of bitumen required for damp courses and the manufacture of roofing materials.  It is possible that the position in that respect will improve in the near future but, in any event, substitutes are likely to be found in tar products.  The main use of bitumen is in the making and repairing of roads. The recent shortage has seriously affected firms manufacturing bitumen emulsion for road work and, to a lesser extent, firms specialising in road making.  The position in regard to actual supplies may improve, but the price at which bitumen is likely to be available will militate against its use on anything like as extensive a scale as formerly.  Other industries affected by the war situation are those concerned with the manufacture of textiles.</P>

      <P>So I understand.  I do not claim to be an expert.  I have said that difficulties have been experienced by firms engaged in the manufacture of textiles, and consequently, by firms concerned with the fabrication of textiles. In the case of wool and woollen yarns, the position is that, following the outbreak of war, steps were taken by the British Government to acquire practically the entire world output of wool and to control all existing stocks of wool and of woollen and worsted yarns in the United Kingdom, with the result that supplies of yarns became increasingly difficult to obtain. The difficulty was most marked in respect of supplies of the lower-quality yarns, the greater proportion of which are required by the hosiery industries. Supplies of the higher qualities were not curtailed to the same extent but were, nevertheless, difficult to secure in sufficient quantities.  A survey of the whole position was undertaken in consultation with representatives of the hosiery and woollen and worsted industries and a comprehensive statement of our probable requirements of raw wool, woollen yarns, wool tops, worsted yarns and wool mixtures was prepared.  The difficulties have, by no means, been overcome and the position is at present receiving the active attention of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somewhat similar difficulties have arisen regarding supplies of yarns for the cotton and linen industries. So far as native wool is concerned, we are producing here approximately 16,000,000 lbs. per year but, in normal years, the quantity of native wool used at home is somewhat less than 3,000,000 lbs., leaving an exportable surplus of between 13,000,000 and 14,000,000 lbs.  The difficulties which I have mentioned in connection with the supplies of woollen and worsted yarns have led to increased use of the home product, and the tendency in that direction is likely to increase. Even, however, with the proposed establishment of a carding plant here, <Col N="173" /> the use of native wool is likely to remain at rather less than half the total quantity produced.  The balance is not suitable for the requirements of the woollen and worsted manufacturers here.  Wool was added to the list of commodities requiring an export licence and regard was had to the requirements of home manufacturers in granting such licences.  Export of the balance of the 1939 clip are being restricted in respect of particular grades by agreement with the Woollen Manufacturers' Association and the Wool Federation.  The question of restriction of export of certain further grades is at present under consideration by both parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Here.  The disposal of our surplus of native wool is bound up in large measure with the supply of woollen and worsted yarns.  Another industry in respect of which it was anticipated that difficulties in respect of supplies of materials would arise was the boot and shoe industry. Although supplies of upper leather are becoming somewhat more difficult to secure, no serious shortage of either upper leather or sole leather has yet manifested itself.  To preserve for home use supplies of suitable native hides, the export of all hides and skins was prohibited and licences are not granted for calf skins and light hides. Circumstantial evidence is available, however, to indicate that that limitation of exports is being evaded and the Federation of Irish Tanners made representations recently that, to ensure effective control of native supplies of hides, a company representative of the tanners and hide merchants should be formed to purchase all available supplies of hides at fixed prices, to allocate the hides according to the needs of the various tanners, and to export <Col N="174" /> any available surplus.  That proposal is at present under examination.  My Department are consulting with the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>One of the matters in respect to which considerable difficulty arose, affecting the boot and shoe industry, concerned the supply of grindery, that is, the steel wire for the small tacks and rivets used by boot manufacturers. Practically all our supplies of grindery for the boot and shoe industry have hitherto been obtained from the British United Shoe Machinery Company, Limited, whose boot-making machinery is mostly used by our factories.  In the early part of February that company notified all its Irish customers that, acting on the instructions of the British Ministry for Supply, they would be precluded forthwith from sending any further supplies of grindery to this country.  The company has arranged with its associate company in the United States of America that supplies of steel wire, without which the boot factories could not carry on, will be sent direct from the United States to this country.  The first supplies under the arrangement have actually arrived and further consignments are afloat. The company is also considering the possibility of having supplies of rivets, nails, etc., consigned from its associate factory in America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any.  Certain difficulties arose concerning the supplies of aluminium for the manufacture of hollow ware, due to the loss of the steamship &ldquo;Rhynanna&rdquo; which carried large supplies for the aluminium company at Nenagh. Steps have been taken to replace the material lost and the present position will be, we hope, bettered in the near future.  Supplies of aluminium sheets for use by transport companies in the manufacture of vehicles are very short and will, we think, continue to be <Col N="175" /> short, but the use of a substitute material is under consideration by those companies.</P>
      <P>Difficulties also arose concerning the supply of secondhand sacks and bags which are used in considerable quantities in this country.  In recent months the position has greatly improved and it is now practically back to normal. The bulk of the new sacks, bags and wrappings used here are made from canvas woven from yarn spun in this country from imported jute.  The increased demands for new goods which arose from the temporary shortage of secondhand sacks and bags, coupled with the fact that replenishments were not possible pending the marketing of the new crop, led to temporary difficulties and the rationing of supplies.  My Department's powers to control exports were used to conserve available supplies for the home market. Supplies of the new crop of jute have been forthcoming fairly regularly and the position at present is reasonably satisfactory.  Jute was recently brought under control by the Government of India, but no difficulties on that score have so far become evident.</P>
      <P>The margarine, soap and confectionery industries obtain their supplies of vegetable oils partly from the Irish Oil and Cake Mills of Drogheda and partly by direct importation.  The Drogheda company has been enabled to obtain its supplies of oil-bearing seeds and nuts and crude oil.  The soap and margarine industries, prior to the war, obtained their supplies by direct importation.  Arrangements have been made under which monthly allocations of the oils are made to those two industries.  In order to ensure that there would be equitable distribution amongst the various industries of the oils produced at Drogheda a committee, which meets frequently, was set up, consisting of representatives of the industries affected as well as representatives of the Drogheda firm.  Generally speaking, it can be said that the supply position is reasonably satisfactory and there is no reason, so far as can be seen at present, to anticipate any grave difficulty arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> There has been no shortage of paper since the outbreak of the war and it is the considered view of the paper mills and the paper trade generally that the only problem in regard to paper supplies will be the maintenance of adequate deliveries of wood pulp to keep our mills in production.  So far no insurmountable difficulty has arisen in that connection.  Reasonable stocks are held and the mills are hopeful that the Baltic countries will continue to be able to fulfil their Irish contracts.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion here to-day upon the question of agricultural fertilisers and I think it is desirable that the House should fully understand the position concerning them.  On the basis of an anticipated all-round increase of 20 per cent. in the acreage under tillage, the Department of Agriculture estimated the additional quantities of fertiliser materials which would be required to be imported before the end of June.  The most important constituent in the manufacture of superphosphates, which is the basis of all compound fertilisers, is rock phosphate, of which 100,000 tons was estimated to be required.  Arrangements were made with the British supply department concerned for the allocation of that quantity of rock phosphate out of extensive purchases made by them in North Africa, which is at present practically the source of all supplies.  Difficulties were experienced in securing the necessary tonnage to transport the rock phosphate and it was agreed that the Irish Fertiliser Manufacturers' Association should make whatever arrangements they could for the chartering of vessels.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of February the association had found it possible to arrange for the transport of approximately 25,000 tons, apart from a further cargo of 4,000 tons recently loaded.  But apart from the 25,000 tons already imported and the cargo to which I have referred, they were unable to arrange for any further cargo.  Supplies on hands at the opening of the fertiliser season were higher than normal, and with those supplies, plus the imports, the Fertilisers' Manufacturers' Association are in a position to distribute <Col N="177" /> 75 per cent. of the total amount sold by them in previous years.</P>
    <P>As the Dáil has been informed, the restrictions upon the importation of fertilisers have been removed, but it would, I think, be foolish to anticipate that any substantial improvement in the position will result from the removal of those restrictions.  Perhaps there will be an improvement, but the indications are to the contrary.  The position, therefore, is that the rock phosphate for the manufacture of superphosphate sufficient to meet our requirements has been purchased and is available in North Africa and the sole difficulty is arranging shipping to transport it here.  Adequate shipping for the transport of the total quantity could not have been made available.</P>
    <P>In the case of animal feeding stuffs, other than grain and offals, we received representations shortly after the war began from traders concerned with regard to the supply of feeding stuffs to the effect that it would be necessary, in the conditions that had arisen, to organise the central purchase and importation of these commodities&mdash; that is to say supplies of oil seed, oil seed cakes and meal, meat, bone and fish meals.  I accepted that view, and, accordingly, the traders concerned set up, with my approval, a non-profit-making company with a nominal capital of £100.  The company commenced operations last December.  Its name is Animal Feeding Stuffs, Éire, Limited.  It has operated successfully, and reasonable supplies of oil seed cakes and meals have been imported and distributed in such a manner as to ensure an equitable proportion of available supplies to traders generally on the basis of the pre-war importations of these traders.  Certain of the commodities with which the company is concerned are, however, unobtainable, commodities such as cotton seed meal and meat and fish meals, but substitute supplies of oil seed cake and meals have been arranged in consultation with the Department of Agriculture. Soya bean meal is the principal substitute.  The two principal commodities dealt with by the company are linseed cake and cotton <Col N="178" /> seed cake.  In so far as linseed cake is concerned the position as regards stocks is that there is sufficient to the end of next April taking into account that the months of March and April represent the season when the demand for linseed cake and meal is heaviest. Stocks of cotton seed cake are, however, low, but two cargoes are at present afloat, and if they arrive in time there should be reasonable quantities available for the period of heavy demand which coincides with that of the heavy demand for linseed cake and meal.</P>

      <P>Mainly.  Deputies will remember the many discussions we had here, after the outbreak of war, on sugar.  Perhaps they will be interested to know the present position concerning sugar supplies.  As they have been informed, our normal consumption of sugar is approximately 100,000 tons a year.  We have at present about 50,000 tons of sugar in stock which represents a half year's supply.  In addition, arrangements have been completed for a further 58,000 tons which will mainly be raw sugars and of that quantity about 24,000 tons are at present afloat on their way to this country.  The total area of beet to be sown in the 1940 season is expected to be in or about 65,000 acres, and with normal conditions as to yield, this acreage is expected to produce approximately 97,000 tons of sugar.  The sugar company have informed me that the purchases of raw sugars made by them have been effected at prices which are below the current f.o.b. quotations. The factories are refining at the rate of 240 or 250 tons per day, and it is expected they will be able to work up to 280 tons per day.  The import of raw sugar, instead of the refined varieties, has, of course, enabled considerable extra employment to be given.  As matters appear at the moment, looking ahead as far as one can, and taking into account all the arrangements that have been made, I think I can say that unless very unusual and exceptional <Col N="179" /> difficulties arise no shortage of sugar is to be anticipated no matter how long the war may last.</P>
      <P>Speaking of sugar, naturally raises the question of the supplies of tea.  In the early days of the war, during the evacuation of teas from the London warehouses, there was some dislocation regarding supplies for this country, but the difficulties in that connection have been got over, and the allocations are now being made regularly in quantities fully adequate to meet the home demand.  In the initial stage of the allocations there were complaints of the quality of tea being forwarded to this country, but it has been ascertained from the tea merchants that there has been a marked improvement in that respect during recent months. The qualities now being received are regarded as being satisfactory.</P>
      <P>My Department is naturally concerned to assist any efforts that may be made by the Department of Industry and Commerce to develop an export trade in industrial goods, an opportunity for which is now offering in some directions.  Investigations and inquiries as to the capacity of Irish industry to undertake the production of goods for which an export demand exists, or could possibly be created, are, of course, undertaken in the first instance by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Department of Supplies undertakes the investigation of any problem in connection with the supplies of necessary raw materials arising in such cases.  Inquiries from the Department of Industry and Commerce are being pursued at the moment as to the outcome of certain tentative proposals of that nature already made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Control of Export Order is being administered as far as possible with a view to encouraging the development of an export business.  Preliminary steps have been taken for an investigation of the problem of the salvage and utilisation of waste materials.  That investigation is proceeding in consultation with representatives of other Departments likely to be concerned, and a considerable amount of information regarding <Col N="180" /> the measures in that connection taken elsewhere has already been collated.  In co-operation with the Department of Industry and Commerce, a survey is proposed to be undertaken of unemployment arising as a result of the war, and the possibility of finding alternative employment.  Preliminary discussions to that end have been initiated.  At present particulars regarding cases of such unemployment arising in consequence of a shortage of materials are specially reported by local employment officers, and the supply position of the particular commodity concerned is investigated by the appropriate section of my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of expressing appreciation of the consideration shown to us by the various authorities established by the British Government controlling the supply of commodities.  They have been most helpful to us in overcoming difficulties, and on many occasions helped us out of a situation which might have been very unpleasant, frequently, even, in the case of commodities in respect of which their own supply position was not too secure.  I think it is right that that appreciation of the co-operation they have shown and the goodwill that they have displayed on more than one occasion should be made.</P>

      <P>I have left to the last a list of commodities I intend to mention&mdash;cereals, both maize and meal. The problems that arise in connection with these cereals are partly problems of supply, partly problems of distribution, and partly problems of price. The position as regards stocks at the present time is as follows: so far as wheat is concerned we have approximately 20 weeks' supply in store. Taking into account existing stocks, and cargoes in sight, the country's requirements of wheat are covered for a very considerable period ahead, certainly to the end of next August.  As regards maize, the position is that there are approximately five weeks' supplies in store, and taking into account existing stocks and cargoes in <Col N="181" /> sight, the country's requirements are covered until the end of next May. In existing circumstances it is not possible to forecast the position any further.  It was apparent at the outbreak of the war that special measures would be necessary in order to maintain supplies of wheat and maize, and to conserve available stocks.  Accordingly, the position was discussed with the interests immediately concerned, and in order to meet the situation I agreed to the setting up by representative corn importers and flour millers of a purchasing and importing organisation, in the form of a non profitmaking company, with a nominal capital of £100, which would be the sole importer of wheat and maize.</P>
      <P>That company, Grain Importers (Éire), Limited, has been in operation since October last.  It has operated successfully, and its importations of the commodities mentioned have been distributed under the direction of my Department in such a manner as to ensure that millers and other tráders concerned receive an equitable proportion of available supplies, based on their pre-war requirements.  The company also purchases and imports other cereals, including offals, as my Department directs, and these importations are also distributed under its directions. The prices at which wheat and maize offals are supplied by the company to the millers and traders concerned are determined in consultation with my Department, which has established machinery for the supervising and implementing by the company, of my direction as regards distribution of all cereals and offals imported by the company.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will please be quiet until I finish.  During the period from the outbreak of war to date, the only restriction on supplies of wheat to millers and traders was restriction to pre-war requirements, which were, however, sufficiently elastic to enable supplies of wheat to be made available without difficulty or delay in areas where the existing demand was above normal.  In the case of maize, it was found necessary to restrict supplies to millers to 75 per cent. of such millers' production of maize-meal mixture for the 12 months' period preceding the war.  As the maizemeal mixture required one part of home-grown grain to five parts of maize, the actual deliveries of maize represents 90 per cent. of what it was last year.  It should also be mentioned that it was found necessary immediately after the outbreak of war, <Col N="183" /> when maize supplies were found to be critically short, to agree, as a temporary expedient, to the flaking of wheat as a substitute for maize.  Some consignments of wheat offals have been imported by Grain Importers (Eire) Limited, and distributed under the directions of my Department.  On account of the freight difficulties mentioned the present prospects of importing further consignments are not good.</P>
      <P>The problem in relation to maize is one of price.  Freight charges, which are about the same as those applicable to wheat, are rapidly putting up the price of maize and, consequently, maize meal.  To-day the price of maize allocated to millers is £9 12s. 0d. a ton, but the most recent purchases work out at £11 5s. 0d. a ton, exclusive of insurance charges.  The prospect is that prices will go even higher still.  It is desirable, from all points of view, to pass on that burden as gradually as possible and, in collaboration with the importing company, prices are being averaged over a period.  At the moment stocks are ample, and by averaging the prices of the quantity in hands and what is to come, the full weight of the price of maize should not be felt by stock rearers for some months to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the biggest problems we have to face arises out of a continuance of the rise in the price of imported wheat. The price of this wheat naturally affects the price of the people's flour and bread.  The rise in the price of imported wheat can be attributed almost entirely to rising freight costs and to the difficulty in getting freight from some countries.  We have been able, so far, to get all the wheat we require but, for some time past, we have been unable to obtain any of the cheaper classes from Australia.  We have, therefore, been obliged practically to confine our purchases to Canada and the Argentine.  I mentioned already the extraordinary increases that have taken place in freight costs for grain cargoes from these countries.  The huge increase in the cost of the transport of wheat from the Argentine is gradually bringing <Col N="184" /> the price of Plate wheat to that of Canadian, which hitherto was the dearest imported.  While that situation continues, and there is no prospect that it will not, the price of flour must inevitably rise.  My Department is daily reviewing all the various factors contributing to the cost of flour and bread, and an inter-Departmental committee is examining the basis of flour prices.  At the present time I have fixed a maximum price for flour at 47/- per sack free on rail, although that figure is less than what the millers claim is an equitable price.</P>
    <P>A good deal of controversy has arisen about the price of flour in this country and in regard to the price of flour in the United Kingdom.  A recent statement by the Chancellor of the British Exchequer that, but for the subsidy, flour prices in England would be 41/- per sack, clears the air to a large extent.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy try to behave himself for half an hour?  Sir John Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking in the British House of Commons on the 8th February, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are acquiring wheat by buying it in various markets, in some cases under a longer contract than others, and by providing the ships to bring it here&mdash;chartering them or otherwise securing transport. We are providing this wheat for the millers for the purpose of having it ground into flour at a price which is much below what could possibly be justified if it were not for the Exchequer subsidy. The price of straight-run flour has remained virtually unchanged at 25/6 per sack, including the Wheat Act levy of 3/6, since August, before the war.  But, if the Government were selling the wheat to the millers <Col N="185" /> in the ordinary way, that is to recover the cost, then the flour would cost about 41/- per sack.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are, in fact, selling to the millers at a much lower price than would be the commercial charge in view of what we have to pay for the wheat.  Hence this subsidy.  It is a very large subsidy.  It is a subsidy of £480,000 per week.  That provides cheaper wheat for the miller and cheaper flour for the baker, enabling him to sell a cheaper loaf and cheaper flour for kitchen use.  That is the nature of the operation.  This £480,000 includes nothing in respect of any pre-war commitments&mdash;nothing whatever&mdash;and that there should be no misunderstanding, I would add that this £480,000 is required by reason of the increased cost of imported wheats&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the basis of similar conditions of sale, the maximum price at which flour may be sold here is 45/- per sack, which price is to be compared with that quoted by Sir John Simon of 41/- per sack.  I use the term &ldquo;similar conditions of sale&rdquo;, because the practice in this country is to sell the flour plus the sack.  In England, the flour is quoted exclusive of the sack, the sack being returnable, and the present price of a flour sack is approximately 2/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the price of flour quoted gross here; is not the sack included in the price of flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum price here, fixed by order, is 47/-.  But, on the basis of similar conditions of sale as those normally operating in Great Britain, that 47/- is equivalent to a price of 45/-, and if any comparison is to be made between the price at which flour is sold here and the economic price in Great Britain, it is between 45/- here and 41/- in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Pure nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can point out the nonsense, which he only can see, later on.  All I ask him is to wait till later on.  As I said, the Chancellor <Col N="186" /> of the Exchequer stated that the economic price of flour in England is 41/-. The actual price here is 47/-.  If we assume similar conditions of sale, the price here would be 45/-.  In any event, as between the economic price in Great Britain and the maximum price here, there is a difference of 6/-.  Of that 6/-, 2/- represents the price of the sack, which is not charged for in Great Britain but is charged for here.  We can and may alter our method of fixing prices here so as to correspond with the British method.  If we did, our maximum price here would be quoted at 2/- less.  The British price contains a levy of 3/6 charged on every sack for the purpose of subsidising the production of native wheat.  We subsidise native wheat on a somewhat different basis.  But, allowing for the fact that only 20 per cent. of the wheat used in Great Britain is of native production, whereas 35 per cent. of the wheat used here at present is of native production, there is a difference between the subsidy element in the British flour price and in our flour price of 2/- per sack. These two items account for 4/- of the 6/- difference between the economic price in Great Britain and the actual price here.  In addition, there is included in our price 1/- per sack, which is charged to meet the cost of the wheat reserve.  That levy was referred to before here in the Dáil.  It is still being made.  It may not be necessary to continue it at all times, but, in the present price of flour, there is 1/- per sack levy which is brought into a special fund which is used to finance the wheat reserve.  There is, therefore, a difference of 1/- per sack still to be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that the cost of imported wheat delivered in this country is higher than the cost of the same wheat delivered in Great Britain. Wheat is brought into Great Britain in British ships at controlled and subsidised rates, and on the cargoes conveyed in those ships the British Government bears by far the greater part of the war risk insurance cost.  We have to transport our wheat in ships secured in the open market and we have to pay the open market freight, and, further, the full war risk insurance <Col N="187" /> charges have to be borne.  These additional charges are probably more than sufficient to wipe out the unexplained difference of 1/- between the price of a sack of flour here and the economic price in Great Britain.  But there are other factors operating as well.  The wages paid in flour mills here are higher than in Great Britain, and apart altogether from wages, labour costs are higher, because the number of men employed in relation to output is somewhat higher than the number employed in British mills.</P>
    <P>All these factors to which I have referred tend to show that the price of flour here is not excessively high.  The attempts made to create public discontent by assertions of that kind are not justifiable on the facts and can only be described as the product of ignorance or dishonesty.  The price of flour here at present is, in fact, less than it was three years ago.  Nevertheless, as I said, the whole question is being investigated to see if there is any way by which it can be kept to lower levels.</P>
    <P>The price of bread continues to be regulated by the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act, 1936, the functions in relation to which have been transferred from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It follows that when wheat prices increase, the prices of wheat offals must follow suit.  In fixing the price of flour, regard is had to the reasonable price at which offals must be sold.  The c.i.f. price of imported offals is now several pounds higher per ton than the present price of homeproduced offals.  In fact, the price of imported offals, due largely to freight charges, is such that it is doubtful if further offals can be imported at all, at least for the present.  Present indications, therefore, are that the supply of wheat offals will only be from 70 to 75 per cent. of the quantity available about this time last year.  Conferences have taken place with the Irish millers and arrangements have been made to secure as equitable as possible a distribution of the available home-produced offals.  It may be necessary to emphasise that control over the <Col N="188" /> price of flour only began to operate strictly in December.  Every effort is being made to make that control effective, and steps are being taken to investigate the results of that control and to judge in what special respects it should be further exercised.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, I think, to correct at once an erroneous view contained in a recent letter published in the Press from Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon put the query as to whether the price charged for flour is based on the net profit of the least efficient millers. That is not correct.  The price of flour has been based on a formula arrived at by examination of the costs of the millers in the country.  The price arrived at by a formula is an average price for the whole country and it is consequently not giving a reasonable profit to the least economic millers.  The question as to the usefulness of that formula for the purpose of control is one of the matters that have been carefully examined.  Deputy Dillon in the letter to which I have referred also suggested that household flour should be considerably cheaper than bakers' flour.  After full consideration of the relevant factors it was decided to fix the same price for all flour permitted to come into the operation of the control. Household flour in this country was cheaper than bakers' flour, but it is very doubtful if there was ever any justification for the difference in price.  A bigger percentage of Irish wheat was generally used in household than in bakers' flour and Irish wheat was and is dearer than imported wheat.  It is difficult to understand why household flour should be cheaper but at present, as I have mentioned, the prices of Plate and Canadian wheat are almost the same.  It is even possible that on a basis of actual cost the price of household flour would, under other arrangements, work out higher than the price of bakers' flour.  In connection with the distribution of wheat, the system adopted by the Grain Importers (Eire) Ltd., is to allocate through the recognised former grain importers. The millers at the ports of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford get wheat at c.i.f. prices plus the importers' <Col N="189" /> charges.  The mills situate elsewhere have to pay carriage charges. The arrangement seems to work out satisfactorily inasmuch as no representations have been received by the Department in relation to it.  If occasion arises a different scheme can be easily adopted.</P>
    <P>I turn now to deal with the problems that have arisen in connection with the distribution of commodities.  So far the only commodity that it has been found necessary to ration, in the generally understood sense of that word, is motor spirit.  The control of the distribution of other commodities in varying degrees short of actual rationing has, however, been unavoidable, in order to ensure that available supplies are distributed equitably.  In co-operation with the traders concerned, the Department has succeeded in avoiding the imposition of rationing in respect of any of these commodities, and it is the intention to continue to rely on the present methods and to refrain from imposing any additional rationing scheme except as a last resort.</P>
    <P>Generally, the efforts of the Department to secure equitable distribution of available supplies of essential commodities have been successful.  By arrangement with the traders concerned or due to the directions given by me in the exercise of my powers under the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, available supplies are distributed where control is necessary, on the basis of the average of pre-war deliveries, and while cases of individual hardship may have occurred as a result of that restriction, an inevitable consequence of restrictions of this nature, every such case coming to notice has received the most sympathetic consideration, having regard to all the necessities of the situation.  Petrol is the only commodity which is rationed in this country.</P>
    <P>In the case of petrol, the rationing schemes came into operation on the 2nd October, and since then the same basic allowances have been allowed.  It was evident shortly after the war began that difficulty would be experienced in obtaining supplies of petrol.  That expectation has proved to be true.  There is a false idea that there are considerable <Col N="190" /> stocks of petrol in the country. That is not so.  The stocks consumed are just being replenished and no more. Very few tankers arrive here now.  Supplies are arriving in relatively small quantities.  The situation is being kept constantly in review, and the amount of petrol permitted to be purchased depends upon the stock position.  Consumption has been restricted to between 25 per cent. and 30 per cent.  But if supply should improve, every effort will be made to increase the ration.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that in putting a scheme of that magnitude into operation there were found to be errors and omissions and some motorists may have considered that their cases did not get adequate attention.  I believe now that the scheme is working quite satisfactorily, and provided the public comply with the simple instructions which they get, nobody should be without a petrol licence for a basic supply at any time.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that once rationing becomes necessary, persons cannot get the petrol that they think they ought to have.  It seems that the great bulk of motorists have adapted themselves to the altered conditions, but considerable pressure is exercised by individuals for bigger allowances.  The supply position is such that we cannot meet those demands, but every effort is made to give as liberal an allowance as possible to persons engaged on essential services or those who must use their cars in the course of their business.  It is appreciated that persons like commercial travellers must suffer more than most other people under the petrol rationing scheme, but every effort is made to give liberal treatment. But it would be very awkward for the Department to attempt to discriminate as between one class of traveller and another, and especially between travellers in the same line of goods. So far commercial travellers have been granted three times the amount granted to the ordinary motorist and, if possible, sympathetic consideration will be given to increasing their ration. For the next couple of months I am arranging to increase these rations, but I cannot say that that increase will <Col N="191" /> be permanent or will be permitted over any prolonged period.  The same consideration will be given to persons engaged in business who require the use of a car.  Deputies will be interested to know that notwithstanding the rationing scheme the number of cars licensed in January of this year shows no falling off on the number registered in the corresponding month last year.  Public transport for passengers and goods is not affected by the petrol ration as all requirements are granted.  Similarly State and local services are not restricted.  All the petrol necessary for agricultural purposes is also given.  As was announced in the Press, a 50 per cent. increase has been granted to all private owners for the months of March and April.  I now come on to deal with the question of State control of prices and will state briefly the principles upon which that control has been operated.  A state of international war has, as in the past, been marked by a progressive rise in the level of prices and in the accumulation of abnormal profits.</P>
    <P>With the comparatively recent experience of the Great War as an example, it was possible to anticipate within reasonable limits the conditions which were likely to arise during the present emergency and, accordingly, to frame measures of prevention and control which would ease, as far as possible, the whole burden of these conditions on the community as a whole.  To the extent that this country is dependent on outside sources of supplies of materials and manufactured products and that those goods, in addition to their market value, must include in their price the cost of freight, insurance and so forth, it was clear that an increase affecting large sections of internal price levels would be forced upon us.  It was also clear that the impact of such increases would bring about adjustments in the price levels of native materials and manufactured products and that, throughout the price structure as a whole, a general movement upward would, therefore, take place.  Such movements, coupled with the fear of scarcity, <Col N="192" /> provide ideal conditions for the accumulation of abnormal and excessive profits and the competing scramble of wages and prices.</P>
    <P>The measures of control taken have, therefore, had, as their primary aim (1) to bring all increases in the prices of commodities under control, (2) to limit such increases to the recovery of unavoidable and proved increases in costs, (3) to limit profits and profit margins to normal and peace-time proportions and, lastly, to secure the maintenance of the greatest economy possible in costs of production and distribution. Our first aim was to put into force necessary preliminary measures of control and, immediately following the outbreak of war, I made orders under the Emergency Powers Act, which, provisionally, fixed the prices of a wide range of commodities of common use and necessity at levels which prevailed immediately before the war.  A large number of commodities were covered by these orders.  In addition, I publicly announced my desire that, before the price of any commodity be increased, application for such increase should be made to the Department of Supplies for examination, and sanction for such increase obtained beforehand.  At the same time I appealed for the co-operation of manufacturers and producers, importers, wholesalers, retailers and other traders in whose best interests it was, as well as in the interest of consumers, that no uncontrolled movement of prices should take place.  In due course, war conditions brought about the necessity for adjustment in the prices fixed under the terms of the orders to which I referred, which were conveniently described as &ldquo;standstill orders.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following examination in my Department, those adjustments were effected either by amending orders or by new orders, or by removal of the commodities in question outside the scope of the standstill orders.  The frequent changes brought about by the war conditions and the frequent price revisions which must follow such changes have made it necessary to institute practically a system of continuous control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> The control is directed to three main groups of traders: (1) manufacturers and producers, (2) importers and wholesalers and (3) retailers.  In the case of manufacturers and producers, it is the aim of control, mainly, to permit only such price increases as are warranted by increased materials-cost and to provide only for normal, or peace-time, profits at reasonable rates, due allowance being made for contingencies arising out of the war.  In practice, allowance must frequently be made for the impact of other increased costs and other factors, arising out of the war, in each particular case.  In the case of importers, wholesalers and retailers, it is the aim of control so to determine gross profit margins as to provide only for normal peace-time profits, judged by reasonable standards, and to prevent the acquisition of excessive profits which would follow automatically on the maintenance of the pre-war percentage margin of gross profit on the increased prices of war-time.  Generally, though certain increases in distribution costs have taken place, traders have been discouraged from attempting to recover such increases which, at present, are not very measurable in terms of wholesale or retail prices.  It is true to say, therefore, that very serious practical difficulties exist in the way of general and effective enforcement of the aims of control in the case of wholesale and retail prices.  A multiplicity of methods and customs of determining profit margins are found in the wholesale and retail traders and, in the case only of a limited number of commodities, is rigid enforcement possible.  In the case of the remainder, control on broad lines only is exercisable, either by agreement with groups of traders or by survey and inspection of individual traders.  The methods of revision may, briefly, be defined as follows: in the case of manufacturers and producers, it is the determination of pre-war costs and war-time costs and the expression of the increase in terms of the pre-war price as a percentage or a sum per unit of sale.  In the case of importers, wholesalers and retailers, it is the determination of the pre-war margin of profit per unit of sale and the provision of the same amount per unit of sale in <Col N="194" /> the new price.  These methods involve a detailed examination of costing accounts and the volume of work in each revision, therefore, depends on the number of prices and qualities in any commodity or commodity group and the nature or extent of the trade or industry. Since the commencement of the war, price revisions in regard to a wide range of commodities, covering a wide area of our industrial and commerical activities, have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>To the extent that it has been found practicable, control of these commodities has been extended to cover all prices from manufacturer to retailer but, as I have said, control in regard to numbers of retail prices must depend on the co-operation of consumers and enforcement by inspectors through individual traders.  A price arrangement with a group of manufacturers or traders concerned in any commodity is, in the first instance, entered into and, thereafter, the terms of that agreement are altered or modified according as the necessity arises.  It cannot be too greatly emphasised that, once a commodity comes forward for revision, the process of control continues automatically. The price arrangements made are, therefore, subject to all the fluctuations occurring in the nature and conditions of trade and to the margins of error arising out of that degree of estimation which is, in certain circumstances, unavoidable, so that the results of such arrangements must, in due course, come forward for examination and check.  It is in the examination of manufacturing and trading accounts of individual firms for the purpose of that check that a serious volume of additional work will fall to be carried out by the machinery of control, for which adequate provision must be made.  It is only by the results of the control measures which have been taken that the degree of success achieved can be evaluated and any necessary adjustments in the system applied.  The measure of co-operation and conformity with the policy of the Government which has been forthcoming from manufacturers and traders is substantial.  It is undoubtedly the case, however, that price increases have taken place without the sanction or <Col N="195" /> knowledge of the Department, and it will be increasingly necessary to undertake a general survey of such commodity prices as these come forward for review with a view to investigation in at least these cases of most importance to the community.  Since the outbreak of the war the work of the prices branch of my Department has been carried out by the personnel of the Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>So much for the general system of control, but, supplementing that general control, there is the process of price investigation by individual inspection and the examination of complaints received from the public.  It is, in fact, by inspection through inspectors on the receipt of complaints from the public that the control can touch most nearly the immediate consuming public in respect of a wide range of commodities and the variety of conditions governing purchases and sales and that is, in fact, their only means of protection.  Since 1st September we have received 1,354 complaints, of which 55 per cent. were in respect of food prices, 12 per cent. in respect of fuel, 10 per cent. in respect of animal feeding stuffs, and the balance in respect of miscellaneous commodities, including building materials, tobacco, textiles and clothing.</P>
    <P>It was not found possible to pursue a large number of those complaints owing to the absence of vital particulars, such as the names and addresses of the traders concerned.  In most of these cases further information was sought by letter, but it is clear that a large body of consumers would not enter into correspondence and such cases can be dealt with only by the personal attendance of the inspectors.  On investigation 36 per cent. of the complaints were proved to be well founded; prices were reduced and in many cases refunds were made.  In the remaining 64 per cent. prices were found to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>In addition to the investigation of complaints from members of the public, a considerable number of complaints have been made at the instance of local authorities and also at the instance of <Col N="196" /> the Department of Local Government and Public Health, the Department of Defence, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and certain charitable institutions. Those investigations arise out of contracts other than those entered into by contractors under the combined purchasing scheme.  Owing to the large quantities of goods passing, such investigations require greater attention and much more thorough examination than ordinary complaints and, of course, inspections of costings and accounts are frequently necessary. The number of such cases received since 1st September was 231.  A further increase in the number of such cases may be anticipated, especially towards the end of the financial year, when fresh contracts are being placed.  It is the practice in such cases to specify the contract prices which, in the opinion of my Department, are considered fairly reasonable.</P>
    <P>I have spoken far longer than I intended, and yet I have given only a very rough outline of the activities of the Department of Supplies and dealt only in a very general way with the policy operated by it.  If there is any matter concerning the supply of particular commodities or the working of the policy of my Department upon which Deputies may require information, I will be only too glad to give it to them.  It is desirable in all matters relating to supplies that there should be the widest possible publicity so that any suspicions that may be entertained as to favourable treatment of some individuals as against others concerning the control of prices and the elimination of excess profits should be removed.  I hope that Deputies, in approaching the matter, will do so in a constructive manner.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that difficulties concerning supplies are to be anticipated. It is because such difficulties were regarded as inevitable that a Department of Supplies was created at all. We cannot undertake to remove all the difficulties but, recognising that the war has created a situation in which supplies of many commodities will be curtailed, it is desirable in the national interest that they should be curtailed as little as possible.  I hope Deputies <Col N="197" /> will endeavour to make their views constructive and give us the benefit of any suggestions they have in mind as to how existing or anticipated difficulties can be removed.</P>

      <P>The Minister has spent the last one and a half hours reading a long document which he prepared at leisure, with the assistance of the officers of his Department, before he came into the House.  His capacity for reading the hundred or so pages of that document reflects credit upon him; but, in the course of reading it and preparing it, I think he has given an exhibition of the most disreputable conduct that any Minister of the State has ever given in this House.  If the Minister had been the salaried servant of the flour millers of this country, he could not have further debased himself to act as their advertisement huckster.  He read us long extracts from an <i>ex-parte</i> statement published, at the flour millers' expense, in the Press of this country.</P>

I shall rebut them in the course of the observations I am about to make.  I shall quote their source, show their falsity, and name the individuals who have been paid to impose them on the people of this country.  We have come now to the limit of our patience, and the time has come to expose this dirty ramp, and I am going to do it.  It is time it was done.  The people of this country have been ruthlessly and systematically robbed by the flour millers.  They have been so robbed and plundered with the consent of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now the Minister for Supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once and once only were these highway robbers brought to book before the Prices Commission, and on that occasion the Prices Commission reported to the Minister and to the Parliament that the flour millers were robbing our people, were making excess profits and were plundering the poor in order to line their own purses. Nothing was done as a result of that report.  That was the only occasion <Col N="199" /> upon which these men were brought before the tribunal to defend their conduct.  On the only occasion on which they were brought to book they were publicly convicted of robbing our people, and yet the only comment the Minister has ever made upon that report is to justify the thing they did; to justify the claim that they were right to rob our people; that the Prices Commission were wrong in regard to the excess profits they were charging. That is not doing a Minister's duty; that is not doing the job he was paid for.</P>

The gentlemen who are engaged in this transaction had better take notice of that now.  We are told to-day that the costings of flour milling in this country are not based on the cost of the most inefficient mill in Ireland. The costings of the flour milling industry in this country are drawn up by the most highly paid costings accountant in Great Britain, a man who is worth £3,000 a year or more, and they are based on the average costings of all the mills in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Every miller in Ireland who owns a mill at the port of Dublin or at the port of Limerick or the port of Cork has in his hand one of the most efficient milling units in the world, capable of producing flour as cheaply as it is produced in any mill in the world.  Only recently in Limerick there has been added to the existing equipment efficient machinery to unload cargoes of wheat from the ship into the mill without the intervention of a human hand.  The costings on which those mills are working are costings arrived at by striking an average between the costings of the efficient mill and the costings of the little inland mill which, on investigation we will discover, is being operated by the owner of the big mill in order to provide a higher average costing for the two mills than would be accepted if he closed down the little antediluvian mill that he is keeping open for no other purpose than to get a licence from that Minister to rob the public.</P>

No <Col N="203" /> greater mistake could be made than to fall into the trap prepared by the Minister here to-day.  The Minister desires those who resent this robbery to challenge him on the prices prevailing at the present moment.  The prices obtaining at the present moment are conditioned by an entirely new set of circumstances, so complex, so rapidly changing that I admit that within the last two months it has become impossible to follow with precision the fluctuations of prices here and the fluctuations of the differential &mdash;between the prices here and the prices in Great Britain.  But I am going to give the House detailed figures of the price of flour here in August, 1939, and the price of flour in Liverpool in August, 1939, because these are the last occasions for which firm figures can be found.  I am going to suggest that from the information we will extract from these figures we get information which will guide us to press home upon the millers of this country their responsibility of, far from exacting an excessive profit now, making some retribution to the people they have robbed in the past, and taking a lesser margin of profit than might ordinarily be expected in this period of stress and difficulty.</P>

On the last relative date it was possible to get figures Liverpool spot prices for wheat, quoted in terms of 280-lb. sacks, were 12/2 for Australian, 14/2¾ for No. 2 Manitoba and 11/5¼ for Plate Rosafé.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately.  The Liverpool forward parcel price for the same date was 10/11¼ for Australian (Queensland); 13/1? for No. 2 Manitoba, August shipment, and 10/0¾ for Plate Rosafé (64 lbs. bushel). Liverpool cargo prices were 11/1 Australian, Western Afloat; 14/- for No. 1 Manitoba and 10/9½ for Plate Rosafé.  I am assuming that 1/- per 280-lb. sack of wheat is approximately sufficient to cover the extra Irish port dues and charges for handling.  Liverpool straight run flour price at that date was 19/6 per sack of 280 lbs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at that date.  That price is subject to the additional figure, to which the Minister referred, of 1/3 for sacks.  Sacks have to be paid for and come to about 7½d. for 10-stone bags, and two 10-stone bags make a sack of flour.  A notable difference between Great Britain and Ireland is that in Great Britain the 280 lbs. of flour is bought naked, and to the price you add the cost of the two sacks to cover it.  In Ireland when you buy 280 lbs. of flour you buy it in the bag. I do not believe the Minister could be so positive as deliberately to mislead the House, but here is where he was mislead.  The practice of the Irish trade is to sell the flour gross weight and you get 276 lbs. of flour and 4 lbs. of bags.  If the flour be worth 8½d. you must deduct the 8½d., which the millers save by not putting the 4 lbs. of flour in the bag, from the price of the two bags, and you are entitled to add the difference between the price of the two bags and the 4 lbs. of flour that the millers save by selling at gross weight.  I shall deal with that in greater detail when I come to the conclusion of this calculation.  Therefore the Liverpool flour price, if we include the bags, was 19/6 per sack plus 1/3 for the bags, giving a figure of 20/9 per sack ex mill in bags.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the price of flour in Great Britain compared with the cost of flour produced in Ireland.  Of course, there was, in addition to the price I mentioned there, a payment which was made on flour consumed in England called the wheat subsidy, with which I intend to deal later.  At present the price of flour is 20/9 ex mill in bags.  Now we come to the Dublin flour prices on the same date.  Strong bakers were worth <Col N="206" /> 38/6 ex mill, shops 35/-, so there was fifty-fifty production, and you get a rough average price of 36/9 for straight run flour.  The House should know at this stage that one of the difficulties of relating prices in Great Britain and in Ireland is that in Great Britain little or no household flour is consumed. Here a very substantial quantity of our total output is in the form of household flour.  In England it is all bakers' flour.  It is fifty-fifty here.</P>
      <P>The price of flour here was 36/9 and 20/9 a sack in Liverpool.  That gives the Irish millers 16/- to play with.  Bear in mind that the 20/9 includes nothing for English wheat.  I am going to make the case that it is well know that the Irish millers have extra responsibility in as much as they have to use Irish wheat, and to put them on an equal footing with English millers, with whom I am comparing them, let us make a reckoning of what the two flours were bought at.  Take Liverpool &ldquo;grist&rdquo;.  They call a mixture of wheat from which you ultimately compose a blend, grist.  Grist in Liverpool consisted of a sack or barrel of Australian wheat costing 11/1, two sacks of No. 2 Manitoba costing 14/- each, and two sacks of Rosafé, 10/9 each.  That gives the total price of five sacks at £3 0s. 7d., giving an average price of 12/1½ per sack or barrel of wheat.  That is Liverpool grist. Come now to Irish grist.  You had one barrel of Australian at 12/1, two barrels of No. 1 Manitoba at 15/-, giving £1 10s. 0d.  You had a barrel of Rosafé at 11/9½ per barrel and a barrel of Irish wheat at 35/-.  The Minister, you remember, said it was about one in five of Irish wheat.</P>

My reckoning makes it £4 8s. 10½d., giving an average price of 17/9½ per barrel.  The Minister wants that increased to about 18/6 per barrel average price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Liverpool grist costs approximately 12/1½d. per barrel One hundred barrels of that grist will cost £60 12s. 6d., and that will produce when it is milled 72 sacks of flour at 20/9 per sack, as I explained to the House, which will yield £74 14s. 0d.; 16 sacks of pollard or middlings at 5/6 per cwt., which gives you £11; 12 sacks of bran, red and white combined, at 4/10½d., which gives you £7 6s. 3d., giving you a total return on the goods produced from that wheat of £93.  From that £93 deduct the cost of wheat&mdash;£60 12s. 6d. &mdash;and you are left with a milling margin of £32 7s. 9d. out of which to pay your expenses and to make your profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, turn to the Irish side.  Their grist costs, according to my calculation&mdash;the Minister, with the assistance of the accountants of the Irish Flour Millers' Federation, may be able to correct me; I have no doubt he will consult them with a view to doing so&mdash;the Irish flour millers' grist costs approximately 17/9½d.  One hundred barrels of <Col N="208" /> that was dearer than the British grist &mdash;it was £88 19s. 2d.  Out of that 100 barrels they got 72 sacks of flour, the price of which was 36/9 per sack in Dublin at that date, yielding them £132 6s. 0d.  They got 16 sacks of middlings or pollard for which they got 5/6 per cwt.  I believe that they got substantially more than 5/6, but I am only debiting them with 5/6 per cwt. for the pollard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>They got out of that grist 12 sacks of bran at 6/- per cwt., which yielded £9, giving a total return in cash of £152 6s.  Deduct from that gross total the price of the wheat they put in&mdash;£88 19s. 2d., and they had a milling margin of £63 6s. 10d., whereas the Liverpool mill had a margin of £32 7s. 9d.  I want the House to note carefully that I did not add on to the British price the wheat subsidy in Great Britain.  But then I did make full allowance, in calculating the cost of the Irish grist, for putting the Irish wheat into the Irish flour, thus compensating the miller for any extra expense he was put to by the use of Irish wheat.  I have no doubt that the costing accountants in Nassau Street will explain to this House through the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating plainly, bluntly, and without evasion that, the Minister and his Department have consulted those men and that their opinion has been asked about those facts.  He said that he will ask their opinion and their views.  That was the phrase, the cost of handling Irish wheat.  These representations will be advanced by the millers as justification for the difference between £32 7s. 9d., the milling margin in Liverpool, and £63 6s. 10d., the milling margin on the same quantity of flour in Dublin.  The Liverpool miller has that advantage over the Dublin miller, but, in reality, the milling industry in this country and the milling industry in Liverpool is controlled by the same person&mdash;Joseph Rank.  The Irish Flour Millers' Association is controlled and run by the English Flour Millers' Association. The Irish millers are just the Liverpool millers with the green, white and yellow flag around them.  That is plain.  It is an unadorned fact, and everybody knows it.</P>
      <P>Let nobody be misled in following into the trap which was set by the Flour Millers' Association in the advertisement published in the Press last week.  That association wants to justify all that has happened in the last four years by what is happening at the moment.  They want to draw their antagonists into a controversy so as to be able to get away with their case that the level of their excess profits in the last four years is the same as it is now. They hoped to engage their antagonists in that controversy in the hope that, by defeating them in part of their controversy, they will get away with the idea that they defeated them in the whole thing.  The Irish Flour Millers' Association may pay their costing expert £3,000 a year, but I warn them here and now that though they may pull the wool over the eyes of the Minister for Supplies they will not pull the wool over the eyes of Deputies in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our people, especially the poor, have been robbed by the millers of this country in the last four years.  That robbery has been carried out under <Col N="212" /> the eyes of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and under the eyes of the Minister for Supplies.  That has been done under the eyes and against the report of his own Prices Commission, although the Minister is supposed to be the trustee of the people and their protector against combines.  But he has never raised his hand to defend the poor of this country against these men who are robbing them.  He has never come into this House but to justify the action of the flour millers. He has never suggested that they have been doing any wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to-day to use a platform from which to underline every syllable of their controversial advertisement in the Press a few days ago.  The Minister attempts to justify their past conduct by the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day. I will not let that pass.  I will not let these men escape the heavy responsibility that rests on them before the whole world, and particularly before the poor people of this country, for the criminal robbery they have perpetrated on the people of this country. We are not in a position to justify their depredations, some of which the successors of the present Government may get back; but, in the meantime, we will have to try to make the burden on the poor as light as advocacy and revelation in this House combine to make it.  I think I made pretty clear what our views are as to the flour industry. Every time the flour millers return to the charge they will be taken up, and their record will be read to the House; their activities will be exposed.  Let them never imagine that, by power, wealth or influence, they will silence those who know the measure of their iniquity.</P>
    <P>I want now to pass over to other matters of supply.  Do the Deputies know that at the present time we are transporting, from the United States of America, treacle and on receipt of it here, we are converting it into petrol at approximately a price of 3/- a gallon in order to take the place of motor spirit which we can buy at 4d. a gallon?

      <P>The Minister would give any help he could to find accommodation in a ship for essential commodities for this country.  But does the House know what he is doing?  He is putting seven volumes of treacle into each ship capable of carrying petrol.  He is converting this seven volumes of treacle into one volume of petrol in this country.  He could bring over several gallons of petrol which would cost him 4d. per gallon delivered in Dublin, but he prefers to bring seven volumes of treacle which, converted into petrol, will make one volume of petrol at 3/- a gallon.  Now that is the question. My submission is that whoever is doing that should be stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated to-day that the public were complaining about his having rationed petrol.  His answer to these complaints was: &ldquo;I <Col N="217" /> cannot give you any more petrol.&rdquo;  My sole concern was to explain to the Minister how he could get more petrol so that he would not have to insist on rationing it as drastically as he has done heretofore.  I think the House now knows what the situation is and, having let in a little light on it, I am sure that public opinion will correct the Minister, <i>nolens volens.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the question of artificial manures and feeding stuffs.  I asked the Minister to-day what he proposed to do to get supplies of manures. There is more to be done by a Minister for Supplies than sitting down and consulting groups of traders because, if these traders fail him, he ought to exert himself to get supplies for the people.  The Minister is not here as a Minister representing traders.  He represents the people as a whole.  If the influence of traders with Belgian commercial men has not been sufficient to get supplies, or if the influence of traders with the Belgian Government has not been sufficient to get supplies exported from Belgium, surely it is time the Belgian Minister was approached through the proper diplomatic channels with a view to invoking his aid in getting us supplies of manures from Belgium.  Belgium is a neutral country.  Belgian ships travelling between their colonial empire and Belgium are immune from attack.  They are, probably, in a position to carry far larger supplies of phosphate rock to Belgium than Great Britain or this country, which has not any mercantile marine of its own, is able to carry.  I cannot imagine why the Belgians would not be able to export to us superphosphate of lime in a finished condition, if we were prepared to take it and to pay for it.  Having placed a general restriction on export for tactical and strategic reasons, they may be reluctant to depart from it, but they might do so if representations were made to them.  I put it to the Minister that there is a grave obligation on him to make these representations before it is too late.  It will take some time to get superphosphate of lime from Belgium but, possibly, we could get a cargo or two before the end of the manuring season if urgent action is <Col N="218" /> taken now.  It would be of incalculable value if that were done.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of oil cakes.  The supply of linseed oil cakes has been very unsatisfactory.  I should like the Minister to inquire from his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, as to whether any protest has been made to the Government responsible for torpedoing a neutral boat approaching these neutral shores with supplies of linseed and linseed cake.  I understand that a neutral ship carrying a cargo of these goods to our shores was torpedoed by a German submarine.  The cargo was nearly lost, but the ship succeeded in limping into port.  Surely, some remonstrance should be made to the Government responsible for that action and a suitable protest registered, with a view to protecting any further supplies which this Government might similarly attempt to import.  I understood the Minister to say that supplies of oil cake and linseed derivatives were equal to those available last year.  That is certainly not my experience.</P>

The Minister, who was born and bred in Dublin, may not know much about these things, because they are not used to any extent in the city, but in the country these articles are to be found on every dresser.  It is practically impossible to get supplies.  I do not know whether that arises from the war, but from whatever source it arises the Minister should investigate the situation with a view to relaxing the existing restrictions on the imports of these commodities.</P>

I am told by the smiths in my neighbourhood that they could not pay the price of fuller iron based on what is charged by Haulbowline factory.  Of course, fuller iron is not a requisite, because for many years the smiths fullered their own iron and they can do it again.  Assuming they buy the iron and fuller it.  I am told they will not be able to get the price for the shoes.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £30,475 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; The Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928, etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total excess over the Estimate as approved by the Dáil amounts to £48,550, against which there are offsetting savings of £18,075, leaving a net excess of £30,475.  The causes necessitating the additional provision are indicated broadly in Part III of the Supplementary Estimate under the various sub-heads affected.  Of the total amount involved, approximately £8,800 is due to additional staff provision rendered necessary by growth of services, by additional work arising out of emergency conditions, by the <Col N="221" /> substitution of officers on military service, etc.  Revised arrangements with the railway companies in regard to the carriage of parcel mails, dating back to 1st July, 1936, involve £7,875; additional motor vehicles for mail purposes, £1,000; the provision of emergency reserve stocks of general stores, uniforms, stamps, etc. £10,200; increased prices resulting from emergency conditions, £7,100.  Owing to the carrying out of the full programme of telephone capital works not being found practicable, the relief from telephone capital funds will be less than was anticipated, and this will involve a charge of, approximately, £2,600 in excess of the actual Vote provision, under sub-head K, for engineering materials.</P>
    <P>Engineering contract work, viz., the laying of new cables to the Aran Islands and to Arranmore, County Donegal, provided for and carried out in the previous financial year, but not paid for until the current year, involves £4,700.  Appropriations-in-Aid fall short of the estimated figure by about £6,000.  The offsetting savings are mainly due to staff reductions in headquarters offices, to lower factory costs by reason of reduced engineering requirements; to expenditure anticipated but not incurred this year on extended accommodation for postal and engineering purposes in Dublin City; and to expenditure in respect of extra staff and equipment for civil aviation and meteorological wireless services provided for but not materialising during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister read his statement rather quickly.  It was difficult to follow it.  If I interpret it correctly, I take it that he gave the explanation which is on page 2 of the Estimate in connection with Provincial Offices.  The increase in that case was due, in the main, to additional outdoor and telephonist staff; extra overtime owing to unfilled vacancies and the release of staff for military service and for work in other Departments; enhanced payments to scale payment subpostmasters mainly in respect of widows' pensions and Unemployment Orders.  Will the Minister tell us how <Col N="222" /> much of that is due to the release of staff for military services and whether, in view of all the circumstances, he would consider it wise to ask the Minister for Defence to leave him those men he had?</P>
      <P>It is a peculiar situation in which we find ourselves.  The cost of the Defence Vote goes up by reason of recruitment and the cost of the Minister's Department goes up by reason of some of his officials having gone over for military service.  There may be excuses for both of these extra costs on the taxpayer, but the explanation we get is not as full as we are entitled to.  There is a considerable sum down for the conveyance of mails by rail&mdash;it is a very considerable addition.  Does it cover only a particular year or does it cover a number of years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The strange thing is that we have those considerable sums coming in at a time when nobody has too much money, when the taxes are at their peak point and when expenses are very high and dividends in most cases are fairly low.  Stores are up by £6,260 and these are apparently extra items because obviously, if the Minister had an Estimate here last year, he had an opportunity for inserting those items in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did Ministers follow the number of statements that were made here by the Prime Minister and others regarding the international situation, or did they think the Prime Minister was amusing himself when he came here and described the situation as being outside the normal?  Were Ministers unable to anticipate those increases in prices?  There is the sum of £4,000 for the manufacture of stamps.  Was that expense unavoidable, or was there delay in giving an order for stamps until prices had gone up?  There is a reference here to contract work, but that deals with a matter that it is impossible to foresee.  I would suggest to the Minister that when coming before the House with an Estimate in which there is a good deal of detail, he might take the opportunity of furnishing a few copies of his statement in advance.  The same complaint was <Col N="223" /> made to his predecessor.  The Minister read his statement this evening a little faster than his predecessor used to do, but perhaps he would bear my suggestion in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate makes provision for a number of matters to which I want to direct the attention of the Minister.  I want to refer to the unsatisfactory position of at least one branch of his Department&mdash;the engineering branch.  On the 22nd February last I addressed a question to the Minister asking him to state the number of employees in the engineering branch of his Department whose services had been dispensed with since the 1st September last.  To that I received the rather surprising reply that 36 such employees had been paid off.  In reply to a supplementary question, which I addressed to the Minister, he said: &ldquo;As a matter of fact, these men were retained during the emergency period until we saw how we could carry on on a normal basis. Their being out of employment now is ruled entirely by the fact that we have no work for them to do.&rdquo;  Those who know the facts of the position in the engineering branch would not believe a statement of that kind for two minutes because there is no foundation for it.  There is an abundance of work in connection with the engineering branch which could be usefully undertaken in the maintenance of an efficient telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the Minister's Department does not choose to do that work, and, consequently, 36 people have had their services terminated since the 1st September last.  Let me take the Minister back to September when we had a moving appeal from the Taoiseach to private employers not to resort to the expedient of terminating the services of their employees.  We also had the present Minister for Supplies making an appeal to private employers to keep on their staffs as far as possible, and not unduly to restrict their activities.  Now, one would imagine that an appeal by the Taoiseach and the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Supplies, would at least <Col N="224" /> induce the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to do some honour to the appeal which they made, but, instead of listening to their appeals, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs feels that their appeals have no concern for him, that he is not obliged to take any notice of them, and he then proceeds to set this very bad example to private employers by dismissing staff, although the Taoiseach had made a very strong appeal to private employers to retain their staffs, especially during the emergency period.  There is, at least, one employer in the country who feels that he can disregard entirely the appeal made by the Taoiseach, and that he is perfectly free to act in any irresponsible manner he wishes in a crisis such as that through which the country is passing.</P>
    <P>Let me deal for a few moments with the contention that there is no work for these 36 men.  The Minister made that statement in the Dáil at a time when many persons want to have the telephone installed either in their business premises or private residences in Dublin.  The fact is that they are not able to get the telephones installed. I understand that there are approximately 200 people in Dublin City alone at the present time who have ordered telephones, and these orders have not been supplied.  I venture to say that if the position is examined in other areas it will be found that there, too, there is a lag between the date of application for a telephone and the date of fitting it in.</P>
    <P>And yet, notwithstanding that condition of affairs, the Minister tells the House that there is no work for these 36 men to do, that there is no work in a branch of the service for which he is administratively responsible.</P>
    <P>If we pass from that type of telephone activity to a type of activity which should be attended to with the utmost expedition, and come to another phase of the Department's work, namely, the provision of underground cables, here again, as the Minister's staff can tell him, there is an inadequacy of these cables at the present time which results in a loss of revenue to the Department because of <Col N="225" /> the inability to give services in areas where there is a shortage of telephone cables.  The position in the city area in this respect is extremely bad, as the staff in the Minister's Department know only too well.  In certain areas, such as Inchicore, Cabra and Marino, as well as in the greater Dublin area, there is the need for a greater number of additional cables.  At present the cables are in many cases giving very considerable trouble.  That is due to the fact that sufficient attention is not being paid to maintaining the cables in a state of efficiency.  There is a 1,000 pair cable running from Crown Alley to O'Connell Street, and the Minister should make some inquiries to ascertain the number of faults which have revealed themselves on that particular cable, as well as the vexatious annoyance caused to persons whose service comes through that defective cable.</P>
    <P>Passing from underground defects and the shortage of underground cables to overhead work, here again we find that the Post Office Department does not apparently regard it as a serious part of its functions to maintain the overhead wires and poles in an up-to-date state of efficiency.  In Dublin City and suburbs there has been no effective maintenance carried on for a number of years.</P>
    <P>There are defects in many of the poles, loose nuts, loose bolts, and sometimes loose wires.  Apparently that condition of affairs is allowed to drag on, with deleterious effects on the efficiency of the telephone service.  I think the Minister knows that many of the distributing poles in the city are extremely defective and react on the efficiency of the service.  Some of them are positively dangerous.  There is a distributing pole in Tara Street which has been officially condemned as being dangerous.  The men object to climbing the pole owing to its dangerous condition.  Yet it continues to serve in some kind of fashion.  It will probably be replaced if someone's life is lost as a result of the defect in the pole.  Passing to the condition of the Wicklow trunk route, if the Minister inquires from the engineering department I think he will find that the position is <Col N="226" /> anything but satisfactory, that faults are of frequent occurrence, and that a staff should be employed to overhaul it. Apparently, the Post Office authorities are content when faults show themselves to do patchwork, instead of making the service satisfactory on that route.  Faults in subscribers' lines in the Dublin area have been particularly bad in the last 12 months, and were viciously bad during the recent wet weather.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was a linesman, and had to call on some of the irritated subscribers who complain of faults, he would recognise that there is work to be done in the engineering branch, and that there was an insufficiency of staff for proper maintenance work.  Even in the Ship Street exchange the Minister might inquire if the staff is adequate according to the Department's standard of what is normally required.  In face of these facts, which I am prepared to prove if the Minister would only initiate an inquiry into the working of the engineering branch, I cannot understand the allegation that there is no work to be done in that branch.  My remarks are about Dublin, but a similar condition of affairs could be shown to exist in other places.  How, in the face of that situation, the Minister could contend that there is no work which would justify the retention of the 36 men members of the engineering staff I referred to completely baffles my comprehension.</P>
    <P>If he looks at the accounts the Minister will realise that the telephones are a profitable service and have yielded a substantial surplus for many years.  Accordingly, the least the public is entitled to is an efficient telephone service.  That cannot be secured if the Minister continues to dispense with staff while there is so much repair and maintenance work to be done.  An insufficient staff means an inefficient service.  The Minister should realise that when this service is yielding a substantial surplus it can best be encouraged to continue doing so by maintaining it in a high state of efficiency. At present the Department appears to be content to allow the necessary maintenance work to be put on the long finger; no serious attention being paid <Col N="227" /> to the necessity for systematic maintenance and repair work over the entire service.  I cannot accept the contention of the Minister that there is no work available in the engineering branch.  If he makes inquiry he will find that there is much more work in that branch than the 36 ex-employees could possibly do.</P>
    <P>Having brought these facts to the notice of the Minister, I hope he will make some inquiry into the manner in which the engineering branch is staffed, at a time when maintenance and repair work is put on the long finger and neglected, and take steps to provide an efficient telephone service, as well as obviating the necessity for the harassing tactics that prevail.  If an inquiry of that kind is undertaken the Minister will find that there is scope for considerable improvement in that branch of the service, and that a solution of that problem will add to the efficiency of the service.  At this stage I hope the Minister will undertake to take back those whose services were dispensed with.  There seems to me to have been downright disregard of the Taoiseach's appeal, and an irresponsible attitude from that which might be expected from a public department, when 36 persons were paid off in a crisis period, with apparently very little consideration for their sufferings, and very little regard for necessary work that should be put in hand.</P>

      <P>Like other Supplementary Estimates that this House has been faced with for the past fortnight, one is inclined to ask if every Government Department and every Minister deliberately underestimated last year? Supplementary Estimates have been introduced in respect of every Department. I am inclined to believe that there was deliberate underestimation last year in order to make the Budget position look far better than it was. Possibly Ministers thought that it would be a much better idea to make the Budget position look as well as possible and to wait until the tail-end of the financial year to ask for more money.  This is quite a substantial sum, £34,475.  If one was to believe <Col N="228" /> the old proverb that the last straw breaks the camel's back one might say that this breaks the taxpayer's back. This is quite a substantial burden. Deputy Norton mentioned that in the Department of Posts people had been put out of employment because their services were not required, but I notice that under sub-head A (3) extra money is required because people had to be paid overtime on account of unfilled vacancies.  I wonder if these unfilled vacancies were of a highly technical character?</P>

      <P>Would it be possible that the vacancies could have been filled by the recruitment of unemployed people?  There is a note also about the release of staff for military services and for work in other Departments. Does that mean that employees of the Post Office were called up as reservists on the mobilisation of the Volunteers and that the Post Office lost their services and had to get other people to do their work?  Could the Minister say into what other Departments officials of the Post Office were taken during that period?  Sub-head E (1) deals with the conveyance of mails by rail, and when Deputy Cosgrave asked if this item arose during the present financial year the Minister shook his head.</P>

      <P>The Minister was not justified in paying out the taxpayers' money until he walked into a position in which the money had to be spent sometime when it would cost the taxpayer far more.  Would it not have been far better if the Minister and his Department took their courage in their hands and laid in stocks at normal prices which could have been utilised normally after a certain length of time, rather than wait until the stocks cost far more?  The same thing possibly applies to clothing.  The Minister would find it impossible, in the eyes of any taxpayer, to justify coming along here within three weeks of the end of the financial year looking for £30,475 extra.  If this sort of thing goes on, and we are to have a Budget at the beginning of every financial year, and towards the end of the financial year we are going to be presented with Supplementary Estimates like these, possibly it may develop into the ordinary Governmental practice, because I am sure that as time goes on the Minister will be quite capable of finding some other explanation next year rather than the war conditions. What I object to is that the war is no explanation for these increased Estimates. I say that the Minister responsible for the Department last year under-estimated and that that under-estimation was to make a bad Budget position better than it really was; that the Minister believes that it is easier to delude the taxpayer by asking for money in dribs and drabs, of which the total amount is very large, rather than face the taxpayer with the correct figure in the Budget statement.  It is quite possible that these are very good tactics on the part of the Ministry, because I can imagine that the shock to the taxpayer if the amounts which are now being voted were added to the Budget statement last year would be far greater than the shock he feels when they are introduced step after step over a period of two or three weeks, and carried piecemeal as they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this House will have to wake up and tell the Government plainly that if they want money to carry on services they will have to do <Col N="231" /> their estimating properly.  There is no good in telling the House that it is because a war has taken place which they could not foresee.  The House will have to tell the Minister and the Government that if they want money to carry on the essential services they will have to ask for it at the beginning of the financial year; that they will have to estimate properly and not be deluding the House and the public by bringing in Supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased that Deputy Norton brought to the notice of the Minister the question of the engineering service.  I certainly think that the service given to the people down the country is disgraceful. No attention whatever is given to the telegraph or telephone service, particularly the telegraph service.  If we have a few nights' frost, as we had at Christmas, the whole country is cut off. Nothing is thought about the people who are finding the money.  In the town of Athenry, for instance, a building was being constructed which was started about last March.  In February last year the postal authorities were notified what the height of the house was to be.  They were also notified as to the height of their wires there, and that the existing wires and poles would not allow that particular house to be built according to plan or specification if they were left as they were.  I brought that matter to the notice of the authorities last March.  That house was roofed before an attempt was made to change the wires.  After it was roofed the matter was again brought to their attention.  When it was first brought to their attention, the answer was that it was difficult to get a pole long enough.  When the house was roofed, we were informed that if we interfered with the wires we would be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several batches of inspectors came down from Dublin and Athlone in motor cars.  One batch of inspectors politely told me that there should be a law under which a three-storey house <Col N="232" /> could not be built in a town of 1,200 population.  The next thing was that we had a staff of men putting up temporary wires.  I would ask the Minister to inquire how many of these wires fell down during the frost last Christmas.  It was only during the last two months that permanent wires were put up.  I know a little bit about wiring, and I say that these wires will be down again within a very short time.  From what I could see of the wires, they were all secondhand.  It is not fair that people who are paying for a service have to go to all that expense. Everyone of the inspectors will tell you that it was all owing to the war; that they could not get a pole long enough, and that they could not get new wire, although they were notified of this last March.</P>
    <P>When the people are paying for a service like that they should get a service.  As far as I know, it will be some time before the Minister gets back the 36 men whose services were dispensed with, because they are in a much better job now.  It would be much better to keep on experienced men at this work rather than dispensing with them, and probably bringing in some prominent members of Fianna Fáil clubs to take their place.  That is what will happen.  It is happening every day.</P>
    <P>As to the telephone service, I know a town in the West where there is a telephone exchange with a full-time telephonist.  That girl has to keep winding a handle from 10 o'clock in the morning, doing eight hours.  It reminds me of the &ldquo;hurdy-gurdies&rdquo; we used to see on the streets.  That is the kind of exchange we have there.  Is that becoming modern or giving a proper service to the people who are paying for it?  I say it is not.  The Minister has enough of inspectors going around the country, and it is time for them to settle down to the work and give the people the service for which they are paying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if all these extras arise directly out of the war.  The first one is salaries, wages and allowances, and there is an increase of £6,000.  I should like to know if that is to go to the badly paid <Col N="233" /> officials in the postal service.  I think it is a disgrace to the public service that many hard-working junior officials in the postal services should be under-paid. I would willingly support the voting of this £6,000 if it were given to these officials.  But, as was perhaps somewhat obliquely suggested by Deputy Brodrick, if it is to send one inspector after another to inspect a job in the West, the sooner it is stopped the better.</P>
      <P>In saying that, I think there has been an improvement in the postal service but there is a lot of room for still more improvement. I have been in trouble with the telephone service this past week but that was different from my experience over a long time and perhaps I should not mention it here.  I have heard people complain of the delays when they apply for the installation of a telephone.  The Minister should realise that in addition to administering the office he has certain commodities to sell.  The telephone is one of them.  If he wants to sell it, he should be as quick about effecting a sale as any shopkeeper in this city would be if an inquirer went in to order any commodity.  But I am afraid that the machinery of the Post Office is not quite so efficient as that. I had an acquaintance with the Engineering side of the Post Office over 30 years ago and I know the spirit that then animated the Engineering Department in London.  The Engineering Department we have here now is run by the man who was in the Chief Office in London 30 years ago, and I am sure if he gets the facilities he needs he will do the work quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope when replying the Minister will refer to what Deputy Brodrick said on the matter of second-hand wires. Sometimes it happens in the Post Office that wires are re-covered and put into stock&mdash;that is when they are fit for use again.  I would not criticise adversely the use of second-hand wires if those second-hand wires were fit to be used again.  If not fit it would be a terrible waste to instal them a second time, that is unless they had a fairly lengthy period of life before them.  There is an item here of £30,000 for stores.  Is that because of under-estimation or has it been caused by an increase in the cost <Col N="234" /> of stores consequent on the war scarcity?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in my business if I had enough money to buy in stores I would not be paying extra prices now for what I wanted.  Personally, I may have to do it, because though at the time I foresaw an increase in the price I did not have enough money at my command to buy in stocks to cover a year ahead.  But surely the Government is in a different position from the small business men. Was it not a very natural thing with the machinery at the Minister's command, to circularise with the usual official circular and specify the stores that would be required up to a reasonable date in the future?  Then, with that information, he could go into the market and buy.  For the last year the international situation looked awkward enough.  After Munich, war was on the horizon, and a good deal of stores had to go into the offices of the engineering department.  Was it not ordinary business prudence to anticipate the future at least in this last year?  I would not put it further than the end of the financial year.  That is what this additional Estimate is for&mdash;to finish this financial year.  I would like the Minister to explain why he did not have a survey taken of the stocks he had, and then get sufficient to carry him through so that he could buy before the market went up.  He is now asking the taxpayer to contribute £30,000, not for additional stores or additional work, but for the increase in the price of stores for which the Minister had already estimated for this year.  He could have got these stores at the old estimated price and saved this money now to the taxpayers.  On the general Estimate it would, perhaps, be more appropriate to talk about the services generally, particularly stamps and telegrams, and that kind of thing. I hope the Minister will talk about and help what so many are talking about off platforms&mdash;the ending of Partition. The Post Office can help at that by their postal service here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item here under the head of &ldquo;Provincial Offices,&rdquo; £2,620 which is required as an additional sum.  The details state that this is &ldquo;due in the main to additional outdoor and telephonist staff; extra overtime owing to unfilled vacancies; enhanced payments to scale payment sub-postmasters, mainly in respect of widows' pensions and unemployment orders.&rdquo;  We hear a good deal about under-paid workers in the postal service. It comes, I think, without challenge that the sub-postmasters in the service are certainly scandalously under-paid.  I have had complaints from people not only in my own constituency but in other parts of the country regarding the wages they receive. Hundreds of them are paid less than 10/- a week.  The sub-postmaster fulfills a very important function in the postal service, and he deserves something better than the wage meted out to him.  What portion of that £2,620 is being allotted to sub-postmasters?  I would like also to ask if the recruitment of the temporary staff in the Post Office has been solely through the labour exchange?  I have received complaints from Cork City that certain appointments have not been made through the employment exchanges, but that political reasons are being brought into play.  I would like to get from the Minister the assurance that the temporary staff will in future be recruited through the employment exchanges.  I should like to get from the Minister some assurance that the emoluments, pay and conditions of service of these people will have some consideration, because, I understand, they work very long hours.  When the main Estimate is brought forward, I hope that the Minister will elaborate a little more on this point, and that we shall have some definite announcement that that condition of affairs will be ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing that impressed me about the Engineering Department of the Post Office was the amount of foresight displayed by those concerned in the present situation.  They have <Col N="236" /> supplies of some commodities which will carry them on for two or three years.  They had laid in reserves of materials in connection with automatic telephones and cables.  They got these at the normal price and they spent about £90,000.  They could not foresee all the possibilities and a line had to be drawn by the Department somewhere as regards increase of expenditure over what had been estimated.  I think that those concerned did extremely well in having laid in a considerable amount of stores at normal prices.  They had to consider whether or not they would wait in the event of prices coming down.  The increase in the amount and price of clothing was due to unexpected supplies for the Army.  The question was whether it was better to buy at the time in case prices should rise further or wait in case prices would come down.  Nobody here can say whether or not prices will rise further.  I was greatly impressed by the extraordinary care taken in all these matters and by the judgment exercised.</P>
      <P>Anybody can find fault with the telegraph and telephone system, because there will always be a certain number of little mistakes and accidents.  If we were to comply with the demands of Deputy Norton and have a perfect system, we should have to spend twice as much money as we are spending at present.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me about the number of persons who went across to military service.  We have not a record of the number of officers who went on military service apart from those who went to other Departments. The total number within this category is considerable.  In order to economise as far as possible, we did not fill these positions.  These officers went to the Department of Supplies and the Department of Co-ordination while others went into military service. Instead of increasing the cost by filling the posts, the remaining officers have had to work harder and, at times, to work overtime.  That is the explanation of the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton attacked me fairly vigorously on the question of the dismissal of 36 men.  He contended that maintenance was in arrear, and mentioned <Col N="237" /> that telephones were in arrear to the number of 200.  That is, roughly, the normal number.  Demands for telephones come in at the rate of 70 per week, and three weeks is about the normal time for the installation of telephones. That would give the number 200.  So far as ordinary telephones are concerned, there is no delay.  With regard to the cable and underground telephones, what are required are jointers.  That is a skilled type of work, and we are short of that class of labour.  However, we are training men as rapidly as possible.  Those who were dismissed were unskilled labourers.  Some two years ago, owing to the increased demand for telephones, this staff was increased considerably by recruitment from the unskilled classes.  An attempt was made to train these men and to turn them into skilled men so far as that could be done.  It was only about May last that it was decided that work was decreasing and that we would have to drop a certain of men, having regard to the necessity for economy and to the fact that work was not available. They were getting back to what you might call &ldquo;normal development.&rdquo; And we had to drop the men who had proved least adaptable so far as the mastery of the skilled work was concerned. They delayed in doing that, making work, so far as possible, until September.  Between September and December, when we had a discussion about the matter, we decided that owing to lack of employment and the general position of uncertainty, we would do our best to keep the men until January.  I was very gratified that work was found to keep them on until January.  In January it became imperative to dispense with them, as no work was available.  We had to drop 36 men, and we may have to drop more, but I hope we shall not.  We are doing our best to carry on without decreasing our numbers.</P>
    <P>As to maintenance, I should like to mention that there is no justification for any suggestion that maintenance in the engineering plant of the Post Office is being neglected because of lack of men employed on the work.  The figures which I propose to give will be of interest.  In the financial year which <Col N="238" /> is just concluding, approximately £60,000 is being paid in wages for engineering and maintenance, as compared with £40,000 paid a few years ago.  The number of men engaged on maintenance work increased since September by approximately 15.  The great difficulty as regards maintenance of the engineering plant is to get the right type of man and to give him the necessary training to deal satisfactorily with the very varied and complex plant now in use&mdash;plant that calls for higher qualities in the maintenance staff than did the older type of plant which it displaced. I do not think it is wise for Deputy Norton to suggest that we are not trying to do the best we can from the point of view of employing the most people we can, because some evilminded employers will get hold of his misrepresentations and make them an excuse for doing something entirely contrary to the present public policy.  I think he knows that we are genuinely interested in dealing with the unemployment problem, and that, having regard to the engineering necessities and the public finance, we have done the very best we can.</P>
    <P>As regards the conveyance of mails, what happened in that case was that we reduced our rates on parcels travelling by railway.  On 1st July, 1936, the rates of postage on parcels within Éire were reduced, and those for places in Great Britain and Northern Ireland remained unchanged.  The reduction of the rates adversely affected the remuneration of the railway companies, who were paid for the carriage of parcels on the basis of 40 per cent. of the postage.  The companies approached the Department for an increase to 45 per cent. as from 1st July, 1936, and for a further increase as from 1st January, 1938, from which date the Railway Tribunal had authorised the addition of 5 per cent. to the charges on all traffic conveyed by rail.  As a result of negotiations, a settlement on the following basis was arrived at, and was approved by the Department of Finance on the 11th March, 1939: The companies' claims both in respect of reduction of postage rates and of the addition to the railway rates authorised by the Railway <Col N="239" /> Tribunal, were merged and modified.</P>
    <P>The modification provided that the companies be guaranteed the remuneration they received during the year ended 31st December, 1935, so long as the rail-borne parcels post traffic actually carried, calculated at the postage rates in force in the year 1936, justifies such payment.  The arrangement will remain in force until January, 1942, or, if such happens earlier, until 40 per cent. of the postage on rail-borne parcels at the new rates of postage produces the guaranteed figure.  The total amount was £7,320, and that covered all the internal and inter-State and foreign rail-borne parcels.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Brodrick's remarks about the Athenry wires over a high house, I have no knowledge of this, and I can only have inquiries made into it. He refers also to the use of second-hand wires.  Of course, there are times when these wires are quite good.  The engineers are the best judges as to the life of wires, and when they are taken down in one place they may be quite all right for use in another place.  If we are to go in for a very extravagant system of supply, we can waste the taxpayers' money and throw away a good deal of very valuable material.  The fact that wires have been used before is no reason, having regard to expert opinion on them, why they should not be used again.</P>
    <P>As regards the sub-postmasters not being sufficiently paid, the sum set out in the Estimate is due to not having anticipated the number of widows' and orphans pensions.  They are paid for the number of transactions per unit.  The sub-postmasters are in the position of part-time officers.  It should not be supposed that they are being paid a full-time salary for their work.  If I may judge from my short experience of the number of demands and the energy with which the demands are made by people in the country to become sub-postmasters, I do not think that they believe they are getting a starvation salary.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that there was a greater sum of money <Col N="240" /> being spent on maintenance.  He must know that the telephone department is extending.  The number of calls last year was substantially higher than the number two, three or four years ago. Calls have multiplied enormously, and installations have multiplied enormously, and that necessarily carries increased maintenance.  My point was that the maintenance work carried on was not nearly adequate to the requirements of the service.  I said they were sub-normal, having regard to the extent of the service.  I mentioned that there were 200 applications on hands for telephones, and the Minister said that was a normal aggregation for three weeks' demands.  Does he suggest that there are applications on hands for no longer than three weeks?</P>

At Clones, in the adjoining county of Monaghan, they have a night telephone.  Cavan is a county town and an assize town and I think it should have equal amenities in this respect.  I wish the Minister would agree to giving us a longer <Col N="241" /> service; better facilities in regard to the telephone during the night hours. We have heard of the large number of telephone installed.  Surely if all those have been or are being installed the Post Office could well afford to give us an extension of time in Cavan?  The telephone is closed down at eight o'clock at night.  That is scarcely fair in the case of a large town like Cavan.</P>

      <P>On the section, I would like to have an explanation from the Minister with regard to the wording of sub-section (2).  It says: &ldquo;Whenever the council of a county has sold or shall sell under this Act any goods to any person&rdquo; etc.  These words would seem to suggest that a county council should carry on trading as it were. Does the Minister think it advisable for a county council to do that?  I know it would not be trading in the ordinary way, but I imagine that it is something a county council would not care to undertake, especially as there has been no response to measures of this kind in the last few years.  The demand for them is diminishing.  Would it not be better for the county council to keep out of trade and adopt some kind of loan system?  I would be glad to know if the Minister has any bias for this form of dealing, and if he prefers it to loans.  One could read into the section that it would be permissible for a county council to meet these cases by a system of loans.</P>

      <P>There is no intention of asking county councils or other <Col N="243" /> public bodies to take on the position of dealers.  This Bill is intended to enable small farmers, or big farmers either, who are not able to get credit, to procure seeds.  Under it they will be enabled to get supplies, arrangements for that purpose being made between the local traders and the county councils.  The county councils will afterwards collect the sums due for seeds supplied.  If there was anything in this Bill, on the lines Deputy Belton seemed to suggest, that there was going to be a big scheme and that you were to throw money out all over the place, then I would say it is not the county councils who should deal with that at all.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) speaks of the rate of interest that shall be paid by the person supplied with seeds.  It says that the sum payable shall carry interest at such rate per cent. per annum as may be fixed in that behalf by the county council.  Is there not a danger in the sub-section as it is worded?  Would it not be better to say that the rate of interest shall not exceed a certain figure?  The sub-section as worded might lead to an awkward situation in this way, that one county council would fix a lower rate of interest and that a neighbouring county council, due perhaps to its financial position, might have to fix a very much higher rate.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply to the point raised by Deputy Belton amazes me.  I would be glad to think that the Minister was right.  I raised this point myself on the Second Reading of the Bill.  The Minister, on Section 1, referred to the legal interpretations put on certain words.  I wonder would he enlighten the House as to the legal interpretation that might be put on these words in Section 2: &ldquo;Whenever the Council of a county has sold or shall sell.&rdquo; Surely these words suggest ordinary trading.  Perhaps there may be some other interpretation of them but I <Col N="244" /> cannot see it.  So far county councils have not undertaken trading of that kind.  I think they would be very foolish to do it.  First of all they have not the experience, and their officers have not been trained to go out to buy and sell.  If there is any interpretation that can be put on these words other than that put on them by Deputy Belton, then I would be very glad to hear it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it would be very invidious if a county council had to take up the position of going into trade, if you like to put it that way, and that it would be equally invidious for the Minister, under this measure to give county councils power to do that. As a county councillor I do not think they should have that power.  Would it not be better, instead of what is proposed in this Bill, if permission were given to those people who want seeds and manures to go to the local trader and make the best terms they can with him on a cash basis for their requirements, and following that that the county council should make a loan to them, taking steps first of all to safeguard the money so advanced?  The money should be paid to the merchants and not to the applicants for seeds, but it should be treated as a loan to the applicant concerned.  As Deputy Brennan and Deputy Linehan have pointed out, I think it is a dangerous expedient to adopt to give power to county councils to go into trade.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to my suggestion.</P>
      <P>I did not quite follow what Deputy Linehan said about the rate of interest. I agree with the Minister's views there, that the rate of interest chargeable by county councils will be dictated by the terms on which they can borrow money, and then charge a margin to safeguard the councils from being at any loss, either from bad debts or the expense of administration.</P>

      <P>It may not say that in the opinion of lawyers, but it should be made say it.  A prudent county council will administer the Act on the lines I suggest.  The Minister said he thought I conceived a big scheme under this Bill.  I do, and I see nothing within the four corners of it to limit that big scheme, unless the Minister, under his statutory powers, decides not to give the terms for an overdraft of £X.  The Minister will probably have requisitions for an overdraft, starting with £50,000 by Dublin County Council, to finance this Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister will not permit accommodation to that extent to Dublin County Council, that is the end of it.  I can tell him that he will get that request, and I do not see anything in the Bill to preclude the Dublin or other county councils advancing money in order to give accommodation required by farmers for seeds and manures.  Under this sub-section the powers of councils are circumscribed. If they have extensive powers, then it is up to the Minister to see that these powers are not abused in such a way as to cause financial embarrassment if the members of some councils use them foolishly.</P>

      <P>The amount to be paid or loaned by the council in respect of seeds and fertilisers supplied to an occupier of land, in pursuance of this Act, shall be a charge, and take priority as a charge on all the estate and interest in the said lands of the person to whom such amount shall be paid, before all other charges and incumbrances whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be understood that I am moving this amendment in violation of a big principle, and I would not do so if times were normal.  As times are abnormal, we want to get all suitable land under production.  There is a considerable number of farms encumbered, the owners of which are subject to mortgages and debts, and have no capital. They cannot let the land to others to work, because the creditors would seize any stock put on it to graze or any crops grown on it.  As matters stand at present, these farms will remain idle.  A country that wants to increase the production of food for man <Col N="248" /> and beast cannot afford to allow good land to lie idle.  I should like to see every bit of land put into production with the aid of this Bill.  Take the position on a farm in County Dublin in my constituency.  It cannot be worked for the reasons mentioned.  The county council expects rates from that farm, but cannot get them.  I suggest that under this Bill they should be empowered to lend money which would permit that land to be worked.  Therefore, we should protect money put into land in times of emergency, so that it would be paid back and that no other claim would take priority over it.  That will put the land into production.  No other means will put it into production. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot, because the council is fully protected as far as I can see.  If they do not collect the debt, they can assess it in the rates and get in that way.  The Deputy knows that there are a lot of mortgages from time to time on places, and it would be unfair to come in with this sort of thing and get priority over them.  You have the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the banks, and a number of others with mortgages, and I think it would be unfair to take priority for this, because the county council have ample power to recover it. If they do not recover it in the ordinary way, they can assess it in the person's rates.  I do not see that there is much danger in practice, as there have been practically no losses on these schemes in the last eight years.  I agree that they were adopted in a rather small way, and that about £6,000 a year is usually spent on them.  There were, I think, some small losses in Kerry, but when the thing is finally disposed of I do not think there will be any losses. I do not think the Deputy need be afraid to follow the lines adopted by councils in the past, as I do not think there is any danger of bad debts.</P>

If the banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, traders, or anybody else have a charge on these lands, are they not shouldered about once power is given to collect this loan by means of the poor rate?

We are given power under the Bill to get inside any bank debt, any Agricultural Credit Corporation debt, and any Land Commission debt&mdash;in fact, any debt.  That is precisely what I am asking, only that it would not be stigmatised as a poor rate or as a dole for paupers.

I understand that no one else can take <Col N="250" /> another person's property off the land except the Land Commission or the local authority for the payment of rates.</P>
      <P>It has been the usual practice in the past to require securities from people who want loans from the county councils.  Nowadays, owing to the difficulty of getting people to pay, sureties are very backward in coming to sign a bill.  If the people have to get sureties to guarantee the county council, I am afraid a lot of people will be left out, because you cannot get people now to secure one another in the way they did formerly.</P>
      <P>Of course the Minister said that it would be unfair to allow charges of this description to have a priority over other charges.  I agree with him to some extent in that, but the charges in this case will be very small; probably £5 will be the average one.  A sum of £5 being in advance of some other charge will not signify very much.  If the charge were in the region of £50 or £100, I could understand the Minister's argument.</P>
      <P>But when it is only a matter of £5 or £7 at the most; I do not think that it would interfere very much with prior charges.  On the other hand, as the Minister said, if the council cannot collect the money, they can recover it in the rates.  I do not know that the people who are in the habit of paying their rates want to be burdened with other people's debts.  We generally find it hard enough to pay our own rates without having additional rates piled on to us, as is done by the Land Commission for unpaid annuities.  The amendment is a reasonable one and I ask the Minister to give it consideration.</P>

      <P>I think that if the Minister does not agree to accept some form of protection like this it is going to paralyse to some extent the good effects of the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that this should be a first charge on the produce of the crop. There is this much to be said for it. If there are other mortgages, the people who made those mortgages made them for the purpose of gain or profit.  The local authorities in this <Col N="251" /> case have no financial interest in it beyond collecting the money.  There is no question of gain for them.</P>
      <P>It is more or less for a charitable purpose that local authorities are asked to extend financial aid to these people. It is quite possible that the very crop, the production of which the local authority has financed, will be scooped by someone with a mortgage on the very day that the man is threshing the crop.  He may possibly leave no goods on which the local authority could collect the loan.  The Minister ought to consider carefully that aspect of the case, and make it a first charge on the produce of the crop.  That would not be unreasonable, and it would be very necessary in order to encourage the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been a slight misunderstanding between the Minister and Deputy Belton.  At least, my interpretation of Deputy Belton's amendment is that it is not an attempt to safeguard the local authorities so much as an attempt to get more production. As the Minister said, the local authority is well safeguarded as far as the local authority itself is concerned. It appears to me that what Deputy Belton wants is that a man will be induced to produce a crop, knowing that that produce will be safe for the person who lent the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that it is a very delicate matter to infringe on priority rights and charges, and there are difficulties there.  But there is a great deal to be said from this point of view: that you may have a person who lent Mr. X £10 or £50 and he refuses to lend him any more, and Mr. Z comes along and says: &ldquo;I will lend him £50 or £60 to produce something, provided I am secured and the other fellow does not get what my money produces.&rdquo;  Is there any way we can get over that? I can see Deputy Belton's point that there are plenty of people in the country on whom the banks or other people have a bold.  Apart from the county council security altogether they are afraid to go into production because they feel it would not be safe to go to the county council and take a <Col N="252" /> guarantee from the county council, knowing full well that somebody is going to come down on them at the threshing.  It seems that there is an obvious case made for Deputy Belton's amendment.  Perhaps it cannot be done; but if it could be done I would say it would be beneficial and would assist in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is somewhat mistaken in his statement that there were no losses in the previous schemes.  I am aware that in the County Wicklow there was in 1933-34 a loss of at least £800 on these schemes.  As a result there is a reluctance on the part of county councils to enter on a new scheme.  They consider it would be unjust to impose on the ratepayers such an additional liability. Therefore there is need for something in the nature of the amendment suggested by Deputy Belton.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment as it stands he should at least be prepared to allow those loans to have priority over the banks and Land Commission charges.  The banks have big resources and they could afford to wait a short time.</P>

      <P>There is another matter also in connection with this amendment. In the Act of 1933 the Minister undertakes to recoup the county councils to the extent of 50 per cent. of their losses.  I think there is no provision to that effect in this Bill.  I suppose it would be impossible to include such a provision now, but the Minister might promise to introduce other legislation to make such a provision. Otherwise I am afraid the county councils will not be inclined to take the risk of putting a liability on the ratepayers without adequate protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a way out on the lines Deputy Hughes has suggested.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to put the councils in a position to give money to people who otherwise would not be creditworthy because of the encumbrances on their lands.  I do not agree in full with Deputy Belton's <Col N="253" /> amendment.  Once you put this thing on the poor rate you are hitting at everything except the Land Commission annuities.  If you made it a first charge on a man's land and postponed the other charges, you may find that you would have everything postponed, and matters may be worse.  When the money was given, there would be the fear that the stock or produce would be seized by another creditor such as a bank.  It might be possible for something on the lines of a chattel mortgage to be entered into by the borrower.  I do not see why the Minister should object to some precaution of that sort in order to give people who are not creditworthy a chance of getting the advantage of this scheme.  I would say that the county council would feel justified in refusing in the case of a man whom they know was stuck with the bank and with others.  They would be afraid that there would be very little hope of recovering in the future even if the unpaid money was put on the poor rate, because the Land Commission might come down and get in ahead of them.  We have been talking about people who are definitely not creditworthy. The necessity for this Bill would not arise if the whole of the agricultural community were creditworthy. You have three sections of people at present.  You have first the section who still have some money left and are creditworthy; the second section are those people who are on the verge, just able to get credit from month to month; and there is the third section who are regarded by everybody as not creditworthy.  These are the people I am sure county councils will not consider creditworthy.  However, I do not like the amendment any more than I like the section.</P>

      <P>The Minister should appreciate this fact: that it would be impossible to get the same level of administration by the various county councils throughout the country.  There will be county councils who will have a very conservative outlook.  It is up to the Minister to hold out encouragement and give to the county council the reduced risk involved in the amendment. This amendment is the only means of doing that that I can see.</P>

      <P>I would wish to impress on the Minister the view we have taken on this.  A request by the Minister was expressed in a circular sent to the county councils.  I would like Deputy Linehan to listen to this. That circular was very specific on the point that this Bill was intended to provide the means for farmers, landowners or those working land who were not able to finance themselves with seeds and manures out of their own resources.  This Bill is primarily intended for farmers who are not creditworthy and whose lands are encumbered. That is a difficult problem. The question to be considered is the proposed advance of money to them. When you want sureties, and a whole paraphernalia of guarantees, you will not get them and, if you do, they may be no good because the man who is guaranteeing the borrower may be as poor as the borrower himself.  If Deputy Hughes were a pauper and I were a pauper, what would be the use of our guaranteeing each other?  Let us get rid of that nonsense, come down to business and secure the money in the way I have suggested.  The only difference between the Minister's proposal and my amendment is that he states the Land Commission annuity takes priority over the poor rate.</P>

      <P>It comes before Agricultural Credit Corporation debts, bank debts, or private debts.  We are asking nothing in this amendment that is not in the Bill.  We want only to put it in more concise form, so that there will be no delay in lending the money. In the last analysis, we would have the poor rate machinery for collecting If necessary, I would have a very summary way of collecting this money. It should be automatic and no option should be left to the county councils with regard to time or anything else. Take it entirely out of their hands once they consent to give the loan.  Adopt machinery similar to that which the Land Commission use for the collection of annuities.  We are pledging the credit of the county to help people to <Col N="255" /> get into production and, consequently, the credit of the county should not be permitted to suffer.  You can include the chattel mortgage in the amendment, if you like, but that will involve cumbersome machinery.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position.  At a later stage, if we have a conference, we might get more closely together in considering this matter than we can do now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the county councils can enter into this question of mortgages.  If the amendment be adopted, a mortgage will have to be registered against the land.  As to priority, it will depend on the time of registration.  That will mean that the county councils will have to sell out these farms if they cannot recover their debts otherwise.  That is a long and tedious procedure.  I think that Deputy Hughes and Deputy Linehan had in mind a chattel mortgage or a charge on produce.</P>
      <P>How could you have rate collectors or officials going around to see whether a crop is growing on land or whether it has been disposed of?  Is it not much better that you should have it in the rates, so that the rate collector can go in and distrain?  That is a more speedy method than the method suggested. This is not a scheme to deal with the position in a big way.  If it were, the Department of Agriculture would be responsible for it.</P>

      <P>If he did not do that, he would not be doing his duty by me as his client.  You need not register the charge.  The fact of this measure being passed has the effect of registering the charge automatically.  Anybody transferring <Col N="256" /> land would, therefore, put in a requisition as regards loans under this Act.  I see the difficulty, the trouble and expense regarding a chattel mortgage. Under this amendment the money would be secured and no guarantors would be required.  Speaking as a farmer and owner of land, I say we must, in times of emergency, whether we like it or not, put our land into production.  In France the Government have taken up the land and said that it must be used as they say.</P>
      <P>If the youth of the country are put into the trenches to defend it, the man on the land should produce food for those in the trenches.  We shall be up against this problem in the coming year.  We want to provide for ourselves and we want to be able to maintain our live stock and we should, therefore, put all our arable land into production.  It would be a terrible thing if we allowed any land to lie fallow simply because of debts registered here and there.  Our whole existence and our food supply depend on what we produce for ourselves.  I asked the Minister to facilitate the councils in this matter.  Surely the machinery of local government will be a sufficient check on any spendthrift council.  If he cannot accept the amendment, I ask him not to reject the principle entirely until we have a talk about it.  I am sure he is open to conviction and is as anxious to put land into production as anybody else. It is only a question of ways and means, and I ask him not to commit himself to complete rejection of this proposal before the final passage of the Bill.</P>

If you had this made a first charge on the produce of the farm, if the produce were collected for such a debt and a return of &ldquo;no goods&rdquo; were made to the county council decree, where would that body be?  There is no hope whatever of collecting it.  I think the Minister might consider this suggestion, think it over carefully, and make his decision at a later stage.</P>

The Minister should give some assurance that he will reconsider the position with the object of safeguarding the interests of the county councils; otherwise, there will be no loans, and the scheme will not be put into operation in a good many counties.

The terms laid down by the Local Government Department are of no use to the ordinary farmer.  He cannot get a loan from the bank on the security of his holding.  The one thing the county councils want to be assured on is that they can continue to collect the loans they give in the same way as they collect the rates.  I have no hesitation in saying that that should be so. It would benefit the whole community, and especially the small farmers, if they could get loans without security, and if the collections were made in the same way as the Land Commission annuities or the rates are collected. Those loans should be a first mortgage upon the people who get them.</P>

I can assure him that if that is necessary the thing is as dead a letter as it was last year, when only £6,000 operated throughout the whole of Éire.  No more will operate this year if that position prevails, and <Col N="258" /> it is a pity that simple and safe machinery should not be set up, so that county councils could give the necessary loans.</P>
      <P>I quite appreciate what the Minister said, that if this was intended to be a big scheme for financing agriculture, somebody else should do it&mdash;that it was the work of another Department. I have been written to, since this Bill got a Second Reading, by farmers all over the country, saying they were assured by the Minister for Agriculture that a loan scheme was coming.  There is no loan scheme that I am aware of for any purpose, except about £3,000 for agricultural implements.  To help agriculture to get on its feet, and to help production this year, there is no scheme, and it is too late for any scheme now.</P>
      <P>This could be fashioned into a good scheme if the Minister would only meet us.  If this is not the best way, perhaps we could get a better method that would enable councils who can get the money to do some helpful work. The council for which I can speak can get it and lend it at 5 per cent.  That is good enough for anybody.  They could extend perhaps to £100,000 and that would be ample to meet all the requirements of the county.  We want that done without any question of guarantors.  We want it done by simple and safe machinery.  We do not want the credit of the county to suffer and we do not want bad debts.  We want simple and safe machinery, and that can be obtained under this Bill if only the Minister will meet us.</P>

      <P>On the section, I raised a point the last day, and perhaps it is my fault, but I still seem to be very much at sea about this matter.  In sub-section 2, and also in sub-section 3, there is set out a certain approved way in which the borrowers shall pay to those from whom they borrow the money.  That is, the councils shall pay to their treasurer the moneys they have borrowed for this purpose and they shall pay it back in a certain specified time.  Suppose it goes over that period of time that is given for payment, are they liable&mdash;will they have to pay at all?  I am going to raise the point that I raised before, and I think it requires some clarification.  According to Section 4, provision is made for the incorporation of a debt in the rate.  I take it the ordinary procedure will be that the county council guarantees a debt to X and they treat it as an ordinary debt for a year and he does not pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then they treat it as a rate for the next year, and he does not pay.  Suppose you meet several cases of that kind, what is going to happen?  Your two years are up, and you come to the end of the 31st March in, say, 1942. You are supposed then to have paid <Col N="261" /> back to the treasurer the money that you have borrowed, but in fact you have not yet collected it, and you have not yet reached the position in which you can put it on the ordinary ratepayer, because in the first year you treated it as a debt, and in the second year as rates on the individual.  He has not yet paid and your estimate is going through for the coming year. You have not included in the estimate any charge for that to make up the deficit.  In that situation, where is the county council going to find the money to pay back to the treasurer? It seems to me that the least you ought to do is to make the period three years, because at present two years are wasted.  In the first year the money is treated as an ordinary debt, and in the second year as rates which had not been collected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years seem rather short when considered in that way.  In the case of small debts of this sort it is considered inadvisable to allow people to defer making repayment for longer than two years.  If at the end of the two years the county council finds that there are defaulters the secretary will make provision for whatever deficit there is in his estimate. He will prepare his estimate on that basis.  If the money comes in in the meantime, it will go to the credit of the funds of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the Minister does realise the difficulty.  If the period is made three years that will not offer any inducement to people who owe a debt to keep the money out. The Minister spoke about the secretary to the county council making provision for any deficit there is in his estimate. He cannot do that because he will not know what the deficit is until the 31st March.  He will not know at the time he is preparing the yearly estimate of income and expenditure.  Suppose the county council lends £30,000.  If £10,000 are outstanding and if the county council must have that money paid back on the 1st March they cannot find out what their liabilities <Col N="262" /> are until the 31st March.  My suggestion is that this be changed to three years.  It is not going to make any difference except to get the county council out of an awkward situation.</P>

In regard to this, as in other matters, he must take a round figure if it is likely that there is going to be a deficit.  If, however, in the meantime money comes in it will go to the credit of the fund of the council.  The objection to the proposal to extend the period is that it is thought that it would encourage people to put the payment of these small amounts on the long finger, so to speak.</P>

      <P>The people who get the advances are not affected by this at all.  This is a matter between the county council and the treasurer.  As the Minister has said, the secretary of the county council is generally a good judge of the amount he is going to be short at the end of the year.  This is a new matter, in which rates are coming in for the first time in this way.  He does not know what his losses are going to be and the rate collectors cannot tell him, because they have not yet closed their collection.  In the middle of February, when the estimate of rates is made the rate collectors are only half way through the second moiety of their collection.  In reply to Deputy Belton, I do not think that what I have suggested would interfere with the rate of interest charged.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, lines 18 and 19, to delete the words &ldquo;or the borough of Dun Laoghaire.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should point out that there is a large number of other amendments relating to this one.  This is the only one bearing on others relating to the same thing, that is, the unification of Dublin City and County.  These are amendments Nos. 1, 3, 9, 33, 36, 39, 47, 58, 60, 62, 63, 87, 89 and 90.  When the Bill was introduced and got a Second Reading it was not proposed at that time to amalgamate the administration of Dublin City and County.  The Tribunal for Greater Dublin reported recently and made certain recommendations. These recommendations envisaged something like a metropolitan county; that certain services in Dublin City and County would be administered by that county, that certain urban services would also be administered in that way and that in rural areas in Dublin County these services would be administered by what was called a public sanitary authority.  I do not think this is a suitable time to put into operation the proposals in that report.  In any event there has not been sufficient time to examine fully the implications of that report. But it has occurred to my Department that we might provide the machinery there, so that if and when a time came, which was considered to be a suitable time, we would have the machinery.  What is proposed in the amendment is administratively to provide that machinery.  It is proposed to make the Dublin City Manager also a manager for the county.  It is proposed to have two assistant managers, that the present manager in Dun Laoghaire should become assistant city manager and assistant county manager, and that the secretary of the county council if considered a suitable person, as prescribed in the Act, would become an assistant county and assistant city manager, the two being under the control and direction of the Dublin City Manager.</P>

      <P>Dublin City and County Manager.  So far as the bodies are concerned you will have Dublin County Council and the bodies associated with it and Dublin Corporation remaining separate units.  This came to mind in a certain way when some complaint was made about the provision of school meals.  If we had school meals in Crumlin where, I understand, the school itself is just outside the city boundary, whereas the children attending it are inside it, this indicates that in such cases a provisional order might be made taking certain areas into the city.  I do not know whether the principles commend themselves to the House but they commended themselves to my Department in this way, that we have seen the recommendations of the Greater Dublin Tribunal, and whether they are adopted in whole or in part you will have machinery provided that will be necessary to put them into operation if such proposals receive the assent of the Dáil or Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow the meaning of the Minister's proposal. We had a Greater Dublin Tribunal a couple of years ago and the report has been on the shelf for some time.  I presume when that commission was called together it was the intention to have its findings submitted to some authority to decide how much, if any, of them would be adopted and, I presume, that authority would be the Oireachtas.  That has not been done. The Minister now proposes to get this House to adopt machinery for the administration of a body that he has not yet got the authority of this House to establish.  Is not that the position? Conceivably this House could grant this administrative machinery for which the Minister asks and could afterwards say: &ldquo;We will have nothing to do with the Greater Dublin report.  Let things stay as they are.&rdquo;  The first thing that should have been done was to put to this House proposals based on the Greater Dublin report, to see how far the House would give its sanction to them and then to devise machinery.  The position at the present time is a very funny one to anyone who knows how administration is carried on.  The borough manager of Dun Laoghaire is specifically mentioned <Col N="268" /> as assistant manager, while the secretary of Dublin County Council is more or less casually mentioned.  He will go with the joint body but, instead of becoming manager of County Dublin, he will become, other things being satisfactory, assistant manager for Dublin City and County.  I take it that by virtue of the other name being mentioned, he will be junior to the manager in Dun Laoghaire.  He will be manager of the county, which in present circumstances is a senior body to Dun Laoghaire Borough Council, because, as the Minister knows, some services in Dun Laoghaire Borough are subordinate to Dublin County Council, and pay rates to the county council.</P>
      <P>The report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal and how far it is going to be adopted should be considered first before we set up the machinery.  The Minister is aware that every administrative officer in the Dublin City Hall gave evidence before that tribunal against including any more undeveloped places in the city because of the difficulty of administration.  I think that that should have been gone into in this House on a different proposal from the one we have before us before we decide on setting up the machinery.  We should know what is to be the unit and how the administration is to be carried out there.  For instance, how will the city manager be fixed if he gets an application for water and sewerage for Garristown, one of the most rural parts in Ireland? Would he be compelled to give it or how would he stand in the matter? How can a man administer an office from the City Hall that will settle a question of water and sewerage for Garristown or Bohernabreena?</P>
      <P>I think it is a monstrous proposal to ask for machinery for an administrative unit that you have not decided on yet.  This House has to decide what will be the administrative unit for Dublin City and County.  We have not decided that yet.  There is not a word about deciding it in this Bill. We are asked to provide machinery for administering a unit we have not yet defined.  I suggest that we should first have a Bill defining the unit, or let us have the whole lot in one Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a point for this amendment with regard to the school meals in Crumlin where the school is in the county and the children attending it live in the city. How will this arrangement help to get over that difficulty?  Suppose the new Dublin County Council refuses to strike a rate for school meals.  I take it they will have power either to strike a rate or to refuse to strike a rate. How will the dual position affect that? I cannot see how it will, unless some provisional order is brought in and they are empowered to assume something that is not in this Bill.  The Minister, as a reason for the two positions being held by the one man, made the point that things like that would be made easy.  I should like the Minister to explain how that can be made easy.  So far as I am aware, the striking of a rate will be the function of the county council and the city manager, acting as county manager, cannot coerce the county council if they do not want to do it. Is there any inherent authority in his position that will get over that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an extraordinary proposal and, like Deputy Belton, I am of the opinion that this is not the appropriate time to do it. Like Deputy Belton, I consider that the report of that tribunal should be debated by this House and the limits &mdash;whatever they are going to be&mdash; defined by this House.  In answer to a question, the Minister stated that Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin and the City of Dublin are to be three separate units.  I should like to know to what extent they are to be three separate units.  We are to have as manager the present city manager who is to be the city and county manager.  It appears to me to be very peculiar that &ldquo;city manager&rdquo; should be mentioned before &ldquo;county manager&rdquo;.  Is the county to be subordinate to the city? It would appear from the title that the county is to be subordinate to the city. Then there is to be an assistant manager in Dun Laoghaire, which shows conclusively that the Borough of Dun Laoghaire is to be treated as subordinate to the county, or is it to <Col N="270" /> be subordinate to the City of Dublin? Is he to be assistant manager to the extent that he is assistant to the city manager and that the Borough of Dun Laoghaire is to be subject to the city manager eventually?</P>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to withdraw the amendment.  Surely people have a right to consider the findings of that tribunal, and surely the Minister has no right to visualise what is going to happen, because he has not the slightest notion at this stage of what is going to happen.  There are a number of amendments involved in this matter which the Minister has recounted to the House, and it is very hard for us to follow those amendments and their implications at this stage.  For that reason I ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment.  If, after due consideration of the findings of the tribunal, it is found that this is the most suitable way to deal with the situation, I think that would be the proper time to bring in an amendment of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">

      <P>I understood from the Minister that there was to be one chief executive officer who would be responsible for the whole work of Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin and Dublin City; that he would be the executive authority and that the other two appointments will be made to enable those who are already in jobs to keep their appointments; that the city manager would be the executive authority and that the others would be appointed under him.  The objection I have to the amendment is that the Minister brings in those other two men. I have no objection to the Minister's point of view in this matter otherwise, because I feel that Dublin is a fairly compact unit, not like other areas in the country.  I am not for or against the amendment, but I object to that part of it making the manager in Dun Laoghaire and the secretary of the county council assistant managers.  I think that is done so that he can appoint those people.  I should like the Minister to explain if that is the reason for the amendment.  Why make those two people as assistant managers? <Col N="271" /> Why should not somebody else be appointed?</P>

      <P>The objectionable feature of this, so far as I am concerned, and I think most members of the Dublin Corporation will agree with me, is that it extends the scope of the city manager's activities to the county as well as the city.  At the moment the city manager has come up in the City of Dublin against the first major crisis during his term of office, and he has quite clearly demonstrated that he is not prepared to face that responsibility. The position now is that a committee of the corporation, which has no right or functions or power, according to the Local Government (Amendment) Act, 1930, is dealing with this situation because of the failure or the unwillingness of the manager to cope with the situation.</P>

      <P>What is the argument in favour of the Minister's proposal&mdash;that he is now providing for what may happen in the future&mdash; whether it is a wise thing to put on the shoulders of one man two positions, one the management of the City of Dublin and the other of the County Council of Dublin?  That is, to ask the same man to take on the management of the County of Dublin, one of the richest counties, small as it is, in the country.</P>

The Minister may reply that he will have two able helpers, two assistant city managers; that the secretary to the county council will be at least one of the city managers.  He will have a secretary anyway.  That will to a certain extent come to the same thing.  He will not be called an assistant manager, but that is what he will be.</P>

What difficulties will confront the Minister when dealing with the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal?  I am personally at sea about it.

      <P>Before the Minister answers that question and as I was not here when he made the statement, and can only judge from some of the facts as presented in the discussion that has taken place, I just want to ask one question.  Is the purpose of the amendment the provision of assistant managers and county managers or is the proposal one in which it is hoped <Col N="275" /> ultimately to harmonise the local government of the borough of Dun Laoghaire, the Dublin County Council and the Dublin Corporation?  The three are separate institutions at the moment.  Both of the two smaller bodies, that is the Dublin County Council and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, may think that the proposal is one which will operate against them. They have now two officials who are, presumably, well acquainted with the work they are doing.  They will be removed from that work and a city manager, who has not experience of the services in the county, will be called upon suddenly to take up that sphere of activity.  Apart altogether from these three areas being distinct local government entities, the county is in a relatively weak position compared with what it was 15 or 20 years ago.  Large and rather wealthy sections of it have been lopped off and there is a gradual spread out of the city.  County expenses have increased very considerably and the services rendered in the county have not kept pace with the increased expenditure.  I am not criticising the administration.  I am merely pointing out that the potentiality of the county as a ratepaying area is not as great as it was 20 years ago.  It was probably the wealthiest county council at one time.  It is probably now one of the poorest county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal would appear to be a good administrative proposal.  I speak purely from the theoretically administrative point of view.  I am not considering the matter from the point of view of the advantage which the county or borough is going to derive from this change.  Would the Minister give the House some indication of his view on this matter and would he state further whether this proposal will be left to the House or whether it will be a Party decision?  A matter such as this, I think, should be left to the House.  If the proposal be one by which it is hoped to harmonise the three bodies, is it further intended that other services rendered separately in each one of these areas will also be centralised? Consider the cases of the medical officer of health, the county surveyor, <Col N="276" /> the borough surveyor and the various other administrative units which go to make up the body.  Is it only intended to carry out this proposal in respect of the manager?  Will the manager have power in his new position to move towards gradual amalgamation of these other units?  I see some difficulties in the matter which the Minister, on further examination of the peculiarities of the county and city, will also perceive. It may be that an excellent case can be made for it but, in the change, I see the probability of a very considerable increase in cost.  If the Minister has the information, I should like him to describe his ultimate aim apart from the immediate setting up of city and county managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer Deputies to the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal.  That report was laid on the Table of the House some time ago.  These proposals are far-reaching, and I do not think that the present time is a suitable time for putting them into effective operation.  A considerable time may elapse before that can be done, with the approval of the Oireachtas.  We have to move about July to set up some other tribunal because ten years have expired since 1930.  It would seem to be ridiculous to set up another tribunal when we have not had the report of the last tribunal fully examined.  I do not say that that argument carries much weight, but No. 6a of the recommendations of the last tribunal reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The metropolitan corporation should consist of a metropolitan council elected on the principles of the Act of 1930, with the necessary adaptations to give effect to the modifications set out below, and a metropolitan manager with the same tenure as the city manager under the Act of 1930.  The council and manager should have for the metropolitan borough the same respective functions and powers as the council and manager have for the county borough under the Act of 1930, subject to the adaptations necessary to give effect to this scheme.  The first manager should be appointed by the constituent statute.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> That report envisaged a metropolitan council which would administer certain common services for the entire city and county and special urban services within the area designated.  The remainder of the county&mdash;the really rural areas where conditions are different and rates might have to alter &mdash;would be administered by what they describe as &ldquo;public sanitary authorities&rdquo;, dealing with certain services outside those for the urbanised or metropolitan area.  A great deal of good can come by having these posts amalgamated and a liaison effected. I understand that difficulties have arisen from time to time about fire brigades and a number of other things. If you had the same manager for city and county it would make for harmony and would be of advantage to both areas.  In this Bill, we are grouping councils.  We are appointing one manager for two counties.  Taking the matter on that basis, I think it would be an advantage.  Certainly the other matter is at the back of our minds&mdash; how we can move towards the amalgamation of the city and county.  I know there are difficulties.  Perhaps I do not fully appreciate them.  Nevertheless, considerable good can come from having the same manager for the two areas and, eventually, I think it will be found that it will be better to have the city and county amalgamated.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that there was a case in respect of appointing the manager of two counties.  There may be a case in the Bill, but it has not been presented to us.  This is somewhat different.  This is the case of a municipality, with all the services which a municipality can give, such as water, sewerage, light and so on.  You have a county with a very much longer road surface in which these services cannot be given.  There is a difference between the sort of administration which would appertain to a city like Dublin or a borough like Dun Laoghaire, which is very much the same as a city, a small example of a city.  The Minister did not tell us about that particular part of it.  While there is a case in the Bill regarding a county manager for two counties&mdash; it is not made to us, but we are assuming that it is&mdash;there is a marked difference, and I should like some information other than merely talk of harmonising things.  I can quite appreciate the advisability of harmonising things, because there has been for a great number of years some little friction, although in most cases it is not so marked as it was.  I remember on one occasion actions pending between different local authorities in and around the city in cases where the ratepayers would have to pay the expenses no matter which side won&mdash; the ratepayers of each one of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some things that the Minister might clear up. The main argument, I gather from the Minister, is that if ever there is a question of amalgamation as affecting a metropolitan council, the administrative machinery will be there without further change.  But in order to bring about that amalgamation a new Bill will have to be put before the House and passed.  It seems to me that is <Col N="279" /> the more natural time to bring about the amalgamation of the managerships. I am not prepared to find any great objection to that, but I am not clear yet on two things.  One is with reference to having one man in the two jobs.  It is not a common managership; it is simply one man holding two very distinct jobs.  How does that enable a combined service to be provided?</P>
      <P>The Minister gave one example, the district of Crumlin, where the school is in the county and the most of the children attending come from the city. The manager there is, as it were, two different persons, responsible to two different bodies.  He is the manager of two authorities, quite as much as if he were two persons.  How is he to get over that difficulty?  How is he to solve that problem that is brought forward by the Minister as the one illustration? If he were the common manager of the two bodies I could understand it, but he is in an independent position in both cases.  I admit the influence of a manager may be so great that he may be able to bring about a certain amount of harmony, but that is quite problematical.  The other point is whether it is wise to take a man whose experience has been that of managing a city and put him a very different problem in addition.  Though he has an assistant manager, the responsibility will always be his.  You put him a very difficult problem in addition to his ordinary duties of manager because he has to take responsibility for the county.  That is what the Minister has not justified.</P>

I <Col N="280" /> forget exactly what the decision was, but I feel certain that if there was a majority turning it down, it was not a very big majority.  I will look the matter up to-morrow.  I wonder are Deputies aware that a great deal of the services in County Dublin at present come from the city?  We are always howling at the city for water and the Dublin water supply serves a big number of towns in the county. There seems to be a great deal of alarm about the city manager taking control in the county and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  Some people imagine he would not be able to deal with it.</P>
      <P>At present a number of the services in County Dublin are administered by a majority of the Dublin Corporation. Poor law assistance is administered by the Dublin Board of Assistance, on which there is a majority of eight or nine members of the corporation, and that poor law assistance takes in at least half the County of Dublin.  The infirmary for the county is in the middle of Dublin City and it is controlled by the same body.  Portion of the city sewerage system is utilised by the county.  We have not even a fire brigade in the county.</P>

      <P>I would appeal again to the Minister to withdraw the amendment. It is obvious to everybody that this is not the appropriate time to introduce such an amendment.  The Minister is visualising something which may come when the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal is implemented, if it ever is.  He has laid it down definitely here that there are two different positions and one man is to be both a county and a city manager. That is a preposterous proposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fogarty has spent about five minutes telling the House that he thinks that it will do this and do that, but he has not the slightest conception of what it is going to do.  How can the one person be a county manager and a city manager at the same time? The job of the Dublin City Manager is a very big one.  Everybody knows the enormous amount of work he has to do. To ask the same individual to be county manager and city manager as well is, I think, to ask him to do a thing that no man is equal to, even if he is the superman that he is supposed to be, and as well to be assistant manager for Dun Laoghaire Borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that there is usually a conflict of opinion between the council in charge of a rural area and the council in charge of a city area.  Is this particular superman to interpret the views of both the city and the county when we all know that there is always a great conflict of opinion as between the city and the county?  The proposition that is being put before <Col N="282" /> the House is an impossible one.  I think it is the most laughable one that has ever come before the House.</P>

I can say that times out of number&mdash;I am sure every member of the corporation has had the same experience&mdash;the city managers we have had have complained of their very big responsibilities, and I am quite certain that Mr. Hernon, or whoever else it might be, would not willingly undertake the extra duties which this section in the Bill proposes to place on his shoulders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to one point the Minister made about the Crumlin schools.  Is there anything in this Bill that will solve the Crumlin difficulty?  The church and schools there were built to accommodate an expanding area.  The development in that area, so far, has been practically entirely in the city.  The Minister's Department gave a big grant of money to the Dublin County Council to build a road through the county area to link up with the corporation housing scheme that was making provision for the people and children who would fill the church and schools.  The question of school meals has arisen there.  I am not well up on the point, but I take it that the provision of school meals in the area in which the school is situate is a matter for the local authority in that area. It is the local authority, I understand, that must raise the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case the Dublin County Council naturally did not raise the money to provide schools for the children who came out of the city area. Even the amalgamation of the managership, having the one man for the city and county, will not rectify the the present position because I take it that until there is a change by statute of the administrative area of the county council, and until the wedge that includes this school is transferred to the city area, the situation will remain precisely as it is to-day.  Where then is the Minister's argument for those amendments?  I am afraid that by a kind of trick the civil servants in the Department of Local Government and the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether it is the civil servants who are urging the Minister or the Minister <Col N="284" /> urging the civil servants&mdash;are despite the wishes of the people of Dublin City and County, attempting to put this over by a sort of side wind.  It is going to be put over in a disguised manner so that we do not know what is happening. I am sure Deputy Hannigan did not mean what he said about the city manager.  He and I, as members of the corporation, were opposed to the appointment of the present city manager.  I have nothing to say of the present city manager except to pay him the highest tribute for his efficiency and ability.  He is prepared to stand up to any situation.  He has not shirked the present situation, but has stood up to it.  We who have been elected by the people and who have to provide the money, if any extra charges are made on the city, have come into the breach and are going to stand up to the situation too.</P>

What I should like to know from the Minister is this: if the present city manager becomes manager of the County Dublin will the fact of his appointment give him power to bring into operation at an <Col N="285" /> early date the School Meals Act for the Crumlin schools?  There is a situation out there which is becoming rather alarming.  I am anxious to know what was in the Minister's mind when he referred to the Crumlin schools.  These schools are only 200 yards outside the city boundary.  If the appointment of the city manager as county manager does not mean that it will automatically bring the Crumlin schools into the city area, I would like the Minister to clear up that point when he is replying because a number of members here are very anxious to see, as Deputy Belton has pointed out, that these schools are brought by statute into the city area, and not by the mere appointment of a manager.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is replying I hope he will deal with the point of the city and county manager attending the meetings of different bodies.  The corporation presumably meets once a month.  The county council meets once a month, and, presumably the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council meets once a month.  That means that the manager will have to devote three days to attendance of the meetings of these bodies.  It is probable that he will have to attend three times as many meetings as heretofore.  Will it be part of his duty to attend all those meetings?  Local authorities are sometimes inclined to be jealous of their prerogatives.  One can easily foresee the objections that would be raised by one of these bodies if the manager should absent himself from its meetings. On that point it might be said that the assistant manager could attend.  That is quite true, but it is unlikely that that would give the same satisfaction to the council as if the manager was there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the manager would have power to delegate his powers in certain circumstances.  I do not think that will be necessary in regard to meetings or anything like that, but in the exercise of certain functions he would certainly have to delegate them.  Nothing more is sought in this proposal, but Deputies seem to consider that the area is too big or <Col N="286" /> the number of institutions or the population.  There is nothing more in it than that for the city manager, and when there is reference made to Crumlin, the manager of both bodies could more easily appreciate the situation than where you have a county council that is deriving no benefit from the school except that it happens to be 20 yards inside its area.  If we consider the administration of Dublin City and County there is considerable overlapping. You have a public assistance district for the city and part of the county.  Arrangements for institutional treatment are common to both, the mental hospitals are common to both, and the water supply of the city supplies a large portion of the county. There may be other things that do not occur to me, but when you find a position like that, without thinking of the Greater Dublin Tribunal recommendations, you can see a considerable advantage, if you could move towards that amalgamation which, I believe, will eventually come.  In the meantime you are making towards securing greater harmony between both bodies than by having people in separate positions.  There is not very much economy in it.</P>

      <P>The position is this, that if you leave the present manager in Dun Laoghaire, and if you carry on in Dublin with a city manager, it is almost inevitable that you will have to have an assistant in County Dublin. If you had an assistant manager that you could move from one place to another you could add additional work.

      <P>This is obviously a second thought.  Here is a Bill that was well thought out by the Minister, by his advisers and by his predecessor.  The Minister now has charge of it, and I suppose this is a second thought on his part.  This raises a number of problems, and from speeches I heard in the House, and that of the one Deputy who supported the Minister, it is obvious that the House does not know what it is voting on.  I think Deputy Everett was quite right in refusing to accept advice from Deputy Fogarty who, it was quite obvious, was enthusiastic because he thought this proposal would accomplish a great deal more than it will accomplish. The only thing that can be accomplished will be to increase the burden on the city manager, but there is a pious hope that it may lead to harmony. As to the example the Minister brought forward, he did not show how it is going to solve the question.  Will there be two different bodies to deal with the county council and the corporation?</P>

      <P>The Minister glossed over the point I made and gave no definite answer to it.  He said the reason the Crumlin schools were <Col N="288" /> mentioned was that the city manager could appreciate the difficulty that exists there.  What will he do as well as appreciate the difficulty?  Will the city manager have power to make an order applying the School Meals Act to Crumlin, without coming here and making an application to have the city boundary extended to that portion of the county in which these schools are situate?  It will be known that the Crumlin schools were mentioned and a false belief will be created that the School Meals Act will be applied there by the Dublin Corporation, if the amendment is passed.  The corporation however states that the city manager, after a resolution has been passed by the corporation, can apply to the Minister for an extension of the boundaries.  It was only this week that I interviewed the city manager and the law agent with a view to having the School Meals Act applied to Crumlin, and I found that there is a very costly procedure to be gone through, preparing plans and maps as well as advertising.  The Minister merely glossed over that and created an atmosphere that suggests that if the Bill gets through the city manager can make the necessary order.  Is that so? Does the Minister intend to give that power?  If he does it will ease the situation considerably.</P>

I cannot see how it would work when there are three consultative bodies to be dealt with.  A question has been raised about the public assistance boards.  Will not the same problem confront the county and the city manager seeing that representations will come from the county and the city?  I suggest to the Minister that the worst thing he could do is to disassociate the people in the county from close contact with public boards in the city.  The best way is to leave the city manager in Dublin, the borough manager in Dun Laoghaire and a manager in County Dublin. Then you will get more efficient service.</P>

They only applied this to Dublin City on the Second Reading, now they are incorporating Dublin City and County, and the probability is that we will next have all Leinster included under a superman.  Deputy Victory asks what is the difference between Dublin City and County.  After we have had a manager for Leinster, we will probably have one for Munster, and after that we will probably have one for Connaught.  The Government are proceeding in that direction.  In the Bill as passed on Second Reading, they gave Dublin City one manager and the county another.  When they got that, they went further when they thought the going was good.  Now it is proposed to have a manager for Dublin City, Dublin County and Dun Laoghaire. <Col N="291" /> I cannot see where they will get a man to control three councils elected by the people.  Apparently, the councils are not to have any views&mdash; the manager is to be in control.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  I think this discussion is futile.

If that is so, it would be well that it should be explained.  On the Second Reading of the last Local Government Bill, I and other Deputies suggested that the Minister might consider introducing all the Bills dealing with local government so as to give the House an opportunity of knowing how they were all going to fit in.

      <P>I think it would be a mistake to divide the House upon the amendment if it makes for administrative efficiency and if it is a contructive step.  Perhaps it would be possible to leave over the amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of strengthening the case for it.  I find myself in a difficulty in connection with this amendment.  On the general principle, without going into details, if there are services which ought to be under a particular central control, obviously there is a case for the amendment. I am not satisfied that the Minister has said that that is so.  It is quite true that you have mental hospital institutional treatment, water and so on.  But there are other difficulties and problems that I think this new management will make more difficult to be solved.  Not the least of them is that one I mentioned when, say, the Dublin County Council meets on a Tuesday.  Perhaps the corporation would meet on the same day.  It does not often happen that that would be so, but there will be a certain amount of resentment.  It is characteristic of local authorities that when their prerogatives are interfered with, there is resentment.  In so far as this means harmonising services it is a good thing that it should be done and this must harmonise some of them.  Then you have the case mentioned by Deputy Alderman Byrne which is a problem in itself and which will probably make the person who occupies this office unpopular with both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with regard to the services that the manager can render, impersonally if I may say so, on each of these bodies.  It does not appear that there is likely to be much conflict between the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council and the City of Dublin.  But with regard to the County Council of Dublin I see difficulties.  I said there are difficulties with regard to the Dublin County Council and I will mention one of them.  There are parts of the county in which the water supply is not satisfactory.  One can easily see that the manager will be the responsible executive officer for that kind of <Col N="294" /> problem.  As I see it the position will be rendered very difficult.  People will say: &ldquo;Well, if a man paying 5/- a week rates on a house in the City of Dublin can be supplied with water, a man in the county who is paying 7/6 a week in rates should get it, but he cannot.&rdquo;  How are we situated in the matter of lighting?  Every street in the City of Dublin and in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire is lighted, whereas the county roads are not.  You will have complaints made that the services of the ambulance are always available in the city on a telephone call and that the county is neglected.  This principle of management I am prepared to accept.  I have accepted it for many years, but I think there is the danger in this particular case of making the office unpopular and making it more difficult to work.  While it presents in theory administrative facility it will create difficulty having regard to the big divergences between the county and city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the assistant manager have as full a power as the manager to function in the respective areas?  The Minister knows that though the manager is a corporation existing in theory, his function is to sit in committee with the officials of the Department, and the orders he makes have statutory effect.  The same man will have to do a lot.  He will have to get to the county council and perform not only the functions of the county council, but the functions of the board of health, the function of a couple of boards of assistance, the functions of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital and so on.  There will be monthly meetings of the borough council, of the county council and of the boards of health.  The latter meetings are fortnightly and the boards of assistance weekly.  Then he will have the monthly meetings of the corporation in addition to the Joint Purposes Committee and the other committee meetings he will have to attend.  I could understand the amalgamation with one body representing the whole of the county and city meeting together and forming one advisory council.  I can understand the practicability of such a proposal <Col N="295" /> but I cannot understand the practicability or utility of three elected bodies in the county and city with one general manager for the whole lot.  I do not think that is feasible or practical at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister, under this disguise and through a Bill that up to now had not anything to do with the City of Dublin or the County of Dublin and which did not affect the administration of the city at all, is endeavouring to get this House to adopt the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal.  Now every witness who came to give evidence at that tribunal was against any portion of the county being taken into the city. They did not make a case for that until they were asked what portion of the county they would prefer taken if any of it were taken.  We were informed that some of it was to be taken.  It was then we made a case for the developed areas to be taken in.  But in doing so we made a preamble that we did not want any to be taken in, but if it were a matter that some area was to be taken in, it was the developed areas we wanted taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unfair for the Minister with a Whip and with a machined majority to force this Bill upon the county council.  We had Deputy Victory, the city specialist from the Longford side of the country, saying why not go on with the Bill.  The Longford Deputy compares his little crossroads with the metropolis of the country.  Well, Longford is my native place but I know the problems in Dublin.  I am in the unique position that I am a member of the three bodies concerned.  I know a little of the jealousies mentioned.  Let us consider the financial position of these three bodies.  The Dublin County Council can borrow money at 4 per cent.  Dublin City can borrow money at 5 per cent., and they have been compelled even to pay as much as 5¾ per cent.  It is only this week that the Borough of Dun Laoghaire borrowed £100,000 of which £77,000 was borrowed at 4½ per cent. and £23,000 at 4¼ per cent., the sinking fund not to operate for a period of three years.  That money is for housing <Col N="296" /> for the Borough of Dun Laoghaire. When the borough is amalgamated with the City of Dublin will they be in a position to get money at that rate? Dun Laoghaire does not want amalgamation. This is a huge problem. This is a Government amendment to the original Bill and I submit, Sir, that it is completely out of order.  We passed the Second Reading of the County Management Bill, and when we did so, the Bill did not relate in any way to the City of Dublin.  This amendment now is to put the administration of the whole city and county into the hands of one manager against the wishes of the people generally of Dublin City and County.  I think that is a monstrous proposition.</P>

      <P>I do not want to chip into this quarrel but I am interested in the line taken by Deputy Keyes a moment ago.  When Acts are passed concerning Dublin, they generally come to be applied to Cork and Limerick.  When we start amalgamation on these lines in Dublin, we shall probably follow suit in Cork in 12 months and then the turn of Limerick will come.  My objection to the whole Bill is that it savours too much of centralisation. Would it not be better to adjourn this amendment for further consideration because there is too much of the city mentality behind legislation of this kind.  Why not adopt the suggestion of Deputy Cosgrave and let the matter go without appointing the city manager to take charge of the county.  It would, I think, be better to leave the matter over.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider carefully the point put to him by the Leader of the Opposition. His suggestion might ease the whole situation.  There is no conflict of interest between Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.  Between Dublin City and County there is a conflict of interest. When we are endeavouring to find some kind of machinery for this purpose, it is a mistake to introduce antagonism of any sort.  Unless we can get a better machine, it is not worth making the change.  If antagonism is <Col N="297" /> introduced, it will operate against the working of the whole Act.  Seeing that there is no conflict between Dublin and Dun Laoghaire, why should not the Minister agree to group these two areas and let Dublin County stand by itself? Any alteration of the city boundaries must be made by statute.  I do not see how joint managership will make for harmony as between the county and city.  If the Minister would agree to deal with Dublin and Dun Laoghaire only and to let the county run its own affairs, he would, possibly, find that harmony would result and I think we would all be agreeable to that course.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is any necessity for worrying as to how this scheme will work out.  We are grouping counties which have nothing in common and we are putting a county manager over them.  The only question that arises is whether the city manager would be able to carry out the city and county work.  I believe he will.  If he is not, we can come back to the House with an amending Bill and ask for power to appoint an assistant manager.</P>

      <P>Many of us have no interest in this matter, which is a purely local question.  The House was, however, very generous to the Minister on Second Reading, and I do not think it is fair to ask us to enter into this conflict on a local issue raised by way of amendment.  There is a serious conflict of view and the Minister should, I think, adopt the suggestion of Deputy Cosgrave.  I leave aside the question whether or not this amendment fits in with the Long Title of the Bill.  This is a new principle entirely and, on account of the substantial agreement which obtained in the House on Second Reading, this proposal regarding the county should be either modified or withdrawn. We have been two hours debating this amendment.  I think the Minister should accept the proposal of Deputy Cosgrave as a compromise and leave the matter over to the Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the exact number to be fixed in the matter of exclusion, the Minister may remember that on the Second Reading of the Bill I spoke strongly in favour of the general principle <Col N="301" /> of the Bill.  The reason I spoke in favour of the principle of the Bill was that under modern circumstances it was becoming more and more impossible for a body like a county council to deal with a large area, that, consequently, their members seldom came together and had not an opportunity of consulting with each other frequently on the various problems. There was the further point that administration had become so complicated, and so many duties were cast upon the local authorities, that it was practicably impossible for the county council, without a manager, to deal with these particular problems.  These, I think, were the principal arguments that I thought would induce anybody to support the general principle of this Bill, and I put it to the Minister that these arguments do not apply to a town, and that everything is to be gained by leaving the town so far as possible to conduct its own affairs.</P>
    <P>The members of a town council meet each other practically every day, and several times a day sometimes.  They can discuss fully and have constantly before them the business of their urban district.  They are fully familiar with all the problems and all their details much more than any county manager could be.  As I say, they are familiar with the problems and they are acquainted with everybody who lives in the town.  I think there would be a loss to the initiative connected with local administration.  After all, we interfered with them considerably in appointing a manager, but did so because we thought it inevitable, but I think there would be a loss and not a gain if there is a further reduction of a town council.  I am not wedded to the figure of 10,000, as I said before. Of course, an increase in the figure would defeat the purpose of the amendment because it would rule out a number of people, but if the Minister suggests certain things in that regard, I have no objection.  I do put it to the Minister, however, that little will be gained and that a considerable amount of real touch with affairs may be lost if he does not see his way to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Col N="302" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a similar amendment down in my name, and I would appeal to the Minister to accept the principle of these amendments. As Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, there may be a case to be made for a manager to be appointed to a county area.  A rural area is generally long and straggling and it is not so easy to get the members to come together as it is in the case of a confined area such as a town.  As I said on the Second Reading, the problems confronting an urban authority are very different from those confronting a rural authority, and to my mind it will be impossible to get a manager to understand the problems of both town and rural areas and be able to apply himself to the solving of these problems in the same way that it has been done up to this.  By the passing of this Bill, a county manager is going to control boroughs such as Wexford, Kilkenny and Sligo, which have old charters.  The particular borough that I represent, Wexford, has one of the oldest charters in Great Britain or Ireland, I think, and people are naturally jealous of that.  To my mind, the placing of a county manager over an area such as Wexford, Kilkenny or Sligo certainly reduces the status of that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister does not see his way to accept the amendment as it appears now, I wonder would he consider the appointment of a manager for a group of urban areas inside a county.  I think he will find that he would get more efficiency from a system of that kind than he would from the appointment of a county manager who would have towns and town councils subordinate to him. I appeal to the Minister to consider this favourably.  There is, as I said, a marked difference of opinion between the county councils and the urban councils.  The manager, of course, will have to attend meetings of both bodies, and I am sure he will find himself in conflict with either or both of their opinions at different times, but it will be absolutely impossible for him to interpret the views both of the urban and rural authorities.  They usually differ on a great many things and have a different outlook on various <Col N="303" /> problems.  The Minister would be well advised to separate the rural and urban authorities under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I believe that, while the feeling in the country is generally in favour of the system proposed under this Bill, there is a great lot to be said for the separation of the urban councils.  If the Minister is accepting these amendments, I think he should except all these councils rather than put a restriction on them as to population.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, there would be a conflict of opinion, and I do not think that the same arguments could be advanced in favour of bringing in urban councils under this Bill as in other cases.</P>
      <P>I believe that in practically every urban area they would feel that a certain amount of their power over their business was being completely taken away if it were going to be under the county manager.  I do not think that it would affect the value that, I believe, would come from this Bill if the Minister agreed to exclude the urban council from the jurisdiction of the county manager.  It is the one thing under the Bill which I do not like.  I would be quite satisfied with the Bill in its entirety if the Minister agreed to remove the urban council from the jurisdiction of the county manager.  I am satisfied with the Bill in principle as long as it abolishes the one thing it ought to abolish, that is, the boards of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that there can be any conflict between the manager who is manager of the county council and the urban councils; I do not see that any conflict can arise between them.  The manager will have his work carried out, to a great extent, by the town clerks under these various councils.  He is purely an administrator, to see that the work is done, to see that the clerk does his work and to see that the services are attended to.  I think Deputies are altogether exaggerating the importance of this matter.  Even <Col N="304" /> if it were a question of prestige, I do not think there is anything in it, as the county council will be under the county manager just the same as the urban council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see that he is taking away local power, to a certain extent, that there is under the managerial system?  The House is agreeing to that&mdash;we are agreeing to it, as we think it necessary.  We think, however, that as little as possible should be taken away and when there are cases where towns are able to manage these questions themselves, without damage to general efficiency, the Minister should be ready to except them.  It is not a case of putting together people having different interests; here you can leave local administration untouched, and why not do it?</P>
