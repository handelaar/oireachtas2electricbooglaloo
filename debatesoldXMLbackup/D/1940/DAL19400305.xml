      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that children of tender years residing in the Ellenfield and Larkhill districts of Dublin have to travel long distances into the city to attend school; and if he will state whether his Department has any plans or proposals for suitable school accommodation in or near these districts.</P>

      <P>Since the Deputy's previous question on the 15th November last I have inquired into the distances which children must travel to school from the Ellenfield and Larkhill areas.  The information which I have secured does not bear out the Deputy's contention.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="2" /> Finance if he is aware that county councils have been instructed by the Department of Local Government and Public Health to include in rate estimates specified amounts as county contributions towards employment schemes, and that the amounts so contributed by councils last year had relation to stated Government contributions for the same purpose; and if he is prepared to state that the Government contributions will this year bear the same relation to county contributions as they did last year.</P>

      <P>The distribution of the moneys of the Employment Schemes Vote for 1940-41 has not yet been finally determined but in order that local authorities should be enabled to make provision for their contributions from the rates it was necessary to notify them in general terms in time for their rates meetings, which statutorily may be held any time after the 8th February.  They were asked accordingly to make provisional arrangements on the same scale as for the current financial year.  Broadly <Col N="3" /> speaking, however, and with the exception of a few cases in which special considerations may arise it may be taken that the contribution required from each local authority towards the cost of employment schemes to which it contributes in the financial year 1940-41 will be in the same ratio to the State grant as in the current financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the hardship imposed on workers employed on relief schemes where wages are paid only fortnightly, involving in many cases a three weeks' delay in actual payment, and whether he is prepared to authorise the issue of an imprest to the county surveyors to enable them pay such wages weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of payment of wages to workmen engaged on <Col N="4" /> employment schemes administered by local authorities will be dealt with in the answer to the analogous question (No. 5 on the Order Paper) which the Deputy has addressed to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
      <P>So far as minor employment schemes administered by the Office of Public Works are concerned imprests for the payment of wages are issued to the county surveyors well in advance of requirements.  The possibility of making weekly payments of wages has already been examined but no satisfactory solution has hitherto been found.  The difficulty lies in the very large number of workmen employed and in the fact that the wages sheets are vouched by the county surveyors, who at the same time are responsible for the wages sheets for roads employment schemes administered by the county councils and also for those in respect of the county council workmen engaged on their normal road works.</P>
      <P>The present practice with regard to the payment of road workers on normal county council work is also to pay the wages fortnightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that it is a grave hardship on workers to be employed in relief schemes for three or four days only in the week and whilst they are so employed to receive no wages in respect of that particular week, no unemployment assistance and no home assistance because they are working. They have to wait for nearly three weeks in order to obtain payment of wages for three or four days' work. Will the Parliamentary Secretary look into the matter further with a view to devising arrangements whereby the workers will be paid in the week in which the employment is given, in view of the fact that many persons who are unemployed over a long period have no credit left and no resources to sustain them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that in a few cases there may be real hardship in this matter, but the number of cases in which there is hardship is probably <Col N="5" /> very small.  I have investigated it very carefully, and various methods have been attempted by the county councils to get over the difficulty, having regard to the fact that they themselves are paying their own men in exactly the same way.  In some cases where there was investigation by the county councils, they have decided that the money which would be absorbed for weekly special payments would have to be taken from the general fund which enables them to relieve unemployment and this might be a greater evil.  It is a very difficult question, and all I can say is that I am prepared to advocate trying to find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you permit, me, Sir, by way of interrogatory, to bring this information to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary?  Is he aware &mdash;he probably is not&mdash;of a case which was brought to my notice recently, where a man was receiving 14/- a week unemployment assistance benefit at an employment exchange?  He was offered four days' employment on a relief scheme.  The man said: &ldquo;I cannot afford to take employment on the relief scheme because I will not get paid for three weeks, and it is better to get 14/- at the exchange than even 20/-, which I will not be paid for three weeks.&rdquo; Because the man refused to take employment for four days, in view of the fact that he would not be paid for three weeks, he was refused unemployment assistance benefit, and was also refused home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are many cases on record, so far as boards of health are concerned, where persons in this position have had to receive emergency relief?  That has caused a good deal of confusion so far as the administration of boards of health is concerned, and there is no justification for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the two questions separately.  If Deputy Norton will give me particulars of the case he has in mind I will look into it, because I know that an exactly opposite decision has been given in a similar <Col N="6" /> case.  In relation to the question raised by Deputy Davin, that was one of the places where we looked for evidence that this was a widespread difficulty. The number of cases we have been able to find in which what Deputy Davin referred to has occurred&mdash;that the home assistance authorities have been called in&mdash;is absolutely microscopic. In one particular county where special provision of this kind was made, I think less than half of 1 per cent of those who were employed under the schemes applied to take advantage of it.  If the Deputy will give me the particular case he has in mind, I will be glad to help him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that in several areas men employed temporarily on roads (rural) schemes are paid wages only fortnightly, involving in many cases a three weeks' delay in actual payment, and that, therefore, they suffer great hardship; and whether he is prepared to authorise the issue of an imprest to county surveyors to enable them pay such wages weekly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements made by county councils for the payment of men on employment schemes on roads have been investigated and everything possible is being done by these councils to make payments to workmen as quickly as can be arranged by the accounting staff.  The suggestion of an imprest to the county surveyor would not obviate the necessity for the preparation of pay sheets and paying orders.  If the Deputy has in mind a proposal to enable payments to be made in cash by the county surveyors, I could not agree to that course.  Payments to road workers are as a rule made fortnightly. <Col N="7" /> If the Deputy would send me particulars of the cases he refers to I will have further inquiries made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that it is a much greater hardship on a man employed for three or four days on a relief scheme to be paid fortnightly than it is on a man who is regularly employed, and whom the shopkeeper knows has regular employment and a regular income?  Does he not think there is a case for discrimination in relation to those who are employed only for three or four days a week, and that the wages should be paid weekly in those cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Where men are newly taken on, we have suggested to the councils that they should try to take them on in the middle of the week, so that that would shorten the period of waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister know that where a man works three or four days he has to wait at least a fortnight or usually three weeks before he gets paid?  That is because of the arrangement made by the county councils for paying their ordinary road staff fortnightly, but does not the Minister think some alternative arrangement should be made in the case of those casually employed for short periods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the workers who are employed part-time in industry or agriculture have to be paid weekly by their employers, surely to goodness the Government and the local authorities should be able to do the same thing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that in connection with the Dublin Board of Assistance objection has been taken even by tradesmen to accepting temporary employment because of the delay that takes place owing to the fact that the wages have to be sanctioned before they are paid?  In some cases that means a delay of three or four weeks. Cases of temporary nurses are affected in the same way.  The whole matter ought to be reconsidered because, undoubtedly, there is hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mrs. Redmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware of the very serious hardship caused by the present state of the bridge over the Blackwater at Youghal, and whether in view of the restrictive effect of the present position on fairs and business generally, he will state how far the scheme for the erection of a new bridge has advanced, and whether he will take steps to expedite the erection of this bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative.  The existing bridge carries all normal traffic up to a limit of 3½ tons and there should not be any restrictive effect on fairs by reason of the speed limit on the bridge being fixed at five miles per hour.  The local authorities for the Counties of Cork and Waterford have adopted a resolution <Col N="9" /> that at least 75 per cent of the cost of the rebuilding of the bridge should be defrayed out of the Road Fund and that the balance of the cost should be levied off these counties, and also the County Boroughs of Cork and Waterford, and, if possible, over a wider area.  No consideration could be given to a proportion of the cost amounting to 75 per cent. being met out of the Road Fund.  I understand that the county surveyors of the two counties mentioned estimated the cost of erecting a new bridge at £200,000. The matter is, therefore, one that requires careful consideration before any decision can be come to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the provision of a water supply for Stradbally were originally received in my Department in December, 1931.  The details of the scheme then submitted were referred back to the board on several occasions and when the yield, on being gauged in 1934, was found inadequate, other possible sources of supply were investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1935 the consulting engineer employed by the commissioner proposed the taking of a supply from springs at Luggacurran, which involved lengthy negotiations with many interests.  In November, 1938, details of this scheme were submitted to the Department, following which gaugings of the proposed source were requested. When the gaugings were obtained in November, 1939, it became apparent <Col N="11" /> that the scheme could not be adopted pending further investigation of the yield.  The Department has not yet received such information as would warrant any approval being given.  It may become necessary to obtain a supplemental source of supply.</P>
    <P>The information available in the Department is confined to the technical details of the two schemes submitted, and as neither of them reached the stage at which the financing of works could be considered, the Department has no information regarding any items of expenditure incurred on preliminary investigations in connection therewith.</P>
    <P>There has been no delay on the part of the Department in dealing with the two proposals submitted.

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether the military officer who has been given notice of dismissal and the two officers who have been called upon to resign in connection with the raid on the Magazine Fort in December, 1939, were tried by courtmartial and given an opportunity of defending themselves, and, if not, whether he will say why they were denied the right of trial, which they are willing to undergo; and whether he will now arrange for such trial to be afforded them.</P>

      <P>The officers to whom the Deputy refers were not tried by courtmartial, but they were given a reasonable opportunity to make such representations as they thought proper in relation to their proposed dismissal or retirement.</P>
      <P>No member of the Defence Forces has a right to claim trial by courtmartial. The Magazine Fort raid has been the subject of prolonged investigation by a military court of inquiry, and the Government considers that, on the facts revealed, it is now for them to decide whether the officers involved are suitable for retention in the forces.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does he deny that the usual procedure for dealing with a military offence, real or alleged, is trial by courtmartial, that that is recognised as an equitable method of dealing with whatever charge is preferred against a person in the defence forces, inasmuch as the person has an opportunity of defending himself, and will he say why this unusual procedure was adopted of dismissing one officer and prematurely superannuating two other officers without giving them an adequate opportunity of defending themselves by trial by courtmartial?</P>

It is not always practicable to vest the holdings of all allottees on an estate at the same time.  Holdings allotted to migrants must be vested as early as possible in order that the exchange may be completed and the retransfer of the surrendered holdings carried out. Allotments by way of enlargements of existing holdings cannot be vested <Col N="17" /> unless the allottee is (or becomes) registered owner of the holding with which the enlargement is to be consolidated.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is to be congratulated on the progress made in the way of increased planting.  It is very useful work, gives a good deal of employment, has a very beneficial effect on our climate and on drainage, and increases the national wealth.  I should like to say that I appreciate the difficulties that the Department experiences in the acquisition of land suitable for planting purposes, and the necessity of securing the goodwill of the people in a locality where it is proposed to plant.  The Minister referred to the difficulty of acquiring that type of land, for which sometimes commonage is claimed.  It must be borne in mind when speaking about afforestation that land suitable for the production of timber that will be used afterwards for commercial purposes must be fertile land.  In that respect land that is suitable for planting is sometimes claimed by the local people to be suitable for grazing, and hence difficulties arise.  I have in mind one place in County Carlow where the Forestry Department proposed, some years ago, to acquire land for planting.  It was land suitable for afforestation, but local small farmers, who live along the skirt of Mount Leinster, pointed out that it was also suitable for sheep grazing.  A good deal of that mountain side produces fair herbage.  The Department actually proceeded to fence in the mountain, prior to planting it, but when I made representations to the Minister, it was realised that it would be a mistake to plant there, and that it was in the national interest to preserve that place for grazing, inasmuch as 40 or 50 families were able to make a living out of it.  They had small patches of arable land that produced potato crops, but they lived mainly by feeding pigs and sheep farming. Between 3,000 and 4,000 sheep were grazed on that mountain, and I suggest that it would not be in the national interests to plant trees there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where commonage is claimed, and where the Department is about to <Col N="24" /> acquire it, I think there should be a definite responsibility on the Departmen to examine into the economic position that obtains there, having regard to the livelihood of the local people.  I do not know if that responsibility obtains at present.  Possibly the Department is simply concerned with the planting aspect alone.  That is not enough.  This question should definitely be inquired into in all cases, especially where there is any doubt about leaving the land for commonage and grazing purposes, and the views of the local people should be considered. We all realise that unless we have the goodwill of the local people we are not going to succeed in this work, because, if there is objection, a plantation might be destroyed two or three years after it has been planted.  While I appreciate the difficulties that the Department is up against in acquiring suitable land for planting, and remembering that the land must be reasonably fertile in order to produce commercial timber, it should also be remembered that where there is useful herbage, that can be used generally for grazing sheep, it is far more in the national interest to preserve it for that purpose and to give preference to men rather than to trees.  Sometimes an attempt is made by the Department to give preference to trees over men. Where people are making a livelihood out of land, it is preferable that it should continue to be used for that purpose. Possibly the herbage could be improved, but that is another matter and does not concern this Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  In a district where there is suitable land, and where no claim is made to it by local people for the grazing of sheep, planting could be carried out.  That type of land can be got.  While I appreciate the difficulties of the Department I think pressure should not be brought to bear on people to give up land that is suitable for the production of sheep.  Such land could carry sheep during the store period, and they could be fattened afterwards on better <Col N="25" /> land in the valley.  That is the type of land we have on Mount Leinster in County Carlow, on which a large number of store sheep are produced and finished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the slowness of the Department in acquiring land for forestry purposes.  As I understand, forestry units have been created throughout the country, the idea being that a unit shall consist of 600 acres within a certain district.  In my constituency in one unit the farmers offered a portion of land to augment an area that had already been planted on the Gradwell estate, and inspectors went down there, but the matter drags on.  I am raising this matter now in order to get an answer from the Minister, because one year follows another, and it is not know when the Department will move.  I hope this Department will not get the reputation for slowness that is applied to some other Departments.  An Act was passed by the previous Government making it compulsory when obtaining a permit to fell trees to plant young trees.  I want to complain that that provision has not been observed.  Two years ago one of the leading saw milling firms in England sent representatives to Ireland, and they bought up ash trees all over the Midlands.  They gave good prices and paid good wages.  They bought hundreds of ash trees, the timber in which, I understand, was used in the manufacture of aeroplanes. I was speaking to one of the representatives of this firm and he told me that Irish ash was the best in the world. That gives the lie to those who say that Ireland is only suitable for the growing of soft timber, such as spruce and fir. An undertaking was given that when a belt of ash trees or forests were sold the land would be replanted.  Not a single tree, so far as my constituency is concerned, has been planted in their place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> I raised the matter with the Department of the destruction of these woods and the Department gave me to understand from time to time that undertakings had been given.  They have not been observed since.  Previous to that, I was able to point out several large belts of forest which had been felled in County Westmeath and nothing has been done to replace them. It is a very serious matter.  We claim that we are one of the best wooded counties in Ireland&mdash;I think that statement is true&mdash;but we will become like the other counties, without woods, if there is not more insistence on the planting of young trees where old timber is felled.  I know that people can become very sentimental about trees and I am not complaining of the felling of old timber where it is mature.  I have given a case of ash which has been bought up all over the Midlands.  That was not old timber and, in many cases, it was not mature. I understand that it takes upwards of 100 years for ash to mature and I should like the Minister to go into the matter.</P>
    <P>What I am going to say now does not really concern his Department, but I might mention, in passing, that that firm were anxious to establish a sawmill here.  They did not get the facilities because the question of a 51 per cent.  Irish capital arose and they were not prepared to let their capital be subscribed here.  These are the two matters to which I should like the Minister to give his attention&mdash;the failure to plant trees where trees are felled and the slowness of the Department in acquiring and taking over land adjoining forest belts which is offered to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties of any Minister in extending the acreage under forestry in this country, and I believe the Forestry Department are doing possibly as well as could be done in the circumstances.  The difficulty pointed out by Deputy Hughes certainly exists.  That is, that in relation to forestry&mdash;and I do not know that it is generally appreciated&mdash;you require reasonably fertile land to grow even the easiest-grown trees, and a <Col N="27" /> question arises, when the Minister is asked to plant a district where land could conceivably be used for either forestry or, in certain circumstances, for various forms of agriculture, which it should be used for.  I am quite sure the Minister has come up against the argument which many of us come up against, that the land can be used for the production of some sort of human food and very probably he will be induced to leave such land for that purpose, and I believe that on the whole he would be right in doing so; but then the question arises: where are we going to get the necessary land for afforestation?  We have been appealing to various Ministers in this Department for years to proceed on a larger scale with afforestation, but when an effort is made to plant lands that are even reasonably fertile, the objection is raised that these lands can be used for other purposes, such as the feeding of sheep, or, in certain circumstances, of cattle, so that the matter is not at all as easy as it appears to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the question to which Deputy Kennedy referred and to which I also want to refer, that is, that while we are proceeding with the extension of forestry, we ought to make a greater effort to preserve the trees we have.  I have referred to this previously and I am glad that Deputy Kennedy alluded to it to-day.  A great lot of the timber of the slower-growing type and the hardwood type, such as oak, elm and ash, and even the rarer types such as walnut, which did exist in this country has disappeared, or is disappearing. Some of them have practically disappeared. Deputy Kennedy referred to the law which forbids the cutting of trees except under permit, but we all know that trees are being cut wholesale and I am not certain that in all cases a permit has been issued. Still, the cutting goes on and, in a short time, there will be very little of the type of timber I mention left.  We have a zoo in this country so that people may have a chance of seeing rare varieties of animals, but we have nothing of the sort in relation to <Col N="28" /> forestry and, in a very few years, such trees as walnut trees and, to a great extent, oak and ash trees will have disappeared from many districts.  The children of the new generation will not have an opportunity of knowing even what such trees were like.</P>
    <P>Some people will say that I am exaggerating, but we are rapidly advancing to that position, and there ought to be a greater effort to preserve the trees which are slow-growing and which are not being planted.  Everyone of us knows that in the division of large estates for the past 14 or 15 years, no practical effort has been made to preserve the trees.  The argument is put forward that if in the division of an estate, some holder gets a portion of land with trees on it, he is bound to cut them, and I agree entirely.  No man ought to be asked to live as a farmer on a portion of land which is composed mostly of large timber, even if it is rich land; but such a man does not do so.  He proceeds to cut the trees down, and most people would do the same.  I suggest that another remedy should have been found.  I do not suggest that any man should be asked to take over a portion of partially wooded land, develop it for agricultural purposes and make it pay; but the State should have devised other remedies and should have preserved those portions of these estates.  If you like, the grazing between the trees could be given to some of the tenants around, in common, if necessary, and the timber preserved.  So far as I know, in my own constituency, no practical effort whatever was made to preserve these trees and I should like to see that matter looked into.  I should like to see an effort made, not alone to advance the growing of timber, but also to preserve what timber we have. I believe the effort has not been made, but it is not yet too late to make it, even though it is rather late.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. Greater encouragement ought to be given to the ordinary holder of land, small or big, to grow timber.  Most people do not want to go in for growing timber on a large scale on their farms, <Col N="29" /> but there are many farmers who would like to plant a few trees.  The Department is good enough to give forest trees to farmers at a cheap rate and, sometimes, for a nominal sum, but the difficulty arises&mdash;I found it in a case in which I was interested&mdash;that there is a minimum that must be applied for.  I think the regulation is that no farmer can apply for a lesser number of trees than 360 or 370.  Very few small holders want 360 trees.  Many farmers would put in a dozen or half a dozen, but the regulations forbid that. I was personally interested in a case lately in my county where a society thought that a particular parish ought to be planted.</P>
    <P>They devised the idea of getting the farmers and labourers to combine and take a number of trees and divide them in ones, twos and tens, if they could get them.  They proceeded on these lines until practically the whole parish was organised.  The time was getting late for planting trees, and when they went to the Committee of Agriculture&mdash;I was with them as a matter of fact &mdash;a crux arose.  The local instructor found that they had no authority to give the number of trees required.  The difficulty was that they wanted some thousands of trees to divide them out in sixes and sevens amongst the small farmers and labourers, and it was found that there was a regulation which forbade that. It appeared that no man could apply for less than 360 trees, I think&mdash;I am not sure of the number.  The crux really was that the society could not apply for the trees, that they had to be applied for by the individual holders, some of whom did not want such a number as that, and it looked as if the scheme would fall through.  However, I am glad to say that, when appealed to, the Department met them very fairly indeed, just as I expected they would.  They agreed in the circumstances to allow them to proceed with their plan and they are proceeding with it now even though it is a bit late, and are getting different people to grow a certain number of trees.</P>
    <P>I refer to the matter chiefly because <Col N="30" /> there appears to be a regulation in existence preventing that.  In this case the Department allowed it, but I should like to see that regulation abolished altogether so that a farmer could apply to the Committee of Agriculture for half a dozen trees or a dozen trees if he wanted them.  Most of us would like to see every farmer growing trees, whether one, two, three, half a dozen or a dozen.  No farmer wants to grow a huge number of trees.  Therefore, I do not think that regulation should be allowed to continue in existence to prevent any farmer getting the number of trees he wanted.  I do not think the Department mean that.  In fact, in the case I mentioned they were entirely sympathetic and met the case fairly. But the regulation still remains so far as I know and I should like to see it removed.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, as I said, the difficulty of the Minister and the Department in increasing the acreage under afforestation in this country.  There are many difficulties, for instance, in deciding whether certain fertile lands should be used for afforestation or agriculture. On the whole, I think they are proceeding fairly rapidly.  They are giving a good lot of employment, and I hope they can see their way to extend that. I hope they will make a greater effort to preserve the trees of a slow-growing variety that we have and not leave us in the position in ten or 15 years' time that certain trees, like the walnut and other trees which we have at present, have not been preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Vote except to endorse the remarks made by some previous speakers, that we appreciate the fact that there has been a great improvement in the operations of the Forestry Department.  I think a great deal of the credit ought to be directed to our colleague on the Fianna Fáil benches, Deputy Dowdall, for the drive which has taken place in regard to forestry. I think it was never seriously taken up as a Ministerial activity until some very nasty things were said about the sort of stalemate which had set in in the Department.  The Ministerial attitude <Col N="31" /> towards trees might be summed up in the words of that famous poem by Joyce Kilmer:</P>
      <P>Poems are made by fools like me,</P>
      <P>But only God can make a tree.</P>
      <P>However, I think that there has been a different viewpoint adopted in the last year or two and that there has been a considerable improvement.  It appears to me that whatever forestry work is going to be done in future will be determined by our own activity in the matter.</P>
      <P>A point has been raised about the class of trees planted on the lands acquired for forestry.  I would like if we could plant a more useful class of tree than we have been planting.  It is all very fine to talk about Scotch spruce, Australian pine, etc.  I should like the Department to use its research branch to discover a form of tree which would be of more material and commercial use.  Take the average house built in this country.  Have we ever asked ourselves how much of the timber that goes into the construction of a house is Irish&mdash;how much Irish timber is used in building construction?  No great commercial use is being made of trees we can grow successfully and which I do not see planted to any great extent&mdash;trees such as beech and elm.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to ash, which is a very useful tree of wide utility, and has been used in aeroplanes very successfully, as Deputy Kennedy pointed out.  Here in this country we are in very great danger of our national game becoming extinct through want of good class ash hurleys which are very difficult to obtain at present, particularly in small sizes for schoolboys.  They have become very expensive owing to the great scarcity of ash.  I think the cultivation of ash is one form of forestry which should be taken up by our Government Departments and forestry classes.  As I say, the national game is in great danger of extinction within the next few years if hurleys are not forthcoming in greater numbers than they have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to replanting <Col N="32" /> and fault has been found that trees have been allowed to be cut down and no replanting done.  I do not think that is very general.  I think the Civic Guards keep a watchful eye out for any vandalism which might take place in the way of destruction of trees.  I do not think that anyone cuts down trees to any great extent without getting the necessary permission to do so.  A lot of clearing was done during the last Great War, and many of the districts cleared then have never been replanted.  Some of these areas ought to be taken up for planting.  I am surprised that some of the Department's inspectors do not agree that some of these lands are suitable for timber growing.  In the County Limerick, towards the hills on the northern side, there is an extensive acreage which was inspected some time ago by an inspector who thought it was not suitable for the cultivation of trees.  There are many places in the valleys in the centre of West Cork between the Lee and the Bandon which have not been availed of where there is distinct evidence of there having been forests in the old times.</P>
    <P>The trouble, of course, is to get large belts in the one ownership.  That could be got over by taking over places which are near to one another within a couple of townlands, but which might belong to half-a-dozen owners.  I think that would be a very economic way of dealing with the matter.  Instead of getting 300 or 500 acres in the one ownership, you might get lots of 100 acres within a certain distance of each other.  I understand that the difficulty with regard to taking less than 300 acres is the cost of fencing which makes it uneconomic.</P>
    <P>A question has also been raised about the difficulty of getting good lands for afforestation.  Some people are of the opinion that any sort of waste land would grow trees.  That is not so.  Some trees require a good deal of nutriment in the soil and will not grow in places where a lot of people think they would grow.  Waste land is not suitable for forestry in all cases.  Sometimes it requires good land, but there is a lot of good land <Col N="33" /> such as mountain slopes and the sides of rivers and mountain sides where the land is good but cannot be cultivated because of its steepness and that is the sort of land that could be planted.</P>
    <P>Has the Department made any advance in trying to secure the kind of tree that might be grown satisfactorily on the south-western slopes of our seaboard, a tree that would withstand the prevailing winds from the ocean?  The whole south-western coast of Cork, Kerry and Clare and the land along the mouth of the Shannon is practically denuded of trees.  It would be of great importance that the Forestry Department should see whether they could get the kind of tree that would withstand the breezes from the western and southern ocean.  On the whole I am satisfied that this Department of afforestation is worthy of support. The money spent on it is money well spent; it gives good employment and it will give a good return.  I am glad to see that there is an increased amount provided by way of grants to private persons and public bodies for planting trees.  That shows that there is more appreciation from private persons of the need for growing trees to beautify the countryside.  I think that even still the amount set apart this year, £700, is too small and I hope it will grow and also that the people generally will appreciate that there is a great deal of help available from the Department towards encouraging the growing of trees.  I hope an effort will be made to make that even better known and have it brought home to all the people with available land.  The whole work of the Forestry Department is one which, in my opinion, should appeal very strongly to everyone who has the interests of the country at heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points that I would like to raise on this Vote.  First of all I want to ask the Minister if he would tell us the cause of the delay in proceeding with the afforestation schemes in Glenahall, Glenadagh and other districts in the County Longford?  An extensive portion of land was examined some years ago for the purpose of afforestation, in <Col N="34" /> that area, but I notice that nothing has since been done.  I am aware that the land is perfectly suitable and there is an extensive amount of it&mdash;700 to 1,000 acres.  That is a very bleak area and plantations there would be very beneficial to the county.  In other areas of North Longford, substantial areas of land are available and I appeal to the Minister to direct the attention of his inspectors to these areas with a view to their reafforestation.  Prior to the big war of 1914-18 we had large wooded tracts in the County Longford but during the war these were cut down and taken away by contractors and others. The result is that the once nicely wooded countryside is now very bleak. I am satisfied that the fertility of the adjoining lands has been seriously injured by the removal of this timber. I urge the Minister that in a special case like this he would agree to the taking of smaller areas than 300-acre sections for planting.  In that district the farms are very small.  The majority of the holders are smallholders and it is therefore very difficult to get a 300-acre belt.  It appears that is the minimum that the forestry branch will consider. However, in a district like Longford and North Longford in particular I would urge the Minister to review that figure of 300 acres.  Even though it may not be an economic proposition at the moment, eventually it will be money well spent in restoring the fertility of the land and in giving employment in the district where employment is so badly needed.  I regret to say that I do not feel myself in a position to pay any tribute one way or another to the forestry branch of the Department because the amount of activity in which they have indulged in Longford is not as much as I would like to see.  When they proceed with tree-planting with more vigour and especially when they proceed with the planting of less than 300-acre belts, I will try to join the tributes that have been paid to this branch of the Department this evening.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes have put before the House the principle of men <i>versus</i> trees.  Deputy Hughes also referred to the difficulties <Col N="35" /> of the forestry branch which I had previously mentioned in acquiring land by reason of claims from local graziers. As Deputies who have listened for years to the debates on afforestation will easily understand, reasonably good land is required for tree planting.  The type of land which may grow trees and even belts of timber may not be sufficiently good to grow forests on an economic scale.  What we have to bear in mind is that very considerable sums of money are being spent on planting and we want to see that when the time comes and these plantations have become mature, the country will reap a proper return from that expenditure. Land that is not reasonably fertile will not give that return.  After a number of years it will be quite clear that the crop it gives is not going to be profitable.  This branch has tried therefore to secure reasonably good land for its operations.  Undoubtedly, there is a certain demand in the country that arable land which the forestry branch has been trying to acquire, or has acquired, should be divided amongst local persons who require it for ordinary agricultural purposes. But as Deputy Moore has very properly pointed out, if we are going to admit the principle that the forestry branch is not going to be allowed to secure suitable land which it requires or that it may not proceed to plant such suitable land after it has incurred expense, trouble and time in taking it over, that would be really making afforestation operations very difficult. There is, I need hardly say, a considerable amount of work in settling questions of title in acquiring these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately in the western areas we cannot go as far as we would like in the matter of afforestation schemes. It has, I think, already been explained to the House that the experts who have had this question under examination for a considerable time, and who have visited practically all those areas, are of opinion that from the point of view of large-scale afforestation work on an economic basis, it would be very difficult indeed to do much in some of the western areas. These experts have had experience, <Col N="36" /> as practical administrative workers in this country over a long period of years, and are, in addition, men of the highest scientific standing in the work.  Apart from the difficulty that a great many of these areas, which are suggested as suitable, are wind-swept, very exposed, and therefore extremely unlikely to be suitable for afforestation, you have the trouble also that the soil is not suitable. One may find certain areas in patches here and there reasonably sheltered, but the number of cases&mdash; Deputies who know the circumstances will themselves realise this&mdash;where there are also good soil foundations for planting, are comparatively limited. The Government and the branch would be only too happy to do more in these areas, but we have to keep in mind that a return is expected from this work, and it is our duty to see that the money which the Oireachtas places at our disposal is spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The case which Deputy Hughes cited is an example of the obstacles with which the Department has to contend in dealing with the claims of local graziers.  That particular case occurred before I became responsible for the branch.  It appears that a number of tenants who were in the habit of taking grazing from the owner claimed, after the place had been taken over and the branch was about to start operations, that they had certain rights.  If the Department has waived its rights as the legal owner and given up its programme of planting in such cases, that does not mean that we are in the future going tamely to submit, after we have acquired land for planting and have gone to considerable expense in taking it over, to local claims which do not appear to have any legal foundation. The economic position of local people is taken into consideration by the very large and expensive Department for which I happen to be responsible at the moment&mdash;the Land Commission.  I dare say that Deputy Hughes would be one of the first to complain that the Land Commission was, perhaps, too active and was extending its operations too widely in the country.  We <Col N="37" /> have heard that complaint frequently. Here is a large organisation which exists for the purpose of satisfying, so far as possible, the needs of uneconomic holders of the smaller type and for making land available for them.  It does not seem fair, when the Forestry Branch takes over land, largely for the purpose of giving employment in the area and benefiting the district, that it should meet with these obstacles.  I would not say so much about the matter were it not that there is such a large amount of land in dispute at the present time&mdash;about 4,800 acres.  That is a very large proportion of the reserve of land which we have and, at least, 3,500 acres of that would be planted if the local people who claim to have these rights, which are very doubtful from the legal standpoint, would allow the branch to proceed. There is another important point at issue&mdash;whether Deputies and the community see clearly that it is the community that suffers in cases of this kind.  A small number of individuals may benefit, if they succeed in having their claims upheld, but the community as a whole, and particularly the taxpayer, loses.  A great deal more is required in the way of educating the public to appreciate that, when damage is done either by setting up claims of this nature or by destroying the property of the Forestry Branch or impeding the functions which it has to perform, it is the community which suffers.  In the first place, it suffers financial loss.  In the second place, if a wrong state of mind is allowed to prevail in connection with afforestation or any other operations under Government auspices, where is it going to stop?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the question of felling.  It is the policy of the Department to insist upon replanting where felling takes place.  Every day I am signing orders for prosecutions, but neither that fact nor the fact that a considerable number of cases is being reported to us by the Gárda necessarily means that all cases in which felling is illegally taking place have come under notice.  The Forestry Act, 1928, requires that no tree be felled without the prior lodgment <Col N="38" /> of a felling notice.  Approximately 3,000 notices are received each year and, of these, about 90 per cent. are allowed to go unquestioned.  In those cases, however, in which a large number of trees are involved or which constitute a large proportion of the total number of trees on the holding, it is necessary to have an inspection made in order to ascertain whether the felling may be permitted in whole or in part and whether any replanting condition should be imposed.  The difficulty of importing timber under present conditions and the greatly increased cost of seed timber has stimulated the demand for native timber, preferably in large lots, and so has increased considerably the work thrown on the forestry division by the Act.  The position is that any action in restraint of felling must be taken within 21 days of the date of the lodgment of the felling notice and as, in view of the numbers of cases now being dealt with and the limited number of inspectors available, it is not possible to ensure inspection and report within the period, prohibition orders are issued in all cases where inspection is considered necessary.  The Gárdaí are requested, when serving such orders, to notify applicants that such is being done pending inspection, but sometimes applicants are under the impression, which may be quite wrong, that felling has been definitely and finally forbidden.</P>
    <P>Deputies who remember the wholesale felling of timber during the last war and the lack of replanting to replace the timber felled will agree that this must not be allowed to occur again.  The number of inspectors available for this work, is, however, limited and these officers have a considerable amount of other work to do in connection with the purchase of land for State planting and the supervision of the existing forest areas, so that it is not always possible to deal immediately with all the notices received but every effort is being made to reduce delays to a minimum.  Applicants themselves can assist to this end by seeing that the trees to be felled are plainly marked.</P>
    <P>To meet the increased demand for <Col N="39" /> native timber, the forestry division is putting on the market as many lots of timber as possible compatible with sylvicultural requirements.  Trees have occasionally to be retained on an area for shelter or amenity purposes or for seeding purposes where natural regeneration can be effected and the cost of planting saved.  The Department is not, however, prepared to allow timber merchants to select individual trees here and there throughout the woods to suit their own immediate requirements. Timber will generally be sold only in blocks to clear the ground for replanting. Private owners would be well advised to adopt a similar procedure. The removal of the best trees in any wood means usually that when the owner comes to sell the remainder he gets only a very poor price and finds the cost of replanting excessive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the slowness in dealing with correspondence. All I can say is that the inspectors are very busy and can scarcely cope with the additional work that has been imposed upon them in connection with the inspection of lands to be acquired and also in connection with felling. Not alone is there a yearly growth in the total acreage under timber, but the amount of thinnings that has to be dealt with is increasing considerably.  Last year, for example, 1,000 acres had to be thinned, and that takes up a considerable amount of the inspectors' time.  I would ask Deputies, therefore, to have a little patience and, if there are some delays in connection with the acquisition of land or in connection with the felling of trees, to remember that the inspectors are doing the best they can. I know that the Forestry Branch is doing its utmost under the new conditions, and I have not heard any great complaints with regard to slowness in dealing with the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to a case in Longford.  It does not seem that the particular lands referred to there have been acquired.  The prices that the Forestry Branch are prepared to offer there, and which they consider right, are, evidently, not considered sufficiently attractive, and we prefer to <Col N="40" /> acquire land by voluntary agreement so far as possible.  If suitable areas could be acquired, even though they be far below 300 acres in extent, so long as they are within easy distance of a forestry centre, I am sure that the Forestry Branch would be very glad to investigate the possibility of acquiring such lands.  We are constantly acquiring lands&mdash;in Wicklow, for example&mdash; which are much less in extent than 300 acres, but we only acquire such lands where they are adjacent to a forestry centre.  In such a case it might be economical to acquire such lands, whereas there might be other cases where it might not be an economic proposition to take over an area for forestry purposes, even though a great deal more than 300 acres might be available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill referred to certain types of hard wood.  I think that Deputies may rest assured that, whereever the lands are suitable for the cultivation of such woods, the Forestry Branch will do its utmost to see that hard wood is planted in a fair proportion. About 12 per cent. hard wood is being planted at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the Appropriations-in-Aid.  It is quite true that the amount mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate, taken last November or December, has been exceeded.  The Estimate, which was set down at £12,000 then, was made out under somewhat different conditions to those which now obtain.  We were not aware then that prices would increase at the rate at which they have increased, but in any case the amount of sales would have been controlled to approximate to the Estimate of £12,000, as the quantity of timber in the hands of the Forestry Branch, which is matured and marketable, is a very limited quantity indeed.  The resources of the branch are not large; they are very limited, and it is necessary to ration out the amounts which are for sale, but owing to pressure from various sources, that more timber should be placed on the market, since the last Supplementary Estimate was introduced the income has exceeded the Estimate very substantially and should approach somestantiall <Col N="41" /> thing like £17,500 for the current year. There is a considerable demand&mdash;and we hope that it will be a very profitable one&mdash;for pit timber.  The Forestry Branch is going into the question of the supply of such timber, and it is possible that a very profitable series of transactions may result.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell also referred to the matter of income-tax in this connection. I think I may say that the Forestry Branch will be very glad to give any land owner particulars as to the Schedules under which a private woodland owner may be assessed for income-tax in this regard.  Of course, the Revenue Commissioners are the real authority in such matters, but the Department will be glad to advise such owners who contemplate planting as to how they may secure legitimate relief from income-tax.  I should be glad if Deputy Dockrell, or any other person, would send me particulars of owners of such land who would be prepared to pay the Department for carrying on plantation work for them, and I shall have the matter investigated.  We would be only too glad to encourage private owners, and to give them all the assistance in our power to enable them to go on with planting work.  I think, Sir, that these are the chief points to be dealt with.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures; for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940, and the Air-raid Precautions Act, 1939; and for a Grant-in-Aid under the Red Cross Act, 1938.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Army Vote, 1939-40, is necessitated by certain factors which have arisen since the presentation of the annual Estimate for 1939-40 to the Dáil.  The first and principal factor is the mobilisation of the Reserve and Volunteer forces following on the proclamation of a state of emergency last September, and the retention of a considerable portion of those forces in permanent service. The additional cost of that mobilisation and retention in permanent service is distributed over some 23 sub-heads of the present Estimate, but the total cost is approximately £499,397, made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The second factor causing this Estimate is the purchase of mechanical transport vehicles for the Army, and the necessity of laying in reserve stocks of certain commodities such as fuel, medicines, defence stores, etc., vital for the maintenance of the Army.  The additional cost of the transport vehicles was £120,056.  The cost of reserve stocks, such as defence stores, etc., was approximately £159,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> The third factor is constituted by what for Estimate purposes are considered &ldquo;new services&rdquo;, in that the services are either completely new, or revive old services which had lapsed, or expand services already existing.  In that sense, no less than five new services are covered by the present Estimate.</P>
    <P>The first and completely new service is a Grant-in-Aid of £1,000 to the Irish Red Cross Society.  The Dáil will remember that under Section 2 of the Red Cross Act, 1938, the Minister for Finance may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, afford assistance to the society by way of grant or loan on such terms and conditions as he shall think proper.  Following on that enactment a Grant-in-Aid of £1,000 was made to the society to enable it to begin its activities, and the Dáil is now asked to give its covering authority for that grant.</P>
    <P>The second and completely new service is the provision of grants to local authorities for works carried out in respect of air raid precautions.  In a White Paper laid before the Dáil 12 months ago, it was stated that the Government would undertake responsibility for paying, at the cost of the Exchequer, grants to local authorities amounting to a certain percentage of their expenditure on approved schemes. That promise was implemented when the Oireachtas passed the Air Raid Precautions Act on the 26th July, 1939.  Under that Act certain schemes throughout the country have either been approved or are under investigation, and it is estimated that the cost of such schemes to the Exchequer during the present financial year will amount to about £60,000 and that sum, accordingly, has been provided for in the present Estimate.</P>
    <P>In the same White Paper was indicated the Government's intention to set up a coast watching service and a coast patrol service.  The officers and men required for the coast watching service have been found from the personnel of the Army and the service has been functioning for some time past. The coast patrol service is now being <Col N="44" /> organised and the Dáil in this Estimate is being asked to approve of that service under the title &ldquo;marine coast watching service&rdquo;.  The service, when established, will comprise four patrol vessels or trawlers and six torpedo boats, and in this Supplementary Estimate provision is being made for two of the four patrol vessels and three of the six torpedo boats.  One of the patrol vessels has been transferred from another Department, a second has been purchased, and negotiations are in progress for the purchase of the remaining two.  As regards the torpedo boats, orders have been placed for six, one of which has been delivered, and five of which are under construction.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the four trawlers and the six torpedo boats will be approximately £269,822, and of that sum £110,000 is being borne on this Supplementary Estimate, leaving a balance of £159,822 to be borne on the annual Estimate for 1940.  In addition, the maintenance of the boats and their stores will cost during this year £4,000.</P>
    <P>Each patrol vessel will have a complement of about three officers and 20 men, and each torpedo boat, two officers and eight men.  The present Estimate provides for crews for two patrol vessels and three torpedo boats, and their cost in pay and maintenance up to the end of March will be about £4,902.</P>
    <P>The fourth new service covered by this Supplementary Estimate is made necessary by the passing of the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940, and the sum of £5,000 will, it is estimated, cover expenses in connection therewith during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The final new service covered by this Estimate is the co-ordination of defensive measures, and the sum of £7,056 provided covers both the office of the Minister for Co-ordination and the censorship service controlled by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The censorship was established at the beginning of September on the outbreak of the European War as one of the measures which, in the Government's view, it was necessary to take at once in the interests of national defence <Col N="45" /> and public safety.  The authority for the censorship is, of course, the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and the Emergency Orders which have been brought into operation with the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The censorship has been organised in three executive divisions to deal with postal, telegraph and press censorship respectively.  The whole organisation is under the direction of a controller who is responsible to the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures in matters of policy.</P>
    <P>In the case of the postal and Press censorship, it has been found possible to centralise the staffs in Dublin, but for telegraph censorship it has been necessary to instal small technical staffs at points where messages are received and dispatched.  The bulk of the staff employed is engaged on postal censorship, where large numbers are required, and the staffs of the telegraph and Press censorships are relatively small and would be even smaller were it not for the fact that in these two branches relays of staffs have had to be provided to cover the longer hours of working.</P>
    <P>The entire personnel for all branches of the censorship service has been recruited from the Civil Service.  In the majority of cases officers have been loaned without replacement from other Departments whose normal activities have had to be curtailed in the present situation.</P>
    <P>Summarising what has been said, it will be seen that the three factors which have emerged since the presentation to the Dáil of the annual estimate for 1939 will cost £970,411, made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Against that gross sum of £970,411, there is a set-off by way of technical savings on the annual estimate of £970,401, leaving a net token sum to be voted of £10.  These technical savings have accured, because certain items of special capital expenditure provided for in the annual estimate have not been delivered during the financial year.  In the White Paper already referred to, it was stated that the sum of £1,368,685 was being borne on the annual estimate for 1939 in respect of capital stores, but the Dáil was warned that although no time had been lost in placing orders for the materials required, the delivery of such was a matter beyond our control.  The possibility then visualised has unfortunately materialised, and we have not been able to get delivery of many of the stores ordered.  That is the main reason why we are not asking for a gross vote of £970,411, but simply a token vote of £10.</P>

      <P>I must say that I cannot consider the statement read by the Minister an explanation of the expenditure of £900,000.  We had from the Minister a statement of how this sum of practically £1,000,000 is made up, but there was no explanation and no justification for undertaking the expense.  He segregated it out quite distinctly.  For that we are thankful. It saved us a certain amount of arithmetical trouble so far as we ourselves are concerned, but he gave no indication as to how the money now asked for in these various services, old and new, will be of any service to this country.  He comes in, in a way that is now unfortunately becoming a habit with the members of the Government, with a bald statement of the money that they need, but if you ask why the answer is &ldquo;We will not give you any <Col N="47" /> information&rdquo;.  On this Vote we have not yet had the opportunity of asking why, but in the statement we have heard there is no information and no justification given of the various heads either in connection with the old or the new services.  Consequently before a Vote of this kind can be passed, before, I suggest, the debate can come to an end, we will require a justification from the Minister of the expenditure under the various headings.  On this matter we have, especially since September onwards, pressed very seriously on the Government to give us information which would enable us to form some kind of a judgment as to whether the increased expenditure, in the present economic and financial position of the country, is justified.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, you have listened to the statement by the Minister from start to finish, and not one word was in palliation of this expenditure of close on £1,000,000.  Apparently, the justification is that the Minister, having &ldquo;saved&rdquo; £1,000,000 elsewhere, he might as well spend it.  He has saved £1,000,000, because on the last occasion he estimated he could spend £1,000,000 on stores.  The question was put to him then where he would get the stores: the question was put to him the other day how we would get these stores, and the only attempt to deal with these questions is that his hopes were unfortunately not borne out.  He was not able to get them.  Is he in any better position to-day to get them?  He saves £1,000,000 because he is not able to spend it, but he will admit, I am sure, that having an Army without ammunition is not a very effective piece of defence policy in modern times.  But he was not able to spend that money to buy stores.  The question was put to him last week, I think it was, whether he could get these stores.  He said he could, but he refused to say how.  Again, if I may point out to you, that is a habit that is becoming almost endemic with the Government, namely, a refusal to give any information to the country or to the House.  There is no reason why the Government should adopt such a policy&mdash;a blank refusal to give information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The first thing that will strike the House as strange is to find one Minister answering for another&mdash;I mean it would be strange, if anything could be strange in the administration that we are discussing at the present moment. The Minister for Defence and the ex-Minister for Defence march in here, and you never know which of them is going to answer.  In fact, neither of them answers.  I thought that the Minister, who was responsible for the other Minister, so far as this Estimate is concerned, that he at least would attempt to give a justification for the other Minister's existence&mdash;I mean his Ministerial existence.  What does the Minister for Co-ordination do?  He controls an executive officer who is also his private secretary, and a typist.  Is that serious?  The censorship could have been quite as well controlled by other Ministers&mdash;by the Minister for Defence.  I doubt if his duties are so heavy that he could not have undertaken the censorship as a portion of his work&mdash;he and the Minister for Justice. Or is it that it is necessary for the Minister for Co-ordination to keep peace between the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice.  What does he co-ordinate?  The three torpedo boats and the land Army?  Now, we have been asking for information about this particular service for quite a while, and here we have an Estimate coming before the House for the first time, with no justification whatsoever for the existence of that Minister. What does the Minister for Co-ordination do except give his moral support to his successor in an Army debate? What work has he?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to co-ordinate the old Army and a new Navy, the old Army and the new Volunteers; such co-ordination is the responsibility of the Minister for Defence&mdash;and we have grave doubts how some of it is done.  What does he then co-ordinate? What are his functions?  Why is there a salary of £1,700 a year paid to a Minister whose functions and whose duties have never been explained to this House?  Will the Minister adopt the usual procedure and refuse to give the information?  Is the work of his <Col N="49" /> colleague, the Minister for Co-ordination, so important and so vital to the nation that what he does cannot be disclosed? Is he like Providence?  Does he work in secret, and are all his good deeds done in secret?  Must the country be kept ignorant of the immense services that he is rendering to the country at the present moment?  What is his relation to the Minister who now answers for his salary, the Minister for Defence?  Is he his colleague, or is he subordinate to him?  I presume that the person who has to justify his existence and his policy is not the Minister himself but the Minister for Defence who answers for this Vote.</P>
      <P>But that is a minor point.  The real point, so far as the Minister and his salary are concerned, is that we have never heard a single word of justification for the creation of this position&mdash; unless he is the Minister without portfolio. Is this the portfolio or not?  It is within the power of the Cabinet, I understand, to transfer from one Minister to another various functions and duties.  What functions and duties have been transferred to the present Minister for Co-ordination? Practically half the sum asked for here is due to the mobilisation.  The Minister will remember that this side of the House always has questioned what was done then.  We questioned it last September, we questioned it last January, and we question it now.  What was the value of the mobilisation at a time when the country was faced with the most serious financial and economic crisis, outlined, not merely by people on these benches, but by members of the Government on the opposite benches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let the Minister read the statement of his colleague, the ex-Minister for Finance, on the occasion of the last Budget.  Let him read the gloomy picture of his colleague, the present Minister for Finance, in the Supplementary Budget which was introduced before the end of last year; and then let him try to justify, if he can, this expenditure of money.  Again and again, we have asked him and members of the Government what they expected to gain, what they had in view, in calling up an extra number of people <Col N="50" /> to the colours.  What precise trouble did they foresee?  How did they prove, or show&mdash;or attempt to show&mdash;that an increase in the personnel of the Army put this country in a better state of defence?  Did it?  Is a mere increase in numbers of that kind a guarantee or a proof that we are in a better state of defence, especially when £1,000,000 is to be spent on stores which cannot be got?  The Minister may say he was hopeful about stores last September: I presume he is still hopeful.  The fact remains that the Government never have put up a case to show what events they had in view facing the Army&mdash;the regular Army, plus the reserves and the Volunteers&mdash;which it would not be possible for the small regular Army to deal with effectively.  Again and again, we have urged that question from these benches, but without getting any answer.</P>
    <P>Is this expenditure for the purpose of preserving our neutrality, or for the purpose of the effective preservation of our independence, if it were threatened seriously by either of the two big sides at present engaged in the war?  The Government has never shown in either of those two contingencies that the measures they have taken will increase our effectiveness in the slightest.  The Minister knows that if it suited one of the belligerents at the present moment to land an army in this country&mdash;and if they were able to do it&mdash;the addition to the Army would not be able to combat them.  Now, the inability of one belligerent to land is not due to any measures the Government has taken: it is due to the interest that the other belligerent has to prevent an invasion of this country.  He is not doing it for our sake, nor for his own.  The only excuse I have ever seen that the Government could give for this increased expenditure is the existence of the European crisis.  They wished to offer some pledge that they were doing something, and the first thing that came into their heads&mdash;without any consideration or counting of the costwas to summon up a number of men.</P>
    <P>As an instance of the lack of information in the Minister's statement, let me point out that he spoke of the mobilisation and said that, where men <Col N="51" /> were called up to the colours, some of them&mdash;I think I am not misinterpreting him&mdash;were retained for permanent service.  I gathered from that that a number must have had their services dispensed with.  To what extent has that happened, and in what way has the situation changed now compared with last September?  Certainly, it is hard to draw any clear conclusion from the Minister's statement, but if there has been a diminution in the number of people with the colours and if he uses the phrase: &ldquo;Some of them are being retained for permanent service&rdquo;, I gather from that that a certain number must have been demobilised.  In what way has the situation changed? It is said that the calling up of a large number was necessary and justifiable last September; but they are going to be dispensed with now.  Our contention is that the Government could have dispensed with them all the time and could have relied upon a small welldisciplined, permanent Army.  We cannot look upon the additions which have been made to the Army by means of the volunteers as anything but a weakness in our defensive position, a weakness that, unfortunately, has cost the taxpayer a considerable sum of money&mdash;and that at a moment when every effort should have been made to cut down unnecessary expenditure.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House and to the Minister that, in the present instance, we are paying not for anything useful, but for a mere gesture; and that gesture&mdash;with all respect&mdash;has not even the merit of being impressive, either to ourselves or to outsiders.  This is a time when there certainly is no money to waste.  As everybody must admit, and as also must be admitted by his colleagues here responsible&mdash;one was, and the other is, responsible; or supposed to be, anyhow&mdash;for the finances of this country, we are faced with the prospect of declining revenue, and of diminution in production in many spheres.  Yet this is the time chosen by the Government to indulge in mere wasteful expenditure.  I wonder whether the Minister would have any objection now to giving to the House some idea as to the numbers which <Col N="52" /> were called up, in addition to the regular Army, in the mobilisation, and as to how many of them have been kept. He must know that any Power interested in us&mdash;if there is any&mdash;could easily get that information; and if he refuses to give it I can only take it that he simply refuses to give the information to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister then deals with the various heads of expenditure.  He calmly says that practically £500,000 is to be spent on what we have always held to be not merely wasteful but harmful expenditure.  It has dislocated unnecessarily the commercial life of the community.  There was no return for it in the form of a useful service to the nation.  Men were called up from their ordinary work to join the colours, for this mere display, and it cost the country £500,000.  The only thing he accomplished was a disturbance, and it cost £500,000 to do it.  Then there is special capital expenditure amounting to £275,000.  The Minister detailed how that was spent, but he did not say what useful services the nation would get from that expenditure. I gathered that in the present financial year he is going to build up half the fleet of two patrol boats and three torpedo boats.  I presume in another year we will have the other 50 per cent. of the fleet, and we can boast to the world &ldquo;In one year our fleet has been doubled; can any of the Great Powers show anything to equal that?&rdquo; See the marvellous tempo of the Irish Government.  What is the purpose of the fleet, except possibly to give his colleague, the Minister for Co-ordination, something to co-ordinate&mdash;and possibly to wear an admiral's uniform. I understood&mdash;I cannot follow their politics too closely&mdash;that they did something similar as regards the co-ordination of the forces in Great Britain. Possibly we thought we should follow suit here, and as we had not a navy we determined to invent one, so to speak. Would the Minister tell us what services those three torpedo boats and two patrol boats can give us?  What is their office?  What is their job?  He is asking for £110,000 this year; I think that is the figure.  For what?  The <Col N="53" /> Minister simply says: &ldquo;I want £110,000 for five boats,&rdquo; but he does not tell us what the boats are to do.  He comes in and asks for the money, but when he is asked: &ldquo;What are they for?&rdquo; he says &ldquo;I refuse to tell you.&rdquo;  When asked &ldquo;How will they help the commerce or defence of this country?&rdquo; he says &ldquo;I refuse to tell you.&rdquo;  Certainly he did not tell us.  What does he expect the three torpedo boats to effect?</P>
    <P>Am I right in saying that each torpedo boat has two officers and eight men?  I took down those figures from the Minister.  What does he expect those torpedo boats, each manned by a crew of two officers and eight men&mdash; I am glad it is not eight officers and two men anyhow&mdash;to do?  Does he expect them to cope with the British Navy should that be necessary, or with the German submarines if they threaten?  What is their function exactly, to say nothing of the patrol boats.</P>
    <P>The coast watching service is costly, too.  How does it work, would the Minister mind telling us?  If some people on the coast of Kerry see something floating on the surface that they think is a submarine, do they cycle into Dingle, and is a report sent to Tralee and then on to Dublin?  If it ever gets there in time what happens then?  Will there be an urgent message sent out to the submarine to wait until investigations take place as to what is happening?  And what then?  I have heard various discussions in the country as to what it is all about, as to what the coast service does, how it operates, how it functions.  All that the Minister says is that he wants so many tens of thousands of pounds for it; otherwise, he gives no information.</P>
    <P>I think it must be clear to the House that, taking the Minister's lumping together of the different sub-heads, the only information given is what is to be the total cost to the taxpayer, but no information whatever is given as to what the taxpayer is going to get for the money that is being spent, or why it is necessary.  Is that a military secret that must be kept from the potential enemy at all costs?  Perhaps the torpedo boats are used for purposes <Col N="54" /> never dreamt of by anyone else, some new class of service that other nations are not fortunate enough to have happened upon?  Otherwise, why the modesty on the part of the Minister in justifying his expenditure?  I will say it is a modesty that since 1932 has always characterised the Minister responsible for that Department, the refusal to give information, the objection that a speech is not helpful, as if it is not the business of the people in this House, when money is asked for, to demand to be told why, and to ask the Minister to put up at least the semblance of a case that it is being spent for some useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I certainly am not going to try to disentangle the question of A.R.P. except to say that the Minister added nothing to the information that has already been put before the House. But I will say this for him: by refusing to give any additional information he has not added to the confusion which prevails in the House and the country as to how A.R.P. stands, as to whether the A.R.P. measures taken by public bodies or private individuals are due to the direct orders of different Government Departments, as I sometimes gathered, or whether as it was &ldquo;seriously&rdquo; alleged, they are due to listening in to some foreign wireless, the foreign wireless being unnamed. The fact is that there is an expenditure here of £60,000, the Government's contribution&mdash;not the full expenditure for A.R.P.&mdash;to measures that have been effected in certain counties; we have no information even as to what the counties were.  Again, is this strategical information that would be valuable to a potential enemy?  What has been done for the £60,000?  How has this expenditure of £60,000 contributed to either of the two big tasks that ought to be before the Minister for Defence, the preservation of our neutrality and the preservation of our independence?  This £60,000 is merely the Government's contribution. There is no indication as to what the local contribution is.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us.  I presume he has the figure at his disposal.  One cannot calculate it from the Government expenditure, because one merely finds a maximum ratio for the Government <Col N="55" /> expenditure, and we are not told if the maximum was given.  We are not even told whether the maximum has been given in some cases.  Perhaps the Minister might, in the course of his intervention in the debate, tell us what it cost the local authorities.  I do not know what it has cost private individuals and institutions of all kinds through the country in their vain effort to follow the advice, the commands, that they got from the different Departments.  As there is a Minister for Co-ordination he might have done a little co-ordination there.  Those who have listened to the answers given at Question Time in this House will be struck by the complete lack of co-ordination between the different Government Departments.  I must say that to present to this House a Vote of £1,000,000&mdash;much of it new expenditure; in fact, practically all of it new expenditure&mdash;and give no justification for it, merely shows the contempt that the Government has both for Parliament and for the country.  The only function of Parliament apparently is to vote the money, and the only function of the country is to pay up the money.</P>
    <P>If they ask what the money is for they are not going to be told.  It will be probably suggested that they are asking questions that should not be answered.  Why?  There is not one of the questions that I have put the Minister that could give any more information to a potential enemy than he has got already.  It must be clear to the Minister, unless he has his head very much in the sand indeed, that the only people that are kept in ignorance of what is going on are the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Is there any effort at economies in this expenditure and, if so, to what extent?  The Minister cannot pretend that that matter comes before him as something new.  From the very start the occupants of these benches insisted on the necessity for rigid economy and particularly here.  I admit that more recent statements of fromt bench opposition Deputies as to where economies could be effected did not get into <Col N="56" /> the Press but the fact remains that economies have been pressed on the Government, particularly in this service, and we should like to get from the Minister some indication that they have a sense of duty, where possible, to effect such economies.  I must confess that, if we are to judge them by their actions, I see no indication of any such awakening sense of duty on their part. A number of new services are provided. This is the first time we discuss them and are asked to provide the money for them and the Minister comes in and simply throws them to the House, saying, &ldquo;Take it or leave it.&rdquo;  Having a majority, and a crowd that will not ask him any question, that will not ask him where the money will come from or what is the use of the service, he knows perfectly well he can afford to adopt an attitude of that kind.  But in doing so he certainly is treating the House in the way in which he and his colleagues have been accustomed to treat the House, but in a way that must spell the death of Parliamentary institutions in any country.</P>
    <P>Sir, I stated at the beginning that it would be impossible without a further and fuller statement from the Minister properly to discuss an Estimate of this kind, and I put it to him that at some time during the debate he should intervene and either tell the House that he will give the information straight away or that he will refuse to give that information but, that he should be allowed to conclude, without any further statement seems absurd.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon this Vote as one which should be passed through this House without debate.  The only complaint which I think ought to come from any side of this House or from any Irishman outside this House is that we cannot vote more.  I believe we must arm and continue to arm. I believe that it is the duty of any free nation firstly to build up her army.  I have listened to Deputy Professor O'Sullivan and, for a man of his cultural attainment, I am more than surprised that he should engage for more than half-an-hour in mere political diatribe.  Not once during his speech did he indicate what Fine <Col N="57" /> Gael's policy is in relation to the Army. He indicated to us, in the same lines as Deputy Dillon would on the economic question, that we are not prepared to spend, but can he or any member of the Opposition justify the position that we, after centuries of struggle, and having won a hard fought victory, should then throw open our doors or take the risk of invasion from here, there or anywhere?  Deputy O'Sullivan asked what did the Government foresee when they were engaging in this Army and armament programme. Deputy Dillon, less than a year ago, in this House indicated that he foresaw and expected an invasion from some powers&mdash;I do not know from whom.  These were his words: &ldquo;I wonder how many Deputies realise that certain powers in Europe have contemplated an attack on Great Britain from Ireland?  Do Deputies realise that certain parties in Europe actually made plans for attack on Great Britain from a base in Ireland?&rdquo;  The Deputies on the other side of the House seem to have been informed beforehand, and were anticipating such an attack before we ever contemplated launching upon an Army or an armament expenditure such as we are doing to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the only fault that I can find with the Vote is that it is not sufficient.  We should continue to arm, and I think we should take as our text the words of Padraig Pearse: &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how nationhood is achieved except by armed men.  I do not know how nationhood is guarded except by armed men.&rdquo;  We must continue to arm in the same way as every other country in Europe has armed and is arming further.  If we look at the smaller countries particularly, there is not one single nation in Europe that I know of that has not got compulsory military training.  In practically all of the countries, so far as I can see, every man must be a soldier.  In a country like Finland, gallant Finland, as we hear it called to-day, with a population of about 800,000 more than we have, they have a standing army of 28,000 and a volunteer reserve of 100,000.  Are we prepared, in the face of any difficulty; are we prepared in the face of <Col N="58" /> no difficulty, to see that as a nation we are prepared to maintain here, as any free nation should, an army?</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Opposition's policy is in relation to this.  I do not know what their policy is in relation to the economic sphere except Adam Smith's policy, about 200 years old, often glibly spoken of here in Deputy Dillon's most up-to-date terms.  But Deputy Dillon, when speaking in this House in the debate of last year, said: &ldquo;It does seem that we could build up a very effective and valuable force in this country, to be used either in the defence of our own coast or in the defence of shipping.&rdquo;  He went on further, during the course of the same speech, to say: &ldquo;We hold that we are a sovereign and independent State responsible for our own destiny, and as such we have got to make up our minds whether or not we are doing enough to fulfil that destiny.  To do that, I think, we have got to take a reasonable stand on the principle that the first vital interest of this country is to protect Ireland and its independence.&rdquo;  I submit, Sir, that the Opposition have made the very best case possible for the maintaining of an army and for the augmentation of an army in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker.  We have made the best case possible, and it is a great comfort to me at this late hour of my life to hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy speaking from those benches in favour of the Army in such terms.</P>
      <P>It is true that we have made the best case possible because we helped to build that Army and to make it what it is, but who would suggest, some years ago, that we would ultimately arrive at the stage when a Deputy of the back benches of Fianna Fáil could find that there was nothing good enough to say for the Army?  I do not criticise him for it; I merely say: &ldquo;Thank God such a day has come.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I pass on to the details of the Vote, I should like to pay a tribute to the Army, and in that tribute I include volunteers as well as regulars. To all outward appearances, they are a splendid force physically, fully up to <Col N="59" /> the standard of any Army in the world.  I want to congratulate them on their appearance and upon their physical fitness.  I am satisfied that should their services be required for the defence of the country, they will give that service willingly.  I have only one fear, and that is that all is not just as well with the Army as it should be.  I am not going into that particular phase of the situation on this occasion, in view of the fact that there is a certain motion on the Order Paper dealing with the Army, and I would rather reserve what I have to say on that particular phase until the motion comes up for discussion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Estimate itself, I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that this House was never so unfairly treated by any Minister in charge of a Department as it has been treated this evening by the Minister for Defence.  The Estimate contains alterations in every sub-head, and as such comes under review on this Vote.  The Minister gives no explanation as to why supplies were not available, beyond the bald statement that they could not be got.  The Department saved £900,000, roughly, on supplies which they had hoped to get and then they expended that money on something else.  The Minister did not avail of this opportunity to tell us how the Army stood in regard to training and what periods were spent, or are being spent, by the various units in field exercises.  A large number of the present forces are volunteers who had only a very slight training before they were taken on permanent service.  The Minister has not told us to what extent field exercises or manoeuvres have been carried out or will be carried out in the coming financial year.  He has not told us the number of officers he has taken from the Reserve, the number he has taken off the Reserve or the number returned to their civilian occupations. I know that in that respect some considerable hardships have been inflicted on certain men.  Some officers who had good appointments in civil life were kept on in the Army contrary to their wishes, while others who were not so well placed in civil life, who had ample time at their disposal and <Col N="60" /> who would make just as efficient officers as some of those who were retained, were sent back to their civil occupations.</P>
    <P>It is an astonishing fact that the Minister for Defence carries on his Vote the cost of another Minister, and that he paid no attention whatever, in asking the House to pass this Vote, to the duties and functions of that Minister.  I think it is most unusual in Parliamentary procedure that one Minister should carry another on his back in the same Vote.  For the future, in my opinion, there should be a separate Vote for each Minister, now that the Ministers and Secretaries Act has been passed.  There is no reason why one Ministry should be tacked on to the other.  I presume the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures will, at some stage in this debate, tell us what are the duties which he performs.  I can understand certain people in this country following the standards of foreign countries in their activities, but I cannot understand the Government of this country constituting itself upon the model of a Government in another and a richer country.  A Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures would be understandable in England where there is a huge army, navy and air force and where there is a marine service and a vast quantity of supplies to be taken care of.  It would be certainly a very large undertaking for one Minister to supervise a whole group of services of that kind.  It is understandable, therefore, that a Co-ordinating Minister should be appointed in a country of that kind, but in this country we have no force of a comparable size nor are we at war.  Notwithstanding the predictions of the Prime Minister himself, that neutrality in the event of a world war was almost impossible in this country, and notwithstanding the fact that my colleague in Longford&mdash; Athlone, Deputy Victory, assured the people that in the event of our supplying food to England, we could not remain neutral, the fact is that we are neutral.</P>

I am glad they have adopted those parts of our programme that are good. We only wish that they would adopt more of them, and then perhaps there would not be so much difference existing between us.

      <P>As we are discussing this matter in friendly terms, the Chair was not supposed to hear what was said.  The Minister has made no case for this Vote.  I distinctly remember the case being made that the Army in 1931 was costing too much. The Army in 1931 was an efficient and an effective Army, with reserves that could be called into line if and when required, and at the shortest notice. While paying tribute to the Army's present formation and physique, I am not satisfied that it is as good as it was then.  I hope it is, but I think the Minister would be well advised to take the House into his confidence, and to give it a survey of the activities of his Ministry, and justify this expenditure at a time when the country is being hard pressed.  I notice that even amongst prominent Fianna Fáil supporters in my constituency, at the last meeting of Longford County Council, it was stated, no matter what anybody said to the contrary, that the agricultural and farming community were in a very bad way and that something should be done about the matter.  The effective defence that the farming community could give is being neglected, while this extraordinary expenditure is to be used on defence in another way. In my opinion that is quite wrong and should not be approved of by this House.  Therefore, I regret that I cannot approve of this Vote, and I intend to ask the House to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to oppose this Vote.  In fact, I do not agree, no matter what the circumstances, that there should be such expenditure on <Col N="63" /> an Army, having regard to the position that exists here.  I feel that it would be just as well that the people should remain slaves or become slaves as to be starved and impoverished in order to build up this kind of an Army. Information has been sought about the numbers in the Army and what its purpose is, but we have never got any definite answer.  The most definite information we got was from Deputy McCann, who is on the back benches, when he stated that it was to protect the nation and its independence.  If we are to depend on it now to defend our independence, I am sure people will feel scared.  Like Deputy MacEoin, I would like to see a decent and efficient Army here, but not one costing three times what it should cost. We have neither a contented nor an efficient Army.  Nobody in this House can get any information as to what the Army is like, its numbers, its efficiency or what it is to do.  We had numbers of volunteers drawn from various walks of life, and when they were first brought into the Army their qualification was that they should be backing a certain political party.  If they were in the I.R.A. that was the only qualification when coming in, and Civic Guards or anybody else would be afraid to give them bad characters as long as they shouted &ldquo;Up the I.R.A.&rdquo; Most of these are still in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that the Army is harbouring nests of men who might be all right in the British Army because of its nature and characteristics but who are traitors and disloyal to our Army.  That is the great trouble.  No steps have been taken to put them out.  Perhaps the Minister has been doing it quietly. This House does not know that, because we have not heard a word about what has gone on in the Army, the regulars or the Volunteers, except what we got by way of public questions. I cannot understand any sensible man, no matter on what side he is, standing up for an Army being carried on like that.  On the other hand, we had an Economic Committee set up at the instance of the Government at the time that this expenditure on the Army started, and one of the <Col N="64" /> Parliamentary Secretaries is at the head of that committee.  It does not seem to have done anything to bring about economy in the Army.  There is no doubt that economies could be brought about in the Army and that we could have a more efficient Army.</P>
    <P>In this Vote there is an item of £16,000 provided for civilians who are employed to assist the Army.  Perhaps it is necessary that the Army should employ civilians without going through the ordinary routine of the labour exchanges or without bothering who is employed.  But what is the position? In one case, of which I am very well aware, and about which I had to write to an officer, every civilian employed in a certain barracks was recommended by the secretary of a Fianna Fáil club. If the Minister wishes I will give names and also mention the barracks.  After I had written to this officer some of the civilians were let go.  What do we find soldiers in that barracks doing? I am sure the ordinary taxpayers would not object, in fact they would be glad to see them doing such work if there were not sufficient civilians available, but when men go out doing ordinary labouring work it causes bitterness&mdash;I mean such as work in sandpits and drawing sand in lorries. The Minister knows about this; yet, we have £16,000 here for the employment of civilians.  When a question was asked what the Army authorities were doing about it, or what the people at the employment exchanges were doing, the only reference to it is that the Army employs its own civilians.  I do not mind if the Army employs civilians for technical jobs but from my experience of the job in question, it was not a technical one.  There were men with families depending upon them idle, decent working men, who should have been employed there through the labour exchanges and not through the secretaries of local Fianna Fáil clubs.  That is not many months ago.  That alone would make anybody oppose this Vote.</P>
    <P>A Deputy on the opposite side said: &ldquo;We want to keep this Army to uphold our hard-won victory.&rdquo;  Does anybody think that an Army of this type, gathered up with a political halo <Col N="65" /> around their heads, brought in with the impression and assisted by Ministers to get that impression, that they were to uphold the republic, to bolster up a Party Government, or to go across the Border and fight the North, is going to be reliable?  Does anybody think that an Army in which the officers are afraid of the men, and will not even &ldquo;pull&rdquo; them, is an Army that will defend this country from invasion?  I hold that it is not, and until there is a complete cleaning-up within&mdash;and I do not hold that every Volunteer who entered the Army is bad&mdash;and until the Minister takes his courage in his hands and says: &ldquo;I will get rid of every one of them who is not loyal to this Government,&rdquo; he will never have an Army that will defend the people against internal or external trouble.</P>
    <P>I am firmly convinced that that is the kind of Army you have at present.  We had the Magazine Fort affair to which reference has been made several times. Nobody knows who is responsible.  We were led to the belief that, because of certain things done, So and so might be responsible, and there is a belief in the House that two or three officers might or might not be responsible.  They did not get even a chance of appearing before a court martial, and the impression was given to the country some weeks after the ammunition was taken away that the Chief of Staff was responsible.  Everybody looked at the paper in the morning to see who was going to resign, to see which Minister was going to resign, and the next thing we saw was that the Chief of Staff resigned.  I know that he was not responsible, but, at the same time, the odium was thrown upon him.  No responsible Minister should have put him in the position of having that odium thrown upon him, even if it were time for him to go.</P>
    <P>I am definitely opposing this Vote, and I think that even in the present world situation, and in existing circumstances, there is no ground for the spending of so much money.  We do not know what way the money is to be spent, nor do we know against whom the Army is going to defend us.  The only thing we do know is that money is being lavished wholesale, and that <Col N="66" /> there is a disbursement on a lavish scale of money on transport and on many other headings of this Vote.  We are given no information as to the money lavished on the manoeuvres that took place in an effort to get back the ammunition taken from the Magazine Fort.  On all those counts I oppose the Vote, and I think it terrible that so much money should be spent on it, in view of the position of the agricultural community and of most of the towns. This money would be better spent on the farmers and the people in the towns than on the Army.</P>

      <P>I feel rather reluctant to deal with the Army mess under the present Minister for Defence, because I think it is due to him to say that he is in the position of a farmer who took over a farm planted with weeds, and it is hard to hold him responsible for the growth of the weeds.  So far as responsibility lies with him, it is more the quiescent way in which he has been prepared to stand over the presence of noxious weeds on the land.  There is no question about this, that the Army, which every one of us had come to rely on as a shield and protection, is coming to be regarded by many thousands of people as a potential menace, and a potential menace because the doors of the Army were thrown wide open to any group of disloyal elements who wanted to go into it for the purpose of selling Army secrets and Army material. We had that dangerous state of affairs reaching its peak point in Christmas week when practically the whole ammunition reserve of the Army was passed out to people who would use it against the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way.  There are dangerous elements in the country, elements whose aim and object, ever since the establishment of this State, have been to undermine the State.  The main protective shield between the State and those elements was the Army, and one of the things that was vital was that the loyalty of every section of the Army should be <Col N="68" /> beyond question, and that a man should go through, not one sieve, but hundreds of sieves, before he was admitted to membership of that Army. But that policy was altered, and the doors were thrown wide open for any kind of a flood to come into the Army, and it is within the knowledge of every one of us, the Minister as well as the rest of us, that elements were allowed to flow in on that flood whose loyalty was not to the State, but to the type of State the Minister and others were bleating about six or eight years ago. Be that as it may, the result was that all the reserve of ammunition, 28 tons in weight, was loaded deliberately, slowly and carefully on more than a dozen lorries and scattered through the country.  We are told that there are courts martial pending, that the under-dog is going to pay the penalty, and that there is to be no investigation as to the responsibility of the politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been under investigation&mdash;a thorough investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean to suggest that any Army officer, or any group of Army officers, no matter how many pips to their shoulders, could or would be entitled to investigate the actions and activities of Ministers?  There is only one way in which the activities and the pernicious policies of Ministers in dealing with a vital service can be questioned, and that is by the Parliament, and every attempt is being made to prevent Parliament from inquiring into the Army.  The Army in every democratic country, unlike any and every other service, comes more directly under Parliament than under any Ministerial head or department.  The Army, unlike other services, is the Army of the Parliament and not the Army of Ministers or of a Ministry, and it is universally recognised all over the world, or all over the democratic world, that when there is a big, grave situation in an army, the very first step is for ministers to walk in and tender their resignations and for parliament to step in and investigate; not a group <Col N="69" /> of officers subordinate to a minister, and not a departmental group of officials subordinate to a minister or even to a government, but representatives of every section of parliament. That has been the universal procedure from time immemorial, and that is why armies are always spoken of as the armies of parliaments, and not the armies of governments.  Here, when the biggest thing that ever happened occurred, when we assembled here a couple of months ago Ministers said: &ldquo;Oh, say nothing for the present; there is an inquiry being carried out,&rdquo; and the implication left and the understanding grasped was that the ink would be no sooner dry on the report of that inquiry than it would be circulated to Deputies and to the public, so as to show that everything was above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Who implied that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister getting vocal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, who implied that?  When you say it is done by implication, you ought to say by whom it is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made here carried that implication certainly to my mind.  Might I say that it carried it to the mind of those who edit the newspapers?  Because, if the Minister reads the newspapers on the eve of the opening of the Dáil, he will see that every newspaper understood that on the first day of the opening of the Dáil the result of the inquiry would be circulated. So I am not alone in my misunderstanding. But I may tell the Minister that, if that was not the understanding of Deputies, he would have heard a lot more about it last January. The impression, at all events, left on my mind, and I can speak for myself, was that that inquiry was being held in order to inform Parliament and the Deputies in Parliament as to what the state of affairs was, but, as far as Parliament, which is the controlling body over this Army is concerned, when the inquiry was terminated the information was withheld from Deputies and from Parliament.  The whole thing was done in secret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> Now we are told that action is to be taken and that there are certain subordinates awaiting court martial; that despicable old trick of finding scapegoats down the ranks without giving Parliament an opportunity to satisfy itself that the real culprits are not higher up than any man in uniform.  It is a most unworthy and undemocratic procedure that is being followed.  It may be that certain technical offences will be found against individuals, certain casual negligence.  But do you think it is fair or just to put these people through the hoop at least until Parliament has satisfied itself that the blame and the responsibility are not higher up?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given up expecting; he is hoping.  We are asked to vote practically £1,000,000 to pay for political elements grafted on to an Army which certainly was reliable and knew how to keep its ammunition before political elements were grafted on to it.  The Minister has made several attempts to suppress discussion on the ground that certain persons are awaiting court martial.  I have ventured to suggest that, if certain persons are awaiting court martial the Minister and, above all, the Minister who sowed the seeds in the Army, should have their conduct and their policy subjected to investigation. I leave it at that in deference to the Chair.  I have heard more nonsense talked from the Government Front Bench about the Army in the last year or two than I ever heard talked about any other subject, and, if it is the result of thought, then it is evidence of muddled thinking.  I would not mind nonsense; we are accustomed to that from that Bench; I would not mind muddled thinking; we are accustomed to that, too.  But when that nonsense and that muddled thinking are converted into money and result in costing the people a few million odd pounds per year, then it is <Col N="71" /> time that we began to wade through all the nonsense to see what it is all about.</P>
      <P>We are a small island country not at war, and we either pretend or believe that there is danger of invasion.  There is no justification for the millions that are being demanded except we believe or pretend to believe that there is danger of invasion.  In order to defend our action in mobilising a comparatively huge army and in demanding millions from poor people, we point to inland European countries and we say: &ldquo;Oh, but they have mobilised.&rdquo; We try to mislead ignorant people that our danger is similar to theirs, with huge armies massed on their frontiers and with the danger in each of one or other belligerent crossing their frontiers.  We are trying to make the case as the Ministers opposite and the Taoiseach himself has made it, that because these small neutral European countries have mobilised, there is just the same case that we, here in an island, should mobilise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the danger of invasion was real, or if the Government had only taken this House into its confidence, then what we would be doing would be spending our millions to prevent any invading army reaching our shores. We would be spending these millions not in demoralising decent young fellows by keeping them tramping around barracks when they are pining to be at work&mdash;when work is there waiting for them and when the vital necessity is the production of food&mdash; we would be spending our millions on submarines to prevent the enemy coming before us.  I said before, and everybody knows it is so, that on the day it was invaded, if this country were invaded by any big belligerent, on that day the war was over.  The idea of waiting until the enemy were landed, and then putting up before them even our best, when we actually saved £1,000,000, or £970,000, by starving the Army of the supplies which we were told six months ago were vital, is purely childish.  Either we are to believe the statements we hear from the Government Benches and from the mouths of <Col N="72" /> Government Ministers, or there is no use in our coming here at all.  We had a Vote presented to us, I think it was last November, and we were asked for hundreds and thousands of pounds for armaments, munitions and machinery of war.  We were told the menace was real and the situation grave and that not a £5 note should be saved out of that huge sum&mdash;that it was all required. We were told that the last thing the Government would do would be to ask for too much.  We are now told that £970,000 of that Vote was not required at all for the purpose for which it was asked; that it could be devoted to pay, to barrack maintenance and transport, but that the armaments and munitions which were asked for could very comfortably be done without or that we could do very nicely without them.</P>
    <P>We are getting no explanation from either the Minister for Defence or his side-drummer as to how exactly the Army is faring with £1,000,000 less material than we were told was essential and vital.  Now there is a very uneasy feeling throughout this country with regard to the whole defence position. That position is, perhaps, worsened by the fact that we are living under a censorship.  Rumours were going around long before Christmas week, but they have been multiplied considerably since Christmas.  There were rumours of leakages, rumours of lack of discipline, rumours of shootings, rumours of discontent.  Those rumours were not lessened by the exhibition of a soldier in uniform retusing to stand or to recognise the courts of this country.  In that kind of a situation, with the Minister asking for the transplanting of a sum of approximately £1,000,000&mdash;which we were told was urgently required for armaments and machines of defence last September, which the Taoiseach himself said was to be spent mainly on aircraft defence and aeroplanes, should now go for pay and maintenance instead&mdash;one would imagine the Minister's usual reticence would in these circumstances be put aside and that he would attempt to take the House into his confidence. Remember that every Deputy is not simply a &ldquo;Yes-man&rdquo;, a man who comes along here to support whatever <Col N="73" /> demand Ministers place before him; that the position of the ordinary taxpayer of this country is getting rapidly worse and that even hundreds of pounds, not to say millions of pounds, must be reasonably justified here before they are demanded from this House.</P>
    <P>We have another rather revolutionary thing in this Vote.  I may be inexperienced but I never before heard of a Vote for one Department being introduced and having included within it on a back page a Vote for another Minister and another Department.  In the money sense now we are proceeding to create an expensive new Department headed by the Minister who was removed from the Ministry of Defence. We have got to approve of a rather grandiose new title, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, and that in a neutral country with 3,000,000 inhabitants and an Army of something about 20,000.  The other Minister, the senior Minister, carries the title not of Minister for the Army or Minister for War but Minister for Defence, irrespective of whether it is Army, Naval or Air.  We are to pay tens of thousands of pounds for another Minister to co-ordinate that Minister with himself&mdash;to co-ordinate Minister Traynor with Minister Traynor. No reason has ever been advanced for this arrangement in this House. Consequently the only reason one can give for it is that there is such an office in the mighty countries where there is a Minister for War, a Minister for Air and a Minister for the Navy and somebody else co-ordinating all three of them in the three Departments. So we have that expensive, unwanted and apparently useless and superfluous new Department being created now as if the money came down with the rain from the sky.  We have not even that Department standing on its own feet and coming in here like an ordinary Ministerial Department with a Vote for itself&mdash;coming in here where the whole thing can be discussed&mdash;but we have it shoved in at the tail end of a Supplementary Vote for the Department of Defence.  This is the first time the Dáil has been asked to vote money for this new Department.  One would imagine that the Minister introducing <Col N="74" /> the Vote would give some reason for such an office.</P>
    <P>Apparently, he agrees with others that he cannot advance any reason and that the easiest way to get away with it is by silence.  We know that one of the functions of that Ministry is to carry within itself the censor's department. Surely, in a country of this size and in our neutral position, neither the Minister nor the Department of Defence is so overworked that they cannot include or look after the activities of the censor's staff.  We have a picked man, an expert and experienced man, specially selected to take over the censorship department.  Is it necessary to have a special Minister and a special Ministry as well?  With the title of &ldquo;Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures,&rdquo; we have a special Minister for this purpose.  What are the defensive measures that require co-ordination? Is it that, in addition to the Minister for Defence, we want a Minister who will co-ordinate the activities of one section of the Army with another.  We have a Parliamentary Secretary to deal with A.R.P.; we have an expert to deal with censorship. Surely it is not playing the game with either the Parliament or the people at a time when money is, to say the least, getting tight to create these new expensive, superfluous, ceremonial departments with grandiose titles.</P>
    <P>I saw in a paper a quotation from a speech of one of the present Ministers when dealing with an Army estimate some eight years ago.  That Minister was deploring the extravagance and the squandering of public moneys involved in keeping an Army in a country of this size which was costing £1,000,000 a year.  He charged the Government with spending his money on extravagant ceremonial.  He was speaking either as an honest and sincere man or as a first-class humbug. If he was speaking as an honest and sincere man, is he now going to vote for four times the expenditure and the creation of a second Ministry, with increased ceremonial?  It is all very well for people who are anxious to strut about as war lords if they do it at their own expense.  This city is well stocked <Col N="75" /> with theatres and it would possibly be a popular turn to ape the European war lords there.  But we are mobilising thousands of men who have nothing to do.  When we recollect that every thousand men cost £100,000, that the people are run to the point that even much smaller sums are hard to get and that to raise revenue and pay for the grossly inflated cost of Government we have to tax every article bought by the poorest of people, then we should, at least, throw over-board unwanted Departments. We should face up to the fact that, if there is a danger of our being pulled into the war at a later stage and if the speeches made by some Ministers are true&mdash;that costs are going to rise and that financially things are going to get harder&mdash;it is a time for retrenchment, for saving every pound we can as against the rainy day, for conserving whatever we have as against the day of strain.  It is certainly not a time for squandering and it is not a time for dissipating not only our wealth but our man-power.  We are doing both.  We are asked to do that at a time when public confidence and parliamentary confidence is shaken in the Army and, above all, when that confidence is shaken in the Ministers who have charge of the Army.</P>
    <P>We are asked to say nothing about this matter because subordinates are being put through the mangle.  We are asked to vote another £1,000,000 to carry out a policy that has resulted in nothing, so far as we can see, but danger to the State.  We are asked to let that through on the ground that, in fact, it is only a £10 note because, although we were asked for £970,000 last November on the assurance of two Ministers and the Taoiseach that it was vitally necessary for specific purposes, the Ministers now ramble into the Dáil and say: &ldquo;In spite of what we said last November, we found we did not want the money and, since we did not want it, will you allow us to spend it on paying political troops&rdquo;&mdash;on the increased cost of the new political troops they have brought into what was the grandest, most loyal and most splendid little Army in the whole of Europe.  That was the case before <Col N="76" /> the politicians started playing tricks with it.</P>

      <P>I should hate to accept the thesis of Deputy McCann that the larger the Army, the greater the freedom. If he casts his eyes on the Continent of Europe, or beyond it, I think he will find that the reverse is true and that the countries with the smallest armies are the most free.  The real purpose of my rising here to-day was to extract some information from the Minister in connection with the marine coast watching service.  Included in this Supplementary Estimate is a figure for a patrol vessel which I take to be only a book-entry as it is a transfer from one Department to another. I should like to hear from the Minister what treatment was meted out to the crew of that vessel on transfer from the other Department of State.  Were they transferred with the vessel and, if not, why not?  My information is that in the case, at least, of one man, with many years' service on that vessel, on transfer from the other Department he received one week's notice. Whether that is correct or not I do not know, but, if so, it seems to me to be a sad reflection on the Government if, because of a small transfer from one Department to another, the crew must be dispensed with at such short notice as that after, presumably, they have given good and faithful service over a considerable period.  Possibly, the Minister would give us some information, when he is replying, on that subject.</P>

      <P>I think that the introduction of this Estimate, the way in which it has been done, and the significance of it, is an outstanding example of the way in which Parliament has been throttled and sandbagged by the present Government. The Army was fully mobilised in or about the first week of September last &mdash;about a week after the giving to the Government of certain emergency powers.  Within a week of the introduction of the Emergency Powers Bill, and the passing of that Bill, the Army was mobilised.  The action of the Government in mobilising the Army was quite in keeping with their mentality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Deputies will remember that when the emergency arose in the beginning of September last, even those of us in Dublin heard only on Friday afternoon, that the Dáil was being specially summoned for 3 o'clock on the following day.  It was not until 25 minutes to 12 that night that the responsible leaders of the Opposition could be shown what business was to be transacted on the following day, what Bills would be dealt with, or what powers were being taken by the Government. It transpired that the Government was taking powers, in effect, to wipe out all Bills or to add anything to these Bills that they might wish to add, and to do all these things inside the five hours.  We heard that decision at 25 minutes to 12 on Friday night&mdash;the Dáil having been summoned&mdash;and we were invited to meet the Taoiseach at 11 o'clock on Saturday morning only in order to be told what had been agreed to at 25 minutes to 12 the night before.  We were summoned simply to be told what was being done.  We did succeed, at that time, in getting the Government to take its hands off the throttle of Parliament and to allow Parliament to discuss, in its own necessarily limited time, the circumstances in which emergency legislation was being introduced, the type of the legislation and its purposes.  In other words, we were able to persuade the Government that if they wanted the assistance of Parliament or of the people of the country, they should have a discussion and the guillotine must go by the board.  As a result, the Government got the powers that they wanted. However, within a week after that, the Army was mobilised without any further consultation with members of the Opposition.  After the Government had got the emergency powers from the Dáil, without any further communication to any responsible person belonging to the chief Opposition Party in the Dáil, or to any other Party in opposition in this Parliament, the Government mobilised the Army.  Now, five and a half months afterwards, Parliament is being given an opportunity of discussing the matter.  Now, either in a state of emergency, or out of a state of emergency&mdash;but particularly in the light of what we have seen <Col N="78" /> that the Government has done and of the things that we see the Government is capable of doing, against or in the face of Parliament, by doing things to it or withholding information from it &mdash;I do not think that this Parliament can afford to continue without discussing important matters here.</P>
    <P>I think it is an outrage that the introduction of a matter as important as the mobilisation, and the retained mobilisation, of the Army, should be made in the way in which the Minister for Defence has made it here to-day. The Minister is aware that the Opposition Party, feeling their responsibilities in this matter, were prepared to act fairly and, in the main, assistfully; but the Government, in less than seven days afterwards, mobilised the Army. We conveyed to the Taoiseach what our opinion of that mobilisation was.  In the first place, we felt that the mobilisation of the Army was objectless; that there was no apparent reason in the world why the Army should be mobilised, and that, to mobilise the Army, without an object, in our circumstances here meant the removal of large numbers of men from their occupations, and a resultant loss of their earnings to their families. It meant detaching these men from their families, and also taking away the earnings that would normally be coming to these men and their families.  It meant that there was, not alone a dislocation of industrial life, but a considerable hardship on the families of these men&mdash;particularly when we consider the difficulty that men have, not alone in finding, but in holding, employment under recent circumstances.  Here there was the threat to the future of all these men: that, after whatever period in the Army they might be called up, it might be impossible for them to get back to their work.  There was that dislocation in industry and also that hardship to be faced by these men and their families, but apart from that there was the fact that, when the Army was mobilised, it had nothing to do.  Apart from what a man might feel about the inconveniences and losses occasioned by his being mobilised, he might be anxious to be an efficient part of an efficient Army in the country, and to do all that he could for the country, but he was <Col N="79" /> bound to become disillusioned, demoralised and disaffected by being mobilised to do nothing.  The steps that the Government, inevitably, would feel bound to take in order to make use of the Army in such circumstances would embrace the scattering of the men of the Army here and there, thus providing points of irritation to any disorderly elements in the country, and thus also further demoralising the Army as an institution.  I do not think that anything that was put before the Government by us at that time can be said to have been exaggerated, or can be said to have been not true, because I think the Minister must have found that everything that was said at that time turned out to be true.</P>
    <P>The principal thing that fault is found with is the enormous expense on the country at the present time arising out of the mobilisation of the Army. Others have indicated that the present Minister for Defence is not in the position of being so much to blame as the previous Minister for Defence for certain things arising out of this Estimate, but I make the present Minister for Defence entirely responsible for what I object to in the present situation.  I think that the futility and the failure of Army policy since last September&mdash;and even before that, if you like to go back before that date&mdash;is clearly indicated by the mobilisation of the Army in September last.  With a country situated as we are, it showed the utter failure of Army policy and the utter failure of Ministerial outlook that the Army should have been mobilised before the tendency in the war situation disclosed itself.  Here in a hurried week, when the Ministry did not know whether there was going to be a war or not, the Army was mobilised at a cost which, in spite of all the Minister says here in dividing his figures, is not £499,000 but £778,000.</P>
    <P>The Army has been mobilised for at least six months.  I submit that the additional expenditure in connection with defence forces, transport vehicles and all that arose out of the mobilisation of the reserves and the volunteers <Col N="80" /> and must be regarded as all part of the mobilisation scheme.  We here maintain, and have maintained, and we indicated it to the Government within a week after the volunteers were mobilised, that the mobilised Army was not wanted here; that it had no object here, and the expense of it, in the circumstances we were facing, was such that it could not be borne.</P>
    <P>Will anybody who understands the circumstances, both from the point of view of defence and general local economy in any part of this country, consider the bill that is presented here for £970,000 for six months for additional personnel for the Army?  Will he consider that amount of money and the way in which it is being spent and contrast it with the other demands that have been made for facilities for seeds and other things to enable us to dig our first line of defence&mdash;to put our agricultural industry on its feet during the present Spring so that there may be something to be harvested?  I should like to ask the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party, who seem to be so few in number when it comes to discussing an additional bill for a six months' addition to the Army, a bill bigger than the amount that they boasted the whole running of an Army should normally cost in this country? I should like to hear from either the one or the two Fianna Fáil back benchers who are here when we are discussing this huge amount what they think of the money that is put down for this additional mobilisation as compared with the amount of money we were discussing on the Seeds Bill the other day, £600,000.</P>
    <P>There is only one real danger to this country at the present time and that is the danger that we will not be able to produce enough to keep our people, on the one hand, and our expensive Government on the other hand.  What I think is a real outrage on Parliament is that a bill like this should be presented for an Army mobilised five months ago, an Army that is still here, and, as is indicated in the Book of Estimates published to-day, is going to be kept.  It is an outrage that that Bill is presented without a single word <Col N="81" /> being said to Parliament about the purpose for which the Army is wanted. If this is the Parliament of the country it ought to ask, and should be allowed to know, what dangers there are of a military kind to this country that warrant the expenditure of £1,000,000 now and that warrant additional expenditure next year of a sum as great.</P>
    <P>We are told that in 1938-39 the actual amount of money spent on the Army was £1,771,000.  In the year 1938-39 the Government spent £142 on the Army for every £100 spent on it before they came into office.  We are now being asked to give them, through this Supplementary Estimate, £183 for every £100 spent on the Army before they came into office, and it is indicated that this is the foundation upon which we are going to continue next year, and that next year £190 will be spent on the Army as against every £100 spent before Fianna Fáil came into office.  The money is asked, not so grandiloquently here, but very grandiloquently throughout the country. It is asked in order to defend our liberties, to defend our independence. If this is a Parliament at all, it will want to know, and it ought to be told, against whom we are defending this country at this additional cost.</P>
    <P>Who are the people likely to attack this country?  Are we going to be attacked from Great Britain, from Germany, from the Six Counties, by any organisation inside?  Why should Parliament not ask itself this question, and why should we not get some kind of Ministerial answer to it?  Why should people who are supposed to represent the country in Parliament, and handle its affairs intelligently and effectively, and in a way that will secure all the national interests, including its independence&mdash;why should they not discuss these things?  It has been pointed out that this is an additional bill for men as distinct from the materials that we were told were going to be bought.  Whatever it is, it is an additional bill of £1,000,000. Is it to defend our country against Great Britain?  I think the House ought to be told that.</P>
    <P>In so far as we can know from the Government, we have nothing against <Col N="82" /> which to defend ourselves from Great Britain, that is, there is nothing in the policy of Great Britain, so far as either the Ministers or we know here, that would suggest that there is any reason to prepare ourselves for defence against Great Britain.  We are told the British have not sought facilities in our ports; the British have not sought any war assistance from us; the British have been scrupulous in their recognition of our declaration of neutrality in this war.  Is there any reason why we should not accept as sincere and definite Ministerial statements on these matters?  Is there any reason why we would not interpret the suggestion that is made by Ministers to the House that our declaration of neutrality has been respected by Great Britain?  Is there any reason why the House would not interpret this declaration as indicating that we do not need to build up an Army because of any danger from Great Britain?</P>
    <P>We have been told explicitly that the German Minister has conveyed to the Government here that Germany recognises our neutrality.  Has there been any sign on sea or land, or any indication of any kind, to suggest that our liberties are endangered from the German side?  I think that six months after war was declared, and six months after continuing to carry on whatever normal trade we have been able to carry on outside, it is no harm to ask that question when presented with a bill of this kind, and to hear the Government tell Parliament, as clearly as they think they can, whether our liberties are threatened from the German side.  If there is any danger either from the Six Counties side or from any internal situation here, then I think the Government should discuss that in the fullest, clearest and most open detail with the House.  Lack of discussion, if there is danger, is only going to allow a kind of conspiracy to breed in a kind of silence outside.  It is going to allow worse than a conspiracy to breed in the silence of Ministers, because it is going to allow inefficiency, a lack of grip on the situation, and a detaching of themselves from the assistance that Parliament and public opinion can give <Col N="83" /> them.  That is what silence on the Ministerial side is going to give us. A thing like that is even more dangerous than silence under the conspiracies that can grow either here or in any place in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister for Defence that, with his particular responsibilities for the Army, with his general understanding of the country and with his joint responsibility with his colleagues in the Government, he does not appear to have given any thought to what he is doing to-day.  I appeal to him to realise what he is doing.  He is asking the House, for the first time, whether it approves of the Vote of £1,000,000 to pay for the mobilisation of the Army that took place in September last, but the Minister has not told the House a single thing about that.  I ask him to contemplate what he is doing, and to tell the House why the Army was mobilised in September last: to tell the House why it is going to be continued to be mobilised.  If the Minister does that, then we can meet on fair, reasonable and decent grounds, using our intelligence to deal with that situation, and to discuss it across the floor of this Parliament where, I suggest, it must be discussed. If the Minister does not face up to his responsibilities in that kind of way, and if he does not lead and help the House to discuss this matter, then he is going to fail miserably on his job.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Defence fails miserably on his job to-day, he may, as a consequence of that, bring very serious trouble on the country.  At any rate, he will inevitably bring this trouble on it: he will bring expense on the country that it cannot bear.  We are simply throwing down a sewer, from which none of it will come back, hundreds and thousands of pounds beyond the million mark on the Army to-day, money that is very badly wanted for other things.  If that money is not used on other things, as distinct from the Army, and if the Army cannot be paid for, then I shudder to think of the economic situation that is going to face the men who have been mobilised into the Army, and of the men in the Army if they are kept in it for another two <Col N="84" /> or three years at this expense.  I shudder to think what their position is going to be in a country that has had this financial blister on it for two or three years, when the time comes for their demobilisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been fair to the Army, he has not been fair to himself or to the country, and he certainly has been particularly destructive of the idea of Parliamentary institutions in this country because of the way he treated the House to-day.  I entreat him to realise, from the point of view of an Irish Parliament, what he has been doing here to-day.  I ask him to help an Irish Parliament in the only way that it can be helped, and that is by having a serious, open and clear discussion of what it is doing.  It is being asked to vote £1,000,000 to increase the Army.  Parliament ought to know why it is necessary to increase the Army.  The Minister ought to have sufficient knowledge and experience after six months of a war situation to be able to talk to Parliament.</P>

      <P>I am at a disadvantage in having to dispute anything that comes from the Chair, but I do wish to point out that this Estimate, taken in conjunction with the Estimate we had last year from the Minister for Defence, shows a divergence, and that there is much antagonism between the two.  Really, the question of policy never, to my mind, <Col N="86" /> loomed more prominently in the Estimate of the Minister for Defence than it does on this Estimate.  Last year, when we were committed to an expenditure of something like £5,500,000 for equipment, if there was one matter more than another stressed by the Minister for Defence it was the change that had taken place since he became responsible for the Department of Defence, the change that had taken place in the extra sum that had been allotted each year for munitions, warlike stores, and so on.  He told the House that it had varied from having been 5 per cent. before he took office up to 12½ per cent. in his own time.</P>
      <P>Last year the case that was made by the Prime Minister was that there was £1,000,000 for guns and £1,000,000 for aeroplanes.  This Estimate is an Estimate which is responsible for the grand larceny of a £1,000,000 out of that £2,000,000.  Instead of purchasing warlike stores we are spending it on other things.  I do not think that there was ever a more deceitful transaction before this House.  Last year the Minister for Defence asked for money, it was voted to him, he got it; he is succeeded by a Minister now who has spent the money for another purpose.  What is that? Why, the courts of this country are full of evidence of people being prosecuted for that sort of thing.  The Minister got money for munitions; he has spent it on something else.  Has he saved the money on the munitions?  Apparently, he has saved practically £1,000,000. The case that was made, not only by the Minister for Defence but by the Prime Minister himself was that we now had an Estimate far bigger than ever before for warlike stores&mdash;for munitions, ammunition and so on&mdash;and we spent it on coast watching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more than administration in that&mdash;very much more.  There is an absolute negation of the policy of the Department of Defence as we knew it or as we were told it was 12 months ago.  Some of <Col N="87" /> these items are much more striking than others.  While we can increase the national expenditure very much in the short space of 12 months, this Estimate gives us no idea of the actual increase that has taken place during the 12 months.  Last year we were presented with a document&mdash;on the occasion of the discussion on the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Defence&mdash;in which the pay of officers, cadets, non-commissioned officers and men was provided for to the extent of £572,686.  The Minister asked for £686,839.  Now, the new Minister for Defence has spent £931,361.  He got no authority from the Dáil for that, no authority of any sort or kind.  I do not know whether he has made any case to the Dáil for it or not.  I would like to know how he seeks to justify it.  It is a sum of £350,000 over and above the Estimate voted 12 months ago.  For what purpose? Is it to protect this State?</P>
      <P>If we are to take the evidence with which we were furnished on the 23rd December last, it would appear that we have mobilised these troops on an occasion of national emergency.  For the first time for something like 13 years, the Army had to go on active service.  While we have not spent money on ammunition during the year, we have had to put the Army on active service to get back what had been bought at very great cost to the State. That ammunition would certainly be needed, even for our very small Army, not to mention the Army that was mobilised.  I would like the Minister to give some justification to the House for that departure from the policy of 12 months ago.  The Dáil voted money to buy munitions: it has been spent otherwise.  We are entitled to know whether, in the case of such a large departure from the stated policy, involving an expenditure of almost £1,000,000, the Government can take that decision and then simply come to Parliament and say: &ldquo;We have done that; you pay up.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming down along these items, one is struck by the very large difference in the cost of petrol and oils.  For the year 1938-39 the sum voted amounted to £16,000, and the sum asked for this year <Col N="88" /> is £55,000.  What is the reason for the increase?  The Army may be mobilised, but it is not on active service, though it may have been for the short space of a couple of weeks.  Over three times the amount of money is to be spent on petrol and oils.  Has it gone up so much in price, or what is the reason for such an enormous increase in expense? Regarding the transport of troops, the original Estimate for 193940 is £14,672; it has gone up now to £21,000.  When we come to mechanical transport, the original Estimate was £14,419; it is now £140,000.  According to the pay&mdash;if we are to take that as a basis&mdash;we do not quite double the number of men; it has not gone up 50 per cent.&mdash;it has gone up a little over 40 per cent.; but in mechanical transport the cost has expanded by 1,000 per cent.&mdash;it is ten times as much as was anticipated.  Surely the Minister must have an exaggerated view of the wealth and the capacity of this country to meet this very large increase in expense.  Can he tell us of any business which, during the course of the last 12 months or during the course of the past seven or eight years, has expanded its mechanical transport to ten times what it was seven or eight years ago. While we may have very exaggerated views regarding the majesty of the State, after all, the State is merely the addition of all the people in it.  The State has not got all the money of all the people; the State at most can only get a portion of the income of all the people and it must behave itself with regard to public expenditure just the same as the poorest man in the State.</P>
    <P>Regarding the marine coast watching service, it is costing us £118,902.  That means fairly heavy expenditure&mdash; amounting to over £2,000 per week. What are the people paid for who are engaged in this particular phase of modern activity?  Where do they send reports?  What is the nature of the reports?  Is the Minister satisfied that it is a useful service? There have been communications from the coast life saving service people that they ought to have been employed in this service; they have had associations with the sea; they know the Morse Codes and the peculiar methods adopted by sailors <Col N="89" /> for making themselves known to their fellows and to the people in their neighbourhood.  Is this on an absolutely new foundation?  Did the Minister get it from scratch, or did he take advice from the lifeboat people or the coast life saving service in connection with it?</P>
    <P>The figure for engineer stores has gone up from £5,000 to £25,000, an excess of £20,000.  I have always a suspicion of those round figures when I see them.  There was an early method adopted in the schoolbooks, by which the answers were always even.  When a boy was doing his exercise he was always satisfied that he was right if he got an even answer.  Somehow or other it does not pan out that way in life.  We do not get it to pan out exactly to the even figure to which the school boys were accustomed.  It may be that this is merely an estimate.  We have another example of it in the case of the protection of civil population against air and gas attack.  The original Estimate showed a very odd number of pounds&mdash; £34,554&mdash;and the supplementary figure required is an even £60,000.  It may be that those who live in the cities know all the intricacies of this new service, but I do not know that there is any service I have heard of in which there has been greater cause for complaint. People were committed to very heavy expenditure, advised to do certain things, warned to do certain things, and almost threatened with prosecution for failure to do them.  Then suddenly it is all over, and they are told not to bother about it.  Is the Minister going on with it when everybody else has stopped, or is it considered that there should be the skeleton of a machine there?  If so, the opinion prevailing now would appear to be very different from what prevailed 12 months ago.  We thought then that something like £30,000 would be sufficient, and now it amounts to nearly three times that sum.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed in this Estimate.  I am not satisfied that we have at all achieved what had been at any rate fairly generally accepted by the two Governments with regard to the Army, however much they may have differed in <Col N="90" /> other matters&mdash;that it was to be a small Army; that it was to be efficient; that it was to be well disciplined, and that it was to be capable of rapid expansion. The only evidence we have had of the expansion or our Army has been the loss of our ammunition.  Personally, if I were offered a choice, I would prefer to keep the ammunition and to have had a small Army.  To my mind, the objection to this Estimate is that the House and the country have been deceived.  We were told last year that we had now got our freedom; that one of the advantages or disadvantages of freedom was that you had got to pay for it; that we might even have to fight for it; and in order to maintain it and fight for it we had to have munitions. We got the money to purchase them. I do not know whether we have purchased them or not, but it does appear to me that it is in connection with the purchase of munitions that we have saved the most of this £970,000.  We gave no sanction at any time for the expansion of the Army to the extent to which the Ministers have expanded it.  It was a panicky gesture on the part of the Government; it was panicky, unwise, ill-balanced and illconsidered. It was an expansion for which this country cannot afford to continue to pay.  It will possibly make unpopular this national institution of the State which should be and was popular.  It gives rise to uneasiness when, in an expanded state, it is unequal to the small burden placed on it of holding what it has, of keeping possession of what was provided at great cost to the citizens of this State. It is a sorry, lamentable story.  This is an Estimate which ought to be rejected by the House, and I propose to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to the House that one of the main reasons for the increased moneys required in this Supplementary Estimate is the fact that there was a general mobilisation of the Army last September, and that the ranks of the Army were increased numerically to a very great extent.  First of all, I should like to know from the Government whether there was any justification whatever for the rushed mobilisation <Col N="91" /> of the Army last September?  Was there any need at all for it?  Can any explanation be given to justify the waste of public money on the mobilisation of the Army last September, and on the continued mobilisation of the Army since that date?  It is perfectly obvious to anyone that the mobilisation of the Army which took place then could not be a mobilisation that was concerned with invasion from outside, and it is still more obvious that a not very mobile infantry force&mdash; which forms the bulk of the Army here &mdash;would not be the best means of defence against invasion from outside. One thing which the present Minister for Defence will be called upon to explain is this: in view of the present situation in the country, when everybody is finding it hard enough to make ends meet, when the farmer and the labourer and the professional people and everybody else are finding it hard enough to carry on their ordinary avocations, what was the justification for increased expenditure on the Army?  There could be only two reasons: one, fear of invasion from outside, and secondly, fear of internal trouble.  There is no justification at all for assuming that this country has reason to fear invasion from outside, and, as I say, if we had to face invasion from outside, it is not the type of Army which the Minister and his predecessor have recruited for the last four years that would be an effective answer to that invasion.  I think the Minister will find it very hard to convince this country that the expenditure of those extra moneys was justified, or would be necessary in order to meet internal trouble.  The Minister or his predecessor never gave any indication to this House that there was any likelihood or danger of internal trouble which would justify the mobilisation of the Army or the expenditure for the sums for which he is now looking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most amazing items in the entire Estimate is the enormous increase in the pay of civilians attached to Army units.  There is an increase of £16,000 there.  I am given to understand that the method of recruitment <Col N="92" /> of civilian workers attached to Army barracks and other Army units is entirely at variance with the ordinary method of recruitment of civilian labour.  When people are taken on for other Government services, relief works, works under local bodies or anything like that, they are expected to be employed through the local labour exchange.  I understand that the civilian workers attached to Army units are not recruited through the labour exchanges, and I find it very hard to understand that, when people are unemployed and are capable of doing the work required of them when attached to those Army units.  I do not believe there is any justification for not taking on those people in the ordinary way through the employment exchanges.  It is not a thing that gives any great confidence in the people that are recruited for this type of labour to say that the one body in this country that has to hand-pick its outside labour without any regard to the employment exchanges is the Army.  As I say, the information I have is that these people are not recruited through labour exchanges.  I would be very glad if the Minister could say that that is incorrect. I do not think it is incorrect, and, believing that such is the position, I hope the Minister will at least take immediate steps to remedy it.  There is no earthly reason why people sweeping barrack yards or doing jobs of that nature could not be employed through the labour exchanges.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister would get just as loyal subjects of the State by recruiting through the labour exchange as he does by hand-picking.  I do not think that the hand-picking of the last four years has improved the Army.  I think they would be just as good if they were recruited through the labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the question of the A.R.P.  One of the most peculiar results of the first expenditure on A.R.P. in country towns is a sort of half black-out.  Originally, the lamps on the Shannon scheme standards used to have a nice white bowl around them.  For one period they were shut off altogether.  Then we got full light for a few weeks or so.  Then <Col N="93" /> they painted a nice white band around the lamps, with the result that there is a circle of light directly below the lamp, and ten to 15 yards are blacked out until you come to the next lamp.  It is hard to see the sense in doing that. A black-out or a one-third black-out is merely a nuisance to anyone who has to walk on the streets of these towns at night.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will find it very difficult to convince the people of this country that the State has even got value for £34,000 out of this service not to speak of £94,000.  As Deputy Cosgrave said, they ask for a nice round sum&mdash;they want £60,000 extra. I wonder would the Minister say actually what has been done as regards air raid precautions?  I wonder do they think of taking their courage in their hands and going the whole hog, as they have done in other countries? Do they intend to dig large underground caverns and make air raid shelters, or is it merely that they want to get £94,000 odd, tinker with a new service, and waste money just as they are in the habit of wasting large sums of money which this House has been voting in many other directions.  It will be difficult for the Minister to convince anybody in this country that the Department will give value for the £94,000 that they are asking this House to give them.  It was £34,000 originally. It is now £94,000.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for a Supplementary Estimate&mdash;and really the only reason&mdash;ought to be that the original amount estimated was not sufficient to carry on the service.  Apparently that is the position as regards these air raid precautions.  One of the things agitating the minds of the people of this country very much is to know what is the Government's policy at all about air raid precautions.  Take, for instance, the black-out.  We blacked-out and then we did not black-out, and then we half blacked-out.  What is the position at the moment?  What is the policy about it?  Are we going to have air raid precautions or are we not? Are we going to black-out or are we not?  The Minister really ought to make up his mind on the question of the black-out and say either that it <Col N="94" /> would be as well to black-out altogether or get the Shannon scheme authorities to erect a huge descriptive sign over the whole country pointing out that this is Eire, in order to show our neutrality and keep foreign aircraft from coming over us.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I feel impelled to vote against the Supplementary Estimate is that it contains one item for which there is no earthly justification. It is a new institution.  It has been and will be a wasteful institution. There was no necessity for it.  There never will be any necessity for it.  I refer to the office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  First of all, I wonder and everybody else in the country wonders, what was that Ministry established for. What has the Minister to do?  What have his Department and the officials to do?  It would not be very difficult to co-ordinate the defensive measures of this country, one would imagine.  There was a reasonably sized Army up to last September; there was a small air force and a very small fleet, and one would assume that it was hardly beyond the capabilities of either the last Minister for Defence or the present Minister for Defence, without creating an additional department, to co-ordinate these three arms of our defence forces into one defensive measure.  Apparently, the Government did not regard it so. I am afraid what really happened was that the last Minister for Defence plainly made a mess of things.  He made a mess of the Army with his harebrained Volunteer force and his harebrained recruiting scheme since 1934. Obviously, things were going from bad to worse.  Public confidence in the Army was shaken and when the European war broke out it gave the Government the chance of shifting them all around and landing somebody else, very unfortunately, into the job, to hold the baby.  I am sorry for the present Minister for Defence that he got landed into that rather awkward position at a time when he was going to be let in for a lot of trouble, as he was.  It is quite possible that the last Minister for Defence would be entirely incapable of co-ordinating our defensive arms, our air force and our navy, during the period he was in command. <Col N="95" /> I hope the same could not be said about the present Minister.  I hope that if he were left to do the job properly he would be capable of doing it.  Apparently what happened was this: the Government, or rather the Taoiseach, decided to get rid of the last Minister for Defence&mdash;he was a failure at his job&mdash;and put the present man in.  He could not get rid of him altogether; that would not look well. It would mean admitting that at long last he had to sack one of the boys. That would not look well at all.  They had to get a way out.  The Taoiseach could have adopted another expedient, that is, to hand over one of his own Ministries, the Ministry of External Affairs or the Ministry of Education. Apparently, the Taoiseach did not want to surrender these two posts.  Having no other job for the man, not liking to sack him altogether for fear of being held up to ridicule publicly and the reactions in the Government, the one way was to create a new job.  They created a new job.  They called it the Ministry for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are asking for £7,056, in addition to officers whose salaries are already borne on other Estimates, to create a nest-egg for that Ministry.  Deputy O'Higgins says it is the Irish House of Lords.  One disadvantage of putting the ex-Minister for Defence, or anybody like him, into the job of co-ordination of defence is that it is not like the House of Lords.  When a man is sent to the House of Lords he is rendered harmless and it does not cost the public very much, but in a new Department he is rendered anything but harmless.  If the last Minister for Defence made such a mess of the one single item, the Department of Defence, what can the country expect he will do when he has the job of supervising our present Minister for Defence, possibly cutting completely across him and saying: &ldquo;You have got your job to do. Look after the Department of Defence. When you have fixed it up I will co-ordinate it.&rdquo;  I do not know what <Col N="96" /> the idea could possibly be.  One would imagine that we were a large Power, that we had millions of men in the Army, that we had an air force running into thousands of men and thousands of machines, that we had a fleet that had to sail over every ocean in this world and that, in addition to the people in control of the various individual services, we would want some co-ordinating machinery.  I do not think the present Minister or anybody else can justify in this House the creation of an additional burden on the backs of the Irish people, in other words, putting a watch-dog over the present Minister for Defence, putting a man into a new job called the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, obviously with no particular job to do except possibly to keep his eye on the Department of Defence.  I do not believe any Deputy in this House would be justified in voting for the Estimate if it contained nothing else but this little item of £7,056 for the creation of a Department called a Ministry for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.</P>
      <P>At one time Fianna Fáil had economy on the brain.  There is one small item&mdash; the smallest in the Estimate&mdash;another round figure of £5,000&mdash;and, even though the Army has increased and even though, possibly, their activities have increased considerably, it seems to me that it is a shocking waste of money that telegrams and telephones cost the Army £5,000 per annum.  They are not tens of thousands of miles away from each other.  They are not holding a long front where there is vital necessity to get into immediate communication with each other.  I think that it is little items like these that go to increase the cost of administration.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to know what justification there is for expending £5,000 on telegrams and telephones.  If everybody in the Army rang one another up once a week for the next 12 months, we would hardly expect them to spend that much on telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another peculiar feature about this Estimate is that it is not balanced.  As Deputy Cosgrave stated, the expenditure is tested by the pay which is increased by £244,522, on a total payroll <Col N="97" /> of practically £1,000,000.  The increase in mechanical transport is entirely out of proportion to the increase in the expenditure on pay, because mechanical transport is costing ten times as much as was provided for in the original Estimate.  Again, the increase in the Estimate for fuel, light and water in kind, and fuel oils is £108,000.  Thus it will cost half as much to supply the extra men with water, fuel and oil as it will to pay them their actual salaries.  There is certainly something wrong when it is costing ten times as much for transport as was originally provided for.  The Minister would be a much better judge of the situation if he went back for ten or 12 years and reflected on the promises of his Party to wipe out the Army altogether, before coming into this House for a third time this year to present us with an Army Budget.  We had the ordinary Estimate for the Army in April of last year.  We had the increased Estimate last September and now we are asked for the third time to provide additional money for the Army.  If the Minister, as I say, went back ten or 12 years and adopted the dictum of his Party at that time, that the sooner the Army was wiped out the better, one might say that there might be some justification for that point of view, seeing what their handling of the Army has cost the people in the past year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could give any justification for mobilising the Army last September, or any explanation of the increase in the personnel of the Army; if he could explain anyway reasonably why this extra money or the mobilisation was required, he might get Deputies to agree that this Estimate was necessary.  The Minister will have to convince me that there was some reason for the mobilisation or that there was some reason for the extra expenditure before he can persuade me to vote for it.  The Minister will have to convince the people that the extra recruitment and the mobilisation were not merely an attempt by the Fianna Fáil Government to get certain people into the Army, not because they were going to do any good in it, but because it gave the <Col N="98" /> Government a chance of fitting in the boys who were probably getting fedup because they were not being properly provided for.  They had hoped that the Government would have looked after them for the last seven or eight years, but the Government were not making any effort to do so and these supporters of theirs thought they were being let down.  Then the happy idea occurred to the Government to take these gentlemen and plank them into the Army, where they hoped they would be satisfied.  The Minister will find it very hard to convince people of the necessity for this extra expenditure when it is recalled that the Fianna Fáil Party told the people before they came into office that by their new Constitution, and their various constitutional measures, they would create a State to whose internal structure nobody would ever object and that there would not be the slightest possibility of any armed opposition to Fianna Fáil as the national aspirations of everybody could be peacefully realised.  Apparently, that stunt has not come off.  I want to know whether the increase in the personnel in the Army and the vast increase in the expenditure is due to any fear of invasion or whether there is some other reason for it.</P>

      <P>There was one matter the Deputy raised, namely, the question of employment through labour exchanges.  I happen to be attached also to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that particular section, the labour exchanges, I control.  I do not think the Deputy is right in his statement that the Department of <Col N="99" /> Defence does ignore labour exchanges. I do believe, of course, that many men are recruited, or shall I say employed, by the Army as civilians, not exactly through the labour exchanges but because they have previous experience of a certain type that makes them suitable for a certain class of work.  I am wholly in agreement with the Deputy that men should be recruited from labour exchanges and from the unemployed whenever a vacancy occurs in any State Department.  The Deputy, of course, is very young, and before he came in here there used to be a regulation that ex-National Army men would get a preference over anybody else. Mind you, there is a good deal to be said for that, but if there is any way to meet the Deputy's wishes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak about the matter merely for the purpose of indulging in criticism.

I merely wanted some information on the matter and I said that for the future they should be so recruited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not be too polite to each other.  I am trying to explain that there may be certain things which it is not possible for us to do, but I am in general agreement with the Deputy's suggestion and I shall endeavour to see that this practice is adopted generally.  The Deputy raised a few points in connection with the lighting restrictions and suggested that no value had been given for the money expended on A.R.P.  He wanted to know what exactly was the policy of the Government in relation to A.R.P.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism and exposition of grievances in relation to the A.R.P. service.  Quite recently Deputies will have seen in the newspapers a statement made by air raid wardens, complaining of difficulties and obstacles placed in the way of building up an organisation, both by the Dublin Corporation and by the Department of Defence.  One such complaint was that made by Deputy Linehan, that Government policy was <Col N="100" /> not sufficiently clear-cut in the matter, as to be a real guide to them in building up such an organisation, and that it was not one that would be inclined to enthuse any volunteer.  Policy seems to me not exactly what one does or how one does it, but why one does a particular thing.</P>
    <P>In this matter, Government policy is the creation of an organisation that will afford adequate protection to the citizens in the eventuality of an air raid.  A certain policy was initiated early in September, and if there is any apparent change in that policy, it is merely an adaptation of the work to changed conditions.  In regard to the question of wardens' complaints I am not getting away from it at all.  We had a meeting recently of all air raid wardens and a sub-committee of the Dublin Corporation and officials of the Department of Defence.  At that meeting the air raid wardens made a complete statement of their difficulties and grievances and, as a result of the ensuing discussions, which are still going on, I think we will find a complete answer to the problems raised by the wardens.  The establishment of the sub-committee in Dublin was a step in the right direction.  It is much easier to deal with any particular problem when the people discussing it are familiar with what are the bones of the problem.  One of Deputy Linehan's difficulties in this matter is that he does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither does the Minister, and that is the cause of the whole of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-committee of the Dublin Corporation was recently appointed, and I must say it has been very helpful to us in setting this vexed question of A.R.P. in Dublin.  I am speaking at length on the wardens' question because, I think, it is really the one thing that we ought to concentrate upon developing, and for several reasons.  Anyone who knows anything about the organisation of a volunteer body knows that there is a tremendous amount of work to be done, and difficulties to be removed, before any progress <Col N="101" /> can be made.  It is very agreeable to me, at this particular time, when it seemed that most people in the country had grown cynical about nationality, and even selfish, to find such a vast body of men coming into a voluntary organisation and offering their services freely and unreservedly in the national interests.  No words of mine could adequately express my appreciation of the work of these men. Certain things have been said outside this House, and there have been certain criticisms inside it, but I would very much regret if anything should be said either by me, by the Department, or by the Dublin Corporation, that would lose us the services of men who are giving them so freely and so unselfishly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Linehan raised a question about value for the money being spent and that will be spent on A.R.P. I am paying my insurance premium, and I shall be very glad to have to pay it next year.  I hope that any of the eventualities which the expenditure of this money is to meet will never occur.  I hope this is money, like the payment of an insurance premium on a policy which will never develop, on which we will never get any return.  It is much more pleasant to spend money on things that will have a permanent value.  We have purchased a large amount of fire-fighting equipment, hospital equipment, machinery and tools that can be utilised in various other circumstances.  We have 73 fire-fighting pumps, some of which were utilised recently in Dublin during the heavy frost, when various water mains were frozen.  We also used them with effect to supply water in Dun Laoghaire as well as Dublin.  While all the bad things against A.R.P. were talked of <i>ad nauseam</i>, we did not hear at all about the taking over of the City of Dublin by A.R.P. during the frost. I would like, whatever form of expenditure is attacked, that one small item would be accepted by everybody.  I regard a volunteer warden service as one of tremendous importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where men of all political opinions and of all types come into an organisation with no selfish interests. <Col N="102" /> I think it is a great augury for the future of this country that we can get unity and agreement on something. If a neighbour's hay rick is burning in North Cork we never ask what the owner's political opinions are, but we all gather around to try to put the fire out.  I think that is a good spirit to develop.  Certain expenditure has to be met by way of providing meeting places, office expenses and halls for training.  I consider that to be of tremendous importance, and I regard it as something of permanent value.</P>
      <P>One of the items of the air raid protection services very much attacked is that of shelters.  We have built certain shelters in various parts of the city.  They were put in places where the population load is very heavy, and where protection, because of the structural condition of the houses in which the people live, was very poor.  I confess I have a personal dislike to trench shelters.  I would not care to use them myself.  Any man who has spent a period in jail suffers from a sort of claustrophobia, and I never like to go into a hole that I have to pull in after me, but we had no option but to make this particular type of shelter.  As we have had so many men giving us their services free and thus saving a tremendous amount of money for the State, it would be an act of good citizenship if people who are property owners, and who could not give their services and time in that fashion, would place at the disposal of the Government any basements which might be utilised as shelters in the properties which they control.  There is great difficulty in getting basement shelter which, to my mind, is altogether more desirable than trench shelter.  It will cost a very big amount if we have to pay compensation for all the shelter we need, and I should like to appeal to people who control such types of housing to place it at our disposal, as working men and others have placed their services at our disposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we could promise that.  It must be an ordinary rough structure.  I think there is enough basement accommodation in the city, without in any way affecting the basements which are in normal use, such as hotel basements and so on.  We have made a survey of them and we know there is a tremendous amount of basement shelter available.  It would be the least costly and would cause the least disturbance of the ordinary work of the country and, apart from the cost, I would prefer it to the type of trench shelter which we have had to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great difficulties of organising air raid precaution services&mdash; Deputy Linehan touched on it and it is a good thing to see that nearly all the intelligence is down in our constituency&mdash;is that the people in general are not convinced that there is any need for the provision of any such services.  If they have any conviction at all with regard to them, it is that any money spent in the provision of such shelters, or any other precautions, is putting money down the drain.  I sincerely hope that there will never be any necessity for the utilisation of air raid precaution services, but it is all very well for the man down in Coomlogane to say that there is no need for them.  If the need ever arises, he is not responsible, but the Government is, and from 1914 to 1918 all the military writers, critics and prophets were all confounded from week to week and from day to day.  I remember reading prognostications as to things that were going to happen in France in 1914, 1915 and 1916, and every one of them was proved to have very little foundation.  We have been reading and listening to military critics again since and before last August, and again we have seen the critics confounded.  The responsibility was the Government's and all they <Col N="104" /> could do was to accept the best prophecy, so far as they could reasonably judge it, as to what was going to happen.  It is said here that we model ourselves on a neutral country which is very near the war area, and that there is very little fear of anything happening in this country.  Most of us read the papers and we see what is happening from day to day.  The one thing we can be convinced of is that the dogs of war are mad dogs and respect nobody.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Mulcahy who asked against whom these precautions were being taken.  I put it like this to the House: these precautions are being taken, in the words of a rather famous expression which we were accustomed to use 20 years ago, &ldquo;against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&rdquo;  I do not know who is going to attack us. Somebody said&mdash;I do not think it was Deputy Mulcahy, because he would not be so foolish as to say it&mdash;that the day this country is invaded, that day the war is over.  Anybody who has read Irish history knows that the day this Army is destroyed, that day the war starts.  It was Deputy O'Higgins who said it.  Deputy Dillon said some time ago that the English would not come back because we would give them 700 years of hell again, and I feel the same as the Deputy.  I do not think the war would be over even if the Army were destroyed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Linehan finally came to the lighting restrictions.  The fact that on 18th November the Minister made the statement that the lighting restriction Order would be postponed had one particular effect, and that was to accentuate the idea of the general public that there was no necessity for A.R.P.  I mentioned military prophets a moment ago.  Last September, when A.R.P. services were put into operation, the Government had to act on its own conclusions, based on the opinions of its own military advisers, on the writings of <Col N="105" /> various military experts and on the services put into operation in various neutral States.  It had to deal, in my opinion, with a very critical situation when the trend of the war was an unknown quantity, and I do not think that the statement, which is sometimes made here, that the Government took panic action is reasonable.  The Government, at that time, was faced with a situation of which it had no previous experience.  It took the best advice it could get and met the situation as well as it could, with the knowledge at its disposal.</P>
      <P>Lighting restrictions, even on a much smaller scale than have been put into force in other countries, are, first of all, a grave disruption of business. They also give an opportunity for certain kinds of lawlessness, and they have many physical dangers to the citizen.  In view of everything, and in view of the changed conditions as between September and November, the Government very wisely decided to postpone the operation of the lighting restrictions.  Deputy Dillon complained about certain lighting restrictions in Ballaghaderreen, and I think he was satisfied that we tried to amend them as far as possible.  Deputy Linehan complained that the amendments put into force in Millstreet were not satisfactory. The lights of Millstreet are better than they were ten years ago.</P>

      <P>As to lighting restrictions, if this war goes on over next winter, it may be necessary to put in force much more stringent lighting restrictions than we have had this year. But we shall only do that if necessity arises, and we shall only spend money if the necessity arises.  As I say, I am very glad to get an opportunity of spending money on some particular types of A.R.P., particularly fire fighting, and whenever I get the opportunity that money will be spent.  But as far as possible we shall try to build up a volunteer organisation and, apart <Col N="106" /> from personnel, shall have to be content, on account of the cost, with an improvised A.R.P. service in other respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House should be grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for intervening at this stage and putting A.R.P. on one side with a comprehensive statement on the part of the Government.  That much having been done, I must ask the Minister for Defence to return to the main question. Why did you mobilise the Army; why did you mobilise the Reserves; why did you mobilise the Volunteers?  That is a question which has been put by Deputy Mulcahy; it has been put by Deputy MacEoin; it has been put by Deputy O'Higgins; it has been put by the whole Opposition; and it is a question which, in our submission, calls for an answer, and a categorical answer.</P>
      <P>There may be those in this House and outside it who may be tempted to comment on the question we now ask, that it is easy to be wise after the event, and why did we not ask that question last September when the hour of peril was at hand and it was hard to foresee the future?  If such comment is on anybody's lips, the answer is: &ldquo;We did ask that question.&rdquo;  The answer is that at that time we felt that to argue that question in public would be to confuse and upset the public mind, and, recognising the measure of the Government's responsibility, we felt that it would not be right to contribute to public perplexity by canvassing this issue while it was still speculative in an hour of acute crisis.  But the Prime Minister asked to see us.  We did see the Prime Minister, and, in the course of our discussions, dealt with many matters into which I do not propose to go now, because <i>ex parte</i> reports of such discussions are neither permissible nor convincing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, having seen the Prime Minister, at his invitation, we then approached the Prime Minister ourselves, not at his invitation, because we stated that we thought the most helpful thing in all the circumstances was to make such representation as we felt requisite in confidence.  The representation we made was: &ldquo;What on earth reason is <Col N="107" /> inducing you to mobilise the Reserves and the Volunteers?&rdquo;  We said to him &mdash;and it is all here in memoranda carefully kept, through which I do not propose to go, unless any part of my allegation is challenged, when I am prepared to go through it in detail, paragraph by paragraph&mdash;&ldquo;Tell us the reason, and please contemplate the staggering cost that will be involved for the country, in a time when the country is ill able to bear it; and, secondly, the dislocation to trade and commerce by the summoning up of some of the best men in the country who are members of the Reserve and the Volunteers, and the immense hardship to the individual members of both these forces and their families by having those wage-earners taken away from their normal avocations and forced to go on active service at a time when it appears to us that there is no menace to the State of a kind which the Army cannot effectively repel?&rdquo; There was no prospect of invasion that we could see, and to this hour it appears to us that no prospect of invasion exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins used a form of speech to-day that the Parliamentary Secretary, I think, misunderstood. Deputy O'Higgins said that if this country is invaded the war is over.  I think that is true.  The only possible source of invasion that we can foresee is that our territory would be invaded by Germany for the purpose of embarrassing the Allies in the conflict which is at present proceeding on the Continent of Europe.  Deputy O'Higgins very sensibly says that if the Germans can get here with an army and supply it, then the European War is over, because such an achievement would presuppose the destruction of the British fleet and the control of the seven seas by the Germans.  That is true.  Now bearing that in mind whence is invasion going to come for which we mobilised the Army?  Surely no Minister believing in Parliamentary institutions is going to go before this country with this Supplementary Estimate to complete an expenditure of £3,252,000 on the Army in this year and a contemplated further expenditure of <Col N="108" /> £3,355,000 in the coming year without telling us the reason for the mobilisation which has made this expenditure necessary.  Bear in mind that the Minister is in this position that he told this House when the annual expenditure on the Army was £1,247,000 that he regarded it as an outrage on the people.  He said in 1931 that that figure represented a burden on the people that no sane man could justify. He is now asking leave to spend £6,500,000 in two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of which this Supplementary Estimate forms part.  However, I dismiss those figures from my mind for the moment.  I say, can the Minister come forward and make that request and at the same time refuse to answer the question why he regards mobilisation as vital?  I do not propose, Sir, to go one inch beyond that single question.  Further opportunities will arise to review wider matters with regard to the Army.  To-day we are dealing with that Supplementary Estimate, and I think with ample notice it behoves the Minister to answer this one primary question: What is the menace against which he deems it expedient to mobilise the Army and to impose taxation on our people at this present time of such a staggering amount?  Has he thought, in proposing this expenditure, of the sources from which he is going to be constrained to raise the money?  Did the Minister realise when he embarked upon this course, that it meant less food for the people; that it meant taxation of the essentials of life to a point beyond that at which the poorer people of this country could afford to pay?  With that consideration in mind surely some grave reason must have inspired the decision.  Did the Minister think of the individual household, of the individual volunteer, of the individual reservist who has been inconvenienced by this summons?  Did he think of the men who have lost their jobs?  Did he think of the families whose incomes have been substantially reduced at a time when the cost of living was <Col N="109" /> rising as it had never risen since 1917? Did he consider all these individual hardships and cause them without any grave reason?  I cannot believe he did. But if this is still a democratic country; if this is still a country in which Parliament is the ultimate authority, Parliament is entitled to be told why the Government mobilised the Army, the Reserves and the Volunteers.  And if Parliament is not told this the men responsible are responsible for an act of usurpation.  They are claiming the right to mobilise the Army without any reference to Parliament; they are claiming the right to continue mobilisation, and claiming the ultimate decision as to whether the safety of this State requires mobilisation.  I would listen with patience to an answer by the Government.  If they mobilised the Army because there was not time to summon Parliament, that is a position that could be defended.  Unless the Government claims the right of dictatorship in this country it is their solemn duty to tell the House why they mobilised the Army in September last, why they kept it mobilised since, and against what danger they propose to keep it mobilised now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some items on this Estimate to which we take very serious exception.  There is one in particular which will require some explanation from the Minister and that is the sum of £60,000&mdash;&ldquo;Protection of Civilian Population against Air and Gas Attack.&rdquo;  We can all throw our minds back to the early days in September when the Dáil met here and when certain emergency powers were given to the Government.  As a result of that session of the Dáil and as a result of the discussion that took place here, there seemed to be a panicky kind of idea not alone amongst the Government but through the country and the people as a whole.  Orders were issued with regard to precautions against air raids, gas attacks and matters of that kind.  The people were ordered to black-out every light and every semblance of light that might in any way cause an enemy to attack us from the air.  I remember for the first few days the state of affairs in the City of Cork. The city was completely blacked-out. <Col N="110" /> There were complaints to the corporation in every direction with regard to what was happening under cover of the black-out.  As a result of the representations to the Minister the black-out was partly lifted.  This is the point on which I would like some explanation. Institutions such as the vocational schools in Cork were still ordered to go ahead with their preparations for a complete black-out.  I am a member of the vocational schools committee in the city and, with the other members, I was faced with a sum of £400 in expenses for the carrying out of the orders of the military.  We pointed out that there was no reason, or very little reason, for such measures because, as we said, in our opinion the schools would be completely blacked-out at 9.30 when the classes finished and that for the short time required the expense was unnecessary. But an order from the Minister came drastically, ordering that the money was to be expended.  The committee had to undergo that expense and to make all the preparations necessary for the black-out.  So far, the black-out has not been put into operation, so apparently there was no necessity for it as far as the ordinary man in the street can see.  In that way people were needlessly burdened with expenses which with a more reasonable outlook on the part of the authorities they should not have been compelled to undergo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this figure of £60,000 here in this Estimate.  I would like to know on what that sum is to be expended? For some time expenses have been falling on the local authorities caused by the sending of officials to Dublin to attend lectures on air raid precautions, but very little has been done about these lectures since.  The Cork Corporation are not making any preparations to meet the suggestions with regard to air raid precautions. The situation or location of Cork City would not permit of the digging of trenches for air raid shelters because these would be flooded at once.  As a matter of fact the city itself is flooded at high tides. Such a proceeding would be utterly out of the question.  I should like to know what exactly the Minister has <Col N="111" /> in mind when he puts down this sum of £60,000 as contribution to air raid protection costs.  Does he intend to insist on a contribution from the local authorities?  I know that the Cork Corporation and, I think, the county council, would be very slow to make any provision in that direction.  Is this sum to be handed over to the local authorities or is it to be used exclusively for Dublin, because other parts of the country would require protection, in case of attack, as well as Dublin?</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate, as a whole, is very distasteful to us, of the Labour Party, because we feel that finance for social services is much more necessary than finance for the Army.  The discussion to-night has been all one-sided but, at the same time, a good deal of truth has been stated.  I think that what was said regarding the unnecessary panic in respect of equipping and preparing an army for the defence of the country was largely justified.  We want to get more definite and more detailed information with regard to the items of this expenditure and, especially, with regard to the item covering air raid precautions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically every member on the opposite side referred to the mobilisation of the Army in September and the justification for that step.  I can only say that the explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Moylan, regarding the justification for action taken in respect of air-raid precautions applies equally to the mobilisation of the Army in September.  The responsibilities of government are very heavy.  Many members on the opposite side have practical experience of that. Many members on the opposite benches have not had practical experience. Those responsibilities weighed, naturally, very heavily with the Government when taking its decision to mobilise the Army last September. The world situation which existed at that time was probably the most precarious that had existed for a generation. We saw small nations and <Col N="112" /> large nations all over the world calling up their reserves and their volunteers and making every possible preparation to defend the liberty which they possessed.  It may be that we were influenced&mdash;I am not saying that the Government itself was&mdash; by the fact that a world conflict of a magnitude which none of us could foresee was about to begin.  We felt that, as a free people, we should take all necessary precautions in defence of the liberties which we possessed.  That, as far as I know, was the main reason for the mobilisation of our Army in September.  There was nothing in the nature of panic about it.  It was discussed with the responsible heads of the Army.  All were in agreement that, in view of the situation which existed, this was the proper precautionary step to take and it was taken.  As soon as it was possible to begin the demobilisation of the Volunteers and the reservists, that demobilisation was undertaken but, there again, it had to be carefully done.  We had to make certain that the situation was such that we could safely do it.  Wherever men were in gainful employment or whereever they had commitments of a domestic nature which necessitated their return to their homes, these circumstances were taken into consideration. The members of the Army who made application for exemption from service had their cases examined, and, where it was found possible to exempt them, they were exempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked what the strength of the Army was on that occasion.  It never exceeded 20,000, and its reduction has been proceeding gradually ever since.  I am taking every opportunity that offers to reduce the numbers and I can assure the House that I am just as much concerned about expenditure on the Army as any other Deputy is.  If it were possible, I should like to see an Army of 4,000 or 5,000, but I am afraid that that is Utopian and that, in present world conditions, it cannot be realised. In my humble opinion, to go to anything near that figure would be to invite invasion.  I have been asked by many Deputies on the other side from whom we expect invasion.  The only answer I can give to that is that <Col N="113" /> I do not know.  I only know that it is the duty of this Government, as I believe it would be the duty of any Government, to make provision for the defence of this country against such a possibility.  That is the only thing I can say in respect of the query as to from whom we are expecting invasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin asked a question in respect of the number of Army officers who were exempted following mobilisation.  Since these men were called up something like 109 officers have been exempted, and about 5,000 men have been returned to their employment. We are continuing that policy of returning men to their homes or employment as fast as it can possibly be done with safety.  I do not think we can regard ourselves as being out of the wood yet, but there is one thing that we have done as a result of the general mobilisation, and that is we have secured a very large number of very highly-trained men. We have the regular Army, the members of which, beyond question, can be regarded as specialists in their profession. We have reservists who have been in such positions and who, if I may say so, have been re-trained.  We have a large number of volunteers who have received sufficient training to enable them to be regarded as welltrained soldiers, capable of taking their place with the regular Army in matters connected with the defence of this country.  That is one thing that has been gained as a result of the mobilisation of the Army.</P>
    <P>Certain things have been said about the Volunteers.  Now, I have been speaking to many of the senior officers of the Army with regard to the Volunteers.  I have made it my business, because of the charges&mdash;the unfounded charges&mdash;that have been made against the Volunteers and the Volunteer movement, to make inquiries among the senior officers of the Army. I have gone out of my way to make inquiries with regard to the general demeanour, general attitude and discipline of these Volunteers, and also with regard to the general desire of men to become Volunteers, and I have <Col N="114" /> been assured that the Army appreciates the services given by these Volunteers.  While it is admitted&mdash;and of course it is only natural&mdash;that among these Volunteers there may be certain undesirable people, the fact that we may have these undesirables should not give to this Volunteer movement the name that has been attempted to be given to it by certain people, and mostly by members of this House.</P>
    <P>Certain questions have been raised by one or two Deputies in respect of the manner in which civilian employees have been recruited into the Army workshops.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary answered that question already, but most of these men have been taken through the labour exchanges.  So far as it is possible to do so, men with large families are given priority, but mostly these men are taken through the labour exchange.  Where they are not taken through the labour exchange, they are taken through the recommendation of Deputies of this House, and I want to say that Deputies of this House, from all sides, have sent forward recommendations of such individuals for employment, and all these recommendations have been given consideration, no matter from what side they came.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of a tirade&mdash;mostly against the Minister, but largely against the present Army&mdash; described the present Army as a potential menace.  I can assure Deputy O'Higgins that that will not be appreciated, I feel, by the Army generally. The Army, as it stands to-day, is, in the opinion of the General Headquarters Staff, with whom, as I mentioned a moment ago, I have discussed the question of the serious charges made against it, in as high a position as it ever has been.  Many of these officers are men who have been in the Army for the last 17 or 18 years, and that is their opinion.  That is the opinion of the General Headquarters Staff, and if anyone wants to dispute that, or if anybody should think I am making a mistake in saying so, they can easily find out for themselves by getting into contact with these officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> There was also the question of the purchase of munitions.  That, certainly, has been one of the gravest difficulties with which we have been confronted. However, I think that my predecessor made it clear last year, when putting through the annual Estimate, that not only was there the danger that there would be restrictions in respect of securing the Army requirements, but that there would also be the possibility that we would not be able to get any of our requirements at all.  Now, it has not been just as bad as that. I think that we have purchased something over half a million pounds' worth of armaments during the present estimate year.  We have received quantities of various types of ammunition, and we have received numbers of aeroplanes as well as numbers of defensive guns in the way of anti-aircraft artillery and so on, but we have not received anything like the numbers we should like to have received.  I suppose that it was natural, in the circumstances, that we could not receive all the armaments we should have liked to receive.  However, the question of the purchase of these has been mentioned in the course of this debate.  There, again, we feel that, whenever and wherever it is possible to purchase armaments for the Army, they should be purchased, if only for the purpose of holding them in reserve in case any necessity should ever arise of having to re-mobilise the Army.  That is something that I sincerely hope will not take place, but nevertheless I feel that it is one of these things for which we must make preparations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Benson raised a question with regard to the staff of one of the coastal patrol vessels, and he mentioned the fact that, when we took over one of these patrol vessels from another Department, we dispensed with the services of a large number of men.  In taking over that vessel, we did have to dispense with the services of one or two or perhaps three individuals, but if we did so it was because the individuals concerned either were over age or physically unfitted to undertake the work which would be necessary in order to man a vessel of the type which we <Col N="116" /> desired.  The &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; in the past was a fishing patrol vessel.  In the future it will be more than that; it will be a war patrol vessel, and the people who will be on board that vessel will have to be up to the standard which is required generally in the Army.</P>

I do not suppose we could ever hope by any possible means to satisfy any of the members of the Opposition in respect to any Estimate that we might bring in.  It is only natural they would take up the attitude they have taken up to-day in respect to this Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has, I think, explained fully the matter raised by Deputy Hurley.  Deputy Hurley was not in the House when the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with A.R.P. I think the Parliamentary Secretary covered the matters raised by Deputy Hurley, and I shall have to refer the Deputy to the Parliamentary Debates, where he can read what was stated here by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were various statements made in respect to some of the figures connected with this Estimate.  For instance, Deputy Linehan spoke of the cost of telephones and telegraphs. While the figure given merely mentions telegrams and telephones, I might say it also covers the wages of the operators in the various exchanges in the military barracks.  Petrols and oils cover the stock of reserves and, while <Col N="117" /> it may be suggested here that there was some type of joy-riding and something else going on, that is not so.  The figures given cover reserve stocks and <Col N="118" /> so on.  I think I have dealt with all the points that have been raised.</P>

      <P>I move the motion standing on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Hurley and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Emergency Powers (No. 22) Order, 1940, which was made on February 12th, 1940, and tabled on February 21st, 1940, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authors of the fantastic device, which is now called summer time, made a case for it originally, and have apologised for it at frequent periods since, on quite different grounds from those which the Minister for Justice <Col N="119" /> relied on when making his case for it last week.  The innovation was originally described as a daylight saving measure, but in the reply which the Minister gave to a query on this matter last week he entirely shifted the case for it from the alleged saving of daylight to that of the convenience of railway time tables&mdash;a standard arrangement between railway transport systems in this country and in other countries.  I think his answer was unconvincing. This craze for what was then described as daylight saving was originally heard of a good many years ago.  Certain gentlemen in England, with a mission to bring about a reformation of a certain kind, began to bombard the newspapers with letters on the subject, and continued their campaign by way of issuing pamphlets.  All this resulted, after some time, in the introduction of measures to secure the object they had in view, but these measures were rejected on more than one occasion by the British Parliament.  Occasionally, in Great Britain as in other countries, freak legislation finds its way to the statute book.  That happened in the case of what was then described as daylight saving.</P>
    <P>At the present time we are discussing in this country, with a good deal of anxiety and interest, the question of Partition.  I am old enough to remember a proposal being made by a private member in the British House of Commons along the lines that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, ultimately took.  The proposal was laughed to scorn at the time, but it resulted in certain legislation afterwards, and in much the same way this freak suggestion of daylight saving ultimately resulted in the passage into law of a Bill in the British House of Commons in 1916.  This followed on the introduction of a similar proposal in Germany some time earlier.  It is not without significance to remember that Germany has long ago discarded this method of daylight saving or what is known as summer time.  Many of the other countries which adopted this system have either abolished it, altered it, or ignored it in one particular way or another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> The whole method of calculating time, arranging time, and standardising time in a certain way has an interesting history.  I do not know that it would be necessary to go into that at length to-night, as, although it is not without interest, I think there is not very much occasion for doing so.  It will be enough to say that, with the spread of the railway system, a certain national standard of time was introduced into many countries, and that the railways of England followed London time, while the Irish railways followed Dublin time.  The same thing happened in other countries.  This led to a certain amount of confusion, which was ultimately settled at a conference in Washington in 1883, when certain zones of time were arranged.  By a somewhat peculiar coincidence, the fixing of the time zones at that conference resulted in a position of anomaly for this country, as the effect was that certain parts of this country&mdash;if that time zone had been strictly adhered to&mdash;would be one hour different to other parts&mdash;the West of Ireland would be one hour different to certain portions of Leinster, and so on.  Of course, that ridiculous situation could not be permitted, and we had our own time standard permitted and sanctioned by that international conference.  It is somewhat significant that that concession bestowed on us internationally was taken away from us by a one-clause measure passed in the British House of Commons in 1916, and coming into operation in October of that year.</P>
    <P>This innovation&mdash;summer time&mdash;is largely experimental.  Referring to the measure passed in this House in 1925, that measure was adopted because it was an innovation that possessed, superficially at least, a certain amount of attraction for a number of people. It was permitted to go through because it was just an interesting experiment that time and experience would be able to tell the value of.</P>
    <P>I think we have had ample opportunity to examine the effects of this system since then and I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that the volume of protest against it has been growing steadily since and that it has grown to a very considerable volume in <Col N="121" /> recent years.  Whatever may be the result of the discussion here this evening, I believe that summer time as we know it is doomed and that we have only to wait a short time to see the end of it in one form or another.  That cannot come too soon; hence I propose to ask the House to-night to annul the order for which the Minister has been responsible for giving effect to the measure for this year.</P>
    <P>One objection to summer time is very well known.  It comes from the rural population, who dislike the inconvenience of the system, and the difficulty that the system provides for the agriculturist generally&mdash;in regard to the milking of cattle and in regard to other aspects of agriculture in the country. In fact, in certain countries where it was introduced, as in the United States, the storm of protest from the agricultural section became so marked that it was withdrawn and a watereddown system of local time was provided for certain States, in substitution.  Obviously, the system is&mdash;and will continue to be&mdash;extremely unpopular in rural areas, because of the dislocation and confusion that it results in and because of the direct loss which, to my mind, results in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most harmful effect of summer time is that on the children. It was stated somewhere recently that one section of the population of this country works extremely hard and that that section is the children.  Anybody in a position to know what school children have to do at the present time, the amount of work they have to put in after school hours, understands that this is entirely true.  There seems to be little doubt about the effect of this measure on the health of children. If there is any doubt, the authorities which have offered their opinion in that respect adduce very convincing proof of their contention.  I have here some views on that particular aspect of the case, of which I ought to put the House in possession.  One view is as recent as the 22nd February.  In it, the Senior District Justice in this city criticises the effect of summer time very severely in his court.  He criticises its effect on <Col N="122" /> the children and says that &ldquo;various ailments coupled with malnutrition marked the track of a bitter winter and a searching spring.&rdquo;  He went on to emphasise the additional effect and resulting ill-health that summer time would cause in such connection.  He did not begin to discover the adverse effect of summer time on the children this year, as in April, 1938, he was responsible for the following views expressed in the Dublin District Court on 11th April, 1938, when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this morning's papers I have read the report of the School Attendance Department of the City of Dublin for 1937.  Upon the cause for non-attendance I wish to state that a year's experience as the Justice presiding in the Children's Court has convinced me that the opening of schools by Statute one hour and twenty-five minutes in advance of the sun's course, has been, and will be, a constant cause of decrease in the percentage of attendance and also a danger to the health, to the physical and nervous welfare of the children of this city.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Children living in crowded and noisy streets, docked at the end of the day of their natural sleep, are by Statute forced to rise at hours unnatural to childhood.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reports from teachers, lay and clerical, are agreed that children harassed by cold and lack of sleep arrive at school numbed in body and mind, incapable of concentration until the mid-day sun brings back the circulation to their little bodies.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The greatest good of the greatest number is the ground on which these Acts are defended.  Are children then a commodity of which there is no supply; for which there is no demand?  Are &lsquo;the gay young things&rsquo; that swing the racket and the club alone to be considered?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the Minister will meet that portion of the argument against summer time with the explanation that there is no obligation on the school authorities to arrange hours of attendance at school in accordance with summer time, but in fact that does not <Col N="123" /> make the position one bit easier.  In the last week there has been an extremely confusing set of arrangements in operation in various parts of the country.  The schools in one particular place observe summer time; the neighbouring schools observe winter time, or what is familiarly known locally as old time; and in other schools a standard is adopted which seeks to find a happy medium between summer time and old time.  I have personal experience of the fact that children in the same household in a small town have two or three sets of time for their attendance at school, which makes things extremely unsatisfactory and confusing.  There are some other authorities that can be quoted in this respect, and one is the County Medical Officer of Health for no less important a place than Cork City.  I will quote from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of February 26, 1940, which gives an account of a meeting to protest against the proposed introduction of summer time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dr. J.C. Saunders, City M.O.H., said he was completely and unequivocally in agreement with the purpose of the meeting.  It was of the utmost importance that nothing should be done which would interfere in any way with the national rhythm of things, especially as experienced in the routine of the farming community. It was a very extraordinary thing that it should be necessary at all to have such a protest meeting held against the legal enactment which caused so much interference with the people's way of living.  It would seem that we are living in an age when the minds of people seem to be obsessed with attempting to improve on the methods of nature. I see this a great deal in my own profession and we see it everywhere else.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dr. Saunders went on to refer to the adverse effects of summer time on children, and said apparently the origination of the Act overlooked the probable and possible effects on the child population....  Teachers had noticed that there was an inability <Col N="124" /> on the part of the children to concentrate while in school and a reduced capacity to absorb the tuition they received, and increased effort was required from the teachers to impress their teaching.  Children could not be got to bed during the operation of the Summer Time Act until 11 or 12 o'clock at night.  They got insufficient sleep, and because of that there was greater vulnerability to contract disease.  Summer time was bad enough in its original form, but it was worse still to bring it into force in February instead of April. There was a suggestion thrown out, he believed, further to prolong summer time by another hour during the year.  &lsquo;Any further extension would really be disastrous, in my opinion,&rsquo; said Dr. Saunders. &lsquo;Not only should we press for the abolition of the Summer Time Act, but they should also seek the restoration of their own standard Irish time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was strongly supported by Mr. T.P. Dowdall, T.D., in the course of a statement which followed that of Dr. Saunders.  Another very prominent authority in this matter, a school medical inspector of the Kent County Health Department, expresses his views on summer time in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The teaching staff are in the best position to judge and observe signs of lack of sleep in school children. Such signs are irritability, touchiness, peevishness, or fidgetiness, inattention or lack of interest in work, lethargy, sleepiness or other signs of fatigue.  These are the most immediate signs of insufficient sleep which can be noticed before any actual interference with nutrition can be established.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A further article by a Lecturer on Diseases of Children, School of Medicine of the Royal College, Edinburgh, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been told over the wireless that one of the reasons for maintaining this so-called summer time is that our watches may be in unison with continental time!  Why need we worry about continental time?  We are not constantly going abroad.  It <Col N="125" /> looks as if it were difficult to find a real excuse for keeping this Act in force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think in those very words can be found a complete answer to the Minister's statement last week that this was merely a matter of convenience for the purpose of arranging some kind of standard accommodation between this country and other countries.  Somebody has suggested that it would be inconvenient for tourists coming into this country if there were different arrangements in the matter of time.  Of course, the answer to that is that people going from this country to Great Britain or countries abroad will have to meet with very frequent changes of time, which do not in the end result in any inconvenience, beyond just fitting oneself in with whatever time prevails in the particular country in which one is travelling.  I do not think it is any exaggeration to describe this whole system as a sort of make-believe, a rather farcical make-believe, and I think in the end an unprofitable and unhealthy form of make-believe.  It has been said that this whole world is a stage and that men and women are merely players, but if, in pursuance of that philosophy, we are to have a good deal of make-believe associated with life, it ought to take some other form.  I think there is a very definite case to be made for the viewpoint that this is not alone unprofitable, as I have said, but definitely unhealthy, and a wrong to that section of our population which ought to be the subject of our most serious concern&mdash;our growing children. Their problems are serious enough at the present time.  Their outlook for the future in this country is difficult enough without making the years of their childhood more difficult and more unhappy than the strenuous form of study they have to do makes them at the present time.  The Minister's reply, of course, will include a statement that an inquiry into this matter is proposed. I do not think that what we require in regard to this matter is so much an inquiry as a decision.  I think the facts are indisputable.  I think no case can be made for the retention of this particular system, and that what we <Col N="126" /> want is a decision.  The Minister appears reluctant to make that decision.  I do not know what is the purpose of retaining this system.  I do not want to suggest that it is merely part of the step-by-step policy which is apparent in legislation generally in another part of the country.  I do not believe it is.  Whatever the reason is, the Minister seems reluctant to change it, and I ask the House to change it by annulling this Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second this motion.  I think that Deputy Murphy has made an unanswerable case in favour of the motion, and I venture to suggest that the Minister would be put to the pin of his collar to answer some of the arguments that he put up to him. I am going to base my opposition principally on the effect that this order and the implementation of this order has on the children of the nation.  There is no doubt about it that this summer time experiment in this country has a definite militating effect against the health of the growing children.  I say that with all sincerity as a parent, and also as a teacher.  I have noticed in my own children that, if their hours of rest are curtailed, during the following day there is a peevishness and an unsettled state of mind as a result.  I have been forcibly struck with that position as a teacher.  For some years past&mdash;and I experienced a time teaching before that order came into effect&mdash; there has been very noticeable towards the end of the school day that lassitude and weariness that is definitely associated amongst children with the want of proper rest.  It is very easily understandable. According to Irish time, our own time, the children would be in bed at 10 o'clock and they would not have to get up before eight in the morning.  That would give them about ten hours' rest.  With the operation of this order, especially in the height of summer, the children are never in bed before 10.30 or 11 o'clock, and they have to get up again at 8 o'clock in the morning.  In that way their rest is definitely curtailed.  I am going to suggest very seriously to the Minister that that is going to have a very detrimental effect on the future of the children of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> I would like the Minister to give a definite answer to this point: Is there to be another hour added on in April? Probably the Minister does not know. He wants to see what England will do in this and then we will probably do the same.  We have done the same as England did in putting on this extra hour on 25th February.  Surely, no case could be made for putting on an extra hour on the 25th February in this country because there was no gain in regard to daylight saving or any kind of composite measure for daylight purposes.  What was gained in the evening was certainly lost in the morning and is so still.  We have to have lights on in the morning in order to get ready for the day's business, even if we have an extra spell of twilight in the evening.  So that, whatever case can be made for the city worker and for the people in offices and other people&mdash;as Deputy Murphy said, they gain in things such as sports, tennis and so on&mdash;it cannot be made at this stage.  There might be reasons for its operation in England, but those reasons do not operate here.  Surely it is not going to be advanced seriously that we have to keep time with England in order to meet the boats and trains and so on?  At the present time the boat from Britain comes and goes when it likes, and sometimes does not come at all.  I cannot see how that argument could be sustained.</P>
    <P>Then, again, the argument was put forward that the managers of schools could arrange that they could keep the old time and not adopt the new time. In that case the position is more confused than ever.  I have six schoolgoing children, three of whom are keeping old time and three are keeping new time, so that the position is worse than ever so far as my particular household is concerned.</P>
    <P>The rural population of this country certainly object, and object very strongly, to the imposition of the Summer Time Order.  They have objected previously to the imposition of the order so early in the year, and they certainly object very strenuously to the imposition of the order at this particular time.  I do not want to go over the grounds which have been covered <Col N="128" /> by Deputy Murphy, but I know that the medical officer of health in Cork City has very strongly expressed his views with regard to this Summer Time Order.  After all, we have to take the opinion of an expert like our medical officer of health as being worth something. He has told us that in his opinion it is bound to have an injurious effect and is having an injurious effect on the health of the children.  Experts like him, surely, should be considered, and not the rather foolish letters that one sees from time to time in some of the local papers, signed &ldquo;A Mother&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father&rdquo;, and so on.</P>
    <P>To support this case for the annulment of this order we have people who are experts in their jobs, people who know what they are talking about.  It may be suggested that the people in the cities and the towns will be opposed to this annulment.  I venture to suggest that it would benefit the people in the cities and the towns as well.  Unfortunately, there are a good many people in the cities and towns who have too much time and too much leisure on their hands.  Those people are not engaged in any occupation that would in any way interfere with their observance of the old time.</P>
    <P>The greatest factor, to my mind, and the one that I think should weigh with this House, is the effect that the imposition of this order has on the health of the children.  That is my strongest argument.  I know that the people in my constituency, the rural population, farmers and agricultural workers, are definitely opposed to the imposition of this summer time.  As Deputy Murphy rightly said, it is not a question of inquiry, it is a question of decision, and I am sure the Minister in his heart believes that the arguments put forward for the annulment of this order are the arguments that should operate, and that other considerations are very small things compared with the considerations for the community here at home, for our children, and for the rural population that we hear so much about and who are so much lauded; but when it comes to operating legislation and orders like this, there is no consideration for them.  I wish to second this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in opposing this motion.  There was never a contention put up, whether about vivisection or vaccination, treatment by serums or treatment by medicines, but one set could quote a group of eminent doctors and their opponents could quote another group of eminent doctors.  If I bothered taking the letters in the Press for the past month I could get letters from doctors equally as well qualified as the doctors quoted by the proposer of the motion.  I have got to bear in mind, when I am opposing this motion, that a very big proportion of my constituents live in crowded conditions in towns in my constituency, and that the bit of daylight saving which they get, which means health and recreation to them, is of great value to them.  As regards the rural population, about whom we have heard so much just now, there is no compulsion whatever on them, unless they are going for a train or a bus, to observe summer time on their farms.  We have heard of all the obstacles and all the difficulties.  In my own county I can point out three parishes where summer time is observed in one parish, middle time or old time in another parish, and old Irish time in a third parish.  Still life goes on and markets and fairs are held and have been held for 23 years without any great inconvenience.</P>

      <P>It is very handy for chapel meetings.  We can get in half a dozen chapel meetings within a very short time, but that is not the real reason I am opposing this motion.  The people down there go by the particular time that suits them.  I should like to put it to Deputy Murphy and to the Labour Party generally, that it is not <Col N="130" /> the tennis racquet people that are vitally concerned in this question of summer time.  There are people like the workers in the mills in Athlone and in the carpet factory at Navan to whom an hour in the evening is a great benefit to enable them to get out in the sun.  That is a very vital consideration for them.  The man working out in the fields has the benefit of sunlight and fresh air throughout the day and summer time may not mean very much to him, but I would invite Deputy Murphy or Deputy Hurley to go into one of the small traders' shops about the city, not the big stores, and to note the stuffy conditions there, to observe the boys and girls, pale and unhealthy-looking, who work in these shops and they will then realise what a bit of the evening sun means to these workers.  Very often these workers are not very well paid; their working conditions have often been referred to in this House by members of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard some references to conditions in Germany.  In Germany the young people are at school at 7.30 in the morning.  They have, it is true, abolished summer time, but they have not interfered with the observance of these early hours.  They work much harder in the schools in Germany than is the practice in this country.  In France summer time has become part of the national life, and it has not interfered with the French nation. Summer time may be a bit of an irritation to the rural population, but if it does not interfere with the carrying on of their daily operations or the earning of their livelihood, they should not try to ram their opinions down the necks of unfortunate people who are not blessed with the same healthy conditions in the places in which they work.  When one comes to examine the type of people who are behind this agitation, one finds that they are very largely people of leisure who never had to work under the conditions under which unfortunate people have to work in our shops.  These people of leisure never had to work like the girls or the lads one sees behind drapery counters. The individuals who have been waging this agitation have not taken into <Col N="131" /> account the conditions under which these indoor workers, 34 per cent. of our population, have had to earn their living.  Therefore my appeal to the Minister would be to oppose this motion.  I have heard some references by Deputy Murphy to local option.  I do not know much about conditions in America, but I have been told that there is such a system as local option in America, and if local option were granted in rural districts it is possible that these districts would not favour summer time.  I understand that a commission has been set up by the Government to inquire into this whole matter and that local option may be a way out of the difficulty.</P>
    <P>My appeal to the rural population would be this.  They have one of the chief blessings of life in fresh air and healthy conditions.  They are working in a healthy atmosphere and they ought to take into consideration the workers in the towns, many of whom are sons and daughters of small farmers who have to go into these towns to earn their living.  I would ask people in the country to hesitate before they advocate the driving of these workers in the towns back into a condition of affairs where they cannot get out until after the sun has gone down, where they have to go to bed without a breath of fresh air, get up in the morning and go straight into the same racket again.  It is all right to say &ldquo;let the shops open an hour earlier.&rdquo;  They will not open an hour earlier; they will go by the time generally observed.  I do not pretend to be a very alert individual. I get up by summer time because I have to go by it, but if the clock were put back again, I would get up by old time.  I think summer time was one of the wisest innovations we ever had in this country.  I do not think that it has interfered in any way with the physique of our people.  In fact, I think their physique has improved considerably over the last quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, I have seen three different times operating in three adjoining parishes in my constituency, and there has been no interference with the life of the community.  Somebody <Col N="132" /> has used the argument that the farmer's boy will be working in the fields, and he will see the road man leaving off work at 5 o'clock old time, while he will have to continue working until 6 o'clock.  I saw cows being brought in for milking in the parish of Castletowngeoghegan, and some time later when I went into the parish of Ballymore I saw that they were only going for the cows there.  Yet the people of these parishes lived under conditions of the utmost harmony, and there was no interference with their ordinary arrangements.  This I think is all a paper battle.  So much common sense has come out of Cork, that I am very much surprised at this nonsense.</P>

      <P>Whatever might be said for the adoption of daylight saving, summer time, the advanced hour, or whatever you like to call it, in the normal summer period&mdash;and I, for one, would be prepared to argue against it even then&mdash;there is no justification whatsoever for its adoption in the month of February.  I am wondering where is the justification for this order at all, or what section of the people asked for it.  No one wants it in the rural parts and, as far as I could gather from conversations with people in the city, every second person held different views about it.  That is exemplified by the letters that were quoted by Deputy Murphy and by Deputy Kennedy.  I am not going to worry the House about the letters for and against this proposal. Deputies have seen them and as much could be said for one aspect of the case as the other.  If I was asked candidly for my opinion, after my conversations with people, I would say that the majority are against this order.  What is really troubling me is where the demand came from for its introduction in February.  Even if there was a unanimous demand from the people in the cities for the adoption of daylight saving, for summer time and the advanced hour, I am not sure that any Government should adopt it, having regard to the fact that this is an agricultural country.  The viewpoint of agriculturists, despite what Deputy Kennedy says&mdash;and he is the representative of an agricultural constituency <Col N="133" />&mdash;should be taken into account, and they should not be treated in a rough-shod manner in any legislation passed by this House.  There are others, besides city people and dwellers in large towns, to be considered.  Those of us who live in the country do not object at all to residents of the cities enjoying all the daylight they want. As Deputy Murphy pointed out, by the adoption of this order in February they are not going to enjoy any more daylight than they enjoy at present.</P>
      <P>This thing cuts both ways.  I do not believe that any person benefits to the extent of half an hour by the adoption of this order in February.  If some people gain by summer time we are all very glad.  We have no objection to people gaining all the advantages they can from the change.  They can get up at four o'clock in the morning if they wish.  I recommend this to residents in the city, that there is no period of the day more enjoyable than that from sunrise on a summer morning until breakfast time.  The Minister laughs at that.  That is the most delightful portion of the day, and I recommend all city residents to try it. Instead of going for a walk in the evening after work, when people are tired, I recommend them to get out in the morning at four o'clock when they are fresh.  That is the time to enjoy the daylight.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;Get up early and get out with the lark.&rdquo;  As far as those who live in the country are concerned, the farmer and farm worker, the lark is a lazy bird. We are being unfair to nature by this order.  The thing is laughable.  As the Americans say, the lark has nothing on us; if anything, we have it on the bird.  If the lark in the summer time gets up a bit earlier than we do, he cannot brag about it.  Remember in the South and South-west of Ireland we will, by this order, be one and three-quarter hours in advance of the sun. We are really getting up with the lark in summer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy taunted agriculturists with having made no case, and said that they should not grudge the extra hour to workers in, I suppose, Mullingar and other towns.  As far as I know Mullingar and other country <Col N="134" /> towns, I think the people do not bother their heads about it.  In most country towns when the people from the country go in with milk in the mornings they find the shops shut and the people apparently not bothering about summer time.  They are taking it easy.  The other argument I heard about summer time is that it does not interfere with agriculturists as they can keep whatever time they like.  If we are going to have law and order in this country the same conditions should apply all over.  Do not make a law that one person can keep and another person must break, and thus create confusion. There is confusion at present.  As Deputy Kennedy pointed out, in one parish there are two times kept.  In Deputy Hurley's household there are two times, and in my household there are two times.  I do not know where I am sometimes or what time it is. Everyone else is in the same position. Personally I never change my watch. I always have old time.  Occasionally I get at a glance at some one else's clock with the new time, and even though I know the train starts an hour earlier than it should start, when I walk into a shop I find that I am sometimes late for a train.  This thing creates more confusion in this country than any law or order that is published. There is no justification whatever for it.</P>
    <P>While people are arguing from the English point of view to make the hour available for our people, it should be remembered that we have followed the English hard and fast, and have made the extra hour practically the normal time all the year round.  Some years ago we took 25 minutes off our time, so that normally, without any summer time, those living in the south of Ireland are already 40 or 45 minutes in advance of the sun.  We are now asked to go one better than the British, by adding another hour to the three-quarters that we had already.  That is what we are really asked to do in the name of daylight saving, to go one better than the English.  If I was asked my opinion on the matter I would say: &ldquo;Go back to God's time!&rdquo; Most Deputies are old enough to remember that when crossing to Holyhead <Col N="135" /> one had to change the watch by 25 minutes and the same thing happened on the return journey.  There was nothing about inconvenience then.  No tourist from England or Northern Ireland spoke of the inconvenience, and the Government did not bleat about inconvenience, yet that is put forward now as an argument in favour of the adoption of summer time.  From whatever view point it is looked at, whether the convenience of the majority of the people or of health I say that some gain might be got by rising at four o'clock on a summer's morning to take advantage of the cool and beautiful daylight hours before starting work, rather than trying to exercise a tired body and a tired mind at the tail of the evening, when youngsters should be going to bed.</P>
    <P>Sometimes in the summer months when I am going home from the Dáil at 11 o'clock at night, I pass York Street and I see the place teeming with children that should be in bed hours earlier.  Driving home at that hour after leaving the Dáil, one would naturally expect in the months of June or July that the children would be off the streets, and that the traffic lights might be disregarded, but, as things are, one has to exercise just as much caution at that hour of the night as in the day, because the children are still rambling around.  Deputy Kennedy said that it was no argument if one's neighbour did not adopt summer time.  Naturally workmen in the country want to get off early to meet their pals.  Who blames them?  That is not a demand for summer time but for the companionship of their fellow workers.  I would wish to do the same if I was in their position.  In a letter in to-day's newspaper a doctor made out what he considered to be a good case for summer time.  He said that it was favoured by city residents and that, as far as he knew, no farmers had objected to it. He then quoted the case of a farmer who is dead against this order but whose 18 workmen were in favour of it. Accordingly the farmer had to be in favour of it.  I know that several of my workmen are in favour of it, because road workers and men living near <Col N="136" /> the towns are finished early and naturally the others want to get off at the same time.  There is no justification for any differentiation.  If we are going to have a law, make everybody abide by it.  Let the Government enforce it solidly, or not pass it at all.  If they enforce it generally, as laws ought to be enforced, and make it compulsory on everyone to adopt summer time, I warn the Minister that he will be up against a greater agitation than ever he thought he would be up against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy made one striking statement when he said that summer time was dead, no matter what the decision of the House might be.  That statement is perfectly true, and if one thing has tended to kill summer time for all time, it is the adoption of the measure in the middle of winter.  Nobody could justify this measure at any time of the year, but the fact that it has been adopted in February has aroused public opinion to such an extent that the system is certain to be quickly abolished.  It has been said that the agricultural community, in seeking the abolition of summer time, are unjust and unfair to the urban population, and Deputy Kennedy suggested that it was not fair for the agricultural community to try to ram their opinions down the throats of the 30 per cent. of the people living in the towns.  He spoke very sympathetically of the pale-faced drapers' assistants, but I should like to ask is it just or fair that 30 per cent. of the people, if there are 30 per cent. in favour of summer time, and I question that, should ram their views down the throats of 70 per cent.?  I question very much whether 30 per cent. of the people are in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time there might have been some justification for summer time, that is, when hours of work were long in the towns, and particularly in shops where shop assistants had to work from early in the morning to very late at night.  At that time there might have been some justification for a reduction of an hour in the evening or night; but now, when hours are limited, and when there is ample opportunity for leisure provided&mdash;and provided by Acts of this House&mdash;for people engaged in <Col N="137" /> offices and shops, there is absolutely no reason whatever why the people in the rural areas should be so seriously inconvenienced as they are by this measure.  It has been said that this legislation does not affect the rural population at all, but everybody who lives in a rural area knows that it is the cause of endless confusion.  We know, for example, that milk is collected according to summer time; we know that trains run according to this legal time; and we know that, in very many parishes, even the schools are running according to summer time.  In face of that, it cannot be suggested for one moment that the rural population are not very seriously inconvenienced.  To begin with, there is the confusion with regard to times.  I listened to two people making an appointment, and one said: &ldquo;I will meet you at 7 o'clock.&rdquo;&ldquo;That is 8 o'clock,&rdquo; said the other.  &ldquo;No, it is 6 o'clock,&rdquo; said the first person.  I think that is quite a common occurrence, and, in face of that, is it not perfectly certain that there is a considerable amount of confusion caused?</P>
    <P>Serious also is the inconvenience and injustice inflicted upon children. Deputy Murphy described the children of this country as the hardest workers in the country, and there is no doubt whatever that children, particularly in rural areas, where they have to travel two or three miles to school, have to rise very early, even where the old time is observed; but where new time is observed you have a situation in which children are roused from sleep before they have obtained half their natural or normal rest.  It may be said that children could be sent to bed at an early hour, but it must be remembered that, on farms, where people are working late, as they must in the summer months and during the harvest, it is impossible for children to go to sleep early, and the result is that when they are aroused early in the morning, a very serious hardship is inflicted upon them, and serious injury done to their health.  That is something which the people should not tolerate for one moment.  We have the same injustice and inconvenience caused with regard to fairs and markets, where they are held at an abnormally early hour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> We have to ask ourselves what advantage is anybody gaining by this. This was introduced as a daylight saving measure, but nobody can say what saving of daylight is secured by taking one hour off the evening and adding it to the morning.  Surely daylight is as valuable in the morning as it is in the evening.  It reminds one of the answer given to the woman who had bought blankets in a shop and who complained that they were too short and would not cover her feet.  The shop people told her that the only thing she could do was to take six inches off the top and put them on the bottom of the blanket. That is exactly what the State is endeavouring to do by this legislation. This measure had its origin in an abnormal period, a period in which the Government of Britain and the people legislating in the House of Commons were suffering from nerves, from what are now known, I believe, as &ldquo;jitters&rdquo;.  They lost their heads completely and somebody suggested that it would be a good thing to introduce a measure of this kind, and, being confused and bewildered by the course of events during the last war, they were unable to think of anything better, and accepted the suggestion.  The result was that this ridiculous measure has been enforced ever since and we have made ourselves even more ridiculous by accepting it.</P>
    <P>We frequently claim to be a neutral country and a separate nation, and we try in various ways to assert our individual and separate nationality; yet, here is one way in which we can assert our separate nationality as a nation, and we refused to adopt it. We refused to adopt a time of our own which would be a purely Irish time and which would demonstrate to the world that this is a separate nation from Great Britain.  We have the fact that, for many years, Irish time was 25 minutes behind English time and no inconvenience was caused to anybody. Having regard to the fact that this is an agricultural country; having regard to the fact that the entire agricultural community are against this summer time; and having regard to the fact that it is no advantage whatever to the urban population, we should have no hesitation in supporting this <Col N="139" /> motion.  As I say, the urban population derive no benefit, financially or from the health point of view, from the operation of this system, and these are the two most important considerations.</P>
    <P>We all know that people in the towns do not retire one hour earlier at night as a result of summer time, although they have to rise one hour earlier in the morning.  The townspeople, therefore, as a result of this are losing one hour's sleep and that is a serious consideration which should weigh with those who talk so much about the health of the people.  In addition to that, owing to the high cost of living the earnings of the people in the towns are not sufficient to meet the demands on them at the present time, so that the additional hours of leisure are of very little advantage to them as they have not the money to travel or enjoy those hours of leisure.  Therefore, summer time cannot be justified from any point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy suggested that there might be local option in regard to this.  I do not know how that suggestion would work.  I suppose we would have trains starting from Kingsbridge by new time and perhaps at one of the stations on the way where the time was not changed they would have to wait for an hour and then would have to accelerate at another stage in order to get back to new time again. That would tend to make confusion more confounded.  I am afraid that Deputy Kennedy's defence of this summer time legislation, so far from strengthening the case for its retention, has more or less doomed it to an earlier extinction than would otherwise happen.  Therefore, I think no argument can be advanced in support of this so-called daylight saving.  I think it is absolutely intolerable to be interfering with the natural time which is set by the sun.  Common sense and reason would dictate that people should be guided by the natural law and not by laws made at a time when the British were suffering from an overdose of nerves.</P>

      <P>If I were to sit quiet to-night listening to some of the <Col N="140" /> speeches made and not to express what I know are the feelings of my constituents, I believe I would not be doing my duty to my constituents.  Deputy Kennedy, for some reason known to himself, was pleased to refer to my constituency in support of his argument. I think I know that constituency fairly well and it is 80 per cent. agricultural. Perhaps if the blockade goes on it will be 90 per cent. agricultural.  I regard summer time as a prohibition against agriculture.  Therefore, we have compulsory tillage on the one hand and prohibition on the other.  It is said that the farmers are not bound to go by summer time.  I know the position of the farmers and the labourers in my constituency.  When the shops are closed the agricultural labourers, even if you pay them overtime, cannot procure the things they want in the towns in the evening.  There is, therefore, nothing but confusion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy mentioned that in one particular parish there are three &ldquo;times&rdquo; observed.  I was there on one occasion and was asked, &ldquo;Can you tell me what time it is?&rdquo;  I said it was such-and-such a time, and was asked, &ldquo;Is that new time, old time, or middle time?&rdquo;  I was not able to answer the question until I had thought over it. I do not want to have that kind of confusion. I know that in the rural areas feeling is growing against this summer time, and that protest meetings are being called where school teachers and managers are inclined to put it in force. Why should we go against the feeling of at least 70 per cent. of the people? It is stated that there is to be a commission appointed to inquire into the matter.  I should like to know how that commission will be constituted.  I do not want to have it doomed before it sits.  There is always that suspicion here.  Compulsory tillage is to be enforced, and I am supporting it in every part of my constituency.  I want the people who are going into it wholeheartedly not to be hindered by the introduction of summer time.  Things are vexatious enough for them at present without adding this.</P>

      <P>Might I draw the attention of the House to the fact that <Col N="141" /> this motion is to cancel an Emergency Order made by the Minister which brought in summer time in February instead of in April.  Therefore, when we are discussing the question of summer time generally, we are not discussing the motion before the House. I think that this motion can be very easily disposed of.  If the British did not bring in summer time in February this year, would we have brought it in?  The British brought in summer time in February because they are at war and because of the black-out.  If we were at war and a black-out were in force, then I presume it would be good business on our part to bring it in.  But we are not at war.  Why then bring it in?  If the British were not at war would we have brought it in?  If we would not, we ought to cancel the order now.  That is the whole case in a nutshell, and I do not think there is anything to be added to or taken from it.</P>

      <P>The only person who really dealt with the motion is Deputy MacEoin.  All the other Deputies who spoke dealt with the question of summer time generally.  When we came into office we found the Act of 1925 in operation and we continued it. <Col N="142" /> We are aware, however, that there are arguments to be advanced on both sides.  I am sorry that there were not more speakers on behalf of the other interests.  Agriculture is undoubtedly entitled to every consideration and gets it.  It has certainly got it here.  I think that there are arguments to be heard on both sides of this question. We have decided on setting up a committee that will examine the working of this Summer Time Act, and after having heard evidence on both sides, advise the Government as to whether this Act should be continued or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it will be confined to outside interests; agricultural interests will be represented by two farmers, one member will represent organised labour, one member will represent business and there will be the chairman.  I am not quite sure yet as to the personnel.  We have asked certain people to sit and it will be a satisfactory committee.  It will hear evidence for and against the continuance of summer time.  I do not therefore propose to anticipate what the decision will be or to make any case for or against.  I hold my own views. There are differences of opinion in every Party on the subject.  When the inquiry is being held the point of view expressed by Deputy Kennedy will be advanced there too I expect, and probably it will not be found that there is no case for the continuance of summer time.  How any Deputy could come to the conclusion that there is no case for it I do not understand.  There is a case on both sides.  Deputy Murphy said what was required was a decision and not an inquiry.  Well, we do not feel in a position to give a decision until we have a very full inquiry into the working of the Act.  It has been in operation now for a quarter of a century; through this committee we will get a fair and unbiased opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One question was asked&mdash;if the British had not introduced this early summer time this year would we have done so.  Certainly not.  Someone suggested that it was slavishly following <Col N="143" /> the British.  It was not.  Representations were made to us by business interests, railway companies, the Post Office and others that to change the time schedules followed by the British until the 1st April and then in April go back to the summer time would lead to endless confusion.  If we were to abolish it altogether it would be a different matter; to make changes now for the sake of a few weeks would not be worth while.  Had we changed now until the beginning of April we would have to change back again to meet the conditions in England.  That is what would be happening in a few weeks' time.  On balance, the arguments put forward in favour of a change now are not sufficiently strong.  Whatever the findings of this committee may be, or whatever decision they may come to, we will continue on in April.  The committee's decision would not affect summer time in any way for the rest of the year.  There will be no change there from what we have now in the Act of Parliament.  If there were a change, there would have to be changes in the matter of the Post Office and, as was pointed out to us, great difficulties would be created, difficulties that would be very confusing.  Where-as if the Summer Time Act were dropped altogether it would be an entirely different thing.  Personally I am not going to give my views on this matter at all.  I have my own personal opinion.  The Government has not come to a decision on it yet.  We have the Act on the Statute Book, and it must take effect this year.  Therefore, it is a question whether we are to change for the eight weeks or not.</P>

The Government realise that there is a difference of opinion, and that there are arguments to be advanced on both sides. The committee to be set up will be fairly representative of all interests, <Col N="144" /> and will make a full inquiry into the working of this Act.  Every section and every body that has an interest in the matter will be able to come forward and give evidence before this inquiry.</P>

      <P>Nothing that we have heard in the course of this debate in favour of summer time can carry any conviction with any reasonable person; nothing that has been said in favour of this ludicrous measure has caused me to alter my opinion.  Deputy MacEoin suggests that the proposal before the House deals with the period between now and April when the summer time will be introduced.  My motion is an effective way of dealing with the matter.  It is dealing with the present position.  A method of dealing with the situation can be found in April in accordance with the rules of the House.  There have been quite a number of ridiculous arguments advanced in favour of this summer time.  I think the sample we had from Deputy Kennedy is the most ludicrous. He talked about workers, tourists and <Col N="146" /> others looking for a glimpse of the sun on February mornings when we had no sun.  Now as to the attitude of the workers with regard to this matter, I think I might say that the Cork Workers' Council represents the organised workers of Cork, and they expressed their views in the course of the last week.  In various shops and offices in that city the people I met gave expression to their views.  The Minister for Justice is a very disarming opponent.  It is very hard to be severe with him, but I think he realises to-night that in this matter he has a very bad case to defend.</P>
