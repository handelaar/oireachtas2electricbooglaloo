      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that an agreement was entered into between the commissioner administering the affairs of the Laoighis County Council and the union representing the road workers employed by the same county council in April last under which the workers were to receive an increase of 3/- per week in their wages; whether approval for the terms of this agreement has been withheld by his Department, and if not if he is now prepared to authorise the commissioner to put the terms of the agreement into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative.  In April last I received a communication from the commissioner for Laoighis County intimating that subject to the sanction of the Department he had decided to grant an increase in wages for road workers in the county.  I was given to understand at the same time that the increase in wages would involve an annual expenditure of £3,000, that no provision had been made therefor in the current year's rate, and that it was intended to close down road work for approximately one month of the year so as to keep within the estimate.  It was considered that there was not sufficient reason for the arrangement, <Col N="1774" /> and the approval sought was not signified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether any recent proposals have been made for the reopening of the Dublin Dockyard and the nature of these proposals; whether certain clauses in the agreement for the letting have prevented its opening, and what these clauses are; whether any progress is being made otherwise regarding the development of this dockyard, and, if not, whether he will hold an inquiry into the cause of the inactivity in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that proposals have recently been made to the Dublin Port and Docks Board for the reopening of the Dublin Dockyard. These negotiations, however, are being carried on directly between the Port and Docks Board and the parties making the proposals, and at the moment I have no authority to intervene in <Col N="1776" /> the negotiations.  The Port and Docks Board is aware of my desire that no opportunity of having work resumed should be lost.  I have no reason to believe that the Port and Docks Board does not share my views, but I shall take an early opportunity of conveying to the Board my desire that negotiations should be pursued energetically to a successful conclusion.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Removal of Protective Tariffs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in view of the Minister for Supplies' radio appeal to merchants to accumulate stocks of imported necessaries it is intended to effect the immediate removal of all protective tariffs and quota restrictions on cotton piece goods, cotton hose, cotton blankets, leather, thread and other necessaries of which shortage is apprehended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A system of protective tariffs and quota restrictions was built up in order to create the conditions necessary for the establishment of new industries and the expansion of existing industries.  The result has been greatly increased industrial production and employment.  I need hardly suggest to the Deputy that to take a step which would obviously create unemployment and reduce home production would not help the country to pass through the present period of emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> I should say, however, that in the administration of the quota system and of the licensing powers attached to most of the protective duties, I have had such relaxation carried into effect as would ensure the maximum ease of importation consistent with the minimum ill-effects on home production and employment.  I can promise the Deputy that I will keep under constant review the action of the Department in relation to applications for import easement on the lines I have indicated. Clearly, where home firms are able to supply, it is in the general interest to do everything possible to ensure the import of the raw or semi-finished materials for the home industry and so maintain both supplies and home employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply I wish to ask if the Minister would say in respect of flannelette and cotton blankets, whether he would give a licence to import these commodities free of duty, for if he will, we can now get in Great Britain substantial stocks of these commodities against the winter; and is he aware that the home industries producing these commodities are in hopeless arrears with deliveries of most, if not all, of the numbers they undertook to produce? Is the Minister aware that unless we get licences to import duty free now, this stuff cannot be got in and it will not be here next winter?  Will the Minister give anybody who has trade contacts with Great Britain an opportunity now, in the light of this emergency, of getting these goods, admitting that this would be a departure from the general protective policy that has been in operation up to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give an affirmative answer to that question without giving the matter full consideration but having heard what the Deputy has said I shall look into it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the average price offered for farmers' butter in the market held at <Col N="1778" /> Dunmanway, County Cork, on June 18th was 7d. per lb.; that similar prices are being paid in Ballydehob and other West Cork centres, and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to ensure that a reasonable price will be paid for farmers' butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, owing to the difficulties which have been experienced in connection with the export of non-creamery butter, buyers felt obliged to reduce prices in recent weeks.  I have, however, been definitely informed that the price paid at Dunmanway on the 18th instant was 8d. per lb. except in a very few cases of inferior quality.  In general the recent prices ranged from 8d. to 6d. per pound according to quality.</P>
      <P>Most of the difficulties encountered in respect of exports of non-creamery butter have now been overcome and better prices will be obtainable henceforth. If farmers improve the quality of their butter the average prices will be further enhanced as there is a considerable difference between the export value of 1st grade and other grades of non-creamery butter.  The prices announced by the Irish Dairy Butter Trade Ltd. from Monday, 24th June, are 10d. per lb. for 1st grade; 9d. per lb. for 2nd grade, and 6d. per lb. for 3rd grade.</P>

      <P>It was estimated that for the A.R.P. scheme in Dublin the following numbers of volunteers would be required:&mdash;2,800 as wardens, 2,000 for first-aid, 460 for fire-fighting, 320 for rescue and demolition, 350 for decontamination, and 2,000 for emergency communications. Up to the present 2,000 have volunteered for the warden service, 2,800 for the first-aid service, and 270 for the fire-fighting service.  The rescue and demolition service is being undertaken by the builders in the city and the necessary arrangements are being made with them.  The decontamination <Col N="1780" /> service is being organised by the corporation, and is being manned with their staffs.  The persons required for emergency communications would be mainly youths, and the scouts' organisations have offered to provide volunteers for this service.  Accordingly, a further 800 wardens and about 200 for the fire-fighting service in addition to a certain number for reserve are required.  The present programme aims at providing for all emergencies that can reasonably be foreseen at the moment.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The provisions of the Local Elections Act, 1937, require that triennial elections of members of local authorities be held not later than the 30th September next.  In the prevailing conditions it is considered prudent. to extend the period within which these elections are to be held to the 30th September, 1941.  But for this Bill the year 1940 would be a triennial election year, and the annual or quarterly meetings of local authorities at which chairmen or mayors, as the case may be, are elected would be held after the elections of members.  To remove any doubts or uncertainties as to the time for the holding of these meetings, during this month, the year 1940 is deemed to be a year in which a triennial election is not held.  The Local Elections Act, 1927, accordingly, requires these meetings to be held not earlier than the 23rd instant, not later than the 1st July, and any annual or quarterly meeting held as such during that period is valid.  If for any cause the meeting is not held, the Act of 1927 authorises the holding of the meeting at a convenient later date. Section 6 confers the necessary powers to resolve any difficulties that may arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reported in the Official Reports as saying, when I was last referring to this Bill, that owing to the microscopic changes taking place in the situation, where, in fact, I said that, owing to the kaleidoscopic changes that were taking place in the situation, the Minister could not be extensively found fault with if a straight and clear line of policy could not be detected in the orders that he made from day to day.  I want to repeat that now, but I think that the Minister should bear in mind that one of the results of the necessity for mending his hand at frequent intervals, as a result of circumstances in Great Britain over which he has no control, is to create a very considerable measure of confusion in the public mind.  I appreciate that it may not be possible to give a full and reasoned explanation of each change that is made lest embarrassment should be created with the other party to the agreements which we have to make from time to time.</P>
      <P>Three weeks or perhaps a month ago all the bacon factories were bitterly complaining that their stores were packed, that they could not take in any more bacon and that they could not accept pigs.  Within the last three or four days the situation has radically altered and we are moving into a period in which it might be necessary to place some restrictions again on exports of bacon.  The Minister will realise that the putting of restrictions on exports last January was followed by an immense glut of bacon in the factories and a refusal to accept pigs. If, as a result of the agreement recently made, there is an immense exodus of bacon, it is conceivable that another restriction will be put on which will give rise to a cry from those who will anticipate a similar result to that which arose subsequent to the Minister's January restriction order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> Am I correct in saying that, if the situation remains substantially as it is to-day, we may expect a demand for pigs and bacon in this country greater than our probable capacity to produce and that, therefore, any person who has barley or other foodstuffs on his own land may look forward with confidence to their profitable realisation as a result of feeding them to pigs?  My reading of the situation is that there will be a remunerative price and a virtually inexhaustible demand for pig products unless there is some revolutionary change in the international situation during the next 12 months.  I think the Minister would do well if he would forecast for us to-day what plans he has in mind, firstly, to deal with the oat surplus to which I referred on an earlier stage of this Bill and, secondly, to indicate to pigs feeders what the probable situation will be in regard to Indian meal supplies next autumn.</P>
    <P>I want to renew to-day the suggestion I made a week ago, that a maize meal mixture scheme on the lines outlined by me should be announced.  I do not think a Bill will be necessary to do this.  I think an order can be made requiring the millers to consign with each parcel of Indian meal a parcel of ground oats or barley and the proportion of ground oats and barley associated with the Indian meal can be varied from time to time in accordance with expert advice and the exigency of supply.  It is vital to the success of the pig industry that that should be done in the very early future, and it is vital to the success of the general agricultural policy of the country that the carry-over of surplus oats from this season into the new season should not be allowed and that the old oats should be disposed of before the new oats come on the market.  If you do not do that, you are going to have a collapse in the price of oats for the first three months of the new harvest year, with the result that every small farmer who cannot wait to cash his crop is going to get it in the neck, and it will be virtually impossible to persuade these people to sow cereal crops in the ensuing harvest.  Those are matters of the most urgent and vital importance and they should be dealt <Col N="1797" /> with forthwith.  I would be grateful if the Minister would give some indication of the line we ought to pursue in the country in regard to these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking here the last day, I said I was not in a position to say anything in connection with the future of our exports of bacon.  Since then the British Government have agreed to take 60,000 extra cwts. of bacon.  The price is not yet determined.  The old contract of 500,000 cwts. per year, at a price of 133/6d., or a price related to what British factories get for their bacon, continues and the 60,000 cwts. will be in addition to the old quota. Unfortunately, I have not found it possible to get the British Government to discuss our quota from the end of August on, apart from the 40,000 cwts. per month that we have already, and therefore it is difficult under these circumstances to give any undertaking to pig producers that, in regard to all the pigs, a market will be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; this 60,000 cwts. is to be filled in the next two months, in addition to the other quota.  Beyond that there is no certainty of what we may be able to get rid of and, therefore, I am not in a position to assure farmers that their pigs will be taken in three, six or 12 months' time.  It is a pity we cannot do that, but it is not within our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think the 60,000 cwts. can be filled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  The curers have given us a return of the stocks on hands and there is not the slightest doubt that the 60,000 cwts. can be filled without any inconvenience <Col N="1798" /> to our consumers here.  The other point raised by Deputy Dillon was with regard to oats.  On that I cannot say more than was said the last day.  On that occasion I did undertake to go into this matter again, to see whether some scheme could be devised that would take the oats from the small farmers, especially those who have to get rid of their oats at the time of thrashing.  Undoubtedly, there is a good deal in what Deputy Dillon says, that it is those smaller men in that position who generally suffer because the price comes down.  A few months afterwards, when they have to buy feeding stuffs, they generally find that prices are high, so that they suffer both ways.  I am having the suggestion made by the Deputy examined: that is of finding some method to require the millers to take oats and barley in proportion to the amount of maize meal they may be using.  If that is considered to be the best means of dealing with this, naturally we will adopt it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the imports of maize meal, I cannot say anything definite.  I do not think that the Government is in any better position than the ordinary citizen to give an opinion on that: The whole matter depends entirely on how shipping goes in general.  I suppose, to some extent, that will depend on how the sea war will go in general.  The opinion of the ordinary citizen on that is perhaps as good as that of any member of the Government.  We cannot give any forecast as to what our supplies of maize may be in the winter. Naturally, we will get all the maize that we can in.  The indications at the moment are that the maize coming in for the next two or three months will probably be somewhat cheaper than it has been for the last three or four months, so that to that extent the rearing of pigs may be somewhat more profitable than it has been.  It is, however, impossible to say what quantity of maize can be got in in the next three or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister should have committed himself, <Col N="1799" /> in such a vague way, on this matter, because the people are looking to the Government to give them some indication as to what they ought to do.  We do not expect the Minister to be a prophet.  What we are asking is, that with the information at his disposal and at the disposal of the Department of Supplies, he would advise the people what to do.  Now, with the limited information at my disposal, I have no hesitation whatever in advising people to produce all the pigs they can.  I may be wrong.  All that I can tell them is that that is my view. It is my firm belief that it would be a wise thing to do.  I think the Minister should take the risk of telling the people what they should do.  I may be wrong, but yet, I think, that in all the circumstances the people are entitled to some kind of guidance.  They ought to be told whether they should get out of pigs or produce all they can.  As I have said, I have no hesitation in advising them that, to the best of my ability in summing up the situation, they should produce all the pigs they can.  At the same time, I would be glad if the Minister would give his opinion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other matter, I fully appreciate the Minister's action in reviewing that situation.  The small farmer will have his oats to dispose of next September after the thrashing. The real problem there is the oats that have been left on the small oat dealer's hands.  There is a real problem there, and it is this, that the oats that have been left on the small oats dealers' hands from last year's crop should be got off the market either by exporting them or converting them into ground oats.  If that is done, the problem will be very much simplified. The real menace is that the carry over of last year's oats will depress the market in September and October.  If the carry over is taken off the market by someone now, then there will be virtually no problem next September or October.  The problem is one that will require treatment.  I want to warn the Minister that, if the carry-over is not taken off the market now, the steps requisite to deal with the <Col N="1800" /> situation next autumn will have to be of a very elaborate character.  I do not believe they will be taken, and, therefore, there will be a lot of suffering and misery.  The key to this problem is to get the carry-over off the market.  If that is done the problem will be simplified in September and October.</P>

As a matter of fact, it was the first matter that we got on to when considering the question of feeding stuffs&mdash;to see what could be done with the oats on the hands of seed merchants and others at the moment.  That matter, as I have said, is being considered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 5, to delete the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;nine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 would have the effect of bringing in the Minister for Agriculture as co-trustee of the funds realised by the levies on cattle.  These levies are to be accumulated in a fund analogous to the Foot and Mouth Fund for the compensation of owners who lose a beast or who have a beast injured in transit between Ireland and its destination in Great Britain.  It is perfectly true to say that the members who are likely to be elected to this board by the Livestock Exporters' Association are eminently trustworthy men, men in whose hands one would have no hesitation whatever in leaving a substantial sum of money on trust.  The experience of all of us in business is that, even if you are on a board of directors, having deep confidence in your fellow directors, you still want the assurance of an independent auditor who will audit the accounts and present a report to the board of directors, a man on whose report each individual director is entitled to act. I think it is good law to say that no director need go behind the auditor's report for the purpose of forming his judgment as to what is right to do in connection with the company for which he is a trustee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is true that the board envisaged under this Bill will employ an auditor, but there is no restriction on the character of the auditor who is to be employed&mdash;when I say character <Col N="1802" /> I mean to say the class of auditor who is to be employed&mdash;except that he should be a certified accountant. What this body of eight men have to do is not only to satisfy one another that these funds are being properly administered, but to satisfy every man in this country who ships a beast that these funds are being properly administered. The auditor's report to the eight members of the committee may satisfy each individual member of the committee that all is well, that he is entitled to remain a member and that he is satisfied that the auditor's report covers the whole story, but will the individual cattle shipper who has never managed to get on the board or who cannot find amongst the eight men on the board any person particularly representing his point of view be permanently satisfied that his interests are properly protected unless there is on the board a representative of the Government who it is to be assumed will be generally a trustee and representative of those elements in the cattle shipping trade who are not represented by any one of the eight individuals elected by the popular vote of the organisation?  I think it is true to say that the working of the foot and mouth disease measure is directly under the control of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I am not pressing this amendment very strongly.  To tell you the truth, so far as I am concerned the scheme will satisfy me perfectly well. I have no doubt there will be men elected under the scheme here before us who will provide me with all the assurances that I personally require that everything will be properly done. It is really for the sake of the men who are liable to be put on this board that I put down this amendment.  It is more for the purpose of protecting these men and to be able to say that the Minister was properly informed and that all interests were represented. It is not a matter for which I would press very hard but I thought that if the suggestion came from me it would <Col N="1803" /> be received better than coming from the Government, lest it might be said that the latter were not satisfied about the integrity of the men on the board.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment is not really necessary.  Under the Detained Animals (Compensation) Act, there is the very same organisation in the matter of the fund in connection with the foot and mouth disease and that has operated very satisfactorily.  I think Deputies will agree that if there were any exporters who had any grievance with regard to the way the fund was administered they would make their grievances known to Deputies or to me, but I never had a complaint.  Where we have a board working satisfactorily on their own, we should not interfere with them.  I think Deputy Dillon takes that view too.</P>

It can hardly be effective as compulsory insurance because, as it stands, the owner can put a purely nominal value on the beast if he wants in any way to evade the insurance.  Is there any possibility of getting over that difficulty? This is a very expensive scheme and I do not see any way out of it, <Col N="1806" /> but this does not seem to make it watertight as compulsory insurance.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Bill and to its passage now, the House will remember that on an earlier stage I mentioned the circumstances of certain employees of a firm engaged in the insurance of cattle for many years in this country and I asked the Minister to look into the matter.  I understand that the Minister was good enough, in the course of an interview he had with representatives of the Livestock Exporters' Association to <Col N="1809" /> direct their attention to that representation. Senator John Counihan was good enough to say to me to-day, and to ask me to mention his name in this connection, on behalf of the Livestock Exporters' Association, that the Minister did not feel himself in a position to act as their spokesman and that, therefore, in agreement with the Minister, he did so and desired to communicate to me that the Livestock Exporters' Association undertook to provide analogous employment for the persons on whose behalf I spoke, with special reference to one of them, Ernest Nolan, whose circumstances I was peculiarly familiar with.  I accept that undertaking, and I have no doubt, from my own knowledge of the men who gave it to me, that it will be carried out both in the letter and in the spirit.  In these circumstances, such objections or apprehensions as I may have entertained about the consequences of this Bill are removed as far as I am concerned and the Bill has my entire assent.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill proposes to confirm three Emergency Orders, Nos. 203, 204 and 206. The first of the orders is an amendment of a definition which appears in Section 1 of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 4) Act, 1932, whereby a customs duty was imposed at the rate of 9d. per square yard, or 6d. preferential on articles defined as compositions made of plaster of paris in sheets or slabs.  Emergency Order No. 203, which it is proposed to confirm by this Bill, simply alters that definition to make it read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Compositions which are made wholly or mainly of or from gypsum and calcium of sulphate and which are imported in sheets or slabs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> There will be no change in the rate of duty.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 204) Order provides for an amendment in the application of the duty chargeable on certain woven tissues of wool or worsted.  Prior to the making of this order, these woven tissues bore a duty at the rate of £3 per cent., or 30 per cent. preferential, in every case in which the value of the tissue exceeded 1/6 per square yard.  The amendment now proposes to raise the exemption limit, that is to say, to extend the exemption so as to cover worsted tissues, not merely which do not exceed 1/6 per square yard, but which do not exceed 2/6 per square yard in value.  To that extent it is a relaxation of the duty.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 206) Order proposes to exempt from duty component parts of agricultural machinery other than ploughs in all cases where the value of those parts does not exceed £2.  Hitherto the exemption limit has been 5/- per part, and this, as is clear to Deputies, proposes to raise the exemption limit from 5/- to £2 per part.</P>

We ought not, however, to write this Bill into our permanent legislation.  I suggest to the Minister, therefore, that he might put into this Bill a section, intimating that it has a limited life; in other words, that the operation of the Bill would be for 12 months, so that perhaps in calmer circumstances we might review the position. That gives the Minister all the power and authority he wants for the problem with which this Bill immediately deals and, at the same time, enables him in these circumstances to get a short continuation Bill at the end of that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides safeguards so far as certain moneys that might be wrongly confiscated are concerned.  There is an assumption that a mistake might be made and an attempt is made to give a right to make claims.  I wonder very much if the attempt is as good as the intention, because from the reading of the section and sub-sections one is led to believe that the person from whom the money is taken must be the person who makes the claim.  We can visualise a case where a person has died and the heirs might make a claim.  There might be matters to be decided before a court and the claim might not be made within the two months prescribed in the section.  In connection with sub-section (2), it might not be possible to produce evidence to satisfy the High Court as to ownership of property as other proceedings might be in abeyance.  An applicant might not be able to give such evidence as would satisfy the court.  The intention apparently is all right, but whether it is fully met by the Bill is a question that I wish the Minister to look into.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill makes provision for the incorporation of the urban district of Howth in the County Borough of Dublin and for the repeal of Sections 53 (3) and 101 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930.</P>
      <P>Section 101 of that Act provided for the appointment of a tribunal to report on boundaries and joint public health services within five years after the passing of the Act, and for a further investigation of these problems by a tribunal to be appointed not later than ten years after the passing of the Act. The report of the first tribunal was received towards the end of 1938.  It constitutes a very comprehensive documentation of metropolitan problems and contains proposals of a far-reaching character.  As I indicated during the discussions on the County Management Bill I do not propose to deal at present with the main proposals in the report.  There is no need for entering upon a second inquiry; and it is proposed to repeal the provisions of Section 101 of the Act of 1930.</P>
      <P>The tribunal in their report did definitely establish the need for bringing the Howth Urban District within the county borough for administrative purposes, and that view was subsequently endorsed by the Howth Urban District Council.  This Bill, therefore, proposes to give legislative effect to its inclusion in the county borough. The urban district is a favourite pleasure ground of the citizens of Dublin and the future development of the area and the preservation of its amenities should have an important place in city management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of the urban district in the county borough will involve a transfer to the corporation of the administration of the services relating to <Col N="1815" /> roads, scavenging, lighting, sanitary works, housing and other miscellaneous services.  The services administered by the county council in so far as they affect the urban district, which will be transferred to the corporation, relate to the preparation of voters and jurors lists, the administration of the Acts relating to weights and measures, and food and drugs.  The joint services under the control of the Dublin Board of Health relate to the treatment of tuberculosis, the school medical service and the welfare of the blind which will also pass to the corporation.  The Howth Urban District is at present included in the Dublin Union area and its transfer to the corporation would make little difference in the contribution of the urban district towards union expenses.</P>
    <P>The property, debts and liabilities of the county council and the urban district in respect of the above services would be the subject of adjustment between the county council and the corporation under Section 19 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act which is applied by the Bill.  The financial effect on the city and the urban district will be slight.  The rates for the present year are 20/2, plus 2/4 water rate, in the £ in the urban district and 20/9 in the £ in the county borough. The incidence of the rate on agricultural land in the urban district will be higher when the district is incorporated in the county borough, as it will then be rated to the municipal rate on one-half the valuation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill incorporates the necessary portions of the Act of 1930, the provisions of which are necessary by reason of the inclusion of the urban district in the county borough.  The principal incorporated provisions relate to the transfer of property and liabilities; the preservation of continuing contracts; the continuance of bye-laws, of resolutions of the council, and of any legal proceedings; the collection of rates due or accruing to the urban council, the transfer of officers and employees; the award of compensation to officers by reason of abolition of office; and the application and adaptation of enactments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> The Bill also repeals sub-section (3) of Section 53 of the Act of 1930 and makes provision for the appointment of Dublin City Manager in the manner laid down in the County Management Act for the appointment of county managers, whereby the Local Appointments Commission shall recommend a person on the application of the Minister and such person shall by virtue of such recommendation be appointed to the position of city manager on a date to be fixed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I have no recollection of any intimation having been received by the corporation of the intention to bring Howth into the city area.  My whole experience of the promotion of Bills for the extension of boundaries for the past 40 years has been that they always brought with them increases in rates and that these increases always remained.  Before this Bill goes further, I think it should be submitted for consideration by the corporation, just that we may know exactly what we are taking in.  In 1935, Rathmines was brought in and we found that we had to spend £25,000 or £30,000 in putting their waterworks into good order.  For years there had been no proper filtering beds and the consequence was that Rathmines people did not know what they were drinking when they were drinking this water.  From what I can gather, Howth township is not a substantial township.  I do not know anything about its liabilities.  Neither do the corporation, so far as I know.  Before we are asked to pass this Bill, we ought to know where we are going.  I understand from the Minister that it is not proposed to proceed until after the elections but the electors should know what is proposed.  I have never had the imperial vision.  I am sure that we have enough territory to govern in the corporation.</P>

If that township was not in a prosperous condition, the chances are that there <Col N="1817" /> would be an agitation by the people there to have it brought into the City of Dublin.  I am speaking from long experience.  When the original Bill to extend the boundaries of Dublin was passed, the rates were very small.  We got a present of Kilmainham, Drumcondra and Clontarf and the result was a big increase in rates, which has not undergone reduction since.  There was a further increase when Rathmines and Pembroke came in and we shall probably have to meet another big impost in connection with Howth. It is only fair that we should know something about the position which will be brought about by this Bill.  I ask the Minister to see that the corporation has an opportunity of examining it before it goes further and I think that is a reasonable request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the appeal of Deputy Kelly for time to consider this Bill but I do not do so for the reasons he has advanced.  The main proposals contained in the report of the Local Government Tribunal are not being put into effect and when the proposals were endorsed by Howth Urban Council, it was with the feeling that the report of the tribunal would be put into effect as a whole.  I know the feeling in Howth Urban Area and I would be inclined to say that it is sharply divided on this issue.  I do not think it would be right that the local government of 5,000 people living in an area which has been cut away&mdash;it is a sort of dead-end, if you wish&mdash;from the city type of local government should be decided in haste.  I understand that it is not necessary to put these proposals into effect, if so decided, until the end of this year.  I do not think that we should now rush this measure without the corporation and the people of Howth getting an opportunity to consider the proposals and to recommend certain improvements by way of amendments to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw this Bill only this morning.  It is necessary to have expert knowledge of the Bill of 1930 to appreciate what the changes are to be and how they will affect the lives of the people of the district.  For that reason, I hope it is not intended to rush this Bill in any <Col N="1818" /> way.  I do not see the necessity for doing so.  Deputy Kelly is afraid of incurring liabilities.  I think I can assure him that the corporation will not incur liabilities but that they will obtain assets.  That area is a peculiarly difficult area from its physical configuration and, from that point of view, is difficult to deal with as a local entity.  It is a seaside resort and a beauty spot.  Opinions are sharply divided as to whether there should be building&mdash;perhaps intensive building&mdash;which building would be necessary in an area scattered over a hill of that type to provide the rates which would make economic the provision of water, sewerage and other amenities.  There is a good water supply&mdash;perhaps as good as Vartry&mdash; which could be developed, and the rates have at no time gone to the exorbitant figure which they reached in other urban areas which have been more highly boosted.  So far as liabilities are concerned, I can assure Deputy Kelly and the Dublin Corporation that the liabilities which would be taken over would be negligible.  That is the result of wise administration and strict economy.  Since the corporation feel that way about it and since the matter has been sprung upon the people of Howth Urban District who, after all, are the people mainly concerned.  I think it would be wise to defer the Committee and other stages of the Bill until there is an opportunity of acquainting the people who will be most interested in this matter as to what is being done.</P>
    <P>These proposals will have effects other than from the local government point of view; they will have effects on the lives of the people in that area. Take the business people, for instance. This urban district of Howth is a tourist resort, and the business people, in the main, rely upon the tourist traffic for a livelihood.  In fact, during the summer time they have to make a sufficient amount of money to last them over the winter and to ensure in many cases that they will not have to dispense with their employees during the winter.  That is a matter that would need adjustment because it affects the livelihood of our people so intimately. <Col N="1819" /> It is a matter that would properly be one for discussion amongst the people concerned and certain recommendations might be made that might be of help when amendments are suggested that, perhaps, could be embodied on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that this Bill arises out of the Report of the Local Government (Dublin) Tribunal which was presented in 1938.  We are now in the year 1940, in the middle of an international crisis and it is at such a time the Minister sees fit to introduce a Bill of this character and to ask for all stages.  It seems to me that such a request is extremely unreasonable.  There has surely been ample time since the presentation of this report to prepare a measure of this sort so that it could be reasonably considered.  We received the Bill this morning and we are asked to pass judgment on it now and give it to the Minister as it stands. He gives us practically no opportunity of amending it.  I think such procedure is most unfair.</P>
      <P>So far as the general principle of the Bill is concerned, I am in entire agreement with it.  I think it is a good Bill.  I look at it from the point of view of town planning and I think Howth should be incorporated in the County Borough of Dublin.  I am quite sure the ratepayers also look at it from that point of view.  We have a lower rate at the present moment than the Howth Urban District Council. Deputy Kelly seems to be unable to get the Rathmines waterworks out of his system.  The fact that there was a flood shortly after the Dublin Corporation took it over, causing considerable damage, has always stuck in his mind, but I do not think he can blame the Act of 1930 for an act of God.  It may interest him to know that the corporation officials have reported that if the present city supply were of the same quality as Rathmines, there would be an annual saving of £15,000 to the citizens because the destruction of lead piping would be much more slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the Bill, the general <Col N="1820" /> idea is good.  It is impossible to say on such short notice whether it could be improved and whether further acquisition might have made a better lay-out from a planning point of view. There has not been sufficient time to consider this matter adequately.  The Minister referred to Part III, which has no direct connection with the rest of the Bill.  He says that this merely enacts the same as was done in the County Management Bill.  Do I understand him correctly, that this is in the same terms as a similar provision in the County Management Bill?</P>

      <P>I admit that the notice was short in connection with the introduction of the Bill.  When considering whether we should bring in this Bill or not, we were influenced by the fact that another tribunal would have to be set up before 15th July. That is the only urgency about the matter and that is the reason it is being rushed now, because of the Dáil being likely to adjourn.  The Act of 1930 provided that a tribunal would be set up within five years and another some five years after that again.  In any event, ten years have now expired and it would seem ridiculous at this time to be setting up a tribunal to go over the same ground.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might read for the House what the Local Government (Dublin) Tribunal reported with regard to the Howth Urban District:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is evident that the present administration of the existing Howth Urban District is uneconomic and is <Col N="1821" /> incapable of being made economic. If the area which the urban district council seek to have added to the urban district, in order to constitute a northern coastal borough, were given to them, the area, as a whole, would still remain uneconomic. Services which have yet to be provided in the area applied for would prove exceedingly costly to any small authority undertaking them. It was stated on behalf of the Howth Urban District Council that the added area by itself would not be able to provide for such developments. We are disposed to concur with the view of the chairman of the Howth Ratepayers' Association, that the development of Howth and the adjoining areas is likely to prove a good long-term investment, having regard to the great increase in valuation which may be expected.  The authority undertaking the investment would, however, have to be possessed of funds sufficient to enable it to wait for the revenue return which it would eventually obtain from the development of these districts.  The Howth Urban District Council, or any local authority specially constituted to administer the Howth Urban District and their proposed added area, would not be able to do this.  Now that the city corporation wish to retain the Raheny-Kilbarrack area they must undertake the drainage of the area.  The witnesses of the authorities concerned agreed that the best scheme would consist of an intercepting sewer towards Sutton joining a proposed sewer from Portmarnock to Sutton.  The city corporation would, therefore, be associated with the preparation of any sewerage scheme for the Portmarnock-Baldoyle-Sutton-Raheny area, even if no further additions to the city area were made in this direction. We think it is well established that the whole of the area referred to is in need of urban control and development. It is also clear that that development ought to involve a considerable degree of city control of the seaside places in this area, which are resorts of the city populace.  A great portion of the district should be preserved as an open space in the <Col N="1822" /> metropolitan interest.  There are thus strong reasons for recommending that the whole of the area should be brought under Dublin municipal control.</P>
    <P>At present the Howth Urban Council get practically all their water from the city and, as has been indicated in the tribunal's report, there is an interlocking in the sewerage system and a scheme cannot be carried out there without an arrangement between the corporation and the Howth Urban Council.  As I also pointed out, this place is being utilised by the city people, who go out there in large numbers.  It is away from the city and you cannot expect a small local authority like that, with a total valuation of £26,000, and a population of 4,800, to carry out the improvements or create all those amenities that tend towards the advancement of a township of that sort.  The city boundary at present goes as far as Kilbarrack.  As regards the liability that Deputy T. Kelly is so much concerned about, I do not think there is much in that.  The Howth Urban Council have had from time to time a struggle to carry on, but I think they have done it pretty well.  They had to cut their cloth according to their measure.  With the financial resources at their disposal, they have been unable to carry out schemes that would go a long way towards improving that district.  Despite that, the council there seems to have carried on well.  They carried on as best they could with their limited financial resources.  I do not think the Deputy need worry about any big liabilities being handed over to the corporation. As a matter of fact, there is not much difference in the rates of the Howth Urban Council and of the Dublin Corporation.  Therefore, I do not think the Deputy need be very much concerned about that aspect of the matter.  If the people of Dublin want to get full advantage from a place like Howth, I think it is only fair to bring it in under the corporation.  The corporation will be in a position to carry out improvements there.  It can invest money there.  As was mentioned in the report of the tribunal, it may be <Col N="1823" /> a long-term investment, but I believe the investment will be one that will repay the corporation in time to come. I want, again, to tell Deputy Benson the only reason why we are bringing in this Bill at the present time is that if we failed to do so we would have to set up another tribunal before the 15th July.  That is the only urgency about this.  Otherwise, I would be quite prepared to leave the Committee Stage over to a later date.  I think it would be ridiculous to set up another tribunal at the present time.</P>

      <P>On the section, there appears to me to be a certain amount of conflict between sub-section (2) and paragraph (d) of sub-section (3). Sub-section (2) says that the under-sheriff will continue to hold office until he ceases either by death or otherwise to hold the office, or until the appointed <Col N="1825" /> day, whichever is the later.  If he lives over the appointed day, he continues to be under-sheriff for the county until he dies or ceases to be in office.  Paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) refers to the jurors books which, I take it, will likely fall in before the under-sheriff dies.  I do not know who he is, so that I can be quite impersonal on the matter.  That paragraph says that so long as there is an under-sheriff for the city he shall be the empanelling officer for the area as extended by this measure.  It appears to me, therefore, that you are going to have two under-sheriffs acting for the same area, one under sub-section (2), the county under-sheriff; and the second, under paragraph (d) of sub-section (3), where the city under-sheriff becomes effective.</P>

Therefore, I think that the city under-sheriff will become effective under that sub-section.  It appears to me that taking the two sub-sections together you will have two under-sheriffs functioning for the one area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill which <Col N="1828" /> will confer on sanitary authorities more effective powers and a simpler and more expeditious procedure for the acquisition of derelict sites which are unsightly and detrimental to the amenities of towns and villages.  The existence of such sites, which are frequently mere rubbish dumps, in many towns not merely detracts from the appearance and amenities of the towns, but frequently constitutes in addition a danger to public safety and public health.  The clearance of them will effect an improvement in these respects and will in addition afford employment for unskilled labour.</P>
      <P>The statutory powers of local bodies in this respect are at present restricted in urban areas to structures which are not only in a ruinous state but also dangerous to the public.  There is a somewhat similar provision in the Public Health Acts which could be made applicable to non-municipal towns, but as in urban areas there would have to be an element of danger arising to the public from the condition of an existing structure before the local authority could act.  These powers are, therefore, of little use in connection with any measures directed to the improvement of towns by the removal of unsightly structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 lay down the procedure to be followed by a local sanitary authority in acquiring derelict sites in their sanitary districts. Under Section 3 (2) the owner or occupier of the site is given the option of improving the site in the first instance.  If within 28 days after a preliminary order is made he himself undertakes the work necessary to cause the site to cease to be derelict, acquisition by the local authority will not follow.  Under Section 4 the owner will also have a right of appeal to the District Court against the proposal of the local authority to acquire his land as a derelict site.  The justice may adjourn the application for a period to enable the applicant to do the work necessary to prevent the site from continuing to be derelict.  The period set out in the Bill as circulated for an adjournment is six months.  This period is, I consider, excessive and I propose to move an amendment on the Committee <Col N="1829" /> Stage reducing it to two months. Failing action by the owner under Section 3 (2) and if no appeal is made or if such appeal is rejected by the district justice in whole or in part, the land will be vested in the local authority.  Section 7 provides that compensation, to be assessed by arbitration, will be payable to any person having an estate or interest in the land so vested.</P>
    <P>When the site has been vested in the local authority that body are required by Section 8 to clear, level, drain, fence or otherwise improve the site so that it may no longer constitute an injury to health or to the amenities of the neighbourhood.  The sanitary authority may use the lands for any of the purposes on which statutory powers are conferred on them, or, if they do not require it for these purposes, they may sell or let it, with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>For some years past I have been endeavouring under other Bills, particularly under the Town Planning Bill, to bring in amendments on the lines with which this Bill is supposed to deal.  This Bill is in the right direction but, to my mind, there are certain matters not covered in it.  I am surprised to find this Bill brought in at this particular time and I am still wondering why it was brought in.  The Minister says that it aims to assist in providing employment.  That is not anything like a satisfactory reason because the amount of employment which will be provided will be very small.  At the present time the kind of employment needed is productive employment, and employment of a productive nature can be found.  My view always was that the local authorities should have the right to get derelict sites cleared away.  I never felt that it would be the ambition of the local authorities to clear those sites.  It is not acquisition the local authorities want and I do not see what advantage it is to them to have a lot of little scraps and bits of sites thrown on their hands.  My view always was that the local authorities should have the right to serve notice to clear away these sites at the expense of the <Col N="1830" /> owners.  In certain cases it might be necessary to have powers of acquisition. To my mind, the Bill is one that will lend itself to a good deal of amendment, and there are many things that are necessary in this respect not covered at all by the Bill.  There are very few villages from 100 to 200 inhabitants all through the country in which there is not some kind of old dump or heap which is unsightly. These old dumps should have been removed years ago.  There was no authority to remove them.  I am afraid the Bill does not give authority to do so now.  To my own knowledge, there are laneways, and what might be termed bits of ends of squares and derelict parks, if I might so term them, in some small villages in the country that do not seem to have an owner at the moment and very great difficulty would be found by the local authorities in finding the owner.  I know what has happened in most of those villages. The landlord who originally owned the village sold the houses and the property to the tenants.  Nothing, however, was done about these public dead-ends that were lying around and now they are used for dumping.  The county council does not own them: none of the local authorities owns them: there is no owner for them at the moment.  We want to get the right to clear all these places up, and I do not think we have it in this Bill.  We only got this Bill this morning and the Minister, apparently, is looking for all stages of the Bill now.  I think that is very unreasonable.  I do not think the Bill is necessary at the moment.  I do not think it is nearly so necessary as it was even last year or the year before. My view of these dumps and rubbish heaps is that we want to clear them up more for the sake of making the country attractive for tourists than for anything else.  At the present time I do not think that counts very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another matter.  One section in the Bill makes provision for compensation.  Another section sets out a period of two years after which a place may be declared derelict if there is no building on it.  We are passing through a period of strain at present and we do not know what is in store <Col N="1831" /> for us.  We do know that in other countries whole districts have been devastated and houses blown down.  These places may remain derelict for years. In this country we have not made any provision for compensation in the case of air raids or anything like that.  If they occurred here we might reasonably visualise houses being blown down and not being rebuilt for years.  We have not any way of meeting that situation. Therefore, I think this Bill is one which requires a good deal of consideration and leaves itself open to a good deal of amendment.  The Minister would be very ill-advised in rushing it through at the present time.  It is a necessary Bill; it is a long time overdue; but it would be much more useful at any other time than the present.  If the Minister would give the House time to consider it until, say next August it would probably meet the situation. Personally, I do not think this is a good time to bring it in, and I have very serious objection to giving the Minister all the stages of the Bill now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that this Bill is a good one.  I hope it will add to the very limited powers which the Dublin Corporation have at present in dealing with these derelict sites.  It is really a scandal that the metropolitan City of Dublin should be inflicted with such eyesores as we see on all sides and that we cannot have them dealt with. I wonder if the Minister in this Bill has dealt with difficulties which have arisen in connection with the administration of the powers that the Dublin Corporation already have regarding derelict sites.  There is a site in Grafton Street, one of our best streets, which has been lying derelict for 40 years.  All the owner has done is to put a paling around it.  It is now being used as an advertisement hoarding and has been so used for many years since it ceased to be the Grafton Theatre of Varieties.  It is private property. There does not seem to be any law in existence to compel the owner to build on it.  I do not know whether the powers given under the Town Planning Act can deal with such a site as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another difficulty.  At <Col N="1832" /> the far end of one of the finest streets in Dublin, opposite Parnell Street, there is a site which has been lying derelict for at least seven years.  The structure is held up by props and there is a paling around it.  It appears that it is the subject of a law action, probably in Chancery.  The Minister, being a lawyer, knows how long Chancery suits go on for; I suppose they go on for years.  Is that property to remain there as a terrible eyesore until that Chancery suit is decided?</P>
    <P>A third difficulty has arisen to my own knowledge in connection with sites occupied by what are called squatters. I know a site in a very good class street in Dublin, portion of which was taken by a man who put a tin construction around it.  I brought that site under the notice of the Dublin Corporation, but the corporation had absolutely no power to interfere.  The owner whitewashes this tin construction now and again, and as long as he does that he is within the law.  There are derelict sites in other portions of the city also.  I should like to know if the Minister has given power in this Bill to deal with such cases.  For instance, would power be given to the corporation to deal with the case which is the subject of a law case? Are the owners of such sites to be allowed simply to enclose these places and leave them there until they get the price which they want for them? I hope this Bill will allow the corporation to deal with these cases, as we are all anxious to get rid of these eyesores.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be general agreement on the necessity for the Bill.  I think the House is agreed with regard to the Bill itself, but Deputies on all sides of the House, so far as I can gather from Deputies Brennan and Kelly, want to improve the Bill.  I wonder would the Minister agree to the Second Stage being taken to-day and then give Deputies time to send in amendments to the Bill until, say, the Dáil resumes in August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree to that. Deputy Brennan wonders why the Bill is brought in now.  I can quite understand that.  Instructions were given for the preparation of this Bill last <Col N="1833" /> August, but owing to the pressure of other work, it could not be prepared until within the last few days. As a matter of fact, if I had time I would have widened the Bill very much more because, as it stands at present, it does not deal with places through the country where you see derelict houses on lands and that kind of thing.  It would take away from the whole framework of the Bill to bring these in at this stage.  I proposed to bring in a Bill subsequently to deal with them.  In these cases where there are derelict houses, such as we see in various places along a road through the country that are of no advantage to anybody but are an eyesore, what should be done is to serve a notice on the owners to clear them and, if they do not clear them, have them cleared under some employment scheme; but I would not, however, interfere with the land.  There is a difference when you come to deal with towns or villages.  There is nothing to prevent the sanitary authority letting the place back again or giving it back or dealing with it in any way they want.  They can deal with it in any way they want, subject to the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>As to the case that Deputy T. Kelly has in mind in Grafton Street, that is a case that certainly can be dealt with. With regard to the other case, where there is an action in Chancery, there may be some difficulty about the person who is interested in it.  But these things can be got over.  Where the sanitary authority are satisfied, after reasonable inquiries made by them, that they cannot get anyone on whom to serve a notice, they can post a notice on the premises.  If they cannot get somebody who is interested in it they can deal with it in that way.  I think the case that the Deputy has in mind can be dealt with.  However, between now and the Committee Stage, that can be looked into to see how it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been accidents caused by these dangerous buildings.  I saw in a Westmeath paper the other day where fatalities had occurred in some parts of the country owing to dangerous buildings.  As the law stood, you had no power to remove any of these <Col N="1834" /> derelict buildings unless you could prove they were dangerous.  Even the acquisition of these sites for the housing of the working classes would be a very tedious process.  You have to make an offer first and then if you take the sites compulsorily, hold an inquiry. In that way the work would never be done.  It is intended to deal with derelict sites which are eyesores throughout the country.  They are of no advantage to those on whose premises they are standing.  They are in a neglected condition and the local authorities are unable to have them cleared away.  I have no objection at all to improving the Bill by leaving the Committee Stage over until August.</P>

Possibly he has in mind what I have in mind in regard to this Bill, and that the amendments I want to bring in now may deal with things that he will put into the other Bill.  It shows the disadvantage of trying to do business in a piecemeal fashion.</P>

      <P>We may be able to do something with this Bill which will avoid having a second Bill.  I had an idea that the position in country places was worse.  It is certainly bad in some towns and villages.  I imagine that dilapidated buildings would be of no advantage of anybody.  My idea would be to give persons concerned with old houses notice to remove them, and if they did not do so, to put in the Board of Works, or let the Board of Works deal with them under the unemployment schemes, on the grounds that they are derelict sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to restrict the upward variation of the cost-of-living bonus beyond what the index figure at present in operation would allow. This restriction will apply to bonus on pensions as well as bonus on salaries or wages.</P>
      <P>When the Government decided to restrict the bonus in the case of civil servants it became necessary to consider the position of officers and servants of local authorities, who received bonus on their pay calculated by reference to the cost-of-living index figure. Local authorities did not adopt the Civil Service scheme generally, but in most areas there are officers who receive bonus on the sliding scale system. The Bill will affect only officers, servants and pensioners who have such bonus.  It will not affect those who are on fixed salaries or pensions.</P>
      <P>There is a danger to our national economy if increases in prices were to be met by increase in salaries, wages and profits.  National and local expenditure to meet the present emergency will throw a burden on every class of the community and we must take all possible steps to avoid any tendency to increased expenditure on salaries and wages to particular classes which would have to be met at the expenses of other sections of the community.  I understand that there is a very limited number in Dublin only affected, and that practically no other part of the country is concerned as there is a sliding scale applicable to the officials of local authorities.</P>

      <P>In these difficult times it is, I suppose, part of the common lot to suffer all sorts of restrictions and interferences with liberties and rights.  However, it did strike me as peculiar that one party to a bargain should regulate how the other party should conform to it.  It does seem to be a new method of doing justice&mdash;to pass an Act to regulate something which had a certain interpretation and which will henceforth have a different interpretation.  Can the Minister say if there is any likelihood of litigation in connection with this matter?  I did not know that the Order affecting civil servants had come into existence.  On a previous occasion, when legislative action was taken, the results were very unsatisfactory.  My recollection is that the State saved, approximately, £50,000 and that the cost in gratuities was £49,000 and in pensions about £25,000.  If we are to be faced with anything like that in this case, it is an unreal economy.  If it were thought desirable to deal with particular individuals, it could have been done by means of the Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very big deduction given in respect of persons in receipt of salary or other earned income.  It amounts to one-fifth, whereas it was formerly one-tenth.  The Finance Act could have been framed to effect a reduction of that allowance in the case of persons paid by way of salary and cost-of-living bonus and who were also entitled to a pension.  Perhaps between now and the next stages of this Bill the Minister would tell us whether the <Col N="1838" /> action we are taking is open to litigation and whether the advice he has got is sufficient to assure us that our legislation will not be declared inoperative.</P>

I am not concerned with the action taken by the Minister for Finance.  That is a matter for himself.  I have brought this Bill in merely to keep the position of the officials concerned in line with that of the civil servants.  The Minister for Finance gave an indication in November, when introducing his Supplementary Budget, and more recently when introducing the Budget of this year, of his intention to deal with the spiral which would be caused by increases in salaries and wages.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made no attempt to justify to the House his reason for introducing this Bill at this stage.  It is described as the Local <Col N="1840" /> Authorities (Cost of Living) Bill.  Local authorities have agreements with their various employees under which wages and salaries are regulated in accordance with the cost-of-living sliding scale.  Under the operation of that sliding scale, the wages and salaries of the officers increases as the cost-of-living index figure rises, and they are reduced if the cost-of-living index figure falls. The local authorities have not made any representations to the Government that they want to dishonour the agreements into which they freely entered with their employees, and, although the local authorities are willing to honour and respect the agreements to which they set their signatures, the Minister now refuses to allow those agreements to operate, and, instead, he compels the local authorities to enforce what, in fact, will be cuts in wages and salaries. I am particularly concerned with regard to the effect of this on the wages and salaries of the lower-paid people, especially as there is no request for any such action from the local authorities.  I wonder can the Minister justify to the House, or even to his own conscience, why he should force a local authority to abrogate an agreement which that local authority desires to preserve?  On what ground can he justify his insistence on local authorities breaking their agreements when, in fact, they desire to preserve them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement under which the wages and the salaries of the local officers are calculated has not been an unmixed blessing to them.  When the cost-of-living sliding scale arrangement was applied to their pre-war basic scales, it provided that there should be revision upwards or downwards according to the movement of the cost-of-living index figure.  While the employees of local authorities got certain increases when the cost of living was rising, the fact is that the tendency has been constantly downwards for many years past, and these employees have suffered a very substantial reduction in wages and salaries, a reduction that went hand in hand with the fall in the cost-of-living index figure.  Now, because of an emergency situation, and the inability of the Government to control prices, the local authorities find the cost-of-living index figure moving <Col N="1841" /> skywards, and, after bearing all the hardships inseparable from a constantly declining index figure, the employees of local authorities find themselves in a position definitely worse than anything they expected.  The Minister, without any request from the employers, wants to force through a Bill denying the officers concerned any compensation for the substantial increase in prices which has taken place since last September.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that if there was any serious national problem to be dealt with or any inequalities to be ironed out, the Government would concentrate on the millers and the bacon curers in this country, but instead, the Minister and the Government select for attack the employees of local authorities and they endeavour to compel them to carry on at a fixed rate of pay at a time when wages and salaries are buying less than they formerly bought. On what ground can the Minister pretend that the agreement which has been in operation for the last 20 years, and which has been honoured loyally by the employers and the employees, should now be abrogated without any request from the people affected?  It seems to me to be manifestly unfair that, having borne all the hardships associated with the sliding scale arrangement, these officers should now be prevented from getting any compensation for the rapid increase in prices.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, further, that by taking this action the Government are taking a line which is calculated to set a very bad example to private employers.  Happily, these private employers have shown a much better appreciation of the economic position than the Government.  The Government seem to be determined to set the pace in keeping the wages and salaries of its own servants down.  The members of the Government do not keep their own allowances down, or the allowances to members of this House down, but they seem determined to keep the salaries and wages of their employees down.  Private employers in industries outside have recognised that the increase in prices has been so rapid that, of their own accord, and as a result of the representations of organisations <Col N="1842" /> representing the workers, they have voluntarily agreed to an adjustment of the sliding scale, a thing that the Government seem determined to abolish.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to stabilise the cost-of-living bonus, there is a very simple way of bringing it about.  The proper way to do it is to stabilise prices.  The Government are apparently incapable of stabilising prices. Apparently they intend to permit prices to rise, on the one hand, and the only stabilisation they contemplate is in regard to the cost-of-living index figure in its application to basic wages and salaries.  If the Government have to admit that they cannot or will not control prices, and are satisfied to allow prices to rise, then there is no answer to a demand by the workers that, in respect to those who have agreements under which wages are adjusted in accordance with the sliding scale arrangement, those agreements should be allowed to operate.  Neither is there an answer to the demand by workers that, in this situation, the purchasing power of their wages should not be attacked by attempting to prevent them from securing increases.</P>
    <P>I think this is a most unfair Bill.  It is picking out those particular employees for attack, and is doing that at a time when there is no request from their actual employers that there should be any abrogation of their agreements.  The Government is setting a very bad headline in keeping wages down while prices are rising. Other employers have shown a much greater appreciation of the situation than the Government appears to be capable of doing.  I do not know how much the Central Funds hope to be able to save under this Bill.  I do not imagine they can save anything under it except a very tiny sum, and that only in so far as they are responsible for recoupment of portion of the salaries of officers of local authorities, while the latter are willing to have their agreements with their staffs continued. I cannot see why the Minister should intervene in such an unfair way.  The viciousness behind the whole thing is manifest in the title which is &ldquo;to restrict the upward variation of remuneration and superannuation <Col N="1843" /> allowances payable by local authorities&rdquo;. Presumably, if the index cost-of-living figure falls the Government will come back to look for their pound of flesh.  Their idea appears to be to prevent any increase in salaries when there is an upward tendency in the cost-of-living figure, but should it fall they will come back and say that they are entitled to get a reduction in wages.  I think the Minister should withdraw the Bill.  It is hardly calculated to beget efficiency amongst the employees of local authorities.  It is a disgrace that the Bill should be introduced at a time like this.  It is a particularly unfair Bill for a Government to introduce.  If the Government want to set an example and a headline in the matter of sacrifices, they can find examples nearer home.  The examples ought to be set nearer home rather than by picking out those people for sacrifices of the kind indicated in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Norton has pointed out, this is a most extraordinary Bill.  It is entitled &ldquo;an Act to restrict the upward variation of remuneration and superannuation allowances payable by local authorities which are variable, in whole or in part, by reference to the cost of living&rdquo;. The dice, as Deputy Norton pointed out, is loaded entirely in favour of the employer.  If there should be a reduction in the cost of living, advantage will be taken of that by the Government to reduce immediately the wages of the employees of local authorities. I presume the Minister has in mind that that will enable the local authorities to economise and thereby help the Government to economise.  Compare that with the position of local authorities at the moment who are being called upon to pay a large amount of money weekly to able-bodied men in consequence of the bringing into operation of an Employment Period Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is costing the county that I represent £20 a week at the moment.  I wonder why did the Government place that burden on local authorities in recent weeks, while having at the same time this particular piece of legislation in their mind, which will not bring about economies equal at all to the <Col N="1844" /> amounts that county boards of health are now being called upon to bear.  The Minister, in answer to me, said that this legislation would apply principally to the employees of educational bodies. They are a body of people who have been agitating for a considerable time with a view to having their positions stabilised.  When I use the word &ldquo;stabilise&rdquo; I do not mean it to apply in the same way that the Minister means it to apply under this Bill, because they have been maintaining continuously that their basic wage is not a sufficient wage, and is not in keeping with the responsibility of the positions they occupy.  We find that under this Bill their positions are going to be affected very seriously, and for that reason I am going to vote against this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago we were given to understand that legislation of a controversial nature would not be introduced during the present crisis.  So far as this Party is concerned, this is a highly controversial measure, because, apart altogether from the fact that it will prevent the cost-of-living bonus from being increased over the present figure, it will also, I take it, be used as a deterrent to prevent the employees of local authorities, who consider that they have a miserable wage&mdash; a great number of them are of that opinion&mdash;from seeking an increase in their wages.  I say that because this will be taken as a headline by local authorities.  It will also, to my mind, prevent the Minister from giving his sanction to an increase in wages to any person in the employment of a local authority.  Deputy Norton has pointed out that private employers all over the country have been far more liberal.  We see that to-day a great many of them are giving an increase in wages to their employees because of the increase in the cost of living.  I submit that it is very unfair to introduce this Bill at the present time.</P>
    <P>We are talking about living in the middle of a crisis.  This Bill is going to create a crisis in the homes of a great many people.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not an appropriate time to bring in legislation of this kind. For that reason, as well as for the <Col N="1845" /> other reasons that I have indicated, that it will prevent any employee under a local authority getting an increase in wages and is going to seriously affect the position of employees under educational bodies, I propose to vote against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <P>As I have already indicated, the Bill is very limited in its application.  It will affect principally certain officials of the Dublin Corporation, certain officials of agricultural committees and of vocational committees. Most of the people it applies to are not by any means badly off. Legislation of this kind was indicated by the Minister for Finance when introducing his Supplementary Budget. I think Deputy Norton said that the Minister said nothing about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when introducing his Supplementary Budget on the 8th November, 1939&mdash;column 969&mdash;said :&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is one other matter to which I must refer.  The war has resulted in increases in the prices of many essential commodities and, before it ends, further increases are, unfortunately, probable.  These increases will bear heavily on every class, and there will be a strong temptation to demand corresponding increases in wages, salaries and profits.  If such demands were successful, the effect would be to increase prices still more, and to give occasion for new demands.  In that way an artificial price structure would be built up which would inevitably collapse at the end of the war, if not before, leaving behind widespread unemployment and depression. The Government feels that it has a duty to do everything in its power to avert such a development, and it is determined to set its face against the efforts of any class to obtain compensation for the rise in prices at the expense of the community. Action to the same end is in contemplation with regard to all classes of public servants, and if the war continues for a long time, the Government may be forced to adopt more drastic measures.  I trust that <Col N="1846" /> all classes of the people will realise that the course we have in mind, though it may call for immediate sacrifices, is necessary to avert still graver hardships in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot say any more in favour of this Bill than the Minister for Finance said, except this, that something has to be done to control the spiral.</P>

You must draw the line somewhere.  In addition, I think it would be very unfair on the part of the Minister for Finance to enforce the measure with regard to civil servants and not to enforce a similar law in the case of the servants of public bodies. The latter would be put in a different position.</P>

Are we to have a position, say, where the cost-of-living index figure, which at the moment is 185 on the pre-war basis of 100, may reach 485 and that this Bill will still continue to operate and there is only the figure of 185 to be allowed&mdash;is there to be any provision for review?</P>
