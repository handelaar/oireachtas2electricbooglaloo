      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (1), page 6, to insert three new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be two assistant county managers for the County of Dublin.</P>
      <P>(2)  There shall be three assistant county managers for the County of Cork.</P>
      <P>(3)  There shall be an assistant county manager for the County of Tipperary, North Riding, and an assistant county manager for the County of Tipperary, South Riding, but one and the same person shall be the assistant county manager for each of those counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Second Reading was being <Col N="953" /> discussed there was some discussion as to the number of assistant managers. This sets out what assistant managers there shall be.  There shall be two for Dublin City and County, one for Tipperary, and three for Cork.  That is the only provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention again to the suggestion made earlier in the course of the discussion, that in counties where it is proposed and provided for in this section to appoint assistant managers, the Minister would&mdash;before the final stages of the Bill are reached &mdash;make provision or indicate in some way a preference for the secretaries of the boards of health for those posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has more regard than I have for the secretaries of boards of health, and if I could see some way of giving a preference I would like to do so.  I will consider the matter, but at this stage I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must always be three assistant managers in Cork County, for instance?  The number cannot be diminished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather doubtful whether three is not too much for Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is, as the amendment stands now, the number cannot be diminished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that between now and the Report Stage.  I am not quite satisfied that three is not too many.  I will leave that in such a position that there can be less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the reason given by the Minister for the insertion of the amendment is satisfactory.  The Minister comes to a certain point which was raised about the assistant managers on the Second Reading, and one would imagine that he is fulfilling all the obligations in regard to assistant managers by putting in this amendment.  He has still got the right which he had, and rightly <Col N="954" /> so; and, while he is still retaining the power under Section 9&mdash;the section we are discussing now&mdash;to appoint all the necessary assistant managers, I do not see why he is putting this amendment in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to give an indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister is simply fettering himself unduly.  Had he not put in this amendment, he would have the same powers under the section.  He is tying himself now to three assistant managers in the County Cork and to other people whom he might find later on he would be better off without.  It would be better for him to have more elasticity than he has under the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my amendments are concerned&mdash;49, 53 and 55&mdash; I do not know about 56&mdash;I am quite satisfied that the Minister's amendment meets the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Keyes I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 43, after the word &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; to insert the following words, &ldquo;with the consent of the county council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is that in connection with the appointment of assistant managers there should be some consultation with the county council.  We are not tied to any particular form.  If the Minister could indicate some manner by which county councils would be consulted in the matter it would meet the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, all these appointments, as the Deputy knows, <Col N="955" /> are made by the Local Appointments Commission.  I am afraid I have no option but to follow the usual practice.</P>

      <P>In page 6, to add at the end of the section three new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Whenever and so long as there is in force an order made by the Minister under this section directing that there shall be an assistant county manager or a number of assistant county managers for a particular county, there shall be, for such county, an assistant county manager or a number of assistant county managers, as may be directed by such order or an order amending such order.</P>
      <P>(5)  The assistant county manager or each of the assistant county managers (as the case may be) for a county shall be called and known as Assistant County Manager (with name of the said county prefixed).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 58:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10, page 7, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be two assistant city managers for the County Borough of Dublin each of whom shall be called and known as Dublin Assistant City Manager.</P>
      <P>(2)  The two offices of Dublin Assistant City Manager and the two offices of Dublin Assistant County Manager shall always be held by the same two persons.</P>
      <P>(3)  If, immediately before the commencement of this Act, Timothy O'Mahony holds the office of Dun Laoghaire Borough Manager and Town Clerk, he shall, by virtue of this sub-section, be and he is hereby appointed to be a Dublin Assistant City Manager.</P>
      <P>(4)  In relation to the first appointment to one, but only one, of the offices of Dublin Assistant City Manager (not being the office mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, if the appointment mentioned in that sub-section takes effect) the following provisions, in so far as they are applicable, shall apply and have effect in regard to the selection by the Local Appointments Commissioners of a person to be recommended by them for such appointment, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> (a)  if the county secretary of the County of Dublin is a candidate and suitable, the said commissioners shall recommend such county secretary;</P>
    <P>(b)  in this sub-section the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; means possessing the requisite qualifications for the office of Dublin Assistant City Manager and being, in the opinion of the Local Appointments Commissioners, suitable in all other respects for such appointment, and the expression &ldquo;county secretary&rdquo; does not include a temporary county secretary.</P>
    <P>(5)  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the office of Dublin Assistant City Manager shall be an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), applies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> This is a new section.  It provides that assistant managers for Dublin City will also be assistant managers for the county.</P>

      <P>11. (1)  Every assistant county manager for a county shall be an officer of the council of that county and each of the Dublin Assistant City Managers shall be an officer of the Corporation of Dublin.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every office of assistant county manager shall be an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), applies.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every assistant county manager for a county (other than the County of Dublin) shall be paid by the council of that county such remuneration as the Minister shall from time to time direct, and the moneys required for the payment of such remuneration shall be raised by the said council as a county-at-large charge.</P>
      <P>(4)  Before or as soon as may be after the commencement of this Act, the Minister may appoint a person to hold any office of assistant county manager created by this Act or either office of Dublin Assistant City Manager (not being an office to which an appointment is made by this Act) until a person has been appointed to that office in accordance with the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926).</P>

They are going to be selected by the Appointments Commission.  By whom are they to be appointed? <Col N="961" /> According to a previous section, the fact that a county manager is selected means that he is thereby appointed, but that does not follow in the case of assistant county managers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 63:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 12, page 7, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  As soon as conveniently may be after the commencement of this Act the remuneration payable to the Dublin City Manager by the Corporation of Dublin shall be reconsidered and shall be fixed, as from such commencement, with due regard to the fact that the holder of the office of Dublin City Manager also holds the office of Dublin County Manager.</P>
      <P>(2)  The remuneration of the Dublin Assistant City Managers shall be fixed with due regard to the fact that each holder of the office of Dublin Assistant City Manager also holds the office of Dublin Assistant County Manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  As soon as may be after the close of every local financial year ending after the commencement of this Act, the council of the county <Col N="965" /> of Dublin shall pay to the Corporation of Dublin such portion of the cost of management (as defined in the next following sub-section of this section) in that local financial year as bears to the full amount of such cost of management the same proportion as the aggregate of the amounts of the valuations of rateable property in the county of Dublin in force under the Valuation Acts in the said local financial year bears to the total of the aggregates of the amounts of the valuations of rateable property in the county borough of Dublin and in the county of Dublin respectively in force as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(4)  For the purpose of this section, the expression &ldquo;cost of management&rdquo; means, in relation to any local financial year, the sum arrived at by ascertaining the total of all remuneration (including travelling and other personal expenses, if any) paid by the Corporation of Dublin in respect of that year to the Dublin City Manager and the Dublin Assistant City Managers respectively and deducting from that total all sums paid in pursuance of this section to the Corporation of Dublin in respect of said local financial year by any joint body.</P>
    <P>(5)  The council of the County of Dublin shall pay to the Corporation of Dublin such proportion of all superannuation granted after the commencement of this Act to a Dublin City Manager or a Dublin Assistant City Manager as shall be agreed upon between such council and such corporation or, in default of such agreement, as shall be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(6)  In the fixing, whether by agreement or by the Minister, of the proportion of any superannuation to be paid under the next preceding sub-section of this section by the council of the County of Dublin to the Corporation of Dublin, regard shall be had to the total amounts of the valuations in force under the Valuation Acts of rateable property in the County Borough of Dublin and in the County of Dublin respectively <Col N="966" /> and to the period during which the officer receiving such superannuation performed duties in respect of the County of Dublin.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where the Dublin City Manager is also manager for a joint body the functional area of which is partly within and partly outside the area consisting of the County Borough of Dublin and the County of Dublin such joint body shall pay annually to the Corporation of Dublin such sum as the Minister shall determine.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where the Dublin County Manager is also a manager for a joint body the functional area of which is partly within and partly outside the area consisting of the County Borough of Dublin and the County of Dublin, such joint body shall pay annually to the Corporation of Dublin such sum as the Minister shall determine.</P>
    <P>(9)  The moneys required for making the payments which the council of the County of Dublin is required by this section to make to the Corporation of Dublin shall be raised by the said council as a county-at-large charge and shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any payment which the said council may be required under Section 47 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), to make to the Corporation of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is a machinery amendment.  Its provisions deal with the contribution that should be made by the county to the city corporation.  So far as the county and city are concerned it will have to be on the rateable valuation. With regard to the joint bodies we tried to find some way of getting it, but I am afraid it will have to be left to the Minister to say what would be considered to be the work done by or for the joint bodies and to see what amount should be put against them.  The rateable valuation of Dublin City, I think, is £2,000,000, and on the county it is £600,000.  That proportion would work out, so far as the city and county manager is concerned, at a relationship of about one-fourth <Col N="967" /> so far as the county is concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, page 9, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(9)  Nothing in this section shall operate to prevent a county council or an elective body demanding a <Col N="972" /> sworn inquiry into matters affecting the carrying on of their duties by the staff.</P>
    <P>I think that if one were to take a narrow view of sub-section (1) of Section 13, one could read into it that a council is prohibited from discussing anything in relation to its officers or servants.  If that be so, I would like to know what my position as a member of a county council would be if, for instance, I had personal knowledge that certain officers of the council were not doing their duty, and that I was strongly of the opinion that the manager was not compelling them to do it.  Surely, as a member of the county council I should be entitled to raise that matter.  But, as I read this sub-section, I think that if I attempted I could be prevented from having the matter discussed by the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. There is nothing to prevent a council making any representations it wishes to the Minister, and nothing to prevent it from demanding a sworn inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it seems tightly drawn in relation to officers, &ldquo;control and supervision&rdquo;.  If I were to raise the point that the control and supervision of the manager was not what it ought to be, would I be debarred from doing so by the section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather important amendment.  We have experience of the working of the Act in Cork, and probably I can speak with more experience in that respect than the Minister.  This proposal is practically a repetition of what is in the Cork City Management Act and under that Act the manager has complete control over the staff.  It happened in Cork that high officials in the corporation service felt they had a grievance, and they had no means of bringing it before the corporation except through the manager.  Surely when the complaint <Col N="973" /> is against the manager, it is rather an invidious position for the accused to pass it on to the Minister.  The whole matter requires to be looked into very carefully.  With regard to a sworn inquiry the Corporation of Cork had what they considered to be a very glaring case of inefficiency amongst certain officials.  I am not going to say whether the city manager was included in that or not, but they put up what was a very strong case to the Minister, demanding a sworn inquiry about the acquisition of a site for a fever hospital, and the demand was turned down.  Not only was that the case but repeated demands from the corporation were turned down. The demand of the corporation was unanimous.  If that has been the practice under the Act at present in operation, I do not think the Minister's hopes of an improvement with regard to the operation of this Bill under county council management will be any better.  Where the opinion of a council is flouted that causes dissatisfaction. On the Second Reading I pointed out that there was a good volume of opinion in Cork in favour of this system when it was first brought into operation.  At present, I do not think even one member of the corporation would be in favour of it, because the snags in the working of it have caused dissatisfaction.  I ask the Minister to consider the section very carefully, to see if safeguards could be put in that will ensure the position of the council in some satisfactory manner, rather than leaving the wording as it is.  The Minister said the council could demand an inquiry, but unless that is definitely laid down in the Bill they will have no function. While Deputy Brennan's amendment goes some way to meet the position, the Minister should look more carefully into it.  I am not in any way biased against the system, but I speak from ten years' experience of its working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the corporation in that case demanded a sworn inquiry and whether they got it or not was another matter.  There is nothing to prevent a body of ratepayers, not to mention the corporation, <Col N="974" /> demanding a sworn inquiry on bringing certain facts to the notice of the Department.  Any official can put his case before the Minister without going to the council.</P>

      <P>It appears to Deputy Hurley that the right to a sworn inquiry is there, but what I am afraid of is that the section is so tightly drawn that it will make local authorities feel they have no power.  If that impression got abroad it would be bad.  The right should be left to local authorities to raise these matters at meetings of the council.  I am not satisfied that they can do so under the section.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  (a) If, and whenever, the office of secretary of the county council becomes vacant at any time after the passing of this Act, the county manager shall, if he proceeds to fill the vacancy in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, appoint to the position the person who, immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of secretary to the board of health in the administrative county if such person is available and, in the opinion of the county manager, suitable to fill the position;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if no person is appointed in pursuance of the foregoing paragraph of this sub-section, the county manager shall, if he proceeds to fill the position in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, appoint to the position a person who, immediately before the commencement of this Act, had held the office of secretary to a board of health elsewhere than in the said administrative county if such person is available and, in the opinion <Col N="978" /> of the county manager, suitable to fill the position.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to try to maintain the principle of promotion in the service; that is to say, that after the selection of the first county manager is disposed of, if there is a vacancy for the secretaryship of the county council, the secretary of the board of health should be promoted to the position.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable in that.  I think it will be agreed that there are many secretaries of boards of health who would be eligible for the position as they are very capable men, and I suggest to the Minister that he should accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could accept the amendment.  You cannot restrict the manager in the selection of his staff.  Naturally, the secretary of the board of health will be considered by him.  Secretaries of boards of health will not suffer anything if they are not selected as secretaries of county councils.  They will lose nothing by the boards of health being amalgamated with the county councils.  In some counties you have an assistant secretary&mdash;I think in Kerry and some other counties.  While secretaries of boards of health will be considered for this position in view of the volume of work that devolves upon them, you cannot put in a restrictive clause like this.</P>

    <P>(4)  Every county manager shall keep, in respect of the council of his county, a register in which shall be entered a copy of every order made by him under this section for such council, and such county manager shall, at every meeting of such council, produce for the inspection of the members of such council so much of such register as contains any such orders so made since the next previous meeting of such council.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 73:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 15, page 9, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Save as is otherwise provided by the next following sub-section of this section, any power vested, by virtue of an enactment in force at the passing of this Act, in the council of a county or in an elective body to appoint at their discretion a committee for a purpose connected with their powers, functions, or duties may, after the commencement of this Act, be exercised by such council or elective body (as the case may be) by resolution.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any power vested, by virtue of an enactment in force at the passing of this Act, in the council of a county or in an elective body to delegate to a committee appointed by such council or elective body any power, function, or duty which is an executive function of such council or elective body (as the case may be) shall, after the commencement of this Act, be exercisable only by the county manager for the county of such council or by the manager for such elective body (as the case may be) but subject in every case to the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>This enables councils to appoint committees except, of course, a committee for rating purposes.  They cannot delegate executive powers to these committees.  They are reserved to the manager, except that the manager can delegate executive powers with the consent of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, very difficult. There is need for some provision.  Take the Seeds and Fertilisers Bill as an example.  Be the amount small or large&mdash;it does not matter&mdash;certain people in the country are of necessity applying to the county council for assistance.  Deputies Belton and Corish wish to leave that completely in the hands of the manager.  I want, at least, if there is a manager, that there should be a sub-committee to go into the merits of the applications from various people; they could do that better than the manager.  It seems to <Col N="987" /> me that this is a democratic safeguard, but Deputies Corish and Belton will not have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were supporting the County Management Bill I would say that, if there is to be a manager, let him be a manager.  Any little dodge that is tried in this way counts for nothing.  He has the sole authority for the spending of money, and he must take the responsibility.  Anything that passes out under the Seeds and Fertilisers Act he must take responsibility for.  It is he that will lend the money, not the committee.  He will be responsible for the repayment of that money, not the committee.  What is the committee to do?  No committee of grown-ups is going to take a thing seriously if they have no responsibility. I have worked under three or four managers and I use the word &ldquo;under&rdquo; advisedly because the committee are working under them, not with them.  Everyone of them, as a human being, likes to run as smoothly as possible with the councils and they will let them set up little committees as toys for the &ldquo;children&rdquo; to play with.  If you are giving power to him, give him the responsibility.  Let him do the work and earn his money.</P>

      <P>I have considerable difficulty in understanding this amendment, <Col N="988" /> and I am possibly not alone in that.  As I understood the Minister's introductory remarks he said that the idea of this amendment is to allow that committees may be set up as heretofore and the manager may, with the consent of the Minister, delegate certain powers to these committees.  Is that a correct interpretation of what the Minister said?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say where it says that because as I read sub-section (2) of the amendment it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any power vested, by virtue of an enactment in force at the passing of this Act, in the council of a county or in an elective body to delegate to a committee appointed by such council or elective body any power, function, or duty which is an executive function of such council or elective body (as the case may be) shall, after the commencement of this Act, be exercisable only by the county manager for the county of such council or by the manager for such elective body (as the case may be) but subject in every case to the consent of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 74a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (3) to add the words &ldquo;and shall provide for members of the council copies of such orders as members shall require&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 74b reads:</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (4) to add the words &ldquo;and shall provide for members of the council copies of such orders as members shall require&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section (4) every county manager shall keep, in respect of the council of his county, a register in which shall be entered a copy of every order made by him for such council, and such county manager shall, at every meeting of such council, produce for the inspection of the members of such council so much of such register as contains any such orders so made since the next previous meeting of such council.  I am proposing in the amendment that he shall provide for members of the council copies of such orders as members shall require.  If we are to keep councils at all conversant with the work which they are doing and which the manager is doing they ought to be provided with copies of the orders.  I do not at all agree that it is enough that there is a register at the meeting, possibly under the manager's elbow or the chairman's elbow that members of a county council <Col N="990" /> have a right to look at.  I do not think that that is enough at all.  There may be ten, 30 or 40 members.  They ought each to have a copy of the orders made by the manager since the previous meeting of the county council. Unless that is done the members of the county council are no better informed than the public.  They have a right to look at the register, but I insist that they have a right to get a copy of the orders made.  Previously the orders were made by themselves and they got a copy of the minutes.  They ought to be entitled to discuss the work which the manager has done since the previous meeting of the county council. They cannot do that unless they have a copy of the orders.  I do not see any other way in which we can meet what I feel is the rightful demand of the members of the county council for information.  For that reason I am moving these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is unnecessary because they will be produced for their inspection at the meetings, but, in addition to that, under Section 19, the manager must afford all information that is required by members.  No difficulty has been experienced in practice in the city councils where that is in operation.  I imagine, if the council make an order that they must be furnished with this information, that they consider it necessary information, the manager must give it to them.  Under Section 19 he must afford all information the council requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he stands upon this section, he could say: &ldquo;I am furnishing all the information you require. It is there in that book.&rdquo;  I do not see how that is got over as the section stands.  I think the members are entitled to more than that.  There may be monthly meetings or quarterly meetings and the members are not informed as to what has taken place. They may want to criticise some of the work the manager has done.  They are entitled to do that, according to the Minister a while ago.  He says they are.  If they are they ought to know what he has done or has not done. Consequently, I do maintain that it is <Col N="991" /> essential to have the members informed and the only way of doing that is to place in their hands at the meeting or previous to the meeting a list of the relevant orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister can accept that amendment as a reasonable one because, in practice, it is done.  It is done in the Cork Corporation in a fashion.  The old committees of the corporation still exist&mdash;law and finance, public works, public health and so on.  The manager is, of course, the committee and makes certain orders. Then, at what we call the general purposes meeting, one of these documents is passed along giving what has been done by each of these committees and the corporation discusses that at their meeting.  It might be as well to put that amendment into the Bill so as to ensure that it will be done under the new Act.  Of course, the manager told us on one occasion that he need not do that, that they could come along and look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to suggest that Deputy Brennan's point would be met on the lines of Deputy Hurley's remarks.  The practice in the Dublin Corporation is that the city manager presents to every council meeting a report of the most important items which he has dealt with during the previous month.  I do not know whether he is required to do that by law.  I am not sufficiently well acquainted with the Act, but he does in fact do that.  He submits to every monthly meeting a report of what has taken place during the previous month. If there is no such requirement here then I think a requirement might be incorporated in the Bill to the effect that a summarised statement would be given of the business he had transacted during the previous month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the Minister himself should bring in an amendment to cover this point. It would ease the minds of a great many members who are against the principle of the city manager system.  It would be a deplorable thing if a city manager were appointed who thought that under the Bill he had certain powers, who started to ignore the members of his council and to refuse to give them any information because there is nothing in the Act to compel him at the moment to give them that information.  May I say here that, while I have voted against many sections of the Bill, we in Dublin have been very fortunate in our experience of the city manager system.  We have had three managers since the original Bill was passed and these three managers always consulted the people's representatives on the council, accepted advice from them very often and, I should say, as often gave them advice.  I understand, however, that at least one area has had an experience where the manager refused to give information.  He felt that he was the principal man, that the members counted for nothing and he ruled accordingly.  If you want to inspire confidence in those who will be controlled under the county managership system, you must create the feeling <Col N="993" /> amongst the people that if their representatives want information from the manager, he will not have power to refuse them that information. I suggest that it would be a deplorable thing if you had the misfortune to appoint a county manager anywhere in Ireland who took to himself the full powers under the Bill and was not broad-minded enough to consult the members of the council.  They must work in harmony and I suggest that the same system that prevails in Dublin City should apply elsewhere. I do not want any misunderstanding, or that anybody should take it that I am against the city manager system. Dublin City as I say has been most fortunate in the operation of that system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 77 is to delete sub-section (7).  In sub-sections (6) and (7) of this section, I understand an attempt is being made to put the manager in a position in which to my mind he should not be put.  It is an effort to give him immunity from compliance with certain orders and regulations with which secretaries of county councils and other officials in ordinary circumstances have to comply.  If the minutes of a county council are brought into court, the secretary must be brought in to prove that they are the minutes or to prove his own signature.  I had an experience where a secretary was brought in in a case like that and it was very necessary that he should have been brought in because there were relevant questions put to him in the witness box which were absolutely essential in the case. The same thing could arise here.  If we are going to pass these two sub-sections, the manager will be in the position that his signature will be received in evidence and should it be an order that is in question, it &ldquo;shall until the contrary is proved be deemed to be an order duly made and signed by such county manager.&rdquo;  I think that that is something that should not be granted to any person.  I understand that an auditor or a Minister is entitled to such a privilege, but I am not prepared to grant it to a county manager. I think that a manager should be obliged to go into court and, if he is brought into court, to prove his own signature.  For instance, you might have a situation in which a payment has been made before a particular date in order to make it valid and you would want to get the county manager into court to have him cross-examined on that point.  I feel very strongly in regard to these two amendments.  I put it to the House and to the Minister that they should be accepted and that <Col N="996" /> these two sub-sections should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Similar provisions are contained in every other Act in which you have to deal with executive authorities.  You have a corresponding sub-section in Section 60 of the Local Government Act of 1930.  It is usual to insert such a provision in Acts of this sort.  If you do not, you would have the position that where an undefended civil bill were issued by the county manager, he would have to go into court to prove his signature.  If his signature is disputed, or if the record is disputed, if it is contended that the signature is not his signature or that the record is not a correct record, then he has to go in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to accuse the Minister of deliberately misleading the House, but, until the contrary is proved, the fact that it is disputed is not sufficient at all.</P>

      <P>It might be disputed, and very rightly disputed.  We had a similar situation in regard to the Pigs and Bacon Act recently, when an attempt was made to put the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Board in the position in which the Minister now tries to put the manager, and the House agreed that such a provision should not be inserted.  It is not sufficient to say that it is brought into dispute.</P>

      <P>I strongly support Deputy Brennan.  I think it is a wellknown fact that action of this character has brought strong remarks from the judiciary not only in this country, but in other countries.  Judges have always insisted that they will not take any written evidence and that a man must appear.  The Minister said that the signature may be disputed, but why put on the other party the extra expense by reason of a postponement of the case for the attendance of a county manager?  Why could he not be there in the first instance?  As the section reads, it is not a question of <Col N="997" /> doubt with regard to the signature; it must be absolutely proved by the other party that it is not the signature.  The words are very definite.</P>

      <P>No, it is exactly the same thing&mdash;that it would be possibly necessary to bring the chairman of the board, the secretary or whoever is the official, to court and make him be subject to cross-examination.  There are statutory obligations on the Minister with which he has to comply within certain dates.  It may be necessary for certain things to be done within prescribed dates.  How are you going to deal with such a case if there is a feeling, and possibly evidence, that they were not done within certain dates, unless he can be brought there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the matter hardens to the point of a division. surely there is a well defined difference of opinion.  Apparently the Minister sympathises with Deputy Brennan's point where it is necessary that the manager should be produced.  The Minister's fears seem to be that the <Col N="999" /> manager might be brought in to prove his signature in frivolous cases, where matters of rent are involved or where there is nothing to be done except to get judgment.  Between those two points of view, surely something could be drafted to meet the situation. Surely a drafting amendment can be drawn up to provide that where it is genuinely believed that the manager's attendance is necessary, the manager will have to attend to prove his signature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Dockrell says, and while I agree with the Minister that there would be difficulty in rigidly forcing the manager to attend in every trivial case, it is easy to cite cases in which the manager's signature ought not to be accepted.  It is very easy for a Deputy to bring to mind cases in which it would not be right that the mere signature of a man should be accepted. I think that something between the two extremes could be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are any extremes because the rent collectors and the rate collectors have their warrants, which are their authority, and the manager will not be called in at all.  There is no chance of trivial matters been brought up.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 78, on behalf of Deputy Norton:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (2) to add the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that every officer or servant of a local authority who feels aggrieved because of any decision made in regard to him by the county manager under this sub-section may, within the next 21 days, after such decision has been communicated to him, appeal to the chairman of such local authority against such decision and such chairman shall thereupon take such steps as he considers proper to hear and determine such appeal.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to make some provision whereby, when an officer or servant of a local authority has a grievance, that grievance will be dealt with in the manner suggested in the amendment.  As I mentioned on another occasion, the practice under the City Management Act is that the officer or servant has no appeal except to the Minister and that appeal must go through the city manager.  I consider that very unjust.  I also mentioned the case of a senior official employed by the Cork Corporation.  He had a very definite grievance against the city manager and he had no redress except to send that grievance through the city manager, who was the accused on the occasion, to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The suggestion of the Cork Corporation&mdash;and I think they included it in amendments that they sent to the Minister&mdash;was that a committee of the corporation would act as a kind of appeal board under the jurisdiction of the Minister.  In that way the officer or servant would have a safeguard that, if he had a grievance, it would be justly dealt with.  This amendment seeks to put that idea into effect and I think it is reasonable, because otherwise the officer or servant has no redress in regard to any grievance that may exist except through a channel that would be barred on account of the procedure laid down in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The reason I am anxious to press this amendment is that we have had experience of the working of the system as outlined in the Bill and it has not been found satisfactory.  The manager has complete control over the staff.  Every manager may not be an ideal employer.  Managers are apt to have human faults and failings and it may be, and it has happened, that certain officers and servants under his control will have a grievance.  Even though an officer or servant can go direct to the Minister, the procedure laid down is so roundabout, and the machinery is so complicated that it has not been invoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion in the amendment is a simple and a very reasonable one. It will certainly do justice to the persons who feel aggrieved.  The city manager or the county manager, as the case may be, will afterwards have redress to the Minister and the Minister will have to sanction whatever decision is come to.  In other words, the appeal, heard locally, will go in a more detailed manner into the facts of the case and will give more information to the Minister <Col N="1004" /> on which to form a judgment than would be the case under the procedure suggested in the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister, even if the amendment is unacceptable, to consider the principle underlying it as he may formulate some other method of dealing with grievances and complaints locally rather than by taking them to Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this and the following amendments as very important.  This section deals with mental hospitals, and it appears that mental hospital committees as we know them are going to be abolished and there will then be what will be known as a visiting committee.  There is a joint hospital in Ballinasloe for Galway and Roscommon. The committee consists of certain members appointed by the county councils.  According to the Bill these members will continue to be members of the visiting committee. Nobody expects that they are going to continue to act as a visiting committee. There will be no need for their attendance. They would have to come very long distances, over 50 miles, in some cases, to go to the hospitals, and the <Col N="1015" /> only thing they can do there is to consult the patients.  Patients of mental hospitals are lunatics, and the only thing members of the visiting committee would have to do would be to discuss matters with these patients and hear complaints.  They have no authority to discuss matters with the officials and to report back to their councils any complaints they may have to make.  They are debarred from doing that.  Of course they can bring back reports of what the patients said, but they cannot report what sane people might say.  As a result there will not be any attendance by members of the visiting committee, if the section passes in its present form.  The manager will be without any advice or supervision.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I am attempting to have the words &ldquo;visiting committee&rdquo; deleted and to let the present committees remain.  In a further amendment I want to provide that the members of the committee will meet at least quarterly.  At present they receive certain travelling expenses but, as members of the visiting committee, they will not get these expenses.  Consequently they are not going to attend. In any case they would not go to consult lunatics and nobody else.  It is very important, when framing estimates for these hospitals, to see that members of the committee are in attendance and in possession of all the facts in relation to their administration. I am definitely opposed to having managers running hospitals without assistance or advice.  The expenditure on these hospitals is unfortunately very heavy, particularly where they are joint hospitals, and I believe it will be impossible to carry on as now proposed.  Where there is a concentration of population in one county or in a city it might be possible to run such an institution and certain people might attend as a visiting committee, but where there is a joint hospital covering a wide area that will not be the case.  I am not asking the Minister to accept my amendment, but I suggest that some amendment should be brought in to allow committees to function as usual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be said for the views expressed by Deputy Brennan on this matter.  As he indicated, the visiting committee would serve no useful purpose.  The payment of travelling expenses to members is an important question. Apart from the case of joint hospitals, such as Ballinasloe, management committees have hitherto been drawn from wide areas.  I should like to know if the visiting committees under the Bill will be paid their expenses, and if there is a certain period laid down within which they must visit the hospitals. There is much to be said for the maintenance of the present committees. The expenditure amounts to a huge sum and as the estimates are submitted in great detail they take up a good deal of the members' time.  Of course the Minister can say that that is the manager's job now.  According to the Bill, when the general estimates are submitted, it will be the duty of the county councils to examine them. How can they do that with any degree of certainty unless they have access to the accounts and are conversant with the general working of mental hospitals? The expenditure on mental hospitals goes into great detail and the Minister would be well advised to have something akin to the present arrangement for the examination of the estimates.  In recent years the greatest increase in rates has arisen in institutions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is useless to suggest that county councils can examine estimates submitted by a manager in connection with the affairs of a whole county unless they can go into the estimates in the proper way.  There is a good deal to be said for the point of view put forward by Deputy Brennan, and if the Minister cannot give way on the point to-day, I suggest that it is of sufficient importance to be taken into consideration between now and the Report Stage and examined in greater detail.  There seems to be no consideration at all for the ratepayers concerned.  A huge amount of money has to be spent on these hospitals, and there are grievances connected with them that from time to time have to be examined.  Anybody who has been a member of a mental hospital <Col N="1017" /> committee knows that an amount of time is taken up dealing with complaints of patients and officers.  A visiting committee will not be able to go into such matters.  The whole proposal is an absolute farce, and something should be done to enable a proper committee to be set up to examine estimates in detail.  The ratepayers are not fools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether they have or not.  Since I had anything to do with local administration I always thought that it was a great weakness to give any statutory body power to spend without having the obligation of raising the money.  I do not care how representative that body may be, it does not feel that it has the same responsibility unless it is directly concerned with the raising of the money as well as spending it.  When county councils get estimates from boards of health, committees of agriculture, vocational education committees and mental hospitals the position seems to be &ldquo;take them or leave them.&rdquo;  Queries can be raised, but estimates cannot be altered materially.  It is easy for a body that has not the responsibility of raising the money to be free about spending it.  I agree with the amendment, but there might be a better way to deal with the matter. A lot of things arise in connection with mental hospitals.  There are complaints by the patients and by the staff, and it would be well to give the human touch to it by allowing the committee to meet as of old.  The manager would find it of great assistance to him, and I think it would be well worth the Minister's while considering that.  You are not taking away any of the powers of the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the supervision of expenditure and consideration of the estimates, the county council, I take it, <Col N="1018" /> under the Bill will have the power of passing the estimates and raising the money.  For that to be effective, I think they should have power to examine and veto, to a greater extent than they have at present, the estimates of the mental hospital.  After all, the power of the county council over county expenditure at present is very small.  With the exception of road works, I do not think they have any control.  It is the subsidiary bodies, even though they are composed of members of the county council and persons nominated by the county council, who are responsible for the expenditure. The county council have the responsibility of raising the money, but it is in the case of these bodies that the expenditure is soaring.</P>
    <P>I would support the amendment as far as it goes, but I think the Minister should consider something more and give power to the estimates committee of the county council to query seriously the estimates of the subsidiary bodies. I have always thought it a weakness that county councils and borough councils&mdash;and I am speaking for the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council&mdash;when they get an estimate can only take it or leave it. We have representatives there, but I do not think a representative on these bodies feels the same responsibility as he does on the county council to which he is directly elected.  The increase in expenditure is largely due to these bodies over which we have no effective control.  The Minister should consider how better control could be given over those bodies and, at the same time, retain this committee.  He can call it a visiting committee.  We call the committees which deal with Portrane and Grangegorman visiting committees, and we call the joint body the joint committee. These visiting committees should meet and hear complaints, even though they have no more authority than to make a recommendation to the manager.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not take very serious note of the point raised by Deputy Belton, because the take-it-or-leave-it power which he <Col N="1019" /> alleges the county councils only have with regard to the expenditure of the subsidiary bodies is a misrepresentation, perhaps an unwitting misrepresentation, because the members of the subsidiary bodies are practically in every case members of the parent body and for that reason have a very intimate knowledge of and competent control over the expenditure.  Therefore I do not think any further safeguards are necessary.</P>

      <P>My difficulty is that the whole thing seems to be contradictory, because in sub-section (c) of this section it is provided that certain members of the visiting committee may not be members of the county council at all.  We are asked in one case to give power in regard to expenditure to this body, many of whom may not be members of the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Still it leaves you in a very awkward position to determine this amendment at all.  Another thing is that in regard to the functions of the county manager you must remember that the conditions in one county may be different from those in another. For instance, the head office in which the manager will spend most of his time may be 30 or 40 miles away from the mental hospital, and he and his staff may have to travel that distance to hold a meeting there.  That is my difficulty in looking at the matter purely from a business point of view. You cannot have it every way.  As regards the expenditure of the mental hospital committee, I think all their decisions have been subject to the ratification of the parent body.  They had certain wide powers up to a point, but they had to bear in mind the fact that the county council, of which they were members, could exercise a veto any time they chose to do so.</P>

      <P>I think we have got a bit away from the amendment.  The existing committees that consider the estimates for the mental hospitals will no longer function.  I want to deal with <Col N="1020" /> Deputy Brennan's amendment.  He wants to give the committees more power than merely to hear complaints from patients.  The amendment does not go so far as to say that they should have anything to do with bringing forward estimates for the mental hospitals. That will arise on the section later, and to argue the two things now would be confusing the matter.  I think Deputy Brennan made a very fair case for his amendment, and that it would be ridiculous to ask a committee, some of whom may have to travel 50 or 100 miles, to visit a mental hospital without having any other power than to interview patients who, as Deputy Brennan said, are insane, so that probably no useful purpose would be served in interviewing them.  I think the Deputy made a pretty fair case for his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the mental hospital committees are going because the boards of health are going.  In some cases we have a joint body, and the committee will continue in those cases, with, of course, all the executive functions transferred to the manager. When we talk about giving committees more power, we must remember that, except for the executive functions, the powers go back to the county council. Deputy Coburn mentioned that it might be unwise, perhaps, to have representatives who are not members of the county council.  But that is the position to-day.  There are people nominated by the county councils to these bodies who are not members of the county council.  One of the reserved functions of the county council, as provided for in Schedule II, is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>8.  The making under Section 9 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, of regulations in respect of the admission, detention, or discharge of patients to, in, or from a mental hospital or in respect of the conditions as to payment or accommodation under which private patients may be admitted to or detained in a mental hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked for some example as to what sort of committees would have to be set up.  It occurred to me that that would be the sort of committee that should be set up under that Section <Col N="1021" /> 15 and that the council could do that.  So far as powers outside the executive powers are concerned they go back to the county council. Consider what the executive powers are.  There is control of the staff and, in control of the staff, is involved the hearing of complaints and there is the question of the dietary scale and so forth.  These are purely executive functions and must be dealt with by the manager.  Deputy Belton is under some misapprehension about the estimates. Deputy Belton or anybody else serving on a local authority is entitled to ask for particulars of estimates and to examine them in detail. The manager cannot prevent his doing that.  He is entitled to examine the estimates in detail and make inquiries about them.</P>

      <P>We are severely handicapped by not having before us all the necessary machinery.  I said that before when dealing with the Public Assistance Bill.  The Minister has drawn an analogy between the board of health and the mental hospital committee, but in the Public Assistance Bill we made provision for committees of various kinds to assist the manager. What I am endeavouring to do is to try to retain contact between the committee and the manager of the mental hospital.  In the administration of the hospital there is no contact.  If the Minister thinks it would not be of assistance to the manager to have a committee which would sit down with him and help him with his estimate in respect of the hospital, I do not agree. I think that the manager would welcome that assistance.  Under the Bill, you are going to have a complete cut-off from the mental hospitals.  In the county you will have committees of various kinds, and you may have in the immediate vicinity of a mental hospital charitably disposed people who will visit it, but you will not have people who will act as a committee.</P>

      <P>Their functions are to visit, from time to time, and hear any complaints made to them by any inmate of the hospital.  They are to report to the county council any abuses observed or found.  The only contacts they have are with the inmates.  They are to report to the council on any repairs which may appear to be urgently needed.  Is not that a matter that should be reported to the manager of the mental hospital, and should they not discuss it with him?  If there are repairs to be done, it will be the duty of the manager to include them in the estimate, and that is the time he ought <Col N="1023" /> to have the advice of the committee. Unless something is done, you will have a complete cut-off between the council and the mental hospitals.  In my council, when the estimate of the county hospital comes up, we have always a representative on the committee to stand up and explain the estimate to the council.  Now we are to be deprived of that assistance.  The Minister would be well advised to retain the hospital committee for certain purposes which should be set out.</P>

If that representative control is withdrawn, we shall have no power over the estimate, and there will be no link with the mental hospital when the county council or the corporation gets the estimate.
