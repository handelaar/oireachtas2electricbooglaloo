      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Nally.)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mayo County Council have forwarded resolutions to the Commissioners of Public Works requesting that a scheme for the drainage of the Giveston, Pollock, and Yellow rivers be proceeded with; that considerable damage is caused to the farmers in the area because of the flooding of these rivers; and if he will now state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Commissioners to proceed with a scheme for the drainage of the rivers.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy was informed in the Dáil on 4th July, 1939, further consideration of this drainage proposal has been deferred pending the report of the Drainage Commission.  The Commissioners of Public Works did receive from time to time copies of resolutions regarding the project from the Mayo County Council but they have received none since the position was explained to the county council on the 15th February, 1938.  Complaints of flooding in the area have not been made to the Commissioners for a considerable time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is in a position to state (1) the amount of oats imported into this country from (a) Canada, and (b) elsewhere, during the first four months of the present year, (2) the price charged for same delivered at our ports, and (3) the prospects of Irish growers securing a market and an economic price for this year's oats crop.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have observed that as from September, 1939, a summary only of imports and exports has been issued; on grounds of public policy it has been decided not to publish for the present in any form more details than are given in this summary. Accordingly, the information asked for in parts (1) and (2) of the question cannot be given.</P>
      <P>As regards part (3) of the question, the Deputy is no doubt aware that it is the general practice of farmers to use the oats grown on their farms for the feeding of their own live stock.  It is particularly desirable that this practice should be followed this year when imported animal feeding stuffs are likely to be scarce and very expensive. If farmers generally retain their oats for this purpose there should be no difficulty in securing a market and an economic price for such quantities as may have to be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that a very large percentage of farmers cannot possibly utilise the entire oats crop on their own farms for the reason that the land may be suited for oats but not for any other grain crop, with the result that farmers may have a big surplus of oats for the market?  There is grave alarm at present with the regard to the position, owing to the fact that it is believed that a large quantity of oats has been imported during the past few months and will be imported during the next few months and that, as a result, the oats crop may be absolutely unsaleable.  Will the Minister give some assurance that farmers who have oats to sell will get a market for it, particularly in view of the fact that farmers have been compelled to extend the acreage under tillage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few general remarks in relation to the Budget, and to call attention especially <Col N="431" /> to one matter, the difficulty in which people engaged either in agriculture or industry have in getting a statement of settled policy from the Government. As regards agriculture, apparently they are not prepared to take advantage of the present position, due to the fact that some years ago we had 10 per cent. preference in the British market, but then decided to abandon that market.  Before the year is out agriculture may be called upon to make an effort to supply some other market with agricultural produce.  Industry is in the same position.  It is very difficult for people over a long term of years to prepare their plans if they are uncertain as to the position that the Government is taking up.  In answer to a speaker during this debate the Minister said that no housing scheme was held up for want of money.  That may be true in a strictly narrow sense, but the housing business seems to have almost disappeared.  When introducing a previous Housing Bill the Minister stated that what the building industry required was not grants but finance, and having said that he proceeded to do away with the grants. In the Housing Bill that passed through this House recently, neither grants nor finance were provided.  How are people in any industry to carry on if they are uncertain from day to day of the policy of the Government?  In my opinion housing schemes have become somewhat of a charity, inasmuch as those who provide houses for people who can pay for them are more or less chased out of the market.  We have a good many taxes that are increasing the cost of housing, and as an instance of that I want to refer to one tax in this Budget, and to ask the Minister what is the policy of the Government on the question.  I understood that whatever justification there was for putting taxes on materials required for housing, the object was to increase production here.  If it was not to increase production, it was merely to increase revenue, and then we are faced with this position, that we are making the cost of housing dearer when borrowing for housing purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> Reference No. 4 in the Schedule refers to</P>
    <P>&ldquo;tiles which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are made wholly or partly of clay and are glazed.  Whichever of the following rates produces, in respect of each particular article, the greater amount of duty, that is to say:&mdash;75 per cent. or 4½d. the tile.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of that duty is to exclude tiles, and as there is only a duty of 30 per cent. on slab panels, surrounds and various other articles, it stops the assembly of these articles in this country.  There are tiles manufactured here but the range is limited.  They are fulfilling a want, and the industry is progressing, but it is absolutely hopeless to suggest that at the present time tiles of any and every sort and description can be manufactured here. Accordingly, a duty was put upon tiles to discourage imports and a different duty was put on assembled articles made from tiles.  What is the policy underlying Reference No. 4, in which tiles are subject to a duty of 75 per cent., and when assembled either in panels or surrounds they are subject to a much smaller duty?  I suggest to the Minister that that is flying in the face of the previous practice of the Government.  It has always been the policy of the Government, as we understood it, that a smaller duty would be put on raw materials.  Remember, the finished product of one industry is the raw material of another, and the raw material of assembled surrounds and tiled panels is tiles.  I suggest that after this duty has been in operation for a few weeks, the Minister will, probably, come along with another duty, it may be 100 per cent., on surrounds and slab panels.  In my opinion the proposal shows that very little care and forethought were given to some of the items included in this Budget. When he is replying I hope the Minister will deal specifically with this criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make a few remarks on the agricultural side of this question.  I want to draw attention <Col N="433" /> to the neglect of the Government to deal with matters relating to agriculture. The Minister for Finance has said that one consolation the farmer here has is that he is as well off as his prototype in any country in the world. That is poor consolation for the unfortunate farmer here.  Much lip sympathy has been extended to the farmer in recent times by every member of the Government, from the Taoiseach down. There has, however, been no material aid for the farmer.  The Government initiated their increased tillage drive last October.  Knowing that the farmer had been impoverished by the economic war, they did not bring in the Bill to empower the county councils to lend money to farmers for the purchase of seeds and manures until late in March. At that time, it was impossible for the farmer who needed this assistance to take advantage of the scheme.  If the Minister were to go through the country as I do, he would see the result of that in the corn fields.  You cannot increase tillage unless you give the farmer the opportunity to supply the necessary stimulant to his crops.  The county council scheme came too late and the result is that there is not a decent corn crop from Cork to Dublin. It is impossible for the farmer to increase production in those circumstances. As regards superphosphates, restrictions were kept on foreign super until the whole of the home supply was used up.  Only a limited supply had been available&mdash;not the supply which would be necessary for the increased tillage.  The restrictions were removed at a time when the small farmer could not buy because the price was exorbitant. I heard the Minister for Agriculture say, in reply to a question by Deputy Dillon, that foreign superphosphate was coming in here at the same price as the home super had been. Deputy Dillon was looking for a subsidy in respect of the foreign super.  I know that the imported super is being sold at from £1 to 27/6 more than the home super.  These are two matters which the Government has neglected and it is very hard to expect increased production when the farmers get nothing but lip sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to <Col N="434" /> refer is that of feeding stuffs.  How can people pay extra taxation when they have no profit left from their production? The people are going out of pig production because the Government has made no attempt to bring the cost of feeding stuffs to a level at which pig production would pay.  They are at present negotiating with the British Government and they should arrange to have feeding stuffs sold here at the price at which they are sold in Northern Ireland.  That would be an incentive to increase production.  In the country, men who were feeding pigs in a big way have gone out of the business.  The bonnamhs are being left in the hands of the smaller farmers who used to sell to the bigger men. The smaller farmers have not the wherewithal to feed these young pigs. They will either have to drown them or let them live on grass.  If something could be done to obtain feeding stuffs for farmers at a reasonable price, it would relieve the situation and enable farmers to meet their liabilities.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is proving a great drain on the resources of the farmer since he undertook increased production&mdash;which he did very willingly, thinking that he would get some assistance from the Government&mdash;is the cost of machinery, and parts of machinery, necessary for the carrying on of farm work.  The cost of machine parts is a greater drain on the working farmer than the rates and annuities put together.  I do not like to decry Irish manufacture.  I should prefer to encourage it, but the parts we are getting are not at all equal to the imported parts.  Most people are willing to pay a higher price for the imported article, which carries a tariff, than use the parts they get at home.  After an intensive campaign for some years to encourage home industry, it is a very poor compliment to the industrialists that they have not risen to the occasion and given us an article equal to that which we can get from the other side.</P>
    <P>Other matters are also affecting the costs of the farmer.  Take the simple item of boot laces.  The man working on the land gets a pair of boot laces <Col N="435" /> for a penny but he has to get a pair every day.  Whoever is manufacturing boot laces here should be hounded out of the business if they cannot give us laces of better quality.  If rain happens to come at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, while a man is working, he has to get another pair of laces in the afternoon. On a wet day, his laces cost him 2d. while on every other day they cost him a penny.  I have seen a man, too, go out with a pair of new working shoes in the morning and come in with the heel falling off in the evening.  Since we are paying through the nose for these things, the Minister should see that we get articles which are worth the money.  I suppose I cannot now refer to the matter I had down in a question on the Order Paper to-day. I do not know how I am going to refer to it.</P>

      <P>I trust the Minister will make some effort to meet the situation so far as the agricultural community are concerned and in some way help to increase productivity in this country and keep us on our feet. I hope the Government will not be introducing what I might term belated measures which will be of little advantage at the time they are made operative.  I trust they will exercise more foresight and, when they have anything in mind more substantial than mere lip sympathy for the farmers, that they will put it into operation and not leave it over until it is too late to be of any advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that I have observed in regard to the Minister's Budget statement is that it made no attempt to face the facts.  It drew a kind of polite curtain over the budgetary position, on the one hand, and the economic situation that we are going to have in the country for <Col N="436" /> the next year on the other&mdash;the type of situation in which the people will have to meet the bill that the Minister now presents to the House.  Whether it was as a result of the Minister's presentation, or simply failure on the part of people to face facts, we have had a lot of very soft-soapy kind of stuff talked, and written in the Press, about the budgetary situation.</P>
      <P>On the Vote on Account we endeavoured to get clear on certain facts not altogether, perhaps, related to the present situation.  It would be well to get clear on a few more facts in relation to the Budget.  The Minister, in the papers he circulated, indicated what he collected in taxation last year. In his Budget Statement, and in the financial statements he presented, he indicated what was going to be collected during the coming year.  In the greater part of the discussion that has taken place and the comment made outside, I see no appreciation of this fact, namely, that the Minister proposes to take out of the pockets of the people during the current year, under the heading of customs, £566,000 more than he took last year. Under the heading of excise he proposes to take £128,000 more than he collected last year and, under the heading of income-tax, he proposes to take £1,039,000 more than was taken during the year ended last March.  Let us consider what we have already argued here, that the size of the bill presented to the people last year and the year before, and the amount of money collected then, has completely choked off any normal additional growth of the employment in this country that used, in the years prior to 1931, be there, to the extent of providing the equivalent of full-time employment for an additional 11,400 persons a year.  When we consider that the bills that the people have had to pay to the Government last year and the year before completely choked off that increased employment, I want to know what does the Minister think is going to be the effect of taking, in taxation alone, out of the people's pockets, £1,718,000 more under the heading of customs, excise and income-tax than was taken last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> That is one feature of the Minister's statement and the figures presented to the House that calls for explanation. I doubt if there has been sufficient mention of the fact in the House or sufficient appreciation of it outside.  I think that it would have been more helpful if the Minister, when presenting his bill, brought out these facts more clearly and more openly.  If we are going to face the current year with not only the internal difficulties that arise out of the financial policy of the Government, but the difficulties that are going to arise for our productive machine in circumstances that have not their seat here but elsewhere, then I think we are going to walk a bit further into the bog of disillusion, the bog of poverty and the bog of difficulty, and the prospect is one that cannot be lightly faced.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the Vote on Account, we brought out certain facts that have not been challenged.  I am stating this again in order to be realistic in my approach to the present situation.  It is not challenged that between 1926 and 1931 there was an average annual increase of persons in employment, as measured by the National Health Insurance contribution fund of 11,400 persons.  In the year 1931 the total amount collected in rates and taxes was £334,000 less than in 1926.  On the other hand, in the year 1939 £6,308,000 more was paid by the people in rates and taxes than in 1931.  If the increase in annual additional employment from 1931 to 1939 had continued at the pre-1931 rate, there would have been 16,200 additional persons in full-time employment; the 14,992 persons who were employed on part-time relief works would have been in full-time employment, and the whole of the 31,000 persons would have been in employment, not paid out of a Government purse collected from the people's purses, but paid out of employment that would be the natural type of employment, whether in industry or agriculture.</P>
    <P>We start in this year as far as that behind a particular point of scratch, and down on top of that situation there comes the additional blow which has <Col N="438" /> brought about the situation we speak about&mdash;that through customs, excise and income-tax, the principal channels through which the ordinary people pay their taxes, there will be taken from them again £1,718,000.  Half a million of that represents customs, a little over £1,000,000 represents income-tax, and the rest is excise.  That money is going to be taken from the agriculturists, whose position has been painted here, not only by Deputy O'Donovan to-day, but by Deputy Childers and other Deputies the other day.  It is to be taken from an industry that every day is increasingly hampered by the fact that it cannot get, in the ordinary way, the raw material that it is entitled to expect and that it used to get from outside.  The only assistance up to the present given by the Government to that industry is that two Ministers have gone across to discuss with the British Government certain things in connection with agriculture, and to discuss, we hope, the position of our industries.</P>
    <P>If agriculture has been neglected in the way that Deputy O'Donovan referred to, our industrial interests have been neglected in the same way. It is on the carrying on of our industries here that the Minister is depending for even the amount of money he got last year.  There is a most perplexing and disturbing situation, to my mind, shown there, and it makes that situation no less perplexing and disturbing that the Minister has been so generally accepted as a person who presents very mild bills.  There was never a bigger bill presented in this House in a way than the present, and it is presented to people who were never in a worse position to meet it because until last year we never had the position in the country that the ordinary growing employment from agriculture and industry did not add to the gross number of people who were kept in a normal way employed in the country.  That is one of the aspects of the present situation.  The other aspect is that anybody who has been in touch with the City of Dublin for a number of years past must realise the difficulty that young men and young women <Col N="439" /> have of getting employment of any kind in the city.  The coming about of the war situation has intensified that.  Not only has it intensified that position, but it has thrown a number of people who would otherwise be employed, into unemployment.  That is very marked in Dublin and it is no less marked in any urban centre in the country.</P>
    <P>I am wondering where the Minister in presenting this Budget thinks he is to get the money for which he is looking. I am astonished that the Minister did not address himself to the future with regard to industry and agriculture.  No plan has been made to deal with the unemployment problem in general.  I think the year cannot advance very far before it will become absolutely necessary to review that situation and to make some attempt to deal with it.  As far as we can see the only plan the Government have for dealing with it is the continued payment of unemployment assistance.  There is no doubt that the payment of unemployment assistance for a period may be of great social benefit, but the continued payment of unemployment assistance over a large number of years can do nothing but rot the whole mentality and the whole morale of a very large number of people in the country.  We here appreciate that while it may be required for the relief of certain classes of unemployed the more it has to deal directly with employment the weaker and the more unhealthy will become the whole social and economic situation in the country.  Nobody questions that we cannot have a satisfactory and healthy people materially, morally and spiritually in the country unless these people can find normal commercial and agricultural occupations in employment that will keep themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>In modern times the Government is called upon to take money from the pool produced by industry and agriculture and dispense it by way of Government relief or employment through Government agencies.  But we are convinced that if that goes beyond a certain point, it is going to undermine <Col N="440" /> the whole social fabric in the country.  The more money that is taken by way of rates and taxes, the weaker does the industrial or agricultural fabric in the country become. The more money that is taken in this way, the weaker will be the industrial and agricultural fabric in maintaining its normal growth.  We expect that both agriculture and industry should year after year increase the normal amount of employment in the country. But before ever the war situation was reached we had come to the time, as I think the facts presented to the House have shown, when through over-taxation we were injuring the normal development of agriculture and industry.  Without the development of the European situation that has come about we had come to the point where in this matter of taxation we should have to stop and retrench.  It would be a very disastrous thing for us here if the development of the present European situation brought about such an increase of unemployment in the country that the Government would have to take more from normal agricultural and industrial development so that agriculture and industry could not get back their normal strength.  If that happened over a substantial period it would be very bad for the country. Nevertheless there is the situation to-day in our urban districts that must be faced by the Government.  There must be some plan of one kind or another adopted to set to work young people and some of the older people who are to-day without employment and even without the hope of employment. That problem calls for consideration by the Government as to the type of public works they ought to start and whether anything is to be done outside giving unemployment assistance.  That problem also calls for a review by the Government of the industrial situation in the country with a view to informing themselves and the House what additional absorption of persons in industry may be expected during the next year or two.</P>
    <P>I doubt, unless something is done radically to improve the position of a large number of farmers, whether agriculture itself is going to be able <Col N="441" /> to absorb during the next two or three years as many people as were put out of agriculture during the last four or five years.  The agricultural situation has been dealt with in a particular way from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  The farmers have been called upon to improve their methods and to reorganise their industry in a way that would suit modern circumstances best, but the fact is that our agricultural industry here has suffered so badly during the last five or six years that while a large number of farmers have their fields and a certain amount of their machinery they have not the resources to start their machines working.  Criticism has been made here that, while other countries have developed their agricultural production, our farmers have not.  A review has been made of the position from 1926 to 1936.  One may say that the agricultural industry in this country met with its main set-back during the period of the present Government's life.  At about the end of the term of office of the last Government, the position with regard to agriculture in this country, as compared with other countries, was reviewed by a committee specially set up by the League of Nations.  That committee reviewed the position of the agricultural industry throughout the world, and the effects of the depression that followed the last war.  As I have repeatedly pointed out, that committee found that there were only two countries in the whole world that had withstood, in the best possible way, the depression of that time, and these were Ireland and Denmark.  It was found that we had withstood the great blow caused by the depression from 1929 to 1931 by reason of the way that our farmers had carried on their industry, and by reason of the fact that the Government of that time co-operated with our farmers in urging them to develop a better policy of production, especially in the matter of live stock and live-stock products, as well as by giving them free access to outside markets where feeding stuffs were cheap.  That was done at a time when prices for live stock had come down.  But, when we consider the position in the last few years, we find that there has been a <Col N="442" /> definite falling off in what used to be some of our main lines of agricultural production.  Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches who are interested in statistics can find all that out for themselves in our own statistics without going to Rome or elsewhere for the information.  I do not want to criticise Deputies who study the statistics of outside countries.  I think it would be a definite advantage if a greater number of Deputies interested themselves in activity of that kind.  If, however, they desire to do that they should not ignore a certain amount of detail that is available for them at home.</P>
    <P>Take last year, when one may say we were at the end of a 12 month period of preparation by the Government to face a war situation, what do we find with regard to agricultural production. We have had the information from the Government that, before the war ever broke out, they had set up a committee to review the circumstances in this country in the light of the possibility of a European war, and to make the necessary preparations for it.  At the end of that 12 month period of preparation for a war situation, the position was that not only had the acreage under oats fallen by 86,000 acres since 1932, but that the acreage in 1939 was less than the acreage in 1938 by 34,000.  Our production in oats had, therefore, fallen substantially in the year in which we had been making preparations for war.  But the position was worse than that.  As compared with 1931, our acreage under barley, was down by 43,000.  The greater part of that decline had taken place between 1938 and 1939, the year in which we were preparing for war.  Never in our whole history had we a smaller acreage under potatoes than we had last year.  We were down 29,000 acres as compared with 1931.  In a year in which we had been preparing for the possible effects of war, we never in our whole history, as I have said, had a smaller acreage under potatoes, or a smaller acreage under turnips.  The latter had fallen by 40,000 acres as compared with 1931. It is further to be noted that we never had a smaller acreage under cabbage, the decline being from 25,000 acres in <Col N="443" /> 1931 to 14,000 last year.  The decline in 1939 as against 1938&mdash;despite all the talk there has been by the Government about increased tillage&mdash;in respect of corn, root and green crops, was 76,000 acres.  The acreage under first year hay was down by 45,000 acres, and, as I have said, after a year of war preparation our acreage was down under oats, barley, potatoes and cabbage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government and Deputies opposite not to say that the skill of the Irish farmer, his application or his technique, his mental interest in his calling or his material interest in his own well-being, grew less from 1931 to 1939.  I want to put it that nothing affected that situation but the circumstances in which the Irish farmer was placed by the present Government. But, even assuming that the Irish farmer was placed in that situation through circumstances arising out of special Government policy, which the Government considered paramount to everything else in the country, surely that was brought to an end when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was made, and what we are entitled to ask the people on the other side to consider is this: that when the Government knew that they might have to prepare for a war situation, and when their difficulties with regard to the economic war were over, why nothing was done to assist our farmers to improve their position in 1939 as against 1938.  In 1939 our total acreage under corn, root and green crops was 76,000 below what it was in 1938.  In that position, I think our farmers are entitled to ask why, even since the outbreak of the war when they were facing production for the year 1940, no lesson was learned from the unfortunate year 1939, and why something was not done to realise that there were so many farmers in the country who could not carry on.  It is true that there are many farmers doing well at the moment.  That is because they had a certain amount of capital and were in a position to husband their resources.  Because of that they were not caught napping, but think of the many others who were not in that fortunate position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> We have been told, in the course of this debate, that the Government expect that we are going to have 400,000 additional acres of tillage this year.  That is going to mean an expenditure of at least £2,500,000.  The farmers cannot expect any return from that expenditure until the autumn of this year.  I wonder does the Minister for Finance who has presented this bill to the House so lightly, so mildly and gently realised what the effect of that is going to be on the commercial community, on the industrial community or even on the farmers themselves whose capital and revenue losses have been so severe during the last six or seven years, and who are being asked to find this additional £2,500,000 in order to carry the Government's programme through in this current year.  One aspect of that situation is that I do not believe the Minister will get his 400,000 additional acres.  Therefore, the Minister's statement and the way in which it has been covered over seem to disclose to us more problems than if he had put the financial and economic situation a lot more plainly, so that we could know that he and the Government understood the kind of situation we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>I see very little hope that the pressing problem of unemployment in urban districts is going to be tackled.  Taking one of their problems such as that and facing up to it definitely and straightly would help them to see the rest of their problems in a better perspective, and then we might have a more informative discussion.  What is wanted is not talk or even the presentation of facts, but an application to the facts of definite policies and the taking of definite action.  There is no possible chance of our being satisfied that we can help towards the taking of definite action to deal with the situation unless the Government show that they appreciate the facts.  If they could show that they appreciate the facts, then we could come down to a discussion of the matter and of the action that should be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which the Minister read when introducing the <Col N="445" /> Budget, although it contained what I might describe as some welcome disappointments, at the same time was not, to use a hackneyed phrase, very illuminating or informative.  In fact, it might truly be said of it that it concealed more than it revealed, because a superficial examination of the statement in relation to the figures circulated with it would indicate that there was little or no increase in taxation. But there is quite a considerable increase in indirect taxation, and the family budget is just as adversely affected by indirect taxation as by direct taxation.</P>
      <P>One would have expected to hear from the Minister a great deal more about the unemployment situation.  We would have liked to have heard what suggestions or hopes he had for the minimising of that problem.  He is surely aware that in various parts of the City of Dublin to-day the position is almost hopeless.  It is so bad in some of the newly built-up areas that we are informed by the dispensary medical officers that malnutrition is widespread and rapidly increasing. That, of course, is a direct result of unemployment.  Already the ratepayers of the City of Dublin are making a contribution of approximately £3,250,000 in an attempt to mitigate the problem.  In spite of that, and in spite of the fact that taxation in the city, so far as the ratepayers are concerned, has reached saturation point, the Government never seem to lose an opportunity of raking off a little extra. I have in mind just now the attempt which is at present being made to collect from the ratepayers of Dublin a sum of £5,000 to cover the damage done as a result of the explosion in Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from the Minister's statement that it is the intention to stabilise the cost-of-living bonus for the Civil Service.  That, of course, is to assist the Minister to balance his Budget.  But the Minister is overlooking the serious difficulty in which the families of civil servants will be placed by their inability to balance the household budget.  Practically every private employer in this city has increased the <Col N="446" /> wages of his employees.  At the outbreak of the war the Government made an appeal to the employers to keep as many people in employment as they possibly could, and, so far as I know, the response to that appeal was particularly good in Dublin.  But it is not very encouraging to an employer, who is doing his very best, and suffering considerable financial loss, to keep his employees in employment at a fair wage, to see the Government setting such an example by keeping the salaries of civil servants, particularly the lower grades, static, whilst the cost of living is rapidly rising.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is the intention to stabilise the bonus at a certain figure irrespective of the extent to which the cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>It seems to be the custom, in fact it is the practice, when Ministers are speaking outside this House at any public assembly or function, that Partition looms largely on the horizon; but it is only on very rare occasions that we hear a word about it in this House.  Surely we are entitled to hear something from the Minister on this very important question, particularly as it affects the economic situation in the country, because it is held by many people, some of whom are very sanguine supporters of the Government, that it would be disastrous to the economic position of the Twenty-Six Counties if the other Six Counties were now added.  If the considered opinion of the Government is that that is not the case, this House is entitled to have a statement to that effect from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Budget statement of the Minister, coupled with the failure of his colleagues generally to deal effectively with the major problems confronting the people for the past eight years, proves to those who want any proof that the Ministry appears to consist of a pack of muddlers who have no fixed policy for the solution of any important problem. When Deputies on these benches voted the Ministry into office in 1932 they accepted the word of the Minister and his colleagues that they had plans in the pigeon-holes in Mount Street for the solution of the principal problems confronting the people.</P>

I read very carefully, in the only paper that can be quoted as being reliable, and that would give a full and accurate representation, a speech that was made by the Taoiseach during the week-end in the country.  With all respect to the Taoiseach personally, and to his position, I say that some of the speeches that are made at ordinary political gatherings would be far better if made <Col N="448" /> in this House, where they could be explained to the satisfaction of the representatives of the people.  In this speech the Taoiseach issued a grave warning to the people and suggested that our neutrality was in danger. His statement was of such a serious nature that it could only be explained by the Taoiseach himself, and I hope that he may consider it his duty before the conclusion of this debate, to explain it in this House which is the only place where it should be made and explained.</P>

      <P>Speaking during the week-end, the Taoiseach referred to Budgetary requirements.  Am I to understand from the Minister that he <Col N="449" /> is not quite confident that this Budget will provide the revenue required for the different Government Departments? I am prepared to admit that it would be impossible for any Minister for Finance in any country where Parliamentary government still exists, to prophesy in £ s. d. the exact requirements under the present extraordinary circumstances, but the remarks made by the Taoiseach, so soon after his Minister for Finance had introduced the Budget, and before it had actually been passed in final form, go to show that there is a grave doubt in the mind of the Taoiseach as to whether it fits in with the requirements of Government policy for the current year.  The Taoiseach went on to talk about the reactions of the international situation upon our trade relations, and according to the <i>Irish Press</i> said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the last war there was a good deal of individual buying and selling. That day is gone.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Personally, I am very glad it has gone, because it is evident that our principal buyer is only going to buy in large quantities in future.  Therefore, if that buyer is going to get a good seller, he will have to get whatever agricultural produce and live stock he requires in bulk from some central selling organisation, rather than continue as in the past buying from the individual.</P>

      <P>Certainly not.  I want to know if the statement made by the Taoiseach is correct, if the day of individual buying and selling is gone, and if we are to sell to our principal customer in bulk in future?  If so, where is the machinery here for carrying out that policy?  I accept the statement as a correct one, and I hope the Minister for Finance will, in his reply, indicate whether the Government are engaged in the preparation of central selling machinery, which will fit in with the requirements of international trade and the requirements of our principal customer, as was indicated by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> The Taoiseach dealt at length with the internal position, and with the danger that he appears to think confronts the people and the Government arising out of recent events, as well as incidents which no one in this House would attempt to justify.  I have never had the same fears as to the future from the point of view of internal strife&mdash;bearing in mind what the Taoiseach was referring to&mdash;as I have from the situation that is likely to arise as a result of the failure of the Government to control the prices of the necessaries of life.  There is far greater danger to the Government and to the State as a whole from the point of view of the failure of the Government effectively to control the prices of the necessaries of life than from any other source.  The Government, either directly or through boards set up by themselves, are responsible for increasing the prices of the necessaries of life, and particularly in the last year or two, increasing the price of sugar, butter, bacon and milk, and other articles. The Minister for Finance will hardly challenge me when I make that allegation.</P>
    <P>Last year, there was a long discussion in this House arising out of the decision of the sugar manufacturing company, on the direction of the Minister for Supplies, to increase the price of sugar.  The price of butter was increased as a result of an announcement made by the Minister for Agriculture. The price of bacon was increased considerably since this Government came into office and, particularly, during the past two years, by the Bacon Board, established by the Government and for whose activities the Government must accept responsibility.  The price of flour went up considerably and, recently, it was further increased. The year that this Government took office the price of household flour was 1/11 per stone; to-day it is 3/-.  The price of bakers' bread in 1933 was 4½d. per 2-lb. loaf.  In mid-February of this year, the price was 5¾d. and, quite recently, that was increased to 6d.  The price of coal went up from 2/6 to 3/4 in mid-February of this year and, since then, it has been considerably <Col N="451" /> increased.  I admit that the Government are not in as good a position to fix the price of coal as they are to fix the prices of the other commodities which I have mentioned.  The price of milk in 1933 was 6d. per quart; in mid-February it was 7d.  Eggs were 1/6 per dozen in 1933; in mid-February they were 2/8.  Potatoes were 8d. per stone in 1933; in mid-February they were 1/2.  Creamery butter was 1/3 per lb. in 1933; in mid-February it was 1/6 and that price has since been increased to 1/7, by personal direction of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, and it would be amusing if the matter were not so serious, to consider the activities of the Prices Commission in relation to the fixing of the price of milk.  In the City of Kilkenny the price of milk was fixed at a particular period last year at 1/8 per gallon.  Local people, including the Workers' Council, representing the organised workers of the City and County of Kilkenny, protested to the Prices Commission against this excessive price of 1/8 per gallon.  An assurance was given by the Prices Commission that the price would be reviewed this year.  A milk vendors association, consisting of the local dairy people who sell milk in the city, particularly, was formed and, before the 1st May, they announced their willingness to sell milk locally at 1/4 per gallon.  The morning after that announcement was made the Prices Commission sent down a direction to the milk vendors to charge 1/6 per gallon.  I demand the abolition of the body responsible for pushing up and keeping up prices to that extent, particularly the price of a commodity that affects every poor person in the city and county concerned.  That is a terrible example of the activities of the Prices Commission and some explanation should be furnished by the Minister before this debate concludes.</P>

      <P>Before the Taoiseach and his colleagues took up their places in the seats of the mighty, many things were advocated as good from the benches which they then occupied.  The Taoiseach, on every appropriate occasion, advocated the establishment of an economic council.  I think he was quite right in doing so.  I think that, with some of my colleagues, I listened to him outside, before he became head of the Government, speaking in the most enthusiastic terms of the necessity for an economic council.  On the 29th April, 1932, after he had been elected as head of the Government, he said in this House:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When I was speaking from the opposite benches, I was in favour of establishing something like an economic council whose sole task it would be to look after the economic interests of the country and which would not be occupied with the ordinary Departmental duties which a Minister has to perform.  I, immediately on taking office, set about the matter.  I found out very quickly that to attempt to take such steps now would simply mean endless duplication.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce convinced me that, for the present at any rate, the work could be more expeditiously done by himself and the officials of his Department.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> The Taoiseach qualified his change of attitude and change of mind on this matter by saying that, for the present at any rate, he was convinced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, could, by producing that famous plan, solve every problem requiring to be solved and that there was no necessity for this economic council.  Will the Minister for Finance say whether the Taoiseach&mdash;I am sure he can speak for him&mdash;still holds to that view?  I am of opinion, and my colleagues are very strongly of opinion, that there is greater necessity to-day for an economic council than there was at any period in the history of this Parliament.  These things go to show how quickly people can change their minds.</P>
    <P>Apart from the seriousness of the failure of the Government to deal effectively with the price of essential commodities, there is the other and greatest of all problems&mdash;the problem of unemployment.  Will the Minister for Finance suggest that any time given to the solution of that problem under the existing system can be regarded as even partially fruitful?  We have had the famous statement by the Taoiseach in April, 1932, repeated in this House during the past couple of weeks&mdash;that if he could not solve the unemployment problem within the existing system, he would go outside that system to find a solution.  The Minister for Supplies is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> as saying on the 23rd January, 1940:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was necessary to stress the urgency of the problems arising out of unemployment.  If it persisted, their economic system could not survive. If unemployment persisted, it did not deserve to survive.  There were, obviously, major defects in their methods of commercial organisation or their financial system if they were unable to provide an adequate livelihood for every man willing to work.  If, within the limits of the present system, they could not cope with unemployment, then the system must be changed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> That statement was made by the Minister for Supplies when addressing a meeting of his supporters of South Dublin in the Red Bank restaurant on the 24th January, 1940&mdash;eight years after the head of the Government had made a similar statement after he took office in this House.  That is a case of two great minds thinking alike.  It is quite right that they should think alike because they have joint and collective responsibility for the solution of this terrible problem.  How long is this system of ours to be given an opportunity to solve the problem of unemployment?  The number of unemployed has not fallen below the number which obtained when the present Government took office eight years ago. From the returns furnished to members of the Dáil and published in our papers last week, we find that there were 10,000 more citizens receiving public assistance during the month of February than in the corresponding period of 1939.  That shows the direction in which we are travelling, from the point of view of a solution of the problem of unemployment.  Deputy Tom Kelly and the Minister for Finance can tell us, if they wish, to what extent the position in regard to unemployment and destitution has improved during the last eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, ground rents; but the Minister does not want to hear anything about that.  Before 1932 this Government had a plan for the solution of every problem, but, since they came into office, instead of producing and operating the plan, they merely established commissions, which kept talking about the solution of these problems for a very long period.  The Banking Commission was set up in 1934 and we have not yet heard any Minister state what action the Government propose to take arising out of the commission's report.  That report has been in the hands of the Government for the last two years.  They set up a Transport Tribunal as a result of a motion moved in this House on the 7th December, 1938.</P>
      <P>Moving that motion for the establishment of a transport tribunal, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, amongst many remarkable statements, made the following: &ldquo;The Government are satisfied that a major decision on transport policy must now be taken.&rdquo;  In order to take a decision it was necessary, there and then, to set up a Transport Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the subsequent debate I made inquiries as to when the Minister hoped to get the report of the tribunal. I did so because I did not want these gentlemen to go into some parlour in Government Buildings and sit there for three or four years; I wanted the report submitted within a reasonable time.  It was left to the Minister to say what that time was likely to be.  When the motion was moved, the Minister said he expected that the report would be furnished to the Government before <Col N="456" /> the House resumed after the Christmas holidays, on 8th February, 1939.  I was prepared to give them more time than the Minister gave.  The Transport Tribunal reports&mdash;there were two&mdash; were handed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 4th and 11th August, 1939.  The legislation&mdash; which the Minister promised to give effect to, based on the findings of the tribunal, the legislation which it was promised would be brought into operation before the end of last year&mdash;has not yet been introduced.  Not alone that, but Deputies have not been given the privilege or the right to read the reports of that tribunal, which was set up by a motion of this House and the expenses of which were borne by the tax-payers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say I do not.  Would it be out of order for me to ask the Minister for Finance whether the Government have an up-to-date register of and a check upon all the aliens who entered this country during the last two or three years?  I know, and I am sure other Deputies who have their eyes open know, that there has been a considerable influx of aliens into this country during the last two or three years.  It is known, and the Minister for Finance knows it perfectly well, that the greatest danger to the neutrality of countries on the Continent has been the rushing in of aliens from one part of the world or another.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister, or somebody speaking on behalf of the Government, that there has been a constant check upon the movements of aliens who undoubtedly have come into this country during the last two or three years and that their movements are being carefully watched.</P>
      <P>I pointed out in a brief statement after the introduction of the Budget that the Budget might be regarded by people who had plenty of money to pay taxes as a good Budget because they probably expected more taxation. They were quite prepared to smile and pay.  People who are getting good profits out of industrial concerns in the country, people like milk vendors, who are allowed to charge, and who are even encouraged to charge, 1/6 a gallon for milk when they would be satisfied to charge only 1/4, are surely able to pay more in taxation if the Minister thinks it advisable for them to do so.  I do not know how many in this country would have incomes in excess of £20,000 a year.  That is information which only the Minister has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> How many people are favoured in that respect and what increase in revenue it is expected to produce is a matter on which we have no information. The Budget is bad from our point of view because it has reduced the grants provided in previous years, and particularly in last year, for the provision of ordinary work by almost £1,000,000.  It reduces the grants under the social services by £911,000; it reduces the grants under housing by £255,000; it reduces the grants under the Land Commission improvement by £150,000; it reduces the grants for the carrying out of new works by £120,000; employment grants, £100,000; and subsidies for dairy farmers by £105,000. There has been reduction as a result of the Government policy in all these items in this Budget.  That reduction in grants is bound to lead to an increase in the number of unemployed this year as compared with last year. The grants provided for our national housing schemes for Land Commission work for the carrying out of minor relief schemes and so on have been reduced.  These were the sort of grants that gave very valuable and much-needed employment all over the country. The policy of the Government in this Budget in making such serious reductions on all these Votes is not a policy that is accepted by the members of this Party.</P>

      <P>I know that the Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs, knows more about this than anybody else.  I am not going to touch on matters affecting neutrality or external affairs.  These are matters that, from a point of view of law and order, should in a House like this be discussed in secret session.  When we cannot get the information that we are entitled to get in public session, then I think it is only right that the Government should take the whole House into its confidence and deal with the matter in secret session.  I have no authority for making that suggestion, but if it is not possible to deal with these matters in public session they might be dealt with in secret session. I think that we, as representatives of the people, are entitled to get that information in the present international circumstances.  The Minister for Finance challenged the figures which I gave in regard to the amount of money provided for employment schemes.  If the Minister would look <Col N="461" /> at Page 354 of the Estimates for Public Services he will see that on Vote 67 there is a decrease of £100,000 as against the figure for last year.  There are many other matters that I would like to raise, but they can be postponed until a later day&mdash;they can be raised as you, Sir, suggest, on the Estimates for the Services concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Budget time is naturally the time for review.  Taking it in that light one should be pleased to read over the Minister's speech.  It is interesting to find the Minister stating as he stated that agriculture in this country must be improved.  He says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have to rely on our export trade&mdash;that means our agriculture&mdash; to ensure that in spite of vast demands we will retain the wide range of imports required to maintain stability of conditions at home.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He also says on the same page:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our expenditure is heavy and certain.  Our revenue though heavy is by no means certain.  It depends upon our ability to maintain, and even to increase, our exports as well as our imports.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had these good intentions mentioned last year by the Minister for Finance, the predecessor of the present Minister.  We have the same kind of thing mentioned by Deputy Childers. Here we have evidence of a complete departure from the self-sufficiency programme of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must maintain our exports and our imports because they are absolutely vital to our lives.  One thing that is wrong with the Government, and with the Fianna Fáil people generally, is that while they agree with us on that and say so occasionally, they never make a real confession, and they never truly repent.  We had the Taoiseach the other day in Galway talking about the advantages of a policy of self-sufficiency.  Let us be honest with ourselves.  We on this side want self-sufficiency in so far as it is suitable and can be carried out, but let there be some commonsense and consistency about it.  When the Minister <Col N="462" /> and Deputy Childers talk about it, let them not be like the man in the Scripture who, having beheld his countenance in the looking-glass, went his way and forgot what manner of man he was.  That is exactly what is happening to those people.  They occasionally give expression to their good intentions.  I do not know if I can even call them good intentions. But now they are beginning to realise that this country must live on its exports and imports, and that the home market is not sufficient to maintain the country.  The sooner we get down to that and confess it the sooner we can get somewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers is a good student. He has that reputation.  He quoted some figures the other day&mdash;most of which, I think, I quoted myself about a year ago when advocating the setting up of a commission to deal with agriculture&mdash;when making a comparison between this country and other countries, the increased production in other countries as compared with this.  I am not disputing the Deputy's figures.  His premises are correct, but his conclusions are all wrong.  I do not think it is good enough for Deputy Childers, or anybody else, to get up here and say that the blame for the present position lies with the lazy farmers of this country.  I admit that he did not use the word &ldquo;lazy.&rdquo;  He said that in some way the people of this country had not been taught to work, and that this House would have to give the country a lead in that respect.  I do not think I would have spoken in this Budget debate at all if it were not for that particular reference.  I want to get it out of the mind of Deputy Childers that this House is no good to lead the country in so far as agriculture is concerned.  I, for instance, would not like to go down and tell the Limerick farmers how they should work their land.  They know how to work it much better than I do.  Their fathers before them knew it.</P>
    <P>What should be done is to provide an outlet for the products that the farmers of Limerick, Tipperary, Roscommon and every other part have to dispose of, products from which the people of <Col N="463" /> this country by their industry and enterprise were able to make a profit in other times.  Once the people of this country were put into leading strings, as the Fianna Fáil Party tried, they were led astray.  What the people want is to be provided with a market. They know more about production than the Government or the Fianna Fáil Party do.  Before the Fianna Fáil Party got into power the Irish farmer had a 10 per cent. preference in the British market.  I say to the Government: &ldquo;Keep that market open for them, get the best terms you can for them, and help them to improve the quality of their products.&rdquo;  That is what was happening before the present Government came into power.  I admit that the Government are trying to do that now, but they ought to be honest about it and try to get back to that market in a wholehearted way.  The important thing is to improve the products of the country, the quality of our livestock, and to get a market for them.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Childers was probing for figures the other day it was a pity that he did not carry his investigations a little further.  He referred to the fertility of the soil, and spoke of the need for improving it.  I agree with him.  I have been hammering at that for years. I have been endeavouring to get the Government to give a subsidy for artificial manures.  It is three years now since I advocated that policy.  What response did we on this side meet with?  The Government were able to throw away £500,000 in a bog in Clonsast, but all they could give for artificial manures was £40,000.  Deputy Childers asked how many of our farmers were aware of the quantities of artificial manure that were being put into the soil of New Zealand and Denmark.  I wonder is the Deputy aware of what happened here since Fianna Fáil came into power with regard to artificial manures.  If not, I suggest to him that he ought to look up the figures which are very interesting. We learn something with regard to the use of artificial manures from the shipping statistics for 1933 and 1938, and from the Census of Production. <Col N="464" /> From both sources you get this information: that since 1933 this country has been using 60,000 tons less artificial manures than previously.  In other words, our consumption of artificial manures has gone down by more than one third of what we had been using.</P>
    <P>Before Deputy Childers talked about increasing the fertility of the soil, and asked if our farmers knew what amount of artificial manures was being put into the land of New Zealand and Denmark he should have made some research in the publications to which I have referred.  If he had done so he would have seen what the results of the policy advocated by Fianna Fáil have been since it came into power.  In the early days the Party opposite, as a Government, told us that the British market was no use, and that livestock was of no use.  Our farmers were reduced to the position in which they could not sell their stock at a profitable price, and if the fertility of the soil has declined it is due to the fact that during the period I have referred to it has been starved of artificial manures by the loss of more than one-third of the quantity that used to be put into it.  Now, when prices are improving and when we want the artificial manures we cannot get them. That is because the manufacturers have cut their cloth according to their measure.  They reduced their output when the demand declined.  We cannot get the artificial manures now when we want them.  Is it not time that people like Deputy Childers should get down to that, and be honest about it, and admit that the land of this country has been absolutely starved because of the policy pursued here by the Government during the last eight years?  The consumption of artificial manures has, as I have said, gone down since 1933 by 60,000 tons a year.  Allowing one ton of artificial manures to five statute acres, which I think is a fair allowance, the figure that I have quoted shows that 300,000 acres of our land have gone unmanured during the last seven years.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the social services, and that the country is <Col N="465" /> able to maintain them.  There is only one way of doing that, and that is by increasing production&mdash;production of a kind that you can make money out of. The Minister for Finance says that the reason for this large Budget is because of the increased cost of social services. When all is said and done, what is this demand for increased social services but an admission of failure?  Surely the Government must admit that they have failed in their policy and to bring prosperity to the country.  If we had a prosperous country there would not be a need for one-third of the social services we have.  Because of misdirection on the part of the Government we have this demand for social services.  The truth is that the Government began at the wrong end.  When the Minister says that we have to rely on our export trade and that we ought to maintain our export and our import trade, we know where we are.  But let us act as if we knew where we are.  It is not so easy at present, with the world crashing around us, to think seriously of what might happen in this country; but let us be serious-minded about our own position.  Let us not say to-day that our export and our import trade are important and to-morrow tell the people that it is the self-sufficiency policy of Fianna Fáil which is saving the country.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I was rather hopeful when I heard Deputy Cleary's speech last Friday.  Deputy Cleary was rather a firebrand in years gone by when he sat on these benches; he was even a bit of a firebrand when later he sat on the Government Benches.  He has now changed his policy a great deal.  That is a good sign, and the Government should take their cue from a man like Deputy Cleary.  On Friday he asked the Government not to be interfering so much with the taxpaying and ratepaying community.  He said that the people were being harassed and that if they got more freedom to do their work in their own way the country would be much better off.  In saying that, I believe Deputy Cleary thought that taxation should be reduced a great deal.  If Deputy Corry <Col N="466" /> speaks in this debate I hope he will speak in the same strain, because he has been tending that way for the last year or two, and Deputy Corry's persuasive way may have some good effect on the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have stated that the war is partially the cause of the heavy taxation.  But if we go back to the years 1932 to 1939 we find taxation increasing every year, the cost of living going up every year, unemployment increasing every year, unemployment assistance increasing every year, home assistance increasing every year, and emigration increasing every year also.  If this country was prosperous, why is it we had all these increases for the last seven or eight years?  It is time for the Fianna Fáil Party to realise that this country is not prosperous.  Let any Fianna Fáil Deputy compare the position of the farmer to-day with what it was eight or ten years ago.  Let him look at the standard of living of the farmer at present.  The families of the farmers are running away from the land and trying to get employment elsewhere. They are going to England, even though there is a danger that they may be conscripted there.</P>
      <P>Then take the position of our rural towns at the present time as compared with ten years ago.  Business in our rural towns has been crippled by the policy of the Government.  The people have no money to spend in the towns. It is time that the Government should take notice of these things.  The people of the country are not able to meet the demands which are made on them. They are being forced to pay more than they are able to pay.  They have to fall back on the little reserves, which they accumulated some years ago, in order to meet these demands, because they are being forced to pay by the sheriffs.  The sheriffs are as active to-day as in any period in Irish history. The screw is being put on to make the people pay and, as I say, they have to fall back on the little reserves they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take another side of the Government's policy.  We know that there was a fairly decent crop of <Col N="467" /> potatoes last year, although there was not so much land under tillage.  In the west of Ireland at present there is a fine stock of potatoes still on hands. Quite recently these people could get £3 15s. per ton on the land for these potatoes which could be shipped to England for eating purposes.  Then the Government stepped in and said that the farmers should get £5 per ton for the potatoes.  What has happened? The most that the exporters could get for the potatoes was £6 10s. per ton f.o.b. at Dublin and, if they have to pay £5 per ton, the potatoes would cost them £7 10s. per ton delivered in Dublin.  If free export was allowed, the farmers, as I say, could get £3 15s. per ton on their land and the potatoes could be exported.  The position to-day is that the farmers have to sell the potatoes on the land at £2 10s. per ton.  These potatoes are brought to Dublin.  I do not know whether they are exported or not.  It is not fair for the Government to try to mislead the farming community by telling them they should get £5 per ton when the most they can get now is £2 10s.  If free export were allowed, there would still be plenty of potatoes for use in this country until the new crop comes in.  There must be plenty of potatoes in the country because the Minister for Agriculture has told the people to buy them and pit them.  Therefore, there cannot be any shortage.</P>
    <P>Any Fianna Fáil Deputy who goes through the country at present cannot but notice the falling off in our fairs and the amount of the land that is in meadow.  He cannot but notice the small number of cattle and sheep offered for sale at the fairs.  These are the fruits of Fianna Fáil policy.  If Fianna Fáil had not interfered with the farmers in the last few years, there would be plenty of stock on the land and plenty of stock for export.  As a result of interference with the pig industry, for several years there was hardly a pig to be bought at any fair in the country.  High prices are being paid for pigs now, because the pig population has gone down and there is a little more freedom allowed to the pig trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Deputy Cleary, in the course of his speech, stated that the Opposition had no economic policy, and the fact that we were not contesting the West Galway election proved that quite clearly. That was a gesture by Deputy Cosgrave, and I think it should be left at that.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that Deputy Cleary will get plenty of time to defend Fianna Fáil's economic policy in the near future.  Before that time comes the Government should get serious about our position, and see what they are going to do to employ the youth of the country.  As to the housing question, hardly any timber to build houses can be got at present.  We have factories that cost the country a good deal of money, but what is their position to-day?  I ask the Minister for Finance and also the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell the House how many of these factories are working half time, how many quarter time, and how many of them are closed.  These factories cost the taxpayers a large amount of money.  The Government must have known that this war was coming on, and should have put in supplies to keep things going. At present we have great numbers unemployed. In the building industry the cost of some timber is up by 100 per cent. and other classes cannot be got at all.  This is a very trying time upon our people.  Taxation and the cost of living are high.  There is no use blaming the war for the present position, because taxation has been going up year after year since this Government came into office.  It is time to give careful consideration to the reduction of taxation.</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity to see the position of the Opposition parties towards the Budget.  Every one of them that took part in the debate tried to find some complaint about the Budget but could not.  The Budget is a good one.  That is where they are caught out.  Deputy Mulcahy complained that less oats, less barley and less potatoes were growing now than during the happy days of Cumann na nGaedheal.  Deputy Brodrick knows the reason for that.  Yet he shouts <Col N="469" /> about the cost of living and at the same time complains that only 50/- a ton was paid for potatoes.  The principal reason for having less oats and barley grown was the attacks made in this House, day in, day out, by Deputy Dillon and by other Deputies on what was practically the only market that farmers had for oats and barley, namely, the admixture scheme.  That was the reason why the acreage under these crops was down.  Farmers began to get nervous, and feared that they were no longer going to have a secure price for oats and barley, and went in for a crop in which they had security&mdash; wheat.  I remember in the good old days of Cumann na nGaedheal seeing thousands of barrels of barley in Midleton and no one to buy it.  In these old days a farmer walked into some brewery and asked the brewer for God's sake to take his barley and to pay him in three months' time.</P>

      <P>I know this, that the moment a rival market was set up, namely, the millers' market, the brewers had to pay, and they had to tell the people what they would pay for barley.

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not troubling about who got it.  I admit that in Mr. Blythe's time the Government got some of it.  When a responsible Deputy like Deputy Mulcahy comes along and comments on the policy of self-sufficiency, I say that if the admixture scheme had been left alone there would be far more feeding available now.  We had Deputy Dillon shouting day in and day out about feeding Irish pigs on rotten Irish barley and rotten Irish oats.  We should be very glad to have that Irish oats and Irish barley now. That was the kind of talk we got from the Deputy.  I wonder where would we be now if Deputy Dillon, who is the shadow Minister for Agriculture in the Opposition, had his way?  I wonder will the Deputy eat Irish wheat now or will we have to get some ship to bring in a special bag of wheat for him?  The policy of self-sufficiency has been ranted against by Deputies opposite since Fianna Fáil came into office.  That policy is one of growing Irish wheat for Irish people on Irish soil.  That policy has been so successful that it has left us in the position that our people will not starve.  Then we had Deputy Brodrick criticising the factories. Deputy Cosgrave visited Cork recently and I noticed that he paid a very high compliment to one of the factories that was set up with the assistance of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Deputy Cosgrave congratulated the manufacturer on his enterprise in providing Irish forks and shovels.  The Deputy did not think that they were bad articles and did not think that they were unsuitable for Irish farmers.  I understand that Deputy Cosgrave is a farmer and evidently he realised that a good article was being produced in that factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> I hope that when Deputy Cosgrave next visits Cork he will bring a few of the Doubting Thomases with him. They should visit some of the other factories, within five miles radius of Cork, that were started owing to the protection policy of Fianna Fáil.  There are 1,800 workers in factories established in the vicinity of Cork City since Fianna Fáil came into office.  I hope that Deputy Cosgrave will take care to bring Deputy Dillon with him on his next visit.  If the policy preached by Deputy Dillon was followed, and if our artificial manure factories were left in the position they were in, what would be the situation to-day?  How many tons of artificial manure did we get in when the ports were thrown open and the tariff taken off?  These are things which Deputies ought to consider seriously in view of the circumstances of the present day.  It was the same way about the beet crop. One of the conditions attached to Deputy Dillon's offer of co-operation by the Fine Gael Party was that we should blow up the beet factories.  We were to depend on the foreigner for sugar during the war.  During the last war, sugar cost 1/2 per lb.  I am sure the agricultural labourers could buy a lot of sugar for their children at that price.  The self-sufficiency policy has proved successful.  We had Deputy Davin talking about housing.  The housing grants are the same as they always were.</P>

      <P>There would be no trouble about that.  I am sure that every Deputy and every Party would vote for it, even the Party which allowed the people to live in hovels, between 1923 and 1932.  They come along and bless Fianna Fáil when they see the people getting decent houses. Last week we had Deputy Hurley making a similar misrepresentation. He spoke of the unemployed in Cobh and he said that the Irish Company was employing 120 hands, but if the whole premises were being worked, full time employment would be given to 700 hands.  We were not responsible for the date on which the war started. We can hardly be held responsible for that.  It was through the protection policy of Fianna Fáil that the Irish people were able to give employment to 120 hands in a place which was derelict while Fine Gael were in office. Deputy Hurley also said that representations were made to show that repair facilities were available for ships and boats in Cork Harbour and that nothing was done.  The Deputy went with me to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to that matter.  He was present with me at a meeting at which a definite statement was made that officials from the Minister's Department had come down and made a complete survey of the place&mdash;a thing which had not been done for twenty years previously.  A complete survey was made of the dockyard and ship-repair facilities at Cobh. I have the minutes of that meeting here.  Deputy Hurley was present then and on the very day he made his <Col N="473" /> speech here he had these minutes in his pocket or in his bag.  The minutes show that a complete survey was made and an estimate prepared of the cost of the necessary repairs.  Deputy Hurley knew that.  Nevertheless, he came up here to accuse the Government of doing nothing.  Those are what I would call unfair tactics.  Deputies are so bankrupt of material for debate on the present Budget that they have to find something with which to attack the Government.  Deputy Hurley blamed the Government for starting the world war and he blamed them for not carrying out an inspection which he knew they had carried out.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister responded to the appeals made to him on the last occasion and took 1d. off the poor man's tobacco.  I have only one regret in regard to the Budget.  I think income-tax should have gone up.  We could easily afford to put another 1/- on the income-tax and devote that money to finding employment for the unemployed.</P>

      <P>We had another Deputy representing my constituency and his whole cry about the people of Cobh was that they were looking forward to the day when the British would come back.  I resent that libel on the people of Cobh.  Deputy Brooke Wellington Brasier was far away from the Irish people and kept very far under the bed when the young men of Cobh were out fighting for this Irish nation.  That part of the country was at more loss than any other part of the country but the young men there did their part faithfully and well.  I saw men who at that period had £10 a week in Haulbowline walk out from their jobs into <Col N="474" /> the flying columns and I have known them to lose their lives at Clonmult. It is a sad thing that here in an Irish Parliament we would have that libel cast on the town that produced such men.  It is rather regrettable that in any body of Irish people there would be a person responsible for such a thing and that there are people who would send a creature like that into an Irish Parliament.</P>
      <P>We hear Deputies talking about the other side of the question, about the export market and the amount of artificial manures that should be put out. I wonder how much artificial manure Deputy Bennett from Limerick would put out at present.  Limerick is a great milk-producing county.  They produce milk in order to sell butter to the British at 126/- a cwt.  I wonder does the Deputy ever think how that would pay for superphosphate at £6 a ton. Does he ever consider if 4½d. a gallon would pay for milking the cows?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the market you were looking for, the free, open, British market.  When the free, open British market in the middle of a war will offer you 126/- a cwt. for butter, I wonder what you will get for it when the war is over.  That proves the value of our policy of self-sufficiency, having a market at home for the farmers' produce, a sound market for wheat and beet, where the farmers will at least have the knowledge on the day they set the crop what their price is going to be, and they will not be depending on the vagaries of our neighbour across the water, who knows he will have to get it and who will pay just what he likes for it.  At the very period when Deputies opposite were shouting to give them back their market, the price of Irish butter in England was 70/- a cwt., or the equivalent of 2d. a gallon for milk.  We had to bring in a Prices (Stabilisation) Act to endeavour to secure some price for the man milking the cows.  That is why this Government turned their eyes on the home market and decided that anything the <Col N="475" /> farmers could produce should go to the home market.</P>
      <P>We heard Deputies talking about the market outside; we heard Deputy Brennan bewailing that there was not more artificial manure put out, and Deputy Mulcahy complaining because there were not more potatoes grown. After each of them spoke another one got up and gave the reason why. Deputy Mulcahy was answered immediately when he was told that the price of potatoes in Galway was 50/- a ton.  I sympathise with the Deputies opposite.  They were expecting a &ldquo;field&rdquo; week here; they looked forward to an opportunity when they could complain of all the increases in taxation.  Lo and behold, they were given nothing to complain about.  They had to search their memories and then they gave us lies, half-lies and untruths.</P>

On page 177 of the Estimates for Public Services it will be seen that under sub-head S.2.&mdash;Grants under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1939, the amount voted last year was £455,000. and that has been reduced this year to £200,000, a reduction of £255,000.

      <P>The fact is that the Deputy was only £250,000 out, but that is nothing to him.  The speech to which we have listened is an indication of the type of policy that has been pursued in this country for the last eight years. We are invited to consider what the individual price of particular commodities is, regardless of whether these commodities were for sale in bulk or not.  The fact is&mdash;and the information is taken from no other sources than Government sources, from Government publications&mdash;that during the five years from 1927 to 1931 there was not what is called a self-sufficiency policy in operation here.  There was a policy which the mentally weak would describe as <i>laissez faire</i>&mdash;the mentally weak, politically, economically and otherwise.  In that period we collected in hard cash for our exports, after paying for our imports of agricultural origin, a sum of £14,866,000 per annum.  That was during the period of the policy of <i>laissez faire.</i></P>
      <P>We then went into what is called self-sufficiency; we were to work harder, to get more money for the farmers, to bring prosperity where there had been beggary, and to put the hard-working agriculturists on their feet.  From 1932 to 1938&mdash;and these figures are taken from the latest publications we have got&mdash;the average sum which the farmers received for the exports of their agricultural produce, having paid for the imports, was £6,412,000.  That represented the success and the prosperity under that particular policy, and that is the reason for the support of this Budget by the apostles of self-sufficiency. Having failed miserably as far as the principal industry of the country is concerned, the Government are now taxing the people to make up for the deficiencies in our economy which are the direct result of the policy that is being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> Deputy Dillon at no time made the statement that there was such a thing as rotten Irish wheat or rotten Irish barley.  That he criticised the policy of growing wheat in this country, I quite agree.  The years that I have mentioned were the years in which we grew the wheat and in which we sold it and got a subsidised price for it. These figures we have got for our agricultural exports include the subsidies that we paid for those exports, and there is the result.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder then that the people on this side of the House not perhaps blinded by the exhilaration and exaltation like Deputy Corry and people like him, people who look on things as they are and take out from the published reports facts as they are &mdash;is it any wonder that we are dissatisfied with the policy that is responsible for that state of things?  Let us examine it from another aspect.  The Deputy mentioned in the course of his statement that there were hundreds and even thousands in employment now in the City of Cork that were not there before there was a change of Government. We take the period from 1927 to 1932.  That period is taken for a very deliberate reason and that is that up to 1927 there was the absence of a very considerable political representation in this country, as 44 members of the Dáil stood out.  They came in in 1927.  They then saw the error of their ways.  And so I take from 1927 to 1932. An average number, according to the figures in the National Health Insurance Funds, of 11,400 was added each year during those five years to the number of employed.  I will try to make it plain to the Deputy.  Assuming that the number the first year was X, it would be X+11,400 the second year, X+22,800 the third year, X+34,200 the fourth year, and so on until by 1932 it was X+57,000.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I am going to go on.  Since 1932 the average has gone down to 9,800. Only 9,800 have been added in the succeeding years and last year there were only 1,000 added to the number of the <Col N="478" /> previous year.  I am taking it that Deputy Corry is not so wedded to the Fianna Fáil economics that if he sees his policy is wrong he would endeavour to have it changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I quite see that in respect of unemployment insurance that the pace was quicker.  It was quicker to the extent of 4,500 persons annually. That is to say the number of persons who were registered in unemployment insurance went at a more rapid rate. Agriculture and such employments as had not employment insurance went down.  What is more significant is according to the same figures and methods of computation there were 1,000 persons less registered last year than the year before.  These are simple facts, not arguments.  The Minister himself admitted that on the last day. Let us take another trial as to how we progressed during those years.  The Minister in the course of his speech on the 13th March, 1940, as reported in column 801, No. 2, volume 79, dealt with these matters, the two divisions of thrift, the Post Office Savings Bank and the Savings Certificates.  He said that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;on December 31st, 1931, there was in the Post Office Savings Bank £3,703,000, belonging mostly to workers and small farmers.  On December 31st, 1939, the amount had gone up to £10,652,000, an increase of £6,949,000.  Is not that something good to boast of belonging to poor people, workers and small farmers, and not the rich?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am accepting that as recorded in the official publication.  Then he went on to state that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the Savings Certificates have not gone up to the same extent.  On <Col N="479" /> March 31st, 1931, they amounted to £6,352,000, and on March 31st, 1939, to £7,866,000, showing an increase of £1,514,000 or a total increase of £8,463,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is here that I have a little dispute with the Minister.  He can, of course, select any date and point in respect of that date to any moral that he wishes.  But I suggest that March 31st, 1931, is not a date over which he can stand.  I am taking, therefore, for comparison the 31st March, 1932, which was as close as possible to the change of Government&mdash;only 21 or 22 days of a difference.  The figure in respect of Savings Certificates on that date was £7,030,000.  According to the latest publications, the fund in 1940 was £7,729,000.  That would reduce the figure which the Minister had by £1,514,000 down to £699,000.  I have taken the two days now which are the latest published in respect of the Post Office Savings Bank and the Savings Certificates.  The date I have taken is the 31st March, 1932, and the 31st March, 1940.  The average is £956,000.  I will dispute that figure, however, in a moment.  Meantime, I take £3,703,000, which was referred to by the Minister as the figure for the Post Office Savings Bank, and add to that £7,030,000 in Savings Certificates.  Adding up the two they amount to £10,733,000. Deputies will say at once that that is for a period of ten years.  It is not.  I will take them at their word and see what the average is.  The average would be then at the rate of £117,000 per year.  We will take it that way.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Post Office Savings Bank was not begun until the 1st January, 1923, and the policy of the Savings Certificates was not inaugurated until the 1st July, 1923.  In respect of each of these we find that the average savings over those years amounted to £1,214,983, as compared with the figure I have given of £956,000 per annum.  The latter figure includes the interest which was earned on £3,703,000, which was in the Post Office Savings Bank on the 31st December, 1931.  The interest on that <Col N="480" /> sum would amount to about £740,000. I deduct a proportion of that from the figure I have quoted&mdash;the figure of less than £900,000 as compared with £1,200,000.  It is quite true that the number of persons in insurable occupations over the period increased but, notwithstanding that, apparently those who were put into employment or already in it were not able to save as much as they were from 1923 to 1931. What is the reason for that?  It may be found to some extent in the cost of living which has advanced and is still advancing.  The increase that has taken place in the cost of living is attributable, to some extent, to the high cost of taxation, to the high impositions made here year after year, now culminating in this Budget which is going to extract £33,750,000 from the pockets of our people.  That is a very considerable sum of money.</P>
    <P>I find, on looking up the cost-of-living figures, that the cost of food alone is 117 as compared with 100 in July, 1914.  If all items are included, the figure in February of this year was 197. Over a period of 12 years, this is the first time in which there has been such a gap between the food item and all items.  The highest previous figure I have been able to discover was 16 in 1932.  At one period there were only six additional points to be added to the food cost.  That was in 1928.  In 1929 seven points had to be added.  If we were in the position to-day of having to add only eight points to the cost of living, as far as food is concerned, the Minister for Finance might not have any quarrel at all with the Civil Service.  His own statement has been to the effect that the customs duties have been a great source of income to him, due to the fact that not only has the cost of imports risen, but that there has to be added to it the extra cost in respect of freight, insurance, war risk, etc.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the other side have said that this is a good Budget; that it is better than they expected.  I wonder whether they have taken the trouble to examine it to see if it is a good or a bad Budget.  The fact of the matter <Col N="481" /> is that in this Budget the Minister is looking for more than £1,000,000 over what he got last year.  I wonder if the people who say that they are satisfied with this Budget have ever turned over in their minds how much has been added to the cost of living in respect of this additional impost&mdash;freight, insurance, war risk, and so on, in connection with our customs.  While we criticise in this House and out of it practically all industrialists, most of our farmers, operatives, and so on, for their little contribution towards the increased cost of living, this House and the majority in it, as well as all those who say that the Budget is much better than they expected, are, in my opinion, more responsible for the increase in the cost of living than a combination of all other people together.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, referred to the fact that he was going to stabilise the Civil Service cost-of-living bonus at 85.  It would not be necessary for him to do that if the Government themselves made an effort to keep down the cost of living.  They are undertaking to do it now.  What particular moral right they have to stabilise the bonus at this figure is another question.  Some eight years ago they introduced in this House what came to be known as the &ldquo;Cuts Bill&rdquo;.  In reply to a question asked here, it was stated that in respect of salaries, etc., that measure would effect a saving in that particular year of £50,000 or £54,000.  By reason, however, of the large number of resignations that took place in the Civil Service, and the gratuities which fell to be paid in respect of the withdrawal of their service by State servants, the cost was £49,000.  On that basis we made a saving of approximately £5,000.  But if we did we inherited another legacy.  It cost the State another £29,000 a year to pension those people, so that if we saved £54,000 a year under the &ldquo;Cuts Bill&rdquo;, we lost £49,000 plus £29,000 a year.  That was bad business.  I hope that, in respect of this particular proposal, we are not heading for a situation of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that civil servants <Col N="482" /> have an advantage over people outside. The latter may be divided into two classes: those with earnings and those living on incomes.  The people with incomes are hardly likely to have as much now as they had before the war, and will have to pay a higher rate of income-tax.  In all the circumstances, the industrial section of the community is hardly likely to make much out of this war.  So far as the agricultural community are concerned, their costs are continually rising.  Everything they have to buy is dearer than it was before the war.  Prices would require to advance much more than they actually have in order to compensate them.  On the face of it, it does not appear that this war is going to be a profitable war for this country.</P>
    <P>To my mind the sum of money required this year is too much.  The policy responsible for these continually increasing demands on the pockets of the people has not yet resulted in increasing employment at the same rate which the Government inherited.  Even if that were all that we had to criticise, the fact that this Budget is not balanced, that the last Budget was not balanced, and that it is not right to borrow money in respect of the items which the Minister has designated for that purpose, is very disconcerting.  The fact that to balance the Budget this year and for the last three or four years in respect of which there has been a deficit would require £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 should be sufficient to make the Government pause in their policy and see whether the best interests of the country would not be better served by more attention to economy than is shown in this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister dismissed almost in a few sentences the efforts of the economy committee which was set up. Wherever economies have been effected, they have been effected entirely at the expense of the services providing employment.  That is unfortunate at a time when the numbers of the unemployed are rising.  It is unfortunate that we have got into the habit of not balancing our Budgets.  It is unfortunate that we should go on year after year increasing the sums <Col N="483" /> which are being taken from the people.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider the whole of the financial policy which has been pursued during the last few years and see if he cannot make some better effort than has been made up to this by the Government to pay its way and not be handing on to the people who are to come after us the responsibility of paying the debts that we ought to have met in our time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with one of the last remarks made by Deputy Cosgrave and dispute with him the question of whether this is or is not a good Budget.  I say it is an excellent Budget, and I say that, apart from politics, and Party politics in particular, any member of Deputy Cosgrave's Party going into his constituency after the Budget was met by every constituent of his saying: &ldquo;You have given us a good Budget, anyway.&rdquo; I have dozens of letters from supporters of Deputy Cosgrave in all parts of the country, as well as from supporters of my own Party, and supporters of other Parties, telling me the same story.  Of course it is necessary, in connection with Party politics, to get up as Deputy Cosgrave and his numerous supporters got up during the three days this Budget has been under discussion, and, in different degrees of adjectives, positive, comparative and superlative, to denounce this Budget. Deputy Cosgrave, I must say, was very mild in his denunciation of the Budget in comparison with some of his back benchers.  But they felt themselves in duty bound to denounce it.  Some of them said that it was practically the worst Budget ever introduced.  That was an exaggerated statement.  But it was necessary, I presume, from the Party political standpoint&mdash;just as necessary as Deputy Cosgrave's milder denunciation of the Budget.  One letter which I got to-day from a person engaged in the liquor trade, who is a backer of Deputy Cosgrave, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;My friends were shell-shocked, after they had stored their cellars with gallons upon gallons of spirits in <Col N="484" /> the expectation of vastly increased taxation on liquor of all kinds.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is the opinion which I am getting from Deputy Cosgrave's supporters all over the country, whatever I got and whatever I am going to get.  I got similar letters from a great many parts of the country from all sorts of people.  There was not one solitary letter of complaint about the additional taxation, small as it was, which was put on.  There was no complaint about the taxation even in the anonymous letters that I got to-day&mdash;I get them every day&mdash;complaining that I had not put taxes on other things. Everybody, as far as I can find&mdash;except of course the members of the Opposition in the Dáil&mdash;has stated: &ldquo;Whatever the reason is, we had a lucky escape and it is a good Budget&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>They had.  Because they have the Government and the Minister for Finance that they have at present, they had a lucky escape.  They might have been much worse off.  It is a good Budget.  This Budget standing alone imposes practically no new taxation. Therefore, being a good Budget and a Budget that any Minister for Finance in any Government could stand over, that was realised by the Opposition.  Deputy Davin and others who spoke from the Labour benches realised it and, in order to find ammunition to throw at the Minister and the Government, they had to go back over the Budgets of the last six, seven, eight or ten years.  I do not object in the least to that.  They are right in reminding the country that heavy additional taxation was imposed in the Supplementary Budget last year.  If that taxation had not been imposed then, it would have to be imposed now. I do not object to their reminding the people of what the additional taxation was and how heavy it was.  I am quite prepared to have the people told that again and again.  I should like them to realise that.  I do not object in the least to that being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> There was heavy additional taxation put on six months ago and there was good reason for it.  As I explained then, and also in my statement last Wednesday, we would not have been able to pay our way during the remainder of the last financial year even to the extent that we did were it not for that additional taxation.  As it was, unfortunately at the end of the year there was a deficit.  But, if we had not put on that additional taxation, we would not have been able to go anywhere near paying our way.</P>
    <P>I admit the taxation is heavy.  I do not deny that at all.  I think it was Deputy Mulcahy said that I drew a polite curtain over the real financial situation when introducing the Budget. I do not think I did.  It certainly was not my intention.  My anxiety is that everybody here and in the country should know exactly what the financial situation is.  I do not want to hide one figure.  If there is any figure any Deputy thinks was not explained sufficiently, if he is interested in asking any question I shall be glad to give further particulars.  There is no desire at all to hide what the real financial situation is and what the significance of the taxation of this country means. But in considering the heavy taxation that is imposed in this Budget, in the last Budget, and in the Budgets of recent years, we have to take into consideration the situation of the country as a whole.  We have been going through a series of serious economic and financial struggles, but notwithstanding that, there was good reason for any taxation that was put on at any time during the last eight years.</P>
    <P>I would like to repudiate a statement that was made here that there is any danger of bankruptcy.  There is none. The country is in a sound financial position and, in particular, I wish that Deputy Dillon, who occupies a responsible position, would not suggest that there is any such fear as bankruptcy in this State.  There is none.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we lose our sovereignty because we could not manage our own affairs it would be a sad day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no likelihood whatever of losing our sovereignty in the Twenty-Six Counties because of inability to <Col N="486" /> manage our own affairs.  They are being well and satisfactorily managed, particularly now, realising the difficult conditions in which we live, and the condition of other countries at the moment.  It is not a laughing matter. It would seem to me that the situation here is somewhat unreal, to see the calm atmosphere in which we are discussing our financial and economic problems, when we realise that at this very moment nations are being blotted out all round us.  The Deputy opposite can laugh because a Minister here says we are going through difficult times.  I do not think it is necessary to laugh or jeer at a remark of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very young and he will learn a little wisdom by the time he has earned the right to sit where he is sitting now.  We are living in difficult and dangerous times, and these difficult and dangerous times have imposed certain heavy additional expenditure upon us.  There was a discussion here recently on the Army Estimate, on Army policy.  On the Vote on Account and on the Budget, reference was also frequently made to the additional cost of the Army.  It was called &ldquo;wasteful expenditure&rdquo;. A variety of other adjectives was used, some not even so mild as wasteful with regard to expenditure on the Army.  I hope it will not be necessary ever to fire a shot in defence of our neutrality or our freedom.  As far as this country is concerned, I hope we are not going to be involved in any way physically in this awful conflict. But if we did not take even the mild measures that have been taken to protect ourselves, I know where the first vigorous vitriolic denunciations would come from.  While our resources are very limited, we must do anything we can to have a modest form of insurance against attack. That is all we can do.  That is all we have done.  If we are attacked what are we to do?  We on this side have our own views on what we are to do.  I was glad to see that Deputy Cosgrave said very definitely what his views were. <Col N="487" /> Speaking on Vote 63, at column 1580, Parliamentary Debates, on April 18, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister wants to know what my view on the Army situation is, if we were faced with an invasion, it is this: that the invasion should be resisted, and that there should be, along with the Army, the support of every citizen to resist that invasion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say: &ldquo;We should not follow the example of Denmark.&rdquo;  If we are to attempt to put that policy into operation we cannot find arms of any kind, even the most modest and simple kind, to put into the hands of the citizens in 24 hours.  You have to spend money.  I would hate, as Minister for Finance in particular, and as an ordinary citizen, to see money wasted in firing off our money in powder for guns.  I would hate to see our resources so uselessly employed.  But we cannot look at it in that way.  If it is meant that the expenditure is excessive, as some people call it, I believe it is necessary to defend our neutrality and our freedom, if attacked. If we were to adopt the policy that some of the Opposition want&mdash;it is not Deputy Cosgrave's policy&mdash;and do as Denmark did, then we could reduce the Army to a size that would be necessary for the maintenance of peace and order here, and even then, in these times, it would have to be a bigger and a costlier army than if there were no war and no disturbances of the kind that are happening around us.  That is one reason why we had a deficit last year, and why over £1,000,000 more was spent on the Army as against the previous year.  Up to the 31st March, £1,200,000 more was spent on the Army, and a similar amount, and maybe more, will be spent this year.  That was one of the items that was criticised by members of the Opposition, but it is an item of expenditure included in the Budget accounts that I think the whole House can well stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When talking of our financial position, Deputy Dillon told us how the head of the Government in Portugal, Professor Salazar, wiped out the external <Col N="488" /> debt there.  I am glad that gentleman was able to do that for his country.  Deputy Dillon spoke at great length about our external debt.  He must not have looked up the figures before he began to speak about our external debt.  Thanks be to God, our whole external debt is under a quarter of a million pounds, and is not worth talking about.  Our external debt amounts to 847,540 dollars.  We are, therefore, in a very happy and unique position in the world in having such a small external debt.  The State might fear nothing if it were asked to pay that debt to-morrow.  We should have no difficulty in doing so.  There is no use in holding up Professor Salazar or anybody else to us as an example, because we have nothing to be ashamed of as regards our external debt when compared with that of any other small country like our own.  Even if we wanted to raise an external loan, which we do not at the moment, there is no reason why we should not.  We have very considerable external assets which could be used.  If we wanted to raise credit for any undertaking here, these external assets could be used.  If it was not convenient to sell them, they could be used as credit for borrowing.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Dillon drew a picture of the terrible position of the poor man going into a shop in Ballaghaderreen &mdash; perhaps his own shop&mdash;and being unable to buy food.  I wonder if there was no such poor man in Ballaghaderreen before this Government came in.  One would imagine from Deputy Dillon's speech that it was only since Fianna Fáil came into office that a poor or hungry man was known in the country.  The employment figures show that considerably more people are employed now than were employed before we came into office.  These people are employed at good wages in all parts of the country&mdash;even in Cork, as Deputy Corry suitably reminded Deputy Cosgrave in the course of his speech here a few minutes ago.  The wage of the poor agricultural labourer, of whom Deputy Dillon spoke is, small as it <Col N="489" /> appears, bigger and better than it was before Fianna Fáil came into office. There is machinery now, which did not exist before Fianna Fáil came into office, for increasing that wage if the board set up for that purpose consider that the wage should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon selected a number of Departments and said economies should be effected in the Departments he enumerated.  If the economies he suggested were made in these Departments, he contended that the additional taxation imposed in the Supplementary Budget and the small amount of additional taxation imposed in the present Budget would not be necessary. The first Department referred to by the Deputy was the Department of the Taoiseach.  I looked up the figures of the cost in 1931-2 and in 1938-9.  In 1931-2, the cost was £11,101 and in 1938-9 it was £13,508, an increase of £2,407.  The staff has been increased by six, four being in the Government Information Bureau.  But if there were only the same number employed in that Department there would, in all probability, be a considerable increase in the amount paid to the staff, because in 1931-2 the members of the staff were comparatively young and they would have had their salaries gradually increased in the usual Civil Service way.  There would, possibly, be an increase of £1,000 out of that increase of £2,407 in any event.  The sum is not very considerable and would not provide much money for any other purpose.  There is a considerable increase in the cost of the next Department to which Deputy Dillon referred &mdash;the Revenue Department.  In 1931-2, the cost of that Department was £631,727.  In 1938-9 it was £843,100, an increase of £211,373, due to an extra staff of about 630, spread over all branches of the Department.  There has been a big development of that Department arising out of the change of Government policy.  The tariff policy involved a considerable augmentation of staff in the Customs and Excise Branch and, naturally, that led to an increase in the other staffs &mdash; superintending staff, secretariat, and so on.  I believe that that increase is justified.  We are getting a great deal <Col N="490" /> of money into the Customs that we would not ordinarily get&mdash;a great deal more than the extra cost put upon the country by reason of the increase of staff.  The Government believe that the change in policy was necessary and whatever additional expenditure was required to implement that change of policy is, in my opinion, justified.</P>
    <P>The next department referred to by Deputy Dillon was that of the Gárda. In looking up the figures for the Gárda, I came upon a speech of the Minister for Justice, dealing with his Estimate, on the 10th April.  In explaining the cause of the increase, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I propose to deal at length with the reason for the large increase in the cost of the Guards.  The sum is £211,000 more than it was in 1932.... When I became Minister for Justice at the beginning of last September, the total strength of the Guards was about the same as when the late Government went out of office.  In fact, it was one less than it was in 1932.  Of course, there was a big increase in 1933-34 and 1934-35, something like 600 men being taken into the force....  On the 31st March, 1932, all ranks of the Gárda numbered 7,099, and on the 31st August, 1939, 7,098.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That takes into account the 600 men brought in in 1933-34 and 1934-35. &ldquo;Of the £211,000 extra,&rdquo; he goes on to say, &ldquo;£20,000 is accounted for by the extra number of men.&rdquo;  Then, in column 1134, he goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the increase in personnel due to the recruitment of 300 Taca Síochána, which took place partly in September, 1939, and partly in February and March, 1940 ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That number was brought in at that time.  He says the correct figure for all ranks, officers and men, of the regular Gárda is £7,049.  There is then a figure of 298 for the Taca Síochána, and this gives a total of 7,347.  If there had not been an additional man put into the Gárda there would have been very considerable additional expenditure this year as compared with 1922.  When the Gárda were formed, they were all young men at the lowest rate of pay, <Col N="491" /> and, during the years that have elapsed, whether you take it at 1922 or 1932, these men remaining in the force and growing older got increased pay. Thousands of them got married, and they got marriage allowances, and if there was never an additional man taken into the force, if there never had been a change of Government, and if Deputy Cosgrave was still the head of the Government, the Gárda would have cost probably £100,000 to £150,000 more than it did in 1932.</P>

      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is another Department that Deputy Dillon referred to, and undoubtedly there has been a big increase.  In 1938-39 the amount of the Estimate was £343,400, and the Estimate for 1940-41 is £313,823.  There has been a big increase in the cost of that Department, but the activities of the Department as compared with 1931-32 are entirely different.  That Department has been responsible for initiating the Government's industrial policy and expanding that policy, as the country and Deputies know it has been expanded. It was responsible for the starting of the numerous factories that <Col N="492" /> Deputy Cosgrave visited in Cork the week before last.  There he saw some excellent work done, judging by the reports of speeches in the newspapers. He saw some excellent work being done, excellent products being turned out.  He praised the industries, those engaged in them, and those responsible for the fact that these industries exist.  We know, however, when it comes to speaking on the Budget here the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, admittedly having increased in cost, does not get the same praise.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the cost of the Army, a matter that Deputy O'Sullivan was so exercised over when he spoke the other day and on other occasions.  Undoubtedly there have been increases, but, with regard to a considerable proportion of the increased cost of the various Departments, I have said before, and I repeat, that if there had not been any change of Government or of policy, these Departments, not to the same extent if you include Industry and Commerce, if they had only the same personnel, would have been under an obligation considerably to increase the cost of the staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole debate on the Budget developed very largely into a debate on agriculture.  We were reminded by Deputy O'Sullivan of the agricultural policy of his late colleague, Deputy Hogan, who was Minister for Agriculture for a considerable time.  Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out that Deputy Hogan started from scratch in his agricultural policy.  That is not a very pleasant kind of testimonial to those who were working in what was known in the British days as the Department of Agriculture.  It was then under T.W. Russell and, before him, Sir Horace Plunkett.  That Department was in existence for something like 20 years and, even though they were under the British Government, we were given to understand that they did a considerable amount of work, not alone in developing co-operation in the country, but in improving live stock breeds and methods of farming and in laying down the principles of farming best suited to this country, and that was long <Col N="493" /> before Dáil Eireann, the late Deputy Hogan, Deputy O'Sullivan, or even Minister Seán T. O Ceallaigh was ever heard of.</P>
    <P>It was not true, therefore, to my mind, to say that Deputy Hogan, when he was Minister for Agriculture, was starting from scratch.  He had the advantage of whatever work was done, and a considerable amount of work was done under the Department of Agriculture before Dáil Eireann was formed. While I think that Deputy Hogan's efforts to increase tillage, to increase and improve live stock, were worthy of praise, I might point out that the greatest criticism of his policy came from people, some of whom were his own and his Party's most eloquent supporters. The former Minister for Agriculture, God rest his soul, used to be called the Minister for Grass, but it was not anybody on this side of the House who invented that phrase.  It was invented, if I remember aright, by the late D.P. Moran, editor of <i>The Leader</i>, who was a thick and thin supporter at all times of Deputy Cosgrave's Government and the Party to which he belongs.  The pity of it is that the recommendations made by the late Minister, for increased tillage, were not adopted, even by the farmers who voted for him and his Party.</P>
    <P>We have done much more for agriculture, if one is to judge by the amount of money that goes out of the national Exchequer into agriculture in a variety of ways and through various channels. We are spending much more money on agriculture than was spent during the days of the last administration&mdash;a great deal more&mdash;and if we had more money, and if pressure from other directions were not as great as it is, we could usefully spend still more money in improving the position of agriculture.  Nobody can say that this Government has not done well by agriculture and, if we are to judge by the amount of support this Government have got from farmers in every constituency in the country, the farmers themselves believe that we have stood well by agriculture.  We would not be here as a Government if we had not stood well by agriculture, <Col N="494" /> and the agricultural people in the main are those who put us in and who have kept us in office.  There are some other notes here about Deputy O'Sullivan's references to the Army, but I think I have gone over that at sufficient length already.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that Deputy O'Sullivan's and Deputy Cosgrave's policies with regard to the utility of the Army are not in harmony.  The real defence of this country, Deputy O'Sullivan said, does not depend on us at all.  That is not Deputy Cosgrave's view if I understand him aright. Deputy O'Sullivan talked about the lucky position in which we are, quoting the words of Deputy Childers.  We were in the same lucky position geographically in 1914 and 1918, and we were not neutral; even geographically we are in a lucky position, that is true. But lucky position and all, unless the men who were there and are there had the statesmanship and foresight shown in the past, and shown now, to make use of that lucky position, we might have Deputy O'Sullivan out with his gun now.  I would be sorry to see him, because I do not think he would be much good with a gun.  He might not be in a very happy and perhaps not so lucky a position as he is at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy O'Sullivan emphasising, underlining and wondering why I felt it necessary to refer here in my Budget statement to our export trade.  I stand for every word I said with regard to the necessity for our continuing to export, increase our exports and to follow up our exports.  If we do not do that then I have to say that we are going to be in a sad plight.  We have to rely on our exports.  When we are talking about exports let us remember that our exports are 90 per cent. agricultural. There were many references during the course of the debate to our agricultural position and the necessity for improving it.  I agree; we have to agree.  People have emphasised to-day that we have only one market.  That is true.  That places us in a difficult position.  We are not as free as the countries that have alternative markets to which to send their goods.  Bargaining <Col N="495" /> is a hard fight.  It is hard to make some impression on those on whom we are relying to buy our goods.  We have to realise that we are in a difficult position in that matter in striking a bargain and that we have to use all the diplomacy in our power and to take advantage of the circumstances as they are to try to improve the position of our agriculturists in that market. While it is true in the case of every article we send to that market that the price is not all that we would desire, it is true that as regards the agricultural prices generally, the index figure is up by approximately 50 per cent. in the last 12 months.  To show that the position in agriculture in the country generally has improved it is only necessary to refer to the collection of rates in the counties.  For the last three or four years there has been a considerable improvement in the collection of rates as disclosed by the figures at the end of each year.  The rate collection has improved all round in the last three or four years and it has again improved this year.  The increase in the bank balances shows that there is an improvement in agriculture.  The moneys in the Post Office Savings Bank have increased and there has been an increase in the amount of Savings Certificates held.  These figures show that the position in the country generally and particularly the position of agriculturists has improved, generally speaking, and is sound.</P>
    <P>I inquired recently about advances and credits given to agriculturists by our banks.  I found that the banks have increased their credit to farmers considerably.  Between December 31st, 1938, and December 31st, 1939, approximately £600,000 of increased advances were given by Irish banks to agriculturists. Since December last that sum has been increased by over £1,500,000 additional.  It is not right or proper, and certainly not true, for one or two Deputies to make remarks that the banks were holding up credit, particularly to farmers; that they were not helping the farmers to make use of the opportunities that at present exist to increase agricultural output.</P>

      <P>There will always be that.  There will be always amongst farmers in the country some proportion of people who will not pay their debts. There may be even in the Dáil some few people who will not pay their debts.  You might even find some here in the Dáil who are in the same position &mdash;able to pay their debts, and will not.  The Deputy may have heard of one or two.  I know I did.  Deputy Linehan is fond of talking about estate duties.  I think he should have left that subject alone in view of the blunders he made on the last occasion that he spoke on it when he got a little lecture from me that he ought to have remembered.  He should know something about that subject because of his position as a lawyer, but apparently he does not.  I imagine that he deals with a good many estates, and as I said before I am sure he has a good deal of practice in that branch of the law, but, as I told him then, he ought to make sure of his facts before he talks on the subject in the House.  I told him on that occasion that he was hopelessly wrong.  He said that we were getting nothing out of the big estates.  I told him that we were getting 75 per cent. of the duties under this head out of the big estates.  He did not tell the truth about it.  I suppose he did not know.  Well, he knows it now, and he might leave that subject alone until he learns something about it.</P>

      <P>I did not pass over the subject of unemployment lightly, as Deputy Hickey said.  I did not deal with it in a complacent way, as he and others suggested.  I realise that the subject is very much there.  It is a problem for which neither this Government nor the last Government has found a solution.  I hope that we will keep on trying to find a solution for it, and that we will get some constructive suggestions from all sides of the House, particularly from the Labour Party, the members of which talk on this subject on every possible occasion.  I am not objecting to that.  I notice that at the annual Convention of the Labour Party, held on the 16th April, Mr. L. J. Duffy, who, I think, is Secretary of the Party, said, if he is correctly reported&mdash;the report is from the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;that no speaker had told them how to cope with the problem of unemployment.  Therefore, we have the position that at the annual convention of the Party which makes it its special province to deal with and discuss this matter, and press the urgency of finding a solution for it, not one of the speakers there made even an approach to suggestion for a solution of it.  In view of that, others may be forgiven if they have not found a complete solution for the problem.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very sure about it himself.  Deputy Hughes talked a great deal about the agricultural position.  He made the point that industrial development was proceeding at the expense of agriculture. That is not true, so far as my experience goes.  When the Deputy was speaking I thought of one town that I happen to know very well.  I have visited it often during the last 30 years. I know the conditions there very well. I refer to the Town of Wexford, of which Deputy Corish is mayor.  He knows the conditions there much better than I do.  I would say that the town of Wexford depends for its prosperity on the agricultural community around it.  It is situated in a highly developed agricultural district.  When there is work in that town the workers have money to buy the agricultural produce that is brought into it on market days.  So far as I know, the town of Wexford in recent years has been in a <Col N="499" /> prosperous condition, and the people there are able to pay good prices to the farmers for the milk, butter, eggs, poultry and so on, brought into it. There has been a considerable increase in the number of people employed in the industrial undertakings in that town, and, generally speaking, I think the workers have good wages.  If there was not employment in Wexford town, the farmers would be minus the money that is under the control of those workers to spend on agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>What is true of Wexford is equally true of other towns in the country that I know, towns like Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan.  I know that the number getting employment in those towns has been very much increased because of the industrial development that this Government has gone in for.  The increased moneys available to the workers are being expended on the agricultural products brought into those towns by the farmers from the surrounding districts.  Therefore, it is not true to say that the industrial development that has taken place in the country since this Government came into office has been at the expense of agriculture.  Of course it is true&mdash;I do not want to deny or conceal anything&mdash;that for certain items, such as agricultural machinery, boots, clothes and other things that the farmer has to buy, he has to pay something extra for these because of the protection policy.  But we cannot have it both ways.  If we are to have a protective market for the industrial worker, the whole country will have to pay for it.  In one way or another the whole country shares in the advantage that is being derived from that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton talked a great deal, as he always does, about agriculture.  He started his speech by making an eloquent appeal for greater and heavier expenditure on education, particularly with regard to agriculture.  That was the line taken by almost every Deputy. Each Deputy has his own hobby on which he wants more money spent while denouncing heavier expenditure on other items in which he is not interested.  But as regards his own <Col N="500" /> particular hobby, the Deputy thinks that there is not half enough money being spent.  The problem that faces any Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, is to try, according to his best judgment, to deal fairly with all interests concerned.  I think that education is being well looked after, at any rate from the point of view of the amount of money that is being spent on it.  Certainly, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, a great deal of money is being spent on education, so that I think appeals at the present time for greater expenditure on education will have to fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey used, as an argument to show that the country was declining in prosperity, the numbers in receipt of home assistance.  He did not quote the figures, but asked us to look them up for ourselves.  He said that the Budget was dishonest because it did not expose those figures and did not point out how the country was declining in prosperity possibly as a result of additional taxation.  I have looked up the figures dealing with home assistance.  They are taken from the statistical abstract.</P>
    <P>The number of persons in receipt of home assistance on the 31st March, 1932, was 90,724; the number on the 31st March, 1938, was 75,953; and on the 31st March, 1939&mdash;the last figures available &mdash; 81,070.  Whatever Deputy Morrissey may have had in mind, these figures do not show the enormous increase that he suggested had taken place.  The amount for outdoor relief and home assistance expenditure for the year ended 31st March, 1933, was £727,892, and for the year ended 31st March, 1939, £564,889.  The Deputy must have got hold of the wrong figures, because these are the figures taken from the Statistical Abstract for 1939.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell wanted to know what was the Government's policy in regard to housing.  Deputy Davin also dealt with that matter to-day, and Deputy Hurley on Friday last.  Our housing policy is the same that has been in operation since the 1932 Housing Act was passed.  We are anxious <Col N="501" /> to have all the people who are living in insanitary dwellings given decent sanitary and habitable homes.  There has been a decline in the number of new houses built in the last year or two.  That is not due to any attempt on the part of the Department of Finance to hold up either grants or credits from the Local Loans Fund for housing purposes.  So far as I am aware, no scheme has been put up to me as Minister for Finance this year which has been held up for one week more than was necessary for the ordinary examination of details.  All applications for loans from the Local Loans Fund that have come from the local authorities through the Department of Local Government have been dealt with as expeditiously as possible, and we are not holding up any grants or credits or loans for housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin this evening accused us of changing our policy on housing. Last year the amount set out in the Estimates for grants for housing was not used to the extent of over £200,000. Going on that basis, the amount that we put in the Estimates this year for housing is similar to the amount used last year.  If all that money is used, and there are any urgent demands for housing schemes, I shall be glad to hear of them, and they will not be held up, so far as I can prevent it, for want of money out of the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said it was not true that this Budget did not mean a heavy burden on the people.  He suggested that people in this House and outside were being fooled into believing that because the Budget imposed practically no additional taxation the burden therefore on the taxpayer was not heavy.  I did not say in introducing the Budget that the burden was not heavy. I did not hide the fact that heavy additional taxation was put on last November and was being carried on in this Budget.  I said earlier that I do not want to hide any figure from anybody. I do not want anybody to go away under the impression that there is not a very heavy burden of taxation being <Col N="502" /> borne by the people.  The money which we hope to get as a result of the adoption of this Budget will be considerably over £1,000,000 more than last year.  I would be better pleased if every taxpayer fully realised what he is paying and also what value he is getting for the money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy described the situation as perplexing and disturbing.  It is that.  Not alone from the Budget point of view, but from the wider point of view to which I referred in my opening remarks, the situation is serious.  I think it was Deputy Hannigan asked if the Minister could give a guarantee that there would be no Supplementary Budget this year.  I hope there will be no necessity for anything of that kind. I hope that we shall be allowed to carry on without any interference, without any crisis of any kind coming upon us during the remainder of the financial year; that we shall be able to make ends meet; and that the amount for which we are asking in this Budget will carry us through to the end of the financial year.  Nobody, however, can foretell, in the troubled condition in which the greater part of the world is at present, what may happen.  Let us hope that in six or 12 months' time we can be as carefree in the discussion of our domestic problems as we are to-day.  Generally speaking, we seem to be taking things very lightly, talking with an air of unreality, when we consider what is happening all round us.  Let us hope that nothing will happen to shake us up and make us any worse financially, economically or nationally than we are at present.</P>

      <P>On the last day, I dealt with the futility of the migration scheme as it is being carried out at present.  I shall now deal with a few outstanding cases which have cropped up in the last few years and which the Minister has overlooked or else refused sympathetically to consider.  The Connolly case has been cropping up here for the last three years.  The Minister for Lands at the time gave us more or less a guarantee that he would investigate the case and, if anything could be done, that he would do it. The case stands as it did three years ago when this widow lost her large farm and never got even £1 for it. That was a case of absolute confiscation. She had a married nephew living in the same house and this man has made repeated applications for a farm in the vicinity to compensate for the land which he should have got when the farm was taken off his aunt.  He has got no consideration and it looks as if he will get none.  I ask the Minister to let us know how the case stands and if any justice is to be done to the widow or her nephew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dunshaughlin area, another case has arisen in connection with a man who, through no fault of his own, got into trouble with the banks and happened to go down.  The farm was taken over by the Land Commission for division, and this man was not even considered by the Land Commission, although he had a wife and family. To-day his farm is divided up, and he is living in some place in Dublin, while his wife and children have to live in London.  They cannot maintain a home because they have no means.  It was very unfair that the Land Commission did not consider this man's case, because, when he was living in Dunshaughlin and doing well, he gave good employment and worked his farm in a very good manner.  The house which he occupied is now being used as stables for the migrants from the West. In justice to that man, he should have got an economic holding on his own farm, and it was mean of the Land Commission not to consider his claim. New houses have been built for the migrants, and the house which this man occupied&mdash;a good two-storey house <Col N="506" />&mdash;has been turned into stables for them.  I ask the Minister to state, even at this late stage, why Mr. Fagan, of Dunshaughlin, was deprived of a holding on his own estate.  He fell on bad times, but the bad times were not his fault, and the same thing happened to a great many people.</P>
    <P>Where the sons or relatives of evicted tenants are reinstated in the holdings of their ancestors, they are not entitled to the same facilities as migrants. Surely, they should be fixed up with a plough, a cow and a sow, the same as the migrants.  When these people are re-instated, it is very unfair to have opposite them men who are not the descendants of evicted tenants, but who get all the facilities for the making of proper farmers, while they do not get any such facilities.  They should get the same facilities as the migrants, now that they have been reinstated by a native Government.</P>
    <P>In my county a big problem is looming up for this Government or the next Government.  That is in connection with the new so-called economic farms, given out in the last six or seven years. What is to be done with them?  In some cases the people are living in the houses.  In other cases nobody is living in the houses, and the grass is growing at the doors.  In many cases, the new tenants have not a penny in their pockets and have no outlook, economic or otherwise.  They are trying to get work on the roads and under relief schemes.  What is to be done with these holdings?  They are an eyesore, and something should be done about the matter.  Is the Minister going to put these people out of these houses or is he going to give them facilities to work the land?  I myself am definitely against any new form of eviction in these times, and I think the Minister should investigate some of these cases and see if anything can be done to provide them with some little stock.  It is terrible to see that land in its present condition.  Some of it should never have been given out in the haphazard way it was to men without a penny in their pockets.  We all know that these farms were given to true and loyal members of the Fianna Fáil clubs.  That is definitely why they <Col N="507" /> got them.  There is no use in saying that that is a lie, because we know it definitely.  In the same areas there were farmers' sons with £200, with farm implements and with the help of their fathers' horses and ploughs, and they were denied even an acre of land. Farmers' sons who had been taking land on the eleven months system for a number of years, and who were thriving, would not be considered for these holdings while, right beside them, &ldquo;derelict&rdquo; men, some men who drank out the little farms they had, because they were loyal and true to the clubs, obtained farms.  They were &ldquo;derelict&rdquo; before they got the land, and they have not a penny now and have no outlook.  Many of these men are working on the public roads, while unfortunate men who have no land have to be denied work on these roads. An investigation is very badly needed in my county in connection with this state of affairs.  The man who has got an economic farm from the Government should either work the farm or get out.  If he is not to get out, the Minister should provide him with facilities so that he can work the farm. At present, the position is a public scandal and a national loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Estimate of the Department of Lands, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the whole problem of land settlement in this country in conjunction with the question of competition on the part of others who are exporting agricultural produce.  Land settlement and land division have been accepted by both sides of the House as inevitable policy.  The Opposition differ from the Government as to the value of land division only in degree, and not as a matter of principle.  Enormous quantities of land have changed hands in the past 20 years and, perhaps, in discussing any Estimate for the service of lands, we should consider whether the effect of land division does not require further examination of the whole position of the small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hard fact that we have to face is this, that our competitors in agricultural exports represent two types of <Col N="508" /> agricultural organisation.  The first type consists of farms getting larger and larger every year, more and more mass production, more and more factory products for the purpose of production and an organisation of marketing which is operated in the most scientific manner possible.  One might take, for example, the large farm system in England and New Zealand. In New Zealand the farms are no less than 1,000 acres and the farming operations are carried out by machinery. Of course, there is a very large number of agricultural labourers employed and the system is entirely different to the system here.  In contrast we have another type of rival, such as a country like Denmark where the holdings have been constantly decreasing in size since the beginning of the century.  The vast majority of the holdings are small and there again you see developing with the growth of the small farm the most intense co-operative system in marketing.  They found that necessary in order to overcome the increased cost of production arising from small farms.</P>
    <P>In order to overcome their difficulties they found it essential to combine together for marketing purposes, for the purchase of raw materials, for the production of certain kinds of crops and for the distribution of those crops in the various markets.  As a result, the Danish farmer who might suffer through having a 30-acre farm and the consequent inability to use machinery of his own, shares machinery with other farmers, and he makes a profit on his bacon up to the time it goes on board ship bound for some other country owing to the fact that he has shares in the bacon-curing establishment which cures his bacon.</P>
    <P>We who have decided on the small farm policy must face the fact that our successful rivals who have been improving at our expense for many years have adopted one of these two systems and the position is that we are continuing to provide enormous quantities of land without examining at the same time the question of the organisation under which the farmers, who are going to take over the small farms, operate. I do not think we have examined sufficiently <Col N="509" /> that all-important question.  I believe it is a problem that cannot be deferred very much longer.</P>
    <P>Why should we be the exception in the entire world in so far as our methods of export are concerned?  Is there anything in this country which can enable us to say that, although every rival of ours either has small farms with intense co-operation or large farms with intense machinery development, we can go on without either of these systems; that we can develop in our own peculiar way; that there is something remarkable in our produce or our cost of production or our method of living which enables us to avoid escaping those conclusions that other countries have come to?  I am speaking of a long-term problem. We have been going into this land position for many years.  It is time to reconsider the whole matter.</P>
    <P>If one examines the question of how our cattle population has fared in past years on large and small farms, one finds that apparently the small farmer has not yet been able to advance as quickly as the large farmer in respect to the number of beasts maintained on his land.  To give one example, I might mention that in the period 1912-1931 there was an increase of 16 per cent. in the number of pigs in this country, but there was an actual decrease in the number of pigs on farms of less than 30 acres, whereas there was an increase of 86 per cent. on farms of over 200 acres.  These figures are symptomatic of our animal population, and they deserve serious consideration, having regard to the fact that we are going in for the small farm policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to indicate that the small farm policy, in the light of the present world competition, demands consideration as to whether there should not be some form of organisation accompanying it.  That leads me to my principal point.  Would the Minister envisage the possibility of making an inquiry into the social and economic results of the different types of land division which have been carried out to date in this country, taking them in their different forms &mdash; the additions to uneconomic holdings, the creation of new holdings and the creation of migrant holdings?  Would he consider it advisable at this stage, having regard to what is going on around us in the world, making an examination into the degree of migration in areas where there has been land division on a large scale, before and after land division; the number of persons forced to leave farms in those areas now as compared with the preland division period; such matters as the total number of stock kept on the farm now as compared with the preland division period, and a general social inquiry into the results of land division?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own belief is that there would be what might be described as a mixed bag.  It would be found that much good had been achieved and, on the other hand, that there was much left to be done.  I believe the general conclusion would be that the Department of Lands, in its efforts to promote land division, should make an effort to promote co-operation, a matter which, I understand, has long been under discussion by this and the last Government. In other words, in order to help the small farmers to compete in world markets, particularly those who have for the first time entered into possession of their land, they should have given to them opportunity for co-operation. If we are going to go on competing in foreign markets, we cannot long delay that decision.  Has the Minister ever considered the possibility of an inquiry of that kind?  We all accept the necessity for land <Col N="511" /> division.  We believe in it, for one reason or another, looking at the world in its present state, and the question is, are we doing all we can to enable our people to export to a greater degree, particularly at the end of this world conflict?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested and slightly amused at the last speaker's method of approaching this problem. Quite obviously he approached it with the urban or city mind.  He had no regard whatever for what is a big matter in Irish rural life&mdash;namely, the sentiment that attaches to the land. Whether it is good or bad for this country, people settle down on the land to stay there.  If the times are good, their circumstances are improved; if the times are bad, the men on the land will tighten their belts, but they will hold on.  They have a land sentiment; the home is their home; it was their father's home, and their grandfather's home, going back for generations, and they refuse to be disturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it was this Government or the previous Government or the Government prior to that, that again was the attitude to the question of compulsorily acquiring land and dividing it amongst allottees.  But that does not prove that that was a good policy for the nation.  I do not belong to the landed gentry of this country.  I am the son of a small farmer, and I am viewing this from the purely detached national standpoint.  Whether it is this or the previous Government's attitude to the policy of acquiring land when and where they like, I must say this&mdash;that some Government will have to sit down, reconsider the position, and ask themselves what credit can attach to the land if a Land Commission inspector may come down in the morning and say: &ldquo;I will take over this land, divide it amongst A B C and D, and give £x for it even though that £x may not be enough to pay the mortgages on the land at the time.&rdquo;  What result will follow from that?  Only one result, and that is a result that everybody who gives any thought to the economic and credit position of this country now is aware <Col N="512" /> of&mdash;namely, that there is no credit in land at the present time.  A farmer of 100 acres of land will not get credit up to £100 for it now.  On his own initiative and record and other securities and on his own character he may. But land is no security for any bank. Any bank will tell anybody who is further interested in the matter that that is so.  The general policy of this Government is to take land anywhere and divide it up.  I presume I am entitled to criticise that policy, and to go back into the history of it.  The British Government never took a farm for sub-division from the ordinary farmer.  They only took untenanted land.  The ordinary farmer was never touched, though that was strained a little bit in the schedule of the congested counties.  Outside the congested counties the land of the ordinary farmer was never touched.  No one ever thought of acquiring it.  A departure from that policy was a great loss to agriculture; it spoiled this country as a whole when that principle was violated.  One of the famous principles of the Land League&mdash;Fixity of Tenure&mdash;went the day that principle was departed from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>These are general principles and general policy, and now we come to the administration.  If the Land Commission want land they can get it in any county in Ireland.  Generally speaking, they can get land nearly in every parish if they go into the parish and pay the market prices for it.  Why should they not pay the market prices for the land?  Why do they not go to the auctioneers' books and buy land from the auctioneers at market prices?  They will not.  They are not buying land.  They are confiscating land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know, but I would like to hear from the Minister what their policy is when selecting allottees.  I take it they start and strip up land, make fences, build houses, and hand over the whole thing as a going concern <Col N="513" /> to men who, as far as I know, have shown no aptitude in the way of farming.  I am aware of that state of affairs, and I know as much about it as anybody else.  The men who get these Land Commission farms get the whole of the property for nothing.  Who respects anything that he gets for nothing? It is not in human nature to do so.  These men do not put their backs into the working of the land in the way a man does when he has put his own money into a farm or into a business.  If these men do not like the farm they turn round after a while and sell it.  If they get only a £5 note for the whole outfit, it is a £5 note for nothing.  We were told by the Minister that it costs £950 to fix up allottees. First of all, the Land Commission destroys the credit of the State by taking the land from the original owner at a confiscatory price.  Then they give the land to a man who has no aptitude for working it.  You put State property in his hand.  You give him £950 worth of land.  Who would give £950 of his own money for 25 acres of land anywhere? Nobody outside Grangegorman Mental Home would do it. Why, if we are going to have a sub-division of land, not acquire that land in the open market?  As it is, we acquire that land at practically whatever price we offer.  Why does the Land Commission, with, I suppose, the sanction of the Minister and the Government, acquire, say, 100 acres of land and divide it into four farms of 25 acres each?  These farms cost, let us say, £500 a farm.  Why do not the Government and the Land Commission say to any prospective allottee who comes along, &ldquo;That land has cost the State £500 or £600; we will give it to the allottee who we think is capable of working it provided he puts down £200 of his own money.&rdquo;  That is what we say to the men who are trying to buy their own houses.  Even the State has already dried up in carrying through that operation of advancing money for houses.  They did help private citizens to buy their own houses.  Why did the State advance £800 to the man who wanted to buy his own house?  They did it so that the man would have an interest in his own <Col N="514" /> house, and his own money would be safe.  If the Land Commission did the same thing in the matter of farms, a better interest would be taken in these Land Commission farms, and people would make a better effort to make a success out of them.  On this business the Land Commission has been losing. But if they insisted on the man who was getting the land putting down some of his own money first, instead of this operation being a loss it would be run to the advantage of the State and show a profit.  I cannot understand any Department or any Government in its sound senses handing over, to people who have no qualifications, valuable farms of land.  I could show the Minister several allottees who had no qualifications for land, and yet these valuable farms were given to them at a great loss to the State.</P>
    <P>The question of mixing up farming with an alleged attempt to propagate Irish in the Midlands is so ludicrous that one would hardly believe it only they know it to be true.  I submit that loss should be borne by the Vote for Education.  Do the Government think it good policy to bring men into the County Meath for the sake of the Irish language?  The Government have given them farms, set them up in houses, given them furniture, hens and chickens, and 30/- a week for a year. Are not the people of the country being robbed by that policy?  Is not a policy of that kind as much robbery of the public purse as the robbery of the community of £500 by some fellow this morning?  What good is it going to do?  Deputy Childers spoke in very general terms.  I was waiting to see if he would come down to earth.  He did not, because, I suppose, like the parachutist, he did not know where he was going to land.</P>
    <P>We talk about increased food production. Are you going to get that from these small farmers?  If agriculture in this, as in other countries, is to hold its own, it must keep pace with the advances in the science of production. Does anybody who knows anything about agriculture suggest that you can produce cheap food on a 25-acre farm and give the owner of it anything but slave conditions?  Sir <Col N="515" /> Antony MacDonnell, on one occasion, gave a definition of an economic holding with which, I am sure, the Minister is familiar.  He said that it depends not so much on its size or valuation as on its position with regard to the track of trade.  I know men who are living on a couple of acres in a specially favoured position in the County Dublin, and they are making a comfortable living for themselves.  There is a community of over 2,000 of them living comfortably, entirely out of their holdings which, on the average, do not exceed two acres.  But they are in a distinctly favourable situation as regards the type of land they hold, in their proximity to a great market, and above all, in the tradition of technical skill that they possess as regards the working of that land.  But, taking the country as a whole, that does not apply.  The breaking up of alleged ranches of 100 or a couple of hundred acres into 25-acre farms will create for this Government, or for any Government that attempts it, not perhaps a problem for to-day, but one for the future.  Where is wheat going to come from off a 25-acre farm?  How is it to be tilled, except by the primitive method of spade and shovel?  A pair of horses would eat all that would be produced on that farm.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of breaking up good grazing land in counties like Meath and Westmeath.  You have in these two counties some of the best grazing land in the world.  In a particularly favourable year you might be able to till it, but it is such stiff land that it would be very difficult to cultivate it in a wet season.  The land in these two counties provides a market for the store cattle raised in the West. Therefore, if you break it up, you may be destroying a very valuable asset. The Minister and his Department are very partial to migration.  I have no hostility to migration, but, speaking for my own constituency, I cannot see why a man, whether he is a congest or a landless man outside the County Dublin, should have prior claim to a parcel of land in this county over a County Dublin landless man.  Speaking from the national production point <Col N="516" /> of view, no man can farm the land of a county better than the man who has been trained to farm in that county. I can speak from a dual experience.  I speak, not as a County Dublin man, but as one who has farmed in a small way and in a big way in this county.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if a man comes to this county to farm, full of the knowledge that he knows farming conditions here, there is nothing surer than that he will fail.  The land in the County Dublin, the nature of it, marketing conditions and everything else have got to be learned, so that if a man starting to farm here is so ignorant that he does not know his own ignorance of the agricultural conditions prevailing in the County Dublin, he will surely be a failure.</P>
    <P>Those are the people that the Minister is proposing to transplant to the County Dublin, and to crush out County Dublin men.  I, as a County Dublin representative, want to enter my protest against that.  Also, as a County Dublin representative, and as the son of an evicted tenant in the plan of campaign days, I want to enter my strong protest against the treatment of the Boylan family in Rush by the Land Commission.  I hope that I am not too late to secure for that family their last request.  They were evicted out of their farm 50 years ago. The Land Commission have just divided it.  They refused to give the Boylan family one inch of it.  The family's last request is that they should get the old house in which they were born.  They are prepared to buy it.  I want to put it to the Minister and to the Land Commission that if they refuse that request it is one which, in my opinion, even Clanricarde himself would not have refused.  The family offered to buy the farm back, but the Land Commission would not sell it to them.  They have given it to somebody else&mdash;to strangers&mdash;for nothing.  The statement has been made by the Land Commission&mdash;I say it is not true&mdash;that the Boylans have not got the money to work the land if they got it.  I can guarantee that they have.  That was guaranteed to the Land Commission, but the family's request has been turned down.  I hope <Col N="517" /> the Minister will take a note of that. I hope that if the land cannot be saved for the Boylan family that the house and some of the paddocks around it will.  This family was evicted out of over 100 acres nearly 50 years ago when the six or seven members of it that survive were mere children. My recollection of Irish politics has been that every popular movement in this country always put the reinstatement of the evicted tenants in the foremost place in its platform.  I know that the present Government have not been backward in making that claim in their political programme, and I now ask them to put it into practice and reinstate the Boylan family.</P>
    <P>I have had a large experience of agricultural workers, and I can say that the agricultural worker in County Dublin has no peer in the labour ranks in Ireland.  An agricultural worker can be given a pair of horses and told to plough or till a field.  He need only be told the field that he is to go into, and he will do it.  He is a good worker and a good timekeeper.  He will, of course, make you keep to your bargain and he can fight for his rights; he has fought for them both with me and against me.  Now, when land is being divided in County Dublin, these men are being turned down and the land is being given to strangers.  What claim has a congest from any other county with five or six acres of land which is superior to the claim of the agricultural worker who has worked all his life in the County Dublin?  I cannot see how the congest has a prior claim to that land.  If there is to be any comparison made, the man who has no land should have a prior claim to the man who has a little land.  The agricultural worker knows how to work that land.  I will guarantee to the Minister that I will get local agricultural workers to take any land that will be divided in County Dublin.  If he puts the cost to the State on the parcels of land, I will guarantee that I will get agricultural workers in County Dublin who will put down 20 per cent. of the cost to the State and work the land.  They have done it at Fieldstown.  Why then is the Minister <Col N="518" /> going to other counties and bringing people to County Dublin?  I hope he will reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>Recently I have been invited to meetings in County Dublin with other Deputies, and I hope these other Deputies will get up and repeat what I am saying, because our unanimous expression of policy at these meetings was that we were opposed to this migration into County Dublin until there were no County Dublin people able and willing to take land and work it.  I will go further than any conditions required by the Minister.  I will guarantee that it will be an economic transaction for the Land Commission, and that it will cost them nothing to divide the County Dublin lands they have in hands amongst <i>bona fide</i> agricultural workers in County Dublin; that they will put down 20 per cent. of the cost to the State, and pay the remainder in terminable annuities.  I hope the Minister will reconsider his policy in that matter.</P>
    <P>I know it has been reported to the Minister that certain officials dealing with the division of land in the County Dublin have not been acting fairly.  I make no such allegation.  I mention it only for the purpose of disassociating myself from any such allegation.  Any time I ever went to the Land Commission I found them ready and willing to answer all inquiries in a courteous manner, and it would not be fair that the impression should go out that I attended a meeting where any official was criticised.  I am quite satisfied that the officials carry out their orders. I know that when I was an official I had to carry out my orders.  It is because I did not carry them out that I am not an official now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers talked about some system of co-operative marketing being worked side by side with land division. Co-operation amongst the agricultural community in this country has never been a signal success and I do not think it ever will, because, temperamentally, we are not co-operators.  If the sub-division of land is persisted in, how are we to deal with the problem which will be created by a lot of small holdings competing in a world where <Col N="519" /> food is being produced by mass production?</P>
    <P>Even in a broken season, so long as a tractor is kept in condition it can be kept going.  In good weather you can make the most of it and in a day you can do more work with it than an army of men can do by primitive methods. If we are going to produce corn in this country, I see nothing for it but the mass production method.  It cannot be done otherwise, unless you go back to the days of potatoes and salt and buttermilk and then burn the land to get manure.  We must face modern conditions and consider our competitors. Our competitors in wheat growing are tillage ranchers and we must try and adopt their methods.  If we are to grow corn successfully, we will have to adopt their methods.  I am not arguing that we should grow it, that is another matter altogether.  But if we are not going to till, what living can anybody make out of rearing live stock on a 25-acre holding?  The thing would not bear ten minutes consideration. If anybody is going to live out of a 25-acre holding, he must cultivate it.  It is so small, that economically he can only cultivate it by primitive methods.  Are we going to go back to these primitive days?  I do not say that that is the policy of the Land Commission, but it is an agricultural development inherent in the sub-division of land.  I would like to see an attempt made to have community farming.  It seems to be the only way out, but before it starts I may say that I do not believe it will ever be a success here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Deputy lecture Deputy Dillon about that. Perhaps he will learn something from him.  Inherent in all Irish farmers is the feeling of being independent.  I do not know that community farming would suit this country.  I should like to see it tried.  It is the only system of farming, if it were successful, that would enable small holdings to be worked economically and face world <Col N="520" /> competition.  I do not know whether the community on a communal farm would agree very well.  I do not think they would, because the implements would belong to nobody in particular, and when a fine day came everyone would want them&mdash;the fellow with the best &ldquo;pull&rdquo; would get them, while the fellow with the least &ldquo;pull&rdquo; would be late with his work, and would get them on a wet day.</P>
      <P>The overhead charges on land are altogether too heavy.  They would weigh heavily on small holdings.  That would be a question for the Department of Agriculture and not for the Department of Lands.  For the security and for the credit of the State, I believe that any man who works his farm, big or little, and who pays his way, should not be disturbed.  He should have as much security in his land as any manufacturer or shopkeeper has in his business.  It is for the Minister for Agriculture to frame agricultural policy.  He can attune farmers to that policy, and can deal with them whatever way he chooses.  A man who owns land, who inherited it or bought it in the market, should not be disturbed.  If the Government is given power to disturb farmers, quite obviously there will be no credit in land, and when there is no credit in an industry it cannot prosper.  If there is one thing more than another that has agriculture in a parlous position to-day, when it is not able to face the present emergency, it is want of credit. That has been the most potent factor in destroying agricultural prosperity, and the sooner it is changed the better. If the policy I am advocating were adopted, and if the Land Commission were given power to buy land in the market, they could buy it in competition with Deputy Corry or anybody else who wanted it.  There are plenty of people anxious to sell land quietly, and they could go to the Land Commission and perhaps make a bargain. Plenty of land could be got in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When land is divided, why should any man be set up in industry or in agriculture at the expense of the State? Whatever the cost, the allottees should <Col N="521" /> bear a portion of it.  You will get industrious farmers' sons and agricultural workers to put down a deposit if they get land, and they will work it.  Allottees can be got for every acre of land divided.  The present policy is too expensive. There is too great a loss to the State.  When there is not an investment by the individual concerned, he has not the same interest in it that he would take even if he only put £20 of his own money down.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the fencing policy that is being followed.  At present a dyke is dug and a clay ditch is made and planted with whitethorn quicks.  I am paying men to level such ditches.  Has it ever been computed how much land on 25 acres is wasted in hedges and dykes?  That work is at present given out to contract.  Why should not the allottee do that work himself?  Thousands of men would be glad to get 25 acres and to make the fences.  If people do not take that much interest in the land they are getting, what interest will they take in paying annuities or in becoming good farmers?  I think the policy of the Land Commission as regards the acquisition of land is injurious to the credit of the State because it destroys the credit in land.  I hold that it is not making for good farming, or good crofters, to give people land for nothing, and to make the State foot the bill for all the expenditure, as well as free grants to allottees.  Some percentage of the total expense of holdings given by the State should be put up by allottees.  Any allottee who is really serious about making a success of his plot will pay up.  I know the farm labourers in the County Dublin, and I guarantee that from their ranks I would get men to put down whatever amount the Land Commission would fix up to 20 per cent. of the entire cost if they got land, and, further, I would guarantee that that land would be worked.</P>
    <P>I would like the Land Commission to take into consideration the fact that the best type of people to plant on the land are those who have been working it, particularly the land in their own county, and who have a few spare <Col N="522" /> pounds and are prepared to invest them in the future holding.  I suggest that for the serious consideration of the Land Commission.  I also suggest that the landless men in any county are better entitled to any slice of land that is going in that county than any congests or landless men from outside counties.  As far as County Dublin is concerned, from what I heard I hope for the peace of the county that no migrants will be brought in.  I did not hear that from publichouse birds, but from hard-working agricultural labourers.  At a recent meeting at which such sentiments were expressed the chairman was a farmer and a supporter of the Government.  He came from County Tipperary, and with his money he bought a farm here.  There is no objection to a man doing that in this or in any other county.  He did not come to look for anything. Neither did he get it for nothing.</P>
    <P>I make a special appeal not only in the case that I mentioned, but on behalf of evicted tenants.  Genuine representatives of evicted tenants should not be turned down for parcels of land anywhere, if only as an indication that we have not forgotten the wounded soldiers of the land war.  I include in the appeal not only direct representatives, but the children of those who were evicted 40 or 50 years ago.  At least they should be given the old homesteads in which they were born, and that belonged to their families for generations.  I think that there is just time to save it, and I hope that the Minister and the Land Commission officials, if any of them are listening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what the policy of the Land Commission <Col N="523" /> is regarding land division.  They have adopted a new policy in my constituency. There they have been acquiring land and letting it on the 11-months system.  The Land Commission are themselves the biggest culprits in that regard.  Last January, I protested against the Land Commission advertising the letting of land on the 11-months system.  The reason for their action was not that there was an insufficient number of suitable applicants. I do not know what the reason was, but, as a result of the Land Commission setting the land by public auction, large farmers were able to outbid the small farmers, thus encouraging men who said on many occasions that they had no desire to live in this State. One large estate of 400 acres, following the example of the Land Commission, dismissed ten or 12 of their employees, holding that they could let their lands on the 11-months system when the Land Commission was doing so with their lands.  That estate is holding up the employment of 100 men from the urban areas.  The landlord or trustee is an absentee, and the estate is managed by solicitors and agents in Dublin.  They are objecting to giving a public body a few acres of that land for the purpose of making a road by the sea.  There are two adjoining farms containing over 900 acres, and only three men are employed on them. At the same time, they have held up the making of this road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an Agricultural Wages Board, and, under the regulations of that board, the small farmers and the large farmers have to pay a wage of from 30/- to 32/6.  The Land Commission are side-tracking the Act of Parliament.  They are employing men from the labour exchange on a 30, 32 or 40-hour week, and they are paying them only 27/- or 28/-, instead of allowing them to work the full 54-hour week and receive 32/6.  The Land Commission in Wicklow are playing up to the landlords instead of giving encouragement to the small farmer who keeps his men working during the winter.  On these large estates they employ men only by the hour in winter.  Then they pay only a small <Col N="524" /> rate of wages.  Does the Minister propose to take any action in connection with these big ranches employing only three men?  I am not particular whether those who get the land come from Connacht or elsewhere.  I have no objection to anybody getting land provided he is an Irishman.  I should prefer to see any Irishman getting a livelihood on these lands to seeing absentee landlords holding these big tracts.  I would not care whether the men came from Galway, Donegal or elsewhere. There will be enough land for them, while providing for the people in Wicklow who desire land.  There are only three men employed on these large estates, to my own knowledge, and the employment of 100 men is being held up.  I did not like Deputy Belton saying that the landless men should not be provided with suitable assistance&mdash; a couple of horses or a cow.  Would it not be better to give assistance to these men on the land than to give subsidies to some of our industrialists who, because of bad management, render no return?  There is no objection to giving thousands of pounds to people in the cities for certain undertakings, and when large sums are lost there is no clamour, but a great cry is raised when it is proposed to give a few thousand pounds to unfortunate landless men who get holdings from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I mention this case so that the Minister will take serious notice of it and try to get the land inspected or divided.  The non-division of the land in County Wicklow is not due to lack of applicants, but is simply to give encouragement to the large farmer to acquire more land while not employing any extra labour.  Ten families were dispossessed on this estate, and not one man has been employed since then. On these two estates, over 500 acres are in possession of the Land Commission, and they should have some explanation to offer why these lands were put up by public auction after I communicated with them last January, protesting against this action.  We were not interested in any particular applicant, but we were satisfied that there were sufficient applicants to warrant the division of the lands.  The <Col N="525" /> Land Commission are giving encouragement to the absentee landlord to sub-let his land.  I hope the Minister will rectify the wrong done to the people in County Wicklow, and change his policy in connection with wages.  If a farmer has to pay 32/6 &mdash; which is the road workers' rate in the area&mdash;why should not the Land Commission pay the same wages?  Because unemployment prevails in the rural areas, the poor men concerned have no alternative but to accept the miserable 25/- or 27/- paid by the Land Commission for the lesser number of hours. That is bad example to give to these ranchers, and the Government should not give such example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has become very interesting, and it has taken a rather important turn, much more so than in previous years.  I think that is only proper, because I regard the Land Commission as one of the most important social services in this country. There are more people, genuine workers, genuine small farmers and labourers, whose hopes are centred in the Land Commission, than there are other sections of the community in relation to any other social service. My hope would be that the Land Commission, realising that, would spare no effort to make the department more active.  I had hopes, too, that the assistance of all Parties in the House would be given to the Land Commission, and that remarks would be directed, not towards criticising unduly or harshly the work of the officials of the Land Commission, which is very difficult, but towards encouraging in every way the people to stand in with the Land Commission in the awkward tasks they have to perform, trying to undo the work of Cromwell in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old score to be settled here, and the Land Commission is the one department, more than any other, whose duty it is to settle that score&mdash; to undo the work of Cromwell.  It will require assistance from public men, particularly when we hear the veiled threats of two Deputies, Deputy Giles and Deputy Belton, about opposition <Col N="526" /> to the social schemes of the Land Commission, and it will require the assistance of sensible Deputies of this House, Deputies interested in the people, to enable the Land Commission to carry out their work and make it a greater success than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission did come to a decision after the start of this war that they would, to some extent, curtail their services so far as the acquisition of land is concerned.  I hope they will find it possible at an early date to change that decision and start again with the acquisition of land on a large scale.  There are big areas in every county waiting to be taken over by the Land Commission.  The people know that the land will be acquired, and must be acquired, for the relief of congestion.  It is land that is not being used to its full capacity for various reasons, the principal reason being the knowledge, which must be in the minds of the present owners, that the land will at some stage be acquired by the Land Commission.  It is a waste of the soil to leave it in its present condition and I hope that the Land Commission will very soon decide to go ahead again with acquisition work. This country can afford to go substantially into debt in order to acquire land for the people, to plant more people on the land, to acquire areas of land not now being used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>One other thing in which the Land Commission should engage is the resettlement of estates.  What Deputy Everett has referred to is happening all over the country, setting land on the 11 months' system until such time as a scheme would be prepared to settle the whole estate.  They are setting small parcels of land and they are becoming eyesores in every county.  These parcels of land in the possession of the Land Commission are let temporarily to adjoining tenants.  I think the Land Commission should devote more time to the resettling of estates and the improvement of the uneconomic holdings. They should endeavour to wipe out the rundale system that is in existence in parts of the country.  They should not wait, as is their custom, until the whole estate is ready for resettlement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> I believe that the most economic thing to do is to wait; I believe, in the end, that is the best system; but you must think of the people on whom this hardship is imposed while they are waiting for the resettlement of the estate; you must consider the loss that is incurred both by the State and the individuals while they are waiting for the resettlement.  I know places where people are living on rundale holdings. They are anxious to have improvement works carried out and they are anxious for a division of the land so as to give them an opportunity to work the new holdings and to take advantage of the housing grants.  In accordance with their custom, the Land Commission wait until they can deal with the whole estate.  They do not take into account the losses suffered by the people living in the mixed holdings, people who are unable, because of existing circumstances, to build decent, sanitary houses for themselves.  I think the Land Commission should consider introducing some remedy in this connection.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I would like the Land Commission to pay attention to, and that is the question of acquiring land.  When a case comes before the Land Commission Court you will find people who have never taken an interest in their land up to that time, except to let or set or waste it or let it go wild, taking a very great interest in their holdings.  They go before the Land Commission Court with a great case about what they are going to do if the land is left to them, and very often the court bases its findings on entirely false evidence.  I know cases where the Land Commission Court decided that they could not acquire the land because of the case made, and I know the case was absolutely false.  People who have not been using their land, and have no intention of using it, make up a case which is, on the face of it, good, and it is accepted by the court.  The land is left there, and having got the decision those people go back and cheer and jeer at the people around.  The people in the district then believe that the Land Commission have done them a wrong.  The land owners make no <Col N="528" /> better use of the land than they did before.  There are numbers of these cases in my county, and I am sure there are similar cases in other areas. I think the Land Commission inspectors should make more vigilant inquiries before the Land Commission Court is held, and they should endeavour to ascertain what evidence is going to be given by the party who has got so fond of the land when the time approaches for the case to go before the Land Commission Court.</P>
    <P>One thing I do not like being resurrected here is the case of the landless man.  Some Deputies on the Opposition benches have all of a sudden got very fond of the landless man.  They want the available land in every county to be divided amongst the landless men.  That is a bad policy, an unjust policy; it is purely a political ramp and nothing else.  Experience alone must have told those Deputies that it is not a workable policy.  If we take the county of Meath, and go into an examination of the holdings of land that were given there to landless men, and the use that is made of those holdings by the occupiers, no matter what their political colour&mdash;they were of all shapes, types and forms of political colour when it suited&mdash;an honest man must immediately condemn that policy of giving land to landless men.  I know it is a good political ramp.  I could say that same thing and be applauded on every platform I would choose to go on in my own county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Speaking for myself, and knowing the problem of congestion in my own and other counties, I hold, as every man must hold, that there are too many families on the land, and that an effort should be made to give those who have to live on the land economic holdings.  Do not be creating more land slums.  The policy must be to try to remedy the land slum <Col N="529" /> problem, and then if you have land left in Meath, Dublin or Mayo, by all means give it to decent respectable landless men who are anxious to get land and to work it.  Experience alone must have taught the Land Commission, as it certainly has taught Deputies in Meath and other counties, that the landless men who got land in the past did not work it.  I am now speaking generally.</P>

      <P>If the policy were to give land to landless men, it would mean putting more of that type on the land and leaving many deserving people to live in land slums.  There were recently 250 vacancies to be filled in the Gárda.  There were 15,000 applications from strong, able-bodied men off the land.  If the Land Commission were to give land to landless men, would you not have to-morrow 50,000 applications?  Who could say that they were not practical and able-bodied men who knew as much about the land as most of us Deputies do?</P>

      <P>These men could put up the money too.  Are we to attract all that, and raise the hopes of 50,000 men getting 50,000 parcels of land, leaving 50,000 families living in bog slums of three acres, five acres, or ten acres?  These families living on uneconomic holdings in the bogs are the very families for whom the Land Acts were passed.  It is for these that in the last 17 years the Land Acts introduced by the late Mr. Hogan were passed to remedy the condition in the land slums.  These were the land slums created by the &ldquo;crowbar brigades&rdquo; of the past.  It was to do away with these that Land <Col N="530" /> Acts were passed by the late Government and this Government.  They were passed to deal with that very pressing problem.  Can any Deputy stand up now and contradict that?  He can, if he is going to look at his own village, at his own parish, or at his own county. Of course, the Deputy who advocates the giving of land to landless men will get a great deal of cheers for it.  These men will shout to the house-tops for him, and say that he is a great man. But we here are not looking after villages, or parishes, or counties.  We are here to look after the State as a whole.  We should go into this great problem, not from the village standpoint, the parish standpoint, or the county standpoint, but look on it as a problem for the State as a whole.  The land belongs first and foremost to the State.  The remedy that is being preached now is a dishonest one, and Deputies know it is a dishonest one.</P>

      <P>I should if it suited them.  I can get 20,000 landless men in the County Mayo to applaud me if I cry out for land for the landless men, but I told these men that there were in Mayo 10,000 to 20,000 men living with their families on starved holdings and that they should be the first consideration. Will any Deputy think that taking John Burke from his father's home and giving him a holding of land, while leaving his father and four or five other families to struggle to get a living on a few acres of land can be of any advantage to the State?  Will it not be creating a second problem? The way to do it is to plant the holders that we have already on more economic holdings.  Then you will have rooted in the soil men with an interest in the soil, men who will cling to their homes. These men in their own way will make a great success of their holdings; they have already done so in my county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of the landless man is a big one.  We know the difficulty of dealing with this, particularly after the sad experience by the Land Commission of planting landless men in the County of Meath.  Side by side with <Col N="531" /> that we have the question of economic holders raised.  Deputies have talked about economic holdings; I always had doubts about what was meant by economic and uneconomic holdings; these doubts remained with me until the economic war came on. I then found that the people who first starved, or who said they did, and who had no use for the land at all, were the men with 100-acre farms.  It was the men on the 100-acre farm and the 200-acre farm and upwards who were the first to succumb. We then saw that most of these men were not able to stand the frost or more than one night of the big wind. They crashed right away after that. They tell us they are still down.  It is the men with 100-acre farms who are starving and who are not able to pay their rates or their annuities.  At all events, that has solved one little doubt that was in my mind as to what constituted an economic or uneconomic holding.  The man who worked his holding efficiently, who did not lose his head, whose holding was not big enough to make him lose his head, or put him off his head, was the man who survived.  The economic holding is not the 100-acre farm which a man can work at high power and at high tension.  The economic holding is really the small, compact farm.  You can start on the 25-acre farm, and I challenge Deputies opposite on that. Deputy Hughes would consider every holding uneconomic unless the man had his own team of horses and his own select type of stock.  At the same time, that Deputy gave a friendly wink to community farming.  We had community farming in the West all along. We have introduced community farming now to the County Meath to some extent, God forgive us.  A farmer does not need a team of horses.  If a man does not own a team of horses, his neighbour has a horse, and there is cooperation between neighbours.  Cooperative farming is better at any time than community farming.  Under cooperative farming two or three men may own one plough.  You do not require to give them a farm that will carry a team of horses and large numbers <Col N="532" /> of live stock.  That is not required. I am convinced that the most economic farm is the small farm.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy, who spoke a while ago, waits for a little time he may be more guarded in what he says.  As I have said, 25 acres of good land is a good holding.  It is just big enough to enable a man to produce a certain amount of food and to raise a certain amount of stock.  At the same time it will make him keep his nose to the ground.  He cannot afford to spend much of his time at race or dog meetings, or to become a Deputy, unless he has some other income. If we in the County Mayo had all our people on 25 acres of good land then I say we would have a good county.  We would not be ashamed to work it to produce food.  The question: &ldquo;Why do they not live on the land?&rdquo; has been put by a man who wants to make a case anyhow, whether it is right or wrong.  Can anyone tell me who is living on the land?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked: &ldquo;Who is living on the land?&rdquo;  Is it not a fact that by far the greater percentage of people on the land are those on small holdings?  Of course, an old bachelor can live on 1,000 acres.  He has not to go to England for three months of the year to earn money.  Suppose you have a man with a wife and six children on 1,000 acres of land or on 100 acres of land, the children, as soon as they grow up, must go out to earn for themselves.  They are the first to fly from the land, and the last to come back to it.  If you have on a holding, <Col N="533" /> no matter what size it is, a family of six, ten, 13 or even 15 children, as you have on many a small holding, it does not matter in what part of the country the holding is situate, the children, as soon as they are able, have to go out and earn for themselves.  Is not that the proper system?  There is only one member of the family who can remain on the farm and get married.  This question of the migrants was more bitterly attacked this year than ever before.  I would remind the House that it was the leaders and members of the Party opposite who practically initiated this migration scheme.</P>

      <P>It was not a success in Connacht, in Donegal, or in any of the other congested areas.  It was not a success so far as the greater number of congests are concerned, and it was in their interest that most of the Land Acts were passed.  The Party opposite are attacking the migration scheme now.  In the past, all Parties talked about migration and of the necessity for undoing the work of Cromwell. Practically all Deputies supported that policy in the past, but now we have two or three Deputies attacking the migration scheme because the village tub-thumper does not favour it.  Their policy, apparently, is to keep the landless men in Meath and subsidise them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would not be wrong at all.  It was the policy in the past.  It is those landless men who are loudest in their condemnation of subsidising the migration scheme.  Anyway, what is there that is not being subsidised now? What amount is being given, by way of subsidy, for this migration scheme compared to the amounts provided for other schemes?  The cry here has been that money is being thrown away on the migrants.  What about the £80 that is given for the building of a <Col N="534" /> house in the country where the valuation is under £15?  If one wants to put it this way, one could ask how many millions were thrown away on the Shannon scheme, a share of which was paid by the migrants, the labourers, and small farmers of the country. How many millions are being thrown away on subsidies, again, if one wants to put it that way, for beet schemes and other schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that it was thrown away, but what I do say is that, if one wanted to put it that way, one could ask: how many millions were given by way of subsidy for housing and for other schemes?  Complaint is now made because money is being provided to help put the sons of the soil on the land.  It is a crime now to do that, according to some of the Deputies opposite, but it was not a crime a few years ago, when subsidies were a popular thing.  They are unpopular for the planting of the people on the land.  The type of migrant has been attacked in the meanest possible way.  I can tell the House that the Land Commission officials take the greatest trouble to select the best type of migrant in the West of Ireland.  They have gone to greater pains in doing that than in picking landless men from the County Meath.  Some of the migrants who have gone to the midland counties are a credit to the county they were taken from and the county of which they now form a part.  After I had heard a lot of this talk about the migrants I paid a visit to some of the migrant colonies, and as a result of my visit I challenge any Deputy to criticise the migration scheme carried out by the Land Commission. Take any migrant on 25 acres of land in the County Kildare or the County Meath, and compare his farm and homestead with any 60 acre farm in the County Meath.  It will be found, if his rent and rate books are <Col N="535" /> examined, that the migrant is on the safe side.  The other man, I would venture to say, is a doubtful quantity. He is still going to the local town to buy his vegetables.  The migrant is producing vegetables on his own land.</P>
      <P>I am speaking now of migrants who have been put on holdings and not given wages.  As I have said, those men are a credit to the county from which they came and an ornament amongst the farmers in the county they are now residing in.  Those migrants have introduced a good standard of living in the districts in which they now reside.  They have introduced there a system of mixed farming.  They have eggs, butter and other farm produce to sell.  They have introduced a good class of cattle.  They are not borrowers and are not going to the local town for the dole.  On the occasion of my visit a few of them were getting ready to go to England.  Deputy Giles complains of that.  They had put in their crops and were going to England for two months.  I mean one member of the family was going.  He will come back with £40 or £50 saved.  It is better to see those people do that than see them follow the example of the Meath men of remaining at home hanging around the corners and finding fault with the Government because it is not giving them something.  Those migrants are an industrious people and will improve the standard of life in the counties they have gone to.  Anybody who looks at that scheme honestly and without any bias will admit that these people are making a success of their 25 acre farms. There was, of course, the suggestion that they were the outcasts of the counties from which they came. There was one statement made by Deputy Giles, about which I should like to hear more, with your permission, Sir, that a parish priest in Connemara wrote to a parish priest in County Meath explaining that the reason he got certain migrants to leave Connemara for County Meath was that he wanted to get rid of them anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what collusion there is between Deputy Giles and the parish priest of Meath who told him that or the parish priest of Connemara.  If there is any fault to be found with the migrant scheme, I do not think that either the parish priests of County Meath or Connemara should be dragged into it.  The parish priests and curates of Connemara and my own county have given every encouragement to the migrant scheme. But to my own knowledge any inspector who went to a parish priest for advice as to who should be migrated was advised as to the most industrious farmers in the district.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what authority Deputy Giles has for saying that a parish priest in Connemara had advised the Land Commission to take the outcasts&mdash;morally and otherwise, I presume&mdash;of his parish and place them in the County Meath.  Deputy Mongan is a member of his own Party who knows the particular parish priest from whose parish the migrants came that Deputy Giles has been blackguarding here, and I venture to say that Deputy Mongan would like an explanation from Deputy Giles as to the outcasts, morally and otherwise, that were sent by that parish priest to County Meath. We should like to have a little more authority for that statement if parish priests are to be dragged in in a most unmannerly way to back the arguments of Deputy Giles.  That appears in the Official Reports.  I take it that Deputy Giles is not going to go back upon it.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Giles is standing over it, I may say that there are people who will see further about it.  That particular parish priest from Connemara is not a man to lie down under a slander of that kind, and I do not think that Deputy Mongan is a man who will allow a parish priest to be slandered by the man who makes that particular case.  The Land Commission should proceed with their migration scheme.  It is the best hope that there is for the land problem in this country.  We have Deputy Giles criticising the Government because of <Col N="537" /> what he calls the crawling craven attitude of people in this country who are looking, as he says, for sops and doles. There is one remedy, and that is to place those people who live in congested areas, no matter in what county, on the land, on reasonable economic holdings.</P>

      <P>These people should be placed on the land.  That is the function of the Land Commission, and it is the policy of all Parties in this House. I read the other day a speech of the late Deputy Hogan in introducing the Land Bill of 1923, and I would recommend Deputy Giles to read that speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you must have let it in in one ear and out in the other. You pay lip-service to the late Deputy Hogan but you forget the policy which he preached when he introduced the Land Bill of 1923.  His policy was to clear out the land slums of the West. He started that policy.  Every member of the Party opposite, with very few exceptions, if any, have time and again approved of that policy of clearing out the land slums in the West.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>By that policy you will leave the country in a happier and better condition; you will give hope to the people who have been hoping, like their grandfathers were in the days of the Land League, that at some period they will be placed in reasonable security on the land.  That is the best hope for the country and there can be no efficient system of agricultural economy until it is done.  We have here the most unwieldy system of agriculture in the world.  We have the <Col N="538" /> 1,000-acre farms, the 500-acre farms, and the one-acre farms.  We can never have a balanced system until we have a reasonable number of people placed with reasonable security on the land and the people to place on the land are the people whose ancestors were for generations on the land.  If you put them on the land they will make a success of it.  They will not be depending on sops and doles.  You will give them pride in themselves and in their families and in their homes.  The Land Commission should not give any heed to the parish tub thumpers who now forget all they stated about the land problem, who forget the 1923 Land Act, who talk about keeping land in County Meath for County Meath people and land in County Dublin for County Dublin people, and who want to give everyone who shouts &ldquo;Up this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up that&rdquo; a holding of land, as they have done already.  The Land Commission should continue with their migration scheme and they will have the support of every Party in the House.  They should not heed those individuals who have an axe to grind, whether politically or otherwise.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Estimate, the Minister, I am sure, made a very comprehensive explanatory statement, but, unfortunately, there are quite a number of Deputies who could not follow that statement because it was made altogether in Irish.  I want to protest against the action of the Minister in introducing the Estimate entirely in Irish without circulating a translation of the statement to Deputies. It ought to be clearly recognised that not more than 10 or 15 per cent. of Deputies can follow a statement such as the Minister made in the Irish language. It is only just and reasonable that in a deliberative assembly such as this every member should be in a position to follow a statement made by a Minister.  For all some of us knew the Minister for Lands might have been outlining in his statement a policy for confiscating all the land in the Twenty-Six Counties.  He might have been outlining an entirely new policy, a communist or socialist policy, and none of us would have the slightest idea what his policy really was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can only judge by appearances.  The Minister appears to be a mild man and would not countenance anything that would be ridiculous. I am only quoting an extreme case, to show how a Minister might outline a policy which would not have the support of Deputies generally, but yet might be allowed to get through without protest, because they were not aware of what was meant.  It is only right that a translation of the Minister's statement should have been circulated.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of farmers who got into arrears in land annuities during the depressed period through which we have passed.  In many cases these farmers have been met fairly reasonably but, on the other hand, quite a number of them have been harshly treated, particularly the smaller type of farmers, upon whom heavy costs were imposed by handling the collection of the annuities over to the sheriffs.  I ask the Minister to review all cases of arrears, now that there is a prospect that agricultural conditions may improve and, wherever possible, to come to an agreement to spread the arrears over a few years to enable them to get out of debt.  That is particularly true of small farmers, and I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware there is very little reason for the compulsory acquisition of land in the majority of the Twenty-Six Counties.  I do not see any reason why compulsory powers should be exercised until all the land that is available for distribution has been dealt with.  I know that a number of holdings in my constituency and, I am sure, in other constituencies also, have been offered to the Land Commission from time to time, but have not been acquired.  I also know that a number of holdings acquired some years ago are not yet divided. While that is the position, there is no reason why the Land Commission should resort to compulsory powers. Many Deputies have referred to the size of the holdings created in the <Col N="540" /> division of land.  I have considerable experience of land division in my county, not only recently but for the past 20 or 25 years, and I assure the Minister that the best type of holding to create is one having a valuation of £30 or containing about 30 Irish acres. On such a holding the farmer can keep the necessary stock and have the necessary implements to work it independently.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the best type of farm is one that will support a farmer and his family in decency and in comfort.  I do not think that is the principle that should guide the Minister.  I think the principle should be to create a unit of land which is the most economic and in the best national interest.  A holding with a valuation of £30 or containing 30 Irish acres is one that would more than support one family.  That is a holding upon which a farmer could employ a worker all the year round, and it is likely to be more economically and efficiently worked than a holding upon which a farmer has to depend on the co-operation, or the kindness of neighbours for implements, horses and other requirements.</P>
    <P>I understand the point made by Deputy Cleary that there could be cooperation between two or three small farmers with regard to implements and horses, but I do not think that there would ever be on such holdings the same degree of efficiency as on holdings where the farmer was absolutely independent, and had his own stock and implements.  That class of farmer would not lose time going around to his neighbours to find out when they would be using implements that he required.  That is an uneconomic system of farming.</P>
    <P>The first principle that should guide the Minister is to create the most economic and efficient holdings, and that is the type upon which farmers would have the implements they required, and would be able to give employment.  On such holdings a farmer is not only a manual worker, but also an employer, so that he can appreciate the viewpoint of the worker and the employer.  For that reason he should be the best type of citizen.  The <Col N="541" /> Minister should take that suggestion carefully into consideration, because estates have been divided recently into holdings that are absolutely uneconomic. As a result there has not been any increase of efficiency.  I have experience of land divided 25 years ago into holdings varying from eight to 15 acres, amongst 15 allottees, and ten of these have disappeared.  They sold their holdings.  That shows that the policy of dividing land into small allotments is not economic, and in the best interests of the State or of the industry.  As to the question of suitable allottees for land, it is only right that first consideration should be given to uneconomic holders in the immediate vicinity.  Wherever there is an application from the previous owner of land it should receive first consideration.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a very glaring case where a farmer purchased a fairly large farm in 1920 for an exorbitant sum.  The cost was £2,100, but five years afterwards the place was only worth £700.  The farmer paid off £1,700 of the purchase money, but because he was unable to pay the balance the land was taken over and handed to the Land Commission and divided.  Although the man had paid £1,700 for a holding, which was eventually worth only £700, he was refused a small allotment.  His case has not yet been reconsidered.  Cases of real hardship like that should be given consideration by the Department.  Uneconomic holders in the vicinity should then receive consideration.  If there is more land available, landless men in the district, men who have a certain amount of capital, or agricultural workers or small farmers and their sons who have experience of working land should be dealt with.  These are the people to whom land should be given.  If that policy were pursued I do not think there would be any loss whatever to the community by the division of land.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like the Minister to realise that the period through which we are passing is one in which it may be possible for the agricultural community to contribute a great deal to the well-being of the <Col N="542" /> State&mdash;more, perhaps, than it was possible for them to do in the past. For that reason, I ask him, in the collection of annuities, particularly from the smaller farmers, to allow a certain period so as to enable these farmers to recover from the bad years through which they have passed, and from the climatic conditions which have obtained during the past couple of years.  If the Minister will bear these facts in mind and allow even a temporary respite to the small farmers, instead of imposing additional costs upon them, I am sure the problem of collecting annuities will right itself in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote is, I suppose, the most important Vote that confronts this House and, of its nature, that must have been so over a period of years.  We all know that the land problem has been attacked by various governments and various Acts.  We all know that practically all the powers taken through the years have proved insufficient to solve this problem.  We should appreciate by now that the land problem is one that must be attacked by some revolutionary means and that, if ordinary legislation, brought to bear on this question throughout the centuries, has now, after our experience, failed, we must, if we can, find some other means to finish the land slum-problem.  I divide the land problem as we know it into two main categories&mdash;the rearrangement of holdings and resettlement of the people on these holdings and, in the second place, the congestion problem.  The Land Commission have on their hands for a large number of years several holdings which they do not give out to the tenants for the reason that, they say, they have not enough land to settle the local problems.  I know some estates on which the Land Commission have held lands, which they resumed, over a 20 year period.  They are still letting out those lands on the 11 months' system, and they are getting nowhere with the problem.  If you approach the Land Commission they will tell you: &ldquo;We are waiting to get more land&rdquo; or &ldquo;we are waiting to migrate some people from that area, because the land in hands is not <Col N="543" /> sufficient to solve the problem.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister and the Department to divide any land they have.  It will solve nothing, and it will do no good to let out these lands on what amounts to rack-rents.  If they have not sufficient land to solve the problem in a particular area, let them give out what lands they have, and settle, at least, a few families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem of congestion affects really only about four counties.  If you take out the congestion problems of Mayo, Galway, Donegal and, possibly, Kerry, you have the land question virtually solved.  Those are the counties in which you have the greatest amount of congestion, and those are the counties which should be concentrated upon.  With an energetic land policy, there is no reason why it should take 200 or 300 years more to solve the problem of congestion.  In the constituency I represent, the problem of congestion is one of the most pressing in the country.  Even to tackle the outskirts of the problem, we would want to migrate, or otherwise provide for, 2,000 families in South Mayo.  This is a problem that will not be abated by small means.  It must be tackled as a national problem.  When, as a nation, we are prepared to spend huge sums on housing, by borrowing or otherwise, I think that, to solve this problem, we should, if necessary, be prepared to float a loan, which would be well repaid. We talk about slum problems in the cities, and about the danger of overcrowding.  We have a greater slum problem on the land in such areas as I represent than you have in any city. You have numbers of people, some of whom should have more sense, and a number of what I might call mutual admiration societies concerning themselves with what they call the &ldquo;flight from the land&rdquo;.  Does any Deputy hold that a farmer with ten children can provide for these children on a little farm of £2 valuation?  If anybody has any false ideas about the flight from the land, he should go down to constituencies such as that which I represent and he would be very soon disillusioned. There is a greater land-hunger problem now than ever there <Col N="544" /> was.  This business about the &ldquo;flight from the land&rdquo; is, to use an expression of Deputy Dillon, &ldquo;all cod&rdquo; as far as I can see, because it is impossible for people to maintain ten of a family on a farm on which it is not possible economically to support a single individual. When there are five or six sons in a family on a farm sufficient to support only one son, five or six of them must migrate in order to find employment.  They know that they have no future on that small piece of land.  They did not exist on that piece of land.  They existed through the sweat of their fathers' brows in the potato fields of Scotland, England and elsewhere, and on the earnings of the elderly members of their families who were transferred in the slave ships to other countries.</P>
    <P>We have a land problem that must be attacked as a major problem, and the migration of 50 or 100 people is not going to stop it.  Bigger methods must be adopted.  The only way out I can see for the problem of congestion is migration on a large scale.  I have listened to some Deputies talking about dividing up the larger farms in County Mayo.  The fact is that there are no large farms left in Mayo to be divided up.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggested that you should migrate people with 60 or 70 acres.  If the Deputy knew his own constituency, he should know that practically every farm of that size in South Mayo is already broken up, and that there is no land available which will solve any problem in South Mayo.  I was amazed to hear the Deputy express the views he did, representing, as he does, South Mayo.  I was particularly amazed to hear the Deputy tell the House that the people of Mayo were not able to farm their own lands and had never seen a plough.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am quite willing,&rdquo; the Deputy said, &ldquo;to believe that if the persons who have lived on farms in Meath and Kildare all their lives see these Connemara people coming up, men who have never held a plough in their lives, they will immediately scream with laughter at the amateurish efforts the Gaeltacht migrants are making.  That will last for some little time.  In my own <Col N="545" /> vicinity, in County Mayo, a large farm was broken up.  People were brought down from the Tourmakeady mountains and that neighbourhood to this farm, which is called Castlecarra.  Their neighbours used to collect on Sunday to laugh at the crooked &lsquo;scriobs&rsquo; where the poor man who was holding a plough for the first time was trying to plough.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be very amusing to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to laugh at the amateurish methods of his own neighbours, but I can tell Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that his own neighbours and the particular people to whom he refers on that farm at Castlecarra have proved themselves to be genuine farmers and better farmers than is the Deputy himself.  Their methods, he says, are amateurish.  The people about whom the Deputy talks saw more of farming in the farming districts of England, and learned more about it than many of the people in County Meath and elsewhere, who know very little about farming and who have proved that by coming into the local towns and villages to buy their vegetables.</P>
    <P>The Deputy objects to the breaking up of the grass lands of Meath and Kildare.  In the same debate he said: &ldquo;My objection to the breaking up of the grass lands of Meath and Kildare is the reaction it is going to have on the people in the West of Ireland. At present the main source of ready money of the small holder of £8, £10, or £12 valuation in the West of Ireland is the price he gets for his cattle.  He sells his cattle to somebody from Meath or Kildare to be finished.  He sells them as stores&mdash;at present he has to sell them as stores &mdash; and these stores are brought to Meath and Kildare and adjoining counties where they are fattened upon the grass.  If you break up the Meath farms entirely, you take away the principal market the small farmer has got for his stock....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy think that the whole basis of farming in County Mayo is for the purpose of sending stores to be finished in County Meath?  Does he suggest there never was any market in Mayo except that created by the few <Col N="546" /> Meath men who come down to buy our stores?  Surely the Deputy does not know the position that exists in his own market when he makes such a statement?  I was really amazed that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, whose opinion in regard to certain things I have had great respect for over quite a long period, and representing the constituency he does represent, should make such outlandish statements and expect people to swallow them.  We had markets in Mayo before ever we heard of County Meath.  During the economic war we proved that we were a people who were not affected by it; that we were the people who got off lightest with the type of stuff we produced or the type there was a market for, and we were not depending on the Meath people or anybody else in this country.</P>
    <P>There was also an argument made here for the landless man.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and other Deputies have made the case here that the migrants from Mayo and Connemara do not know sufficient about farming, and if you migrate them to holdings in Meath or Kildare, that they will not be able to farm economically, not knowing enough about it in Mayo.  If Deputies hold that argument seriously, how do they expect us to believe that landless men are going to make a success of it?  If there is no case to be made for the migrants from Mayo or Galway, men who have been brought up on the land and who have worked in England, Scotland, and elsewhere, how can anybody make a case for the landless man who knows absolutely nothing about land?  How can you expect him to make a success of it when the man bred, born and reared on the land is going to fail simply because of lack of knowledge of the farming methods in Kildare or Meath?  The first job the Minister and the Department will have to tackle is that of solving the congestion in those areas, and, if any land is left over after the congestion is relieved&mdash;and that is a problem that will take some time to solve&mdash;you can give that land to any person you wish.  But you must first tackle the vital problem.  You must relieve the congestion that exists in <Col N="547" /> areas such as we have in the constituency I represent.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I would like to draw the Minister's attention to, and it deals with the question of rearrangement. I view with alarm the taking of inspectors from the Land Commission for the purpose of carrying out the tillage scheme advocated by the Government.  I think there are other Departments that could better afford &mdash;although I must admit I do not know what the main qualifications would be &mdash;to send some of their inspectors to do this work rather than take those men from the Land Commission, particularly the men engaged in the country, I would like to point out to the Minister that a Land Commission inspector must be in a congested area for at least three years before he is capable of putting through a rearrangement system satisfactorily.  It is a very technical and difficult problem, because when a man has to go into an area in which one farmer has his land in about 20 different stripes, and has to decide the question of rearranging that for him, taking a piece from one farmer and giving it to another, trying to satisfy every farmer in the village, it is no easy task.  It is more or less a special problem in itself, and experience has proved that a young man coming down from the city, or an inspector serving in the Land Commission in counties like Meath or Kildare, is not fitted for that job until he has had at least three years' experience.</P>
    <P>I find that, because of the tillage drive here, the Land Commission have taken away several of those inspectors from constituencies such as I represent, and in some cases they have replaced them by young men who will take two or three years to learn their job.  I think the Land Commission would be better advised if they left the men who were dealing with those problems in those areas; they would be more efficient and we would get better results.  I fear our rearrangement problems in Mayo will suffer by the taking away of these inspectors who knew the job so well.  It is unfortunate that the men had to be taken away from the land in the first <Col N="548" /> instance.  It will be doubly unfortunate if they are kept away for any length of time because it will have a slowing-up effect on the work of the Land Commission.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that the problem of rearrangement is almost as important in counties like Mayo as the problem of migration.</P>
    <P>As regards the collection of annuities, I did not think it would be raised on this Estimate, because it is really more a matter for the Department of Justice than for the Minister. At all events it has been dealt with, and I would direct the Minister's attention to this fact, that it is not really costs that are involved; it is a question of the sheriff's fees, travelling to the point where he is to make a seizure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised was with regard to costs, and the question with regard to the sheriff's fees is contained in the question of costs.  It is the matter of the sheriff's fees that raises the question of costs and that gives cause for complaint.  At all events, if you think it is not a matter that should be raised on this Estimate, I will not pursue it.  We are told that the people from the Gaeltacht, the people from Mayo and Connemara, are not fit to associate with those wonderful representatives of County Meath or the wonderful farmers that they have in Meath and Kildare.  I must take exception to the statements made by some Deputies about those people who go to a strange county from small farms trying to eke out an existence.  It is a very sad thing that the policy of the Land Commission <Col N="549" /> should not alone be attacked, but that those people who are not able to defend themselves here should be open to the castigation that they have received here within recent times.  If the truth were told, I think that notwithstanding the slurs thrown upon them in this House, these are people who have returned and are returning to the lands from which they were driven.  They have had a very good tradition in the counties from which they come and I believe that they will prove an ornament and will prove themselves worthy citizens in the counties to which they have gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies here have thought fit to cast slurs of every possible kind on the migrants from the West who have been given land in Meath.  A number of references has been made about them.  I think it was Deputy Giles who suggested that they were people whom we wanted to get rid of down in the West of Ireland.  On the contrary, those people were picked for their integrity and for their good knowledge of husbandry.  These Mayo migrants have proved good and capable farmers, and I think the Land Commission will confirm what I am stating about the Mayo and the Connemara migrants, who are well worthy of the trust of the Land Commission.  The Deputy cast slurs, I think on these people and on their ancestors, but I tell him there may be greater bars sinister on the escutcheons of many of the families living in Meath than on the families of these people, and some of the people of Meath may be a lot poorer in lineage, tradition and character than any of the people mentioned.  These migrants from the West and their families have been in Connemara and Mayo, and the West generally, for generations, where they were living in the bogs and mountains.  I am sorry indeed to find this sort of thing introduced into the House&mdash;the old idea that the man from across the hill is to be regarded as a stranger.  It is a sorry thing to find that we have not sufficient charity in speaking of people who are as good as ourselves if not better.  All these people have been accustomed to work. They have been brought up on farming all their lives.  When they come back <Col N="550" /> now to Meath they are only coming back to the land of their ancestors, from which they were driven.  They are able to show the people of Meath and of the other counties of Ireland that the men from the West are able to hold their own.  These men were driven out of Meath, and the other richer counties many generations ago, and I am glad to see them back there again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few cases to which I wish to refer, and I want specially to draw the attention of the Minister to them.  First of all, I wish to condemn strongly the action of the Land Commission in not taking over certain lands in Mayo.  I want to know why the estate of Lord Oranmore and Browne at Castlemacgarrett, Claremorris, was not taken over for the relief of the acute congestion existing in the electoral divisions of Crossboyne, Caraun, Ballindine and Kilvine.  There are over 2,000 acres on that estate which has been let in grazing for the past 20 years, and as I say it is surrounded by those electoral divisions where acute congestion exists. In Kilvine and Crossboyne there are at least over 20 persons within a mile or so of the estate with valuations under £5.  That land should have been taken over long ago and divided amongst these people.  There were up to very recently ten tenants who were getting turbary on that estate, but of late his Lordship thought it proper to eject them from that turbary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware they had been cutting turbary there for the last 25 to 40 years.  Applications have from time to time been forwarded to the Land Commission asking them to acquire the whole of the estate, turbary and all. The need for turbary in that area is very great indeed.  I know the people have to go five or six miles away to get turbary.  There was a scheme proposed for the dividing of the lands held by Messrs. Mellet, Crossboyne, on the Ward Estate.  This happened as far back as 1924 when these lands were taken over.  There are about 400 acres on that farm and it is sorely needed for the relief of congestion in the townlands of Kilscaghagh and Curraghadoey. <Col N="551" /> In these townlands alone there are 20 tenants whose poor law valuations are under £3 each.  Nobody knows what is the cause of the delay. I think that is a case into which the Land Commission should look immediately.  It is a long time ago now since the scheme was first made out about these lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>About 400 acres.  I am speaking of the Ward estate in Crossboyne. As I have already said it was acquired by the Land Commission in 1924.  The lands were acquired for the purpose of providing people in that district with economic holdings but not an acre of that land has been divided yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Corry's Party have been here for the last eight years and they have done nothing about it yet.  It is only last year that the County Council of Mayo unanimously passed a resolution asking the Land Commission to act about this matter.  The Deputy who spoke before me, Deputy Moran, subscribed to the resolution of the county council requesting the Land Commission to take over very large parcels of land in that area.  Nothing has been done since.  The Mayo County Council passed a resolution asking the Land Commission to take over a farm near Castlebar.  This is a farm of 400 acres and it is held by Doctor Browne who is out in Australia.  On that land there has been neither rent nor rates paid for the last five years.  We have repeatedly asked the Land Commission to take it over and divide it amongst uneconomic holders but the Land Commission will do nothing.  Who is responsible? I hope now that the matter has been brought before the Minister he will look into it at once.  A memorial was drawn up and sent to the Land Commission on behalf of the congests in that area within the last four or five years but up to the present nothing has been done.  Will the Minister look into it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> If that matter is attended to it would make economic the holdings of at least 30 or 40 persons in the vicinity. There are also in the vicinity of Aughamore and Crossard between 400 and 500 acres of untenanted land which should be immediately acquired, and in Crossard itself there are about 200 acres.  There are over 50 tenants in that parish of Aughamore, with a poor law valuation of under £5 each.  Their land is practically useless, all covered with rocks and heather.  The Land Commission had already decided to take over a large farm now held by Mrs. Gallaher, Kilmore, but they allowed in a purchaser.  That purchaser bought the lands.  There is acute congestion there, as I have already pointed out.  We have time and time again asked the Land Commission to take over the land but nothing has yet been done.  The purchaser is still in possession of that land.  Within one half mile of that holding there are a number of people living on little bits of land the poor law valuation of which is under £1 each.  There is no great necessity for migrating those people to Meath if there is plenty of land in the vicinity and if the Land Commission take steps to divide it.  I am in favour of sending certain people to Meath. With regard to the division of land there is a very large farm at a place called Kilvindoney, Ballyvary.  It was taken over ten years ago by the Land Commission.  Eight years ago it was decided to divide that land.  A cancelling order came down, but I understand that the land was to be divided three years later.  The Land Commission purchased another farm in the vicinity of the land that I speak of.  The farm which was purchased five years ago was promptly divided, but the one that was purchased ten years ago was left there.  The people who would be likely to get some of the land purchased from Mr. Canning were all supporters of Fine Gael.  Therefore they would not get a look in.  The people who were to get the recently purchased lands were supporters of Fianna Fáil and the land has been divided amongst them.  The County Council of Mayo sent up a resolution to the Land Commission requesting them to go on with <Col N="553" /> the division of that land.  They will not do it until, I suppose, they have the right type of men in the neighbourhood, men of the political hue that Fianna Fáil required.</P>
    <P>I asked some questions some time ago with regard to the amount of land which the Land Commission had on hands at the time in South Mayo.  I was informed that they had about 4,500 acres.  That was the amount of land held by the Land Commission in South Mayo at that time.  Quite a lot of that land is in the parish of Kilcommon, some in Kilvine, some in the Ballyhaunis area, and some in the Castlebar district.  Since I asked the question about six months ago I have not heard whether any of that land has been divided.  I do not think it has. I understand that the Land Commission have got it still on their hands. If it were divided it would probably relieve about 100 families in the County Mayo.</P>
    <P>With regard to the migrants, I asked a question some time ago with regard to the Ardilaun estate in the parish of Cong.  There is a townland there called Dringeen.  There is a number of poor unfortunate tenants in that district.  Practically all the land they have is covered with rocks and heather.  They have signified their willingness to migrate or to take additional holdings if they can get them.  I know a number of families there whose valuations are very small.  In the first case there is a family of six and the valuation is £3; in the second case there is a family of seven and the valuation is £3; in a third case the valuation is £3 10s.; in the fourth case there are 14 in family and the valuation is £4; and in a fifth case there are six in family and the valuation is £3 10s.  That is the class of people that you have in the neighbourhood of the Ardilaun estate.  I hope the Minister will see that something will be done for those tenants.  Some years ago tenants were migrated from off that estate, but the land has not yet been divided.  There is not much use in migrating people from land if it is not then utilised for the purpose of relieving congestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> I hope the Minister will take steps at once to give attention, first of all, to the acquisition of land, secondly, to the division of land, and thirdly, to migration.  I know it is costly and expensive to migrate tenants from the County Mayo to the County Meath.  I am also aware that people who have been migrated from South Mayo have made good, every one of them, in the County Meath.  I can say this that not 1 per cent. of those in South Mayo who got additions to their holdings, or new holdings from the late Congested Districts Board, have failed in the payment of their rents.  I think if we are serious about preventing people from flying from the land to England and the big cities, immediate steps should be taken to divide up the land which the Land Commission have in hands and put those people on it.  This delay in putting the people on the land should not be allowed to go on for ever.</P>
    <P>The late Sir Henry Doran, when he was head of the old Congested Districts Board about 30 years ago, said that the board would have the whole land problem, so far as it concerned the Gaeltacht, settled within ten years.  I believe the board would have succeeded in doing that if it had been allowed to function.  A great many people are of the opinion that this delay on the part of the Land Commission is more or less inspired from political sources, or directed from political sources, and that the reason why they are not acquiring and dividing land more quickly is because they want to keep the job going on for ever.  The present Minister has not been very long in charge of this Department.  I hope he will look into these matters and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the bogs, I want to impress on him that there is a great necessity for giving the people turbary. On the estates in South Mayo of Lord Dillon, Lord Oranmore and Browne and Sir Henry Bloss there are large tracts of the best bog on these estates which should be immediately acquired.</P>
    <P>In those areas the Land Commission <Col N="555" /> should take steps to see that the people are provided with turbary.  We are all aware of the difficulty there is at the present time in getting coal. The difficulty is likely to become much more severe in the next few months. In regard to certain estates which have been taken over by the Land Commission in the County Mayo and in other parts of the Gaeltacht area, drains and fences need to be attended to.  The old landlords used to keep them in repair.  In many cases the estates were enclosed by stone walls, and in others by substantial banks. Since the Land Commission acquired those lands nothing has been done to keep the drains and fences in repair. The drains, in particular, need to be attended to.  If the Land Commission is not able to undertake this work, or if it is not possible to get it done out of the Land Commission Vote, then I think the Minister should use his influence with the Minister for Finance and get the Commissioners of Public Works to attend to the drainage.  At the moment many of those drains are practically closed up.  The Minister should see that they are cleaned and restored to a proper condition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rearrangement of rundale holdings, we have a number of these in the parishes of Kilvine and Bakan.  You have a number of such holdings on the Ruttledge and Blake estates.  I hope the Minister will see that these holdings are re-arranged. In some cases the tenants' holdings are divided up into ten, 15 and 20 parts, and are situate a long distance from the tenants' homes. That makes it very difficult for those men to work the holdings.  Something should be done to arrange the land in compact holdings.  I have no doubt that the matter could be arranged very easily by the staff that we have at present.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter and see if there is any possibility of getting something done in those areas.</P>
    <P>In the townland of Ranahard, which is in the Claremorris parish, where <Col N="556" /> there is any amount of land available, there are ten tenants who were promised over and over again by the Land Commission that their holdings would be re-arranged.  Their valuation is only about £2.  Some 20 years ago certain persons were migrated from holdings there and these holdings are still in the hands of the Land Commission and let for grazing.  That should not be allowed to take place.  It is time that the Land Commission put an end to that condition of affairs which should not be allowed to go on.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the farm of Ballyvary on Canning's estate as to which I have got a return here from the Land Commission showing the amount which that farm cost them, the amount which they received in rents and so on, and the amount they spent on fencing, drainage, etc.  There was a net loss on that farm of £550 over the last ten years, although it has been let in grazing at very exorbitant rents.  There is no reason why the Land Commission should be allowed to waste public money in that way.  I hope the Minister will look into these matters and see what can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, as representing a city constituency, it is rather strange that I should talk about land division.  But I am very much interested in it because I have known a couple of estates which have been divided in the past ten or 14 years and I must say that the men who got that land have worked it most successfully. Of course they got, not 25 acres, but 35 or 40 acres and the land was good. In some of these places a great change has been brought about in the countryside by these people being put on the land.  I have also seen places where men have been given 25 acres of land. While I agree with much of what Deputy Cleary said, I am not, however, prepared to agree that 25 acres of land make an economic holding. After all, we do not want to put a man on 25 acres in the hope that he is going to make it a paying proposition by spending three or four months across in England each year in order to help to maintain himself and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> I am entirely in agreement with Deputy Cleary when he states that the land should be given to uneconomic holders.  There is a lot of talk at present about people fleeing from the land and what we want is to make the holdings of those at present on the land economic.  I have known landless men who have been given parcels of land up to 30 and 35 acres.  Some of them are agricultural labourers and they have made a success of their holdings mainly because their friends helped them out with capital and also in working the land.  I do not agree with Deputy Giles when he comments on the Government giving financial aid to men who have been placed on the land, whether landless men or small farmers' sons.  Money could not be better spent than by placing people on the land and enabling them to work their holdings successfully.  Anyone who travels through the country must be impressed by the absence of small farms.  I have travelled through Meath, Westmeath, Kilkenny and Tipperary recently and it was regrettable to notice the large tracts of land which were devoid of people.  If the country districts are not prosperous and if the people have not land to work you cannot have prosperity in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Comment has been made on the fact that some men only got 20 acres of land and could not work it successfully. Some Deputies suggested that there should be co-operative farming.  I think the Government should try the experiment of co-operative farming.  I know an estate which was divided up between a number of men.  The land was rather poor and I must admit that a good many of them have now disposed of the land because they were unable to make a success of their holdings, due to lack of capital and the fact that they were not able to stock it. They met with hard times and had to give up the land.  I have here particulars of an experiment in co-operative farming in Wales.  The Government bought a farm of 750 acres on which they placed 67 settlers.  They built houses for these men and work is carried on under three charge hands and a manager.  Each charge hand has 20 <Col N="558" /> men under him.  There are glass-houses covering three acres on that farm. They have 400 pigs, 1,000 head of poultry, rising to 2,000 during the table chicken season and they buy as many as 400 sheep at the end of the summer. Last year that farm showed a net profit of £1,150.  Out of this, £250 was put to reserve, £300 to reserve for income-tax, leaving £600 to be divided amongst the men.  The average per man was approximately £9 per head, in addition to the weekly earnings of £2 5s. per week on an average.  Each man has a splendid five-roomed house with bath-room, hot and cold water and inside W.C. for 4/- per week and there is a free issue of vegetables, which consists of ½lb. per head per day of whatever vegetable is in season and ¾lb. per head per day of potatoes for each member of the family.  I have known farms of 1,000 or 1,500 acres which have been divided up amongst a number of men.  If in such cases we had this system of co-operative farming, I think we would not have so many of the complaints which we have had. Some of these I believe were most unjustified. Some of the statements made by Deputy Giles were, I think, a slander on the Irish people and should not have been made.  If this co-operative system were adopted in some cases I believe that the land could be used more successfully.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cleary that the Land Commission is one of the most important and one of the most successful social services in this State, but like him I am afraid that we have not sufficient land available for all the landless men.  I have often wondered where land will be got for all the landless men that we hear about.  I heard the Deputy say that there were 2,000 families in Mayo looking for economic holdings, and I agree with him, that while we have farms of three acres, ten acres and 1,000 acres we will not have a balanced land policy.  I know places in parts of the country where some landholders have whole townlands, where there has been no tillage for years.  I know one farm containing 666 acres from which 18 or 19 families were evicted.  I have often wondered if it is advisable to allow a few people <Col N="559" /> to hold 600 acres while large numbers of other people have to live on rocky patches of ground on the hillsides. The Land Commission are not dealing with the question as vigorously as they might.  I am also inclined to think that land which has been given to some people has been bought too dearly, and that some of those who got it have made a case against acquiring land.  I am afraid the Land Commission has been too lenient with them.  I have no sympathy with people who get land and who do not make good use of it.</P>
    <P>When dividing land in future I consider that an area of 25 acres is rather small for a holding.  I do not believe that any real progress will be made by putting people on holdings of that size, on which they have to maintain families, whether large or small.  I think the Land Commission will have to consider the size of the farms rather than the size of the families.  I know several people who are living fairly comfortably on farms of 40 acres.  They are hard working and industrious people, but I think they are always too near the margin of poverty and too hard pressed to make a living.  I do not think they could live out of 25 acres.  In the division of big estates where a number of men may be thrown out of employment co-operative farming should be tried.  It was successfully tried in the instance I mentioned in Wales where miners were put on the land.  The complaints I heard were from people anxious to get land, that the Land Commission was not dealing vigorously with the question.</P>

      <P>When the Land Act of 1938 was introduced several instances were given here of owners who were evading the acquisition of their land by the Land Commission.  It was understood then that no matter what happened these holdings would be taken over by the Land Commission. They are a liability on the people and, in the majority of cases, they were grabbed holdings, from which people of whole parishes were evicted.  They had to go to the mountain-sides <Col N="560" /> in order that these big estates would be made.  Many families are eking out a living on the mountains, on holdings of 20 or 30 acres on which they have to pay, not only their own outgoings but the rates and annuities due by the grabbers.  It is time to stop that.  I expressed the hope in this House on several occasions when the Land Act of 1938 was going through that the Land Commission would acquire these estates.  On the Foley Turpin estate there are 470 acres on which £1,000 is owing in rates to Cork County Council.  I do not know the amount of the annuities owing.  On the Smyth estate, containing 430 acres, there is £580 owing for rates to Cork County Council.  On the Rostellan estate, containing 1,300 acres, there is £2,000 owing in rates. On these three estates about £3,580 is owing for rates that poor families living on the hillsides have to pay in addition to paying their own rates.  In addition, there is the Flowers estate, containing 750 acres, and also the Clarke estate, containing 700 acres, so that practically in one parish there are 3,650 acres of land available.  I do not know the reason for the delay in dealing with them, seeing that a Land Act was passed here, the definite purpose of which was to close all loopholes that were found in previous Land Acts.  It may be stated that this land is being tilled.  It is not.  In the 470 acres of the Foley Turpin estate not a sod has been ploughed.</P>

      <P>Their Fianna Fáil neighbours are paying their annuities at present.  But that day is gone now, and I ask the Minister to take particular note of these holdings.  It is a grave injustice that such a burden should still fall on small farmers in my constituency.  It is an injustice that has lasted too long.  Last week when this Vote was before the House, Deputy Brasier referred to the manner in which sheriffs were operating for arrears of annuities on holdings that were divided up in the past.  I admit that there is one estate in the county that was purchased, and if every sod there was made of gold there could not be so much loot got for it.  It was bought for ex-service men.  When the scheme finished up the land annuities were about £2 an acre plus rates, and the majority of them left in the night, after looking back to see if they were being followed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy also alluded to the case of a man who got a holding <Col N="562" /> on the Dinan estate.  He told us about a man who got a holding of 37 acres there.  He said that portion of it was tilled, but most of the land was without crops.  This is a case of the poacher turned gamekeeper.  There is Deputy Brasier, who never tilled 12½ per cent. of his own holding until compulsory powers were brought in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go into that matter further.  I have dealt with it fairly fully.  I have seen the progress of land division in my constituency for <Col N="563" /> a number of years.  Under previous Land Acts, lands were taken over and far more than their value paid for them.  They were actually valued twice.  The Land Commission valuer went down and valued them.  Then there was an appeal to the judicial commissioner and then there was another valuation.  The result was that the whole burden was thrown on the unfortunate tenants.  I have seen farms on the Gubbins estate, Carrigtwohill, which changed hands five times in the last 20 years.  Every fellow comes in, knocks his bit out of it, gets a couple of crops and clears out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position on some holdings.  They are holdings on which the halved annuity is three times higher than the first annuity put on neighbouring land.  You have the estate I alluded to a short time ago where some generous-minded people over in England came along, when the last war was over, and said the noble soldiers should not be forgotten.  They bought land for them and some good-natured gentleman down the country drew about ten times the value of the land he was selling.  He put the money in his pocket and said: &ldquo;God bless you; there is the farm for you.&rdquo; Houses were built and the Land Commission were foolish enough to take over the land.  The result is that the halved annuities on these holdings are three times as large as the annuities on neighbouring holdings.  I can see no remedy for these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Nally give us a completely new sidelight on the position in County Mayo. I thought, hearing Deputies speak about these congested areas, that there was not a sod of land left high or dry anywhere.  Deputy Nally named a number of farms some of which had been in the possession of the Land Commission for five years or ten years. I find there are roughly 5,600 acres in the list of lands mentioned.  If there are 5,600 acres available in County Mayo, they should be divided before <Col N="564" /> the people there move out.  Perhaps these lands are being kept in the background as little nest-eggs while the people move out while the going is good.  If Deputy Nally's statements are correct, that land should be divided amongst uneconomic holders in Mayo before they look for land outside Mayo.</P>
    <P>I also made an inspection of those holdings in County Meath about which we have heard so much talk.  I went there&mdash;in the daylight&mdash;about three times.  I have only one fault to find with them.  In my opinion, the holdings are not large enough to be economic. It is all very well for Deputy Cleary to tell us that the men who survived the economic war were the smallholders with 25 or 30 acres.  It was not by the land that they managed to survive it.  They survived it by the assistance of friends in America and from employment in Scotland and England. I have been stuck in an old farm since I was 12½ years of age and I know how much land one can manage to live on.  Deputy Brasier might, of course, live on one of these holdings because he is an old bachelor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
