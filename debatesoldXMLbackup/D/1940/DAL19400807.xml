    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware of the fact that a large number of Irish building trade workers who have taken up temporary employment in Great Britain are denied an opportunity of returning to Ireland for the purpose of visiting their families, and whether he will make representations to the British Government with a view to having facilities granted to such workers to pay periodic visits to their families in Éire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that British exit permits are granted only to the following categories of persons:&mdash;(1) Persons travelling on business of especial importance; (2) Irish citizens whose homes are in Ireland and who are returning thereto for permanent residence; (3) Cases of special urgency, such as dangerous illness of relatives in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The British authorities will not grant exit permits to persons desiring to travel from Great Britain to Ireland on holidays or to visit their families, and, from the representations already made I am satisfied that further efforts to have the restrictions relaxed would not be successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is now in a position to state <Col N="1850" /> when legislation to enable local authorities to provide pensions for such of their employees as do not now occupy pensionable positions will be introduced.</P>

      <P>There is no prospect so far as I can see of any such proposals being submitted in the present year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he say whether he gave consideration to a suggestion which was made to his predecessor that advantage might be taken of the introduction of some of the Local Government Bills to incorporate a provision of this kind in one of such Bills?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been considered, but I do not think we could introduce it until the Local Government Bill becomes law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that in consequence of the increase in building costs, local authorities find it impossible to proceed with the erection of houses to cater for the pressing needs of persons living in overcrowded and slum areas; that if subsidy were paid on the full cost of a house, and the pre-war rate of interest reverted to, houses could be let at a pre-war rent; and whether in view of these facts he will take steps to have these concessions granted, and thereby enable local authorities to provide the much-needed houses and also employment for the large number of building workers now unemployed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been directed to the scheme adumbrated in Great Britain of incorporating in the school meal of children one vitamin biscuit containing an adequate daily ration of necessary vitamins, thus greatly widening the range of essential foodstuffs for poor people; and, if so, whether he intends to adopt a similar scheme for the children in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question it would appear that the matter referred to is related to a possible shortage of protective foodstuffs.  From the examination of the position which has so far been made, similar action in this country does not appear to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Parliamentary Secretary agree that if such action were taken here it would greatly widen the range of essential foodstuffs available to the poor and enable them to spend their modest resources to greater advantage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And if that aspect of the problem should carry conviction to the Parliamentary Secretary's mind, may I assume that the scheme adumbrated here will be pursued?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state when the acceptance of the tender for the provision of a sewerage scheme for Portarlington, County Leix, was sanctioned by his Department, and what is the cause of the delay in commencing work on this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>A tender for the carrying out of this work was accepted in November, 1939.  The contractor whose tender was accepted stated in February last before the contract documents had been completed that he was not prepared to undertake the work at his contract figure.  In April certain changes in the lay-out of the scheme were proposed by the consulting engineer and revised contract documents have not yet been submitted to the Department.</P>

      <P>No prices for wool have been officially fixed and the price of our wool is governed by conditions in the available markets.  The exportation of wool is subject to licence under the provisions of the Emergency Powers (Control of Export) Order, 1940, but licences are at present freely available apart from certain limited grades of wool which are required for use in this country.</P>

      <P>The House, I think, is aware that for a period negotiations were in progress with the British Government concerning the sale of our total exportable surplus of wool to the British Ministry of Supply.  During the period that these negotiations were taking place the export of wool was prohibited.  The negotiations broke down on the question of price and the issue of licences for the export of wool was resumed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having refused the licences to export when foreign markets were available, is the Minister now prepared to issue licences when there are no foreign markets available and none of the wool can be sold, with the result that the wool is unsaleable in rural Ireland at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not quite as simple as the Deputy states. <Col N="1857" /> We are dependent upon Great Britain for the supply of wool yarns, wool tops and the types of wool that must be imported by our manufacturers. The British Government stated that they would supply us with these raw materials only on condition that we agreed to sell to them our exportable surplus of raw wool.  It was in consequence of that attitude that the negotiations took place but, because we were unable to agree to a price and because of the protracted nature of the negotiations, the licences for the export of wool were issued as from some date in the middle of June.  The position is not one that we made and so far as we are concerned, we would much prefer to be free to sell our wool wherever we can get the best price for it.  That is now the position, but in so far as we departed from that position for a time it was because we were compelled to do so by the circumstances that then existed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are not as stated by the Deputy.  Before the export of wool was prohibited, the market for the class of wool we have to export had ceased to exist.  In fact, prices had fallen very considerably and the <Col N="1858" /> British were, I understand, exporting that type of wool.  In so far as the protection of the interests of wool producers is concerned, it was precisely on that ground that the negotiations failed, because we considered the prices available inadequate to remunerate them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of household coal depends on the quality and on transport charges from the colliery of supply to the point of consumption. It is not possible, therefore, to give specifically the price of household coal on 26th August, 1939, nor at any subsequent date.</P>
      <P>With my approval the price of household coal was increased in certain districts during the month of July, 1940, by amounts varying from 1/- to 1/6 per ton.  Such increases arose in the main from increased freight charges due to coals being imported in increasing quantities from collieries situated on the east coast of England.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, I am making every possible effort to secure the maximum imports of suitable coals; some of the surplus stocks to which the Deputy refers are not, I am advised, of such qualities as are ordinarily regarded as suitable for the Irish market.</P>

Having prohibited the export of oats during the past three months, a large quantity of oats&mdash;a considerable part of it is in the Minister's own keeping, Canadian oats&mdash;has deteriorated from oatmeal oats into feeding oats as a result of having got the smell of a bag or something of that kind.  These oats are absolutely unsaleable and if not cashed or used before the new oats come in, they will be thrown on the market at any price, with the result that the new oats will have to be sold by the small farmer at a staggering loss unless something is done to facilitate him in holding them back until the carry over is taken off the market.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to questions 19 and 20 together.  The matter of the disposal of unsold stocks of oats of last year's crop has received my careful consideration but in view of the situation in regard to imported feeding stuffs I would not feel justified in relaxing the present restrictions on the export of oats.  I am not satisfied that the disposal of existing supplies of oats of last year's crop presents a problem requiring any special measures to be taken by my Department. I intend to examine the question of fixing minimum prices for oats of this year's crop.</P>
      <P>For the reason given in a reply to a question addressed to me by Deputy Cogan on the 15th May last information as to the quantity and price of Canadian oats imported last spring cannot be given.  I have not particulars as to the quantity of oats on the hands of grain merchants at present or as to the quantities disposed of during the last three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like once more to remind Deputies that in my view oats should not be regarded as a cash crop but <Col N="1869" /> should as far as possible continue to be used for feeding on the farms on which the crop is grown.</P>

The Minister is aware that this question has considerably agitated the minds of some Deputies, who found it necessary to make representations to him on the matter.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister agree with me in this, that where the Compulsory Tillage Order is applied to very poor land, to poor farms, and the farmer is forced to grow oats where he cannot grow wheat or barley, he must sell some of that as a cash crop?  In such circumstances there is no use in expressing a pious wish that that should be consumed on <Col N="1870" /> the farm.  Would the Minister agree that the farmer is often forced to sell in such circumstances?</P>

      <P>On a former occasion in the House I referred to the problem of the farmers who would be holding large stocks of oats.  I indicated that the problem of holding large stocks would be a difficult one when the question of threshing would arise.  Will the Minister endeavour to make some announcement so that the farmers will have some idea of the position&mdash;will he make some announcement before the oats are threshed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that a considerable part of the existing surplus is due to the fact that the Minister imported 5,000 tons of Canadian oats and there is a balance of that Canadian oats still on hands?  Furthermore, I should like to point out that the Minister exhorted seed merchants throughout the country to accumulate stocks of seed oats in order to facilitate the extra tillage campaign.  In the circumstances, is he under no obligation to assist these men in converting the oats into cash, not at an excessive price or at a profit, but at any price?  The situation is that the oats are there, the men have no money, the banks will not lend them any and they cannot sell the oats at any price.  Surely, the Minister must make some effort to meet that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that oats were brought in from Canada, but if Deputies will read the debates they will observe that there was great anxiety at the time that there might not be sufficient seed oats in the country.  It is very easy for Deputy Dillon and others to be wise now, but they were not nearly so wise last February when there was a fear that there might not be sufficient seed oats to meet the country's requirements.  There was definitely such a position and it <Col N="1871" /> was then that we got the Canadian oats in.  There is a certain amount on the hands of the merchants, but it is not very much more than in an ordinary year and I do not see why we should take any special measures. When the merchants were buying the oats they had hopes of making a big profit.  If they did make a big profit, I am quite sure they would not give me any of it.  As it happened, things did not turn out as they were expected to turn out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not do too well and the point is, is the Government to come to the rescue in what is an ordinary commercial loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must endeavour to understand the position. I am not asking that he should guarantee the merchants a profit on these oats.  I fully appreciate that, in the circumstances, a commercial loss has been sustained, and every reasonable merchant in the country does.  I am not asking that the Minister should guarantee a profit, but I think he should work out some scheme whereunder the farmers could convert their oats into money at some price and not leave the oats in the stores to be eaten by rats, to be fouled by rat manure, to be destroyed by the smell of the bags in which they have been kept so long and very likely finally jettisoned as absolutely worthless.  Take it at any price, at a fixed price, and do not sit idly by while the stuff is rotting in the stores.  Do not allow conditions to drift to the extent that you may upset the market and jeopardise the programme that is so necessary for the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister agree that he is denying farmers the right to export oats at present?  If it is in the national interest to retain the oats, is it not only fair that you should give those people a market at home? You are denying the people the market they had in the past and, so far as existing conditions are concerned, you say it is their own responsibility.  I think that is most unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of growing more oats and barley was to supply feeding stuffs to the farmers.  As a matter of fact, last year after the war started there was very little oats put on the market at all.  That is what is causing the difficulty now.  The merchants were not getting very much oats last October and November and oats went up to a high price.  The position now is that the oats bought at a rather high price are left on their hands.  It is quite possible that there will not be much offered after this harvest either. It is much better to wait and see what the position will be.</P>

Drugs and dressings required generally throughout the country for emergency purposes are being purchased centrally and will be issued to the local authorities.

      <P>May I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that there ought to be a little give and take in these matters?  As a matter of fact, as a result of the delay on the part of the Department of Defence in paying marriage allowances to the wives and dependants of new recruits, the Dublin Board of Assistance have had to relieve an extra 650 cases at a cost to the ratepayers of the City of Dublin of £400 a week.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, does he not appreciate that the necessity of maintaining <i>morale</i> amongst a new organisation like the Red Cross largely depends on securing equipment so that the members will be in the best condition for training?  In the case of the Monaghan area, is it not true that they have their personnel available but no materials wherewith to put them to work?  In that situation, would the Parliamentary Secretary not permit the local authority to stimulate the business of the organisation under the direction of the county medical officer of health by buying sufficient supplies to enable the body to carry on until the supplies come from the central authority?</P>

      <P>I do not think any difficulty of the kind suggested by Deputy Dillon exists.  It would create destruction <Col N="1875" /> rather than organisation if we did permit every sectional organisation&mdash;if one may describe a county council as such&mdash;to purchase locally.  It would make it very difficult for us to find out exactly what amount of drugs were in the country and available in an emergency.  We think this is a better way to do it, and a more speedy way.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Department of Local Government that at the present moment all hospitals under the control of that Department have a seven months' supply over and above their usual supplies, and that all the voluntary hospitals were circularised by the Department of Local Government and advised to lay in stocks.  That has been done.  Therefore, as far as any suggestion of slackness to meet immediate requirements is concerned, it can be said that all the hospitals, in every area, are fully stocked.</P>

      <P>Is it not daft to be sending me out on the hustings to appeal to men and women to join the Red Cross, and then, when they do join, to find that we cannot and will not give them anything to work with? Surely there is no use in having me stumping the country appealing to people to join the Red Cross if we do not and will not give them the wherewithal to work.  My information is that the Monaghan County Council cannot get for the Red Cross units functioning in the county under the direction of the county medical <Col N="1876" /> officer of health the wherewithal to train their members.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us, apparently, that he does not intend to give them any supplies in the immediate future.

How far would the provision of these contribute to the training of the personnel of the Red Cross in Monaghan?  The Central Society of the Red Cross here is providing stretchers and equipment for training immediately.  I do not think it is any function of mine to tell the Red Cross how they are to organise.  Some time ago, in the House, when a reference was made by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, in some connection or other, to the Red Cross, Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins got very indignant because of the Minister's interference with the Red Cross.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the facts of the matter to which the Deputy refers are as follow: In about the year 1920, the then judicial authority nominated a certain solicitor to be General Solicitor for Minors.  The person nominated was not required to give security.  He continued to occupy the position until his death, which occurred in February, 1938.  It was then found that he had apparently misappropriated sums to the amount of about £2,500, being the property of various minors.  His own estate will probably be unable to meet these claims, and other claims, in full. In the circumstances, I propose to ask the House at the earliest convenient date to provide for the immediate payment in full of the minors' claims, by way of a Vote of about £2,500 Supplementary to the Supreme and High Court Vote for the current financial year.  Whatever sums are subsequently recovered from the deceased man's estate in respect of the above mentioned transactions will be handed over to the Exchequer.  As regards certain other points raised or suggested in the question, I may perhaps point out that <Col N="1879" /> the deceased man was not a court officer in the ordinary sense of the term: he was a solicitor selected by the court to assist the court in administering certain estates.  He was paid by fees out of the estates so administered. There was no Ministerial or Departmental control over his appointment, duties or remuneration.  The power of nominating a solicitor for these purposes is now vested in the President of the High Court, who has made it a condition of appointment that security be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he has received any complaints that the operations of the Special Unit for the collection of land annuities are in districts preventing a satisfactory response to the recruitment of Local Security Volunteers, and, if so, whether he will take steps to eliminate this element of irritation so as to encourage this vital voluntary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received two such complaints, one of which came from the Deputy himself.  I have already replied to both these communications, but I may perhaps repeat here that according to the information available to me the arrears of land annuities are higher, in proportion, in County Wicklow than in any other county in the State and arise to a noticeable extent from the failure of a <Col N="1880" /> relatively small number of owners of large holdings to discharge their liabilities.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the deficiencies so caused have to be made good at the expense of other ratepayers. It is therefore only right that every reasonable effort should be made to ensure that these liabilities are discharged, if possible, by the persons primarily liable instead of being added to the burdens which others have to bear.  That is the object of the special arrangements in County Wicklow. These arrangements are not unduly severe or peremptory; they involve, in fact, little more than the provision of a police car and driver for the conveyance of one of the court messengers in order to expedite the collection of money from defaulters at their own homes.  Seizures are very rare; and every effort is made by the officers of the Land Commission and by the under sheriff and the court messenger, to meet any genuine appeal for more time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that in County Wicklow a large farm might not be a farm of a wealthy farmer?  It might be a mountain or bog.  The Minister must be aware of the conditions in Wicklow, that the land in the county consists mainly of mountain and bog.  He must also be aware that the county is one in which the people have to depend mainly on stock raising and that they have not derived any benefit from wheat growing. As a result they have suffered more severely than most counties from the economic war.  For that reason, it is not right or proper that the Minister should specially penalise this county by employing a special force to collect annuities, a force which is extraordinarily expensive, so expensive that in some cases the costs incurred in the collection of arrears far exceed the amount of the arrears. The cost of even one visit varies from 10/- to as high as 30/-.  This cost, added to the arrears, has made the arrears uncollectable.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment is really necessary or reasonable.  Here we are proposing to, omit from consideration, as far as derelict sites are concerned, any property which is held by such bodies as railways, tramways, dock, canal, water, gas, electricity, or other public undertaking.  It does seem unfair that if a private owner has a shack of some sort or other, which we think is unsightly or unsanitary, we are going to take power to deprive him of it whether he likes it or not, whereas if it happens to belong to any of the parties enumerated here, we are going to allow it stand.  Our experience of some people in charge of public undertakings is not so very happy that we should be prepared to exclude them in this way.  If the Minister wants the amendment, I think he should make a case for it.  I should like him to tell us why he thinks these public undertakings should be excluded from the provisions of a law that will operate against private individuals.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be protected by this amendment. To give an instance of a case in which the amendment would apply, you may have a railway station attached to which there is a siding.  The local authority may consider that the siding is kept in an unsatisfactory state, but it may be kept in a perfect state from the company's point of view.  You have, for example, tramway yards and such places, that perhaps may look sometimes unsightly but that are very necessary to maintain.  These are a couple of examples I might give. Although I do not think local authorities would abuse that power very much, I think that in giving such a power to a local authority you would be giving them too comprehensive a power.  It is intended that places like that, which are being used for a particular purpose and which, while not <Col N="1911" /> perhaps looking as if they were kept in a desirable way from an esthetic point of view, still are probably in keeping with the purposes for which they are intended, should not be interfered with.  I have in mind railway sidings, tramway yards, and places of that sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has really made a case for the insertion of this amendment. After all, the Minister must have very little faith in his County Managers Bill, according to this amendment.  I do not think there is any danger whatever of a public authority abusing its powers in that respect.  I do happen to know of a public undertaking, a gas undertaking, which, to my mind, has some surroundings that ought to be altered, and I do not think these people should be immune and do not see any reason why they should be.  I think the Minister ought to have faith enough in public bodies, particularly under the new managerial system, to feel that they are not going to abuse any powers that they have, and it will be manifestly unfair to have such people as I have in mind exempt. After all, if there are railway sidings or other public undertakings that are unsightly, these people are better able to mend these places and put them into proper order than a private individual would be, and why they should be exempt I do not know.  This is really a tidying-up Bill.  Personally, I have very little faith in the Bill, and the Minister knows that, but at the same time I think that if a public undertaking has any property which requires tidying up they ought to be compelled to do so, just the same as an individual.  If we have any faith at all in public bodies we ought not to insert this amendment, and I do not think there is any reason for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather welcomed this Bill on its Second Reading.  I think it is a splendid Bill, because anybody going through our provincial towns and seeing a lot of these derelict buildings, half demolished and some of them not demolished at all, will realise the necessity for such a Bill as this. <Col N="1912" /> However, like Deputy Brennan, I think that you will take away a lot of the best part of this Bill if you insert this amendment.  These people should be amenable to the law just the same as a private individual and, as Deputy Brennan has pointed out, these people have more money and are in a better position to remove such abuses than the ordinary individual.  I think the Minister should leave the Bill as it stands because the insertion of this amendment will take away a great deal of the effectiveness of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The railways operate under a certain code of laws and regulations, and I see a certain danger in trying to get another code of laws. They have, I think, to abate such things as a nuisance or something like that.  There might be some stations closed down and there might be a case to be made there, but this is to some extent experimental.  I believe this will cover at least 80 per cent. and probably 90 per cent. of these derelict sites that we see around the country. What I mean is that you very often have all the amenities of a place destroyed or taken away because of unsightly and derelict buildings beside it.  You have such unsightly buildings near towns, and the amenities of such towns are taken away as a result of these sites, but I do not think that places such as Deputy Brennan has in mind, like railway sidings or something like that, do very much in the way of taking away from the amenities of a place, and I think they could be dealt with in some other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) A preliminary order shall not <Col N="1913" /> be made in respect of land consisting of or containing agricultural land save with the consent of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>This has been suggested by the Land Commission with a view to excluding agricultural land from the operation of this Bill.  It might be construed that, in taking a derelict holding, we wanted to take agricultural land, which we do not want to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I should like to know from the Minister is this: outside the municipal authorities or urban councils what land is agricultural land? Is not all land agricultural land? Accordingly, in all cases, outside of pretty large towns where there are urban councils and town boundaries, in every village and town in the country all sites are, in fact, agricultural land and will have to be treated as if they were a farm.  I think the Minister probably could find a happier way for dealing with that matter than the particular way he sets out here, because any person who has had any experience of dealing with the Land Commission will feel that having to look for the consent of the Land Commission in this matter is not going to hurry things up and that it is going to be the other way round.  If the local authority has to get the consent of the Land Commission with regard to little plots and so on in every town and village in the country, outside the urban towns, you will hold up the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think these sites would come within the definition of agricultural land; at least I am advised that they do not.  I think that land, to be agricultural land, must be used for pasture or tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is right at all.  If the Minister looks at any demand note he will find the rateable valuation set out as agricultural land.  As Deputy Brennan says, in every town, except an urban town, the land upon which a house is situated is described as agricultural land.  To my mind, the difficulty is that the phrase &ldquo;agricultural land&rdquo; there is what makes the weakness in the amendment, because it seems to suggest that that is subject to <Col N="1914" /> the Land Commission or, in other words, to a Land Commission annuity, and that is not so because the definition of agricultural land is land that is rated as agricultural land.  You are up against two snags there: one is that you are going to give the Department power to acquire land that is actually not subject to their authority or, secondly, you are going to consider, under this amendment, that the only land that is agricultural land is land that is subject to a Land Commission annuity.  You cannot have it both ways.  The Land Commission are not at all interested unless the land is subject to a Land Commission annuity.  If you go on the definition here of agricultural land you immediately come into contact with other portions of land rated as agricultural land.  Now even the land on which houses are situated is agricultural land.  If the Minister will look at his own demand note for rates he will find that it would be defined as agricultural land even where the house is built on.  No matter how small the portion was, it would be so described; so obviously there is a catch there between agricultural land and the other definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural land is land that has been tilled.  I knew a case where the owner tilled his land so as to avoid paying the higher rates on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister analyses this amendment he will find that it is only an amendment that is winding the Bill around with red tape.  It is putting obstacles in the way of the local authorities dealing with this matter of derelict sites.  It is dealing with two Departments that will make it much more difficult for things to be done.  This amendment does nothing but put more obstacles in the way of local authorities.  Every foot of land is agricultural land.  This is a very loose definition.  If it is passed as it stands you will be only setting up a new section in the Land Commission to deal with it and putting obstacles in the way.  If you want anything to be done you cannot do it in face of these new obstacles and you will make no progress in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I want to say there may be a whole lot of small portions of land acquired under the section and I want to point out that costs of arbitration have been found to be very expensive on local authorities.  should there not be some simple way of awarding compensation than that followed under the present system?  This would materially reduce the costs.  These costs are very often one of the things that may deter a local authority from setting out to acquire a site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that affects a lot of other things besides derelict sites.  It affects the acquisition of land for roads.  To my mind it is a question of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Something more simple than the present system could be devised.  At present the proceedings are too cumbersome.  The site may very often not be worth 10/- or £1 and the local authorities find that the costs are ten times as large as the compensation itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.  Take the case of a house a portion of which has to be demolished.  The local authorities take down that part of the house.  They make the owner pay.  In this case if a building is to be taken down it is not charged for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of taking it down is deducted from the award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery is slightly cumbersome.  In the case of a small man where the site would be worth only 10/- or £1 the local authority would have to go through the whole of the costs involved, advertising and so on, just as if they were acquiring sites for building <Col N="1918" /> cottages.  That is where the difficulty comes in.  Take the acquisition of sites when we give £25 or £30 for an acre of land.  The amount of trouble which the individual has to go through as compared with the local authority makes it very difficult.  I will take a classic example of one Department of State, the Estates Duty Department. When an estate is being probated, the local auctioneer says it is worth £1,000, the valuer for the Estates Duty Department says it is worth £2,000.  To give them their due it is quite easy to come to an agreement with them.  What usually happens is the two sides come together and they do agree without any process of law.  It strikes me that in this particular matter of the acquisition of derelict sites there could be some such method adopted.  If my auctioneer says the place is worth so much and the Department's auctioneer says it is only worth one-third of that, there should be some means of getting them together.  Other Departments of State do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support that point of view.  There is an extraordinary amount of work attached to the taking over of any land.  I remember that in one case in Wexford the board of health found it necessary to get a site.  Before they could do anything they had to take out administration for the whole estate, a very expensive proceeding to the board of health. It added considerably to the costs.  I would suggest that the Minister ask the Department to go into this again and see whether they could provide some means for simplifying the acquisition of land in such cases.  I do not know whether the Minister has time to do it; I suppose he wants to get this Bill through; but I would ask him to go into the whole question of the acquisition of land in order to find out if some simpler and easier method could be adopted which would take less time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that what Deputy Corish says is quite right? Under another Act, the Soldiers and Sailors Act, there is a procedure by which they get a statutory receipt, and <Col N="1919" /> the body taking it over get a good title no matter what the title was before.  I think that ought to be done in the case of the acquisition of any site by a local authority&mdash;that they would pay the person in occupation if they are satisfied that he is obviously the person entitled, and that they would get what is called a statutory receipt, as under the Act I have referred to, and get their title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>All local authorities welcome this Bill, but there will be a certain amount of hesitancy about it owing to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The case mentioned by Deputy Corish does not arise directly under this Bill.  You go in and acquire the site in the ordinary way; you post the notice on the place if there is no one on whom to serve it, publish it in the newspapers and, after making all reasonable inquiries, proceed to acquire it.  The question of making title is a matter for anybody who wants to come along and claim compensation, which will be less the cost of clearing the site and putting it in a proper condition.  I want to get this Bill through; I do not want to keep it over until October.  But there are other difficulties that may arise from time to time in this matter of fixing the compensation or finding the proper person to whom compensation should be paid.  You might have obscure titles in various places, and it is very difficult for a Government Department to try to get what might be called a &ldquo;near cut&rdquo; without having some sort of official arbitration upon it. They want to get a good title and to see that the person who is properly entitled to the compensation will get it.  While I am anxious to see some way of short-circuiting it, I do not see any way in this measure, or in some of the other measures affecting local government, except by the method of arbitration, where there will be an inquiry and all that.  I do not think that these are matters which will arise very often in the case of people who have neglected sites for so long.</P>

      <P>I was out of the House when Section 1 and the amendment were being passed.  While I entirely agree with the amendment, I should like to ask the Minister how far he can see his way to safeguard the interest of two classes of people that are not mentioned.  One would be a builder who would have acquired an estate which would take years to develop.  You might have one end of the estate lying derelict for a couple of years while the builder would be quite honestly proceeding to develop that estate.  The other case would be that of a business or factory with a small portion of land next to their premises which they intended to take <Col N="1921" /> in in the course of normal development. How far could both these cases be safeguarded from what I call undue haste to make these people proceed beyond their normal rate?</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any danger about that, because it is a matter for the District Justice to say whether such a site is derelict or not.  It must be derelict for two years. It is for the builder who is brought up before a District Justice by any local authority which is so unreasonable &mdash;if there were such an unreasonable local authority&mdash;to show that there were difficulties in one way or another to prevent him from going ahead.  It would be for the District Justice to decide the matter, the builder having given evidence that he intended to develop the estate, and to annul the order or do whatever he wanted in regard to it.</P>

I want to eliminate the need for paying guineas either to Deputy Linehan or the Minister or their fraternity, because if there is one profession in the country that is a pure racket it is their profession.

I know that local authorities with which I am connected, and which have a good deal to do with matters of this kind, have been so bitten that, unless they meet with an impossible man on whom they can make no impression, and even then, unless the scheme was a huge one, they would not dare use compulsory powers because they are so expensive.  I am not sure that there is machinery in this Bill to improve that.  Having some experience of this kind of work, I appreciate the Minister's point of view that it would perhaps be very dangerous to try to short-circuit these matters.  I am afraid it will be a good Bill for the lawyers.</P>

      <P>To my mind this Bill does not meet the necessities of the hour at all.  I said so to the Minister on another occasion.  In so far as the Minister, or anybody else, thinks it is going to be a success, I give it my blessing, but I shall be very much surprised if much advantage is taken of it. My objection to the Bill is that a local authority cannot do any cleaning up, or compel any cleaning up to be done, without acquiring the site.  That brings me to the objectionable matter mentioned by Deputy Allen and Deputy Belton.  The site must be acquired. At present I cannot see the local authority of which I am a member wishing to acquire five or six little bits of sites in a village down in County Roscommon, because they do not want them.  They want authority to clean them up very badly, and now they are getting that authority, but they must acquire the sites, and if they cannot <Col N="1923" /> get them by agreement, they must adopt this round-about method of compensation by arbitration which has in the past held up quite a lot of important work.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out to me that the Bill as it stands will be very useful for dealing with towns in which houses require to be built and in which sites have been allowed to go derelict, and that in such a case, the sites should be acquired.  I say certainly that the local authorities ought to have the power of acquisition, but they ought not to be compelled to acquire, and that is the fault I find with the Bill. I had hoped that when a Bill of this nature was brought before the House, it would deal in an omnibus fashion with the matter of clearing up nuisances all over the country, because, in most small towns, we have dead-ends of streets with old motor cars and debris of every description and condition piled on them.</P>
      <P>This Bill will clear them up, but the site must be acquired, and in order to acquire the sites certain conditions must be complied with.  The owner must be found, or, at least, an endeavour must be made to find him, and in that respect there are three conditions laid down here.  One of these conditions is that you may publish the matter in the local paper.  I hope that the district justices, in taking the view which Deputy Belton hopes they will take of another matter, will agree that that is sufficient notice because it is the notice I should like to see given in the cases of some of the small towns in which there are dead-ends which do not belong to anybody, but which did and may still belong to the landlord, wherever he or his representative may be at the moment.  I hope the Bill will be useful and will be availed of, but, to my mind, it does not meet the necessity of the hour. In so far as it is useful, I wish it Godspeed.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to do something in this matter.  I know of a case involving about 12,000 square feet of ground and 11 solicitors sat round the table contesting the claims <Col N="1924" /> to it, all having to be paid out of Cork Corporation funds.  Like Deputy Allen, I think that if anything could be done in a matter of that kind, it should be done.  It is appalling what we have to pay for derelict sites in slum-clearance areas.  We find claims coming from London and from as far away as Australia in respect of letting, subletting and so on, and something should be done to save local authorities from expense of that kind.</P>

      <P>Local authorities, in acquiring land for house-building, experience more difficulty than in any of the other work they do and there would have been thousands more houses built by the State but for this trouble in regard to acquiring sites.  I think that the Local Government Department has no appreciation at all of the cost and the trouble to which local authorities are put, and with the burden of work which sanitary authorities have at present, I can see them not being able to touch the Bill at all.  I think it will not be operated, except in very rare cases.  The Minister should have made provision for the acquiring of sites by some more easy means&mdash;some Deputy mentioned the Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust. There must be some easier system of acquiring land, but local authorities have the most tortuous system in existence of acquiring even an acre of land. I have no objection at all to the legal community, but every Bill passed here makes work for them and gives them endless trouble and work, for which they may very often go unpaid; but when local authorities are paying out the ratepayers' money, there are tons of money in it for everybody.</P>

      <P>We are all getting more confused as the discussion goes on.  Deputy Allen and some other Deputies seem to think that all this array of counsel and solicitors is concerned with the acquiring of sites.  It is nothing of the kind.  The simple procedure as to how to acquire sites is set out in the Bill and we are all talking now about something which will happen afterwards.  If a site is such a marvellous site that he can afford to employ counsel and solicitor to get a little compensation fixed, after a council has cleaned up the place, the individual who had the site for years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The man employs the solicitor and counsel himself, and if he satisfies the arbitrator as to the reasonableness of his <Col N="1926" /> case, it is a matter for the arbitrator, in his absolute discretion, to decide whether he is going to award costs against the counsel or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  With regard to the matter referred to by Deputy Hickey in Cork, that was a site well worth looking after.  If it were not, they would not be so anxious about it.  I do not think it very likely that if there is a valuable site, if an individual discovers that a site is valuable, when served with notice, he will not clean it up and put it into proper condition, instead of allowing the council to come in and acquire it. I think that the very threat of acquisition that is in the Bill, and the measures that can be taken if the person himself does not clean up the site, will have considerable effect. There was mention of the difficulty of making title and all that.  That arises only when the site has been acquired. The Bill leaves you the method for acquiring the site and the only question afterwards is as to who gets the compensation or who can make a title to compensation when that site has been acquired.  So far as acquiring the site is concerned, however, there is a simple, easy and direct method in this Bill and there is no necessity for an array of counsel.  The matter goes before the district justice in the last resort and he determines as to whether the preliminary order should stand or not.</P>
      <P>I believe that there are numerous sites all over the country, which we can see going into any town or village, and which are regarded by the occupants or whoever is entitled to them, as being so valueless that they do not think it worth while doing anything about them.  There is going to be no difficulty, so far as the legal end is concerned, and there is no justification for any members of local authorities saying that it is a costly measure and one impossible to operate.  It is a simplified measure, and whatever delay may arise will arise after the site has been acquired by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is designed to serve three purposes&mdash; firstly, to make certain amendments which appear to be desirable in the present Mines and Minerals Act of 1931; secondly, to authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to acquire compulsorily minerals in private ownership, in certain circumstances; <Col N="1928" /> thirdly, to authorise the Minister to work mineral deposits as a State enterprise.  In the administration of the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931, certain difficulties were experienced. To meet these, certain amendments are proposed now, of which I propose to mention the two principal ones more specifically later.  The bulk of the amendments are of a minor character, but they have been rather numerous, and in view of that it has been felt desirable to proceed by way of a consolidating measure rather than by way of an amending Bill.  Accordingly, this Bill proposes to repeal completely the Act of 1931 and to re-enact its many provisions with the amendments which experience has shown to be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first main amendment which this Bill proposes to make in the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931 is one to meet the difficulty which arises out of the fact that, on the sale of estates to tenant purchasers under the Land Acts, 1903 to 1923, minerals are, as a general rule, reserved to the Land Commission.  The tenant purchaser is granted the ownership of the stone, gravel, sand and clay on his holding. In the case of minerals which were thus reserved to the Land Commission, certain difficulties regarding title have arisen from two causes: first, there is no way of telling whether some particular substances come within the category of minerals vested in the State under the Acts or within the categories of stone, gravel, sand or clay and are thus specifically exempt from such vesting by the terms of the Land Acts.  The second difficulty arose through the fact that vesting of minerals in the State under these sections did not take place in certain circumstances, that is to say, for example, if the owner were himself working the minerals on the day of vesting.  Whether particular minerals were being worked on the vesting date or on the appointed date was, in some circumstances, a question of fact which it was difficult to determine.  As a means of settling the questions of title, the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931 empowered the Minister to refer such questions to the Land Commission for determination. <Col N="1929" /> Reference to the Land Commission meant delay for the person proposing to work the mineral and, in one case, expensive litigation, which ultimately went to the Supreme Court, in which the tenant purchaser was involved.  In this Bill, the remedy proposed is, by way of legislative act, to declare that an exclusive mining right vested in the State under the Land Acts shall be deemed to include and always to have included the right to take all of the mineral substances set out by name in the Schedule to the Bill.  I think it will be conceded that this is, perhaps, the most practical and businesslike way of settling this rather vexed question.</P>
    <P>The Mines and Minerals Act of 1931 also failed to make sufficient distinction between prospecting and working. In so far as that Act did make provision for prospecting as such, it placed this aspect of mineral development on the same plane as actual working, with the result that anybody in this country wishing merely to examine a mineral deposit to see whether it was worth developing or not was faced with pretty much the same degree of formality, expense and delay as if he had already decided to work the deposit commercially and wanted for that purpose to get legal title.</P>
    <P>With a view to remedying this position in regard to the matter of mineral prospecting as distinct from actual working, the new Bill contains in Part II a whole set of provisions based on the principle that where there are minerals, whether State owned or privately owned, which are not being worked or which are not being worked efficiently, either the Minister or any person to whom a licence for the purpose may be granted by the Minister should be entitled to investigate the possibilities of these minerals subject to payment of compensation in respect of disturbance or damage caused to the surface of the land only.  It is not proposed that the owner should get compensation in respect of the minerals themselves because he in fact will suffer no loss.  His title, even if a prospecting licence is granted, will remain unimpaired and, in view of the <Col N="1930" /> fact that the Bill proposes to make it an offence for anyone to whom a licence has been granted to work the minerals or to remove any quantity of them other than what is required for the purposes of analysis or other similar tests, his property will be protected.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains provisions which authorise the compulsory acquisition of minerals in private ownership.  Briefly, this authorisation is granted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce where he, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is satisfied that certain mineral deposits are not being worked or are not being worked efficiently and where in his opinion it is essential in the public interest that such order should be made.  Circumstances have shown that there is necessity to look for these powers.  Left to development by private enterprise, experience has shown that there is a probability that the mineral deposits, such as they are, in the country, may never be developed.  In the interests of the State it is important that such possibilities as there are should be fully explored and should be fully availed of. The development of the deposits which we have would give much-needed employment, and the coal and other minerals which may be raised would help to feed essential industries with raw materials at a time when the flow of imports is for any cause interrupted. Again, development of the country's mineral resources has, to some extent, been impeded by unreasonable demands which have been made by owners of deposits for a right to work and develop them.  There is, naturally, no desire to confiscate private property, but it is important that the efforts of the State or of private persons to develop mineral deposits should not provide the owners of deposits which may have lain dormant for years with the opportunity of demanding for their interests amounts which would make the exploitation of the deposits uneconomic.</P>
    <P>In general, we assume that the owners of the deposits will be sufficiently compensated by a royalty on any minerals which an efficient mining undertaking may succeed in winning <Col N="1931" /> from the soil and it is only in exceptional circumstances, I should say, that any lump sum will be paid over at the outset.  The Bill, in relation to this question of compensation, provides that the compensation to be paid to the existing owners will, in default of agreement, be fixed by the Mining Board, but the compensation which the board is empowered to award is, in general, limited to compensation, as I have mentioned, by way of royalty on the quantity of minerals raised from the deposits which are acquired.  There are, however, two exceptions to this general rule.  If the minerals are held subject to a rent or other fixed annual payment or if they have been purchased by their present owners for valuable consideration within ten years prior to the date of the passing of the Bill the board may at its discretion award compensation in the form of (a) a lump sum, (b) a fixed rent, (c) a royalty, or any two or more of these modes of payment.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill authorises the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to work and dispose of minerals already vested in the State or minerals which have been acquired by the issue of an order under Part III of the Bill.  The arrangements most suitable for working minerals by the State, whether directly or through a semi-State organisation, would, of course, be for consideration in each particular case.  So far as it may be proved necessary, the Dáil will be approached to provide financial assistance in the form of repayable advances, but it is intended that any such project should, within a reasonable time, show itself capable of being operated on a commercial basis without State assistance. Accordingly, the enactment of the Bill will not of itself throw any charge upon the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>While the other provisions in this Bill do not differ widely from the provisions of the Act of 1931, they are arranged on a somewhat different plan, and it may be well at this stage to mention briefly the plan adopted in the 1931 Act for giving effect to the general purposes behind that legislation. <Col N="1932" /> The principle underlying the provisions of the Act of 1931 was that the development of the mineral resources of this country is essentially a matter for private enterprise.  In that Act, therefore, it was not necessary to do more than, first of all, authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give leases of minerals which were in State ownership; secondly, to provide persons with facilities for acquiring the right to work minerals which were in private ownership; thirdly, to provide facilities for working deposits either acquired by mining leases or by mining rights, to provide them, for instance, with a right to a supply of water, a right to dispose of waste products, a right to demolish buildings. These rights, provided under the Act of 1931, were known as ancillary rights and are set out in detail in Section 19 (2) of that Act.  The 1931 Act also provided for the terms on which mining rights and ancillary rights should be acquired and the compensation which should be paid to the persons from whom they were so acquired.  It also made provision to prevent the working of minerals which were required for the support of buildings, and it made provision for various minor matters mentioned in Part VIII of the Act, that is to say, for the fencing of abandoned mines, for furnishing information regarding boring operations, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>For the purpose of advising the Minister as to the reasonableness of claims made for mining and ancillary rights and for assessing compensation which should be paid in respect of them a body called the Mining Board was established and it consisted of three persons, a lawyer, an expert in land values and an officer of the Minister. These various provisions of the Act of 1931 have their counterparts in the present Bill.  Part I corresponds roughly with Part I of the Act of 1931.  Some of the definitions are changed slightly.  I have already referred to some changes in the definitions in the first part of the Bill, and also to the main changes of substance in that part which refers to scheduled minerals.  The changes, as I indicated, <Col N="1933" /> will, we hope, obviate delays which have taken place, and remove difficulties which have been experienced in considering whether in fact certain mineral substances have been vested in the State.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt briefly with Parts II and III of the Bill, and with Section 30 of Part IV.  That part of the Bill will generally re-enact the provisions of the 1931 Act.  It also introduces the following new principle: that the Minister will have authority to give facilities to take deposits from State-owned minerals, and also from privately-owned minerals, without putting the applicants to the expense of making formal leases.  It also provides that the Minister will be authorised to work certain mineral deposits as a State enterprise.  Part V re-enacts in substance Part II of the 1931 Act.  The constitution of the mining board to be set up will not be altered.  The nature of its general functions will not be altered, but the cases that will come before it for determination may be more numerous, depending on the extent to which the powers vested in the Minister under Part III of the Act will be exercised.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill embodies the provisions of Parts IV and V of the Act of 1931.  These are the parts which contain provisions for the giving of facilities to work minerals which are in private ownership.  In this Bill the facilities are called &ldquo;unworked mineral licences.&rdquo;  In the Act of 1931 they were called &ldquo;mining rights.&rdquo;  In this part are provisions which will make it an offence for a person to work mineral deposits in such a way as to deprive of the necessary support buildings and other erections on the surface of the land.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals with the payment of compensation.  The circumstances in which compensation will be payable have been stated at length in a memorandum which I circulated to Deputies.  Part VIII deals with miscellaneous items which were dealt with in Part VIII of the 1931 Act and, in addition, contains provisions making it an offence to work minerals without lawful authority.  The need for that <Col N="1934" /> arises from the fact that from time to time it has come to the notice of my Department that mineral deposits which belong to the State were being pilfered by persons living in the locality.  The trespass was most frequent on coalfields such as at Arigna, the Leinster coalfields, and Slievardagh.  Quite apart from the injury done to State property by these acts of trespass, it is important that trespass should be stopped for the following reasons: firstly, that the trespassers left unfenced shafts which they had sunk when they decided to abandon the workings; secondly, the State might, to some extent, be made liable for compensation to the owners for any injury done to the surface; and thirdly, there was a likelihood that the irregular working carried on might result in serious accident. There was, in fact, one serious accident due to that cause.  Nevertheless, the State hitherto had no effective means of putting an end to the trespass.  Proceedings might have been taken under the Larceny Act, but it is doubtful if they would succeed. The protection that will be extended to mineral properties by this section will also extend to minerals in private ownership.</P>
    <P>These are the principal features of the Bill, and as the need for the enactment of the measure in present circumstances is very urgent, I should be grateful if the House could see its way to give me all stages of the Bill to-day.  The powers with which we are seeking to vest the Minister in Parts II and III would be particularly valuable in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a particular reason for not laying down the law here as if the Act of 1931 had disappeared? It is rather distressing to know that while part of the Act is to be repealed, in order to find out where we must look up every other Act to see what particular part is still in existence.  This is a very comprehensive Bill, and like most of the measures that we have had in recent times, it proposes to give power to the Minister to do or to undo, and to amend or otherwise.  Section 12 is an example under which the Minister may at any time at his discretion revoke a licence.  In that sense it is different to the 1931 Act, as under this Bill the State can go in and operate a mining proposition on its own.  Personally, I dislike that provision.  We had an example of that sort of work in connection with peat within the last few years, and it has been a very expensive experiment.  Naturally, when it was introduced it had all the recommendations which one might expect from politicians, or from persons expecting great results.  We were told from time to time that the development of peat would be second only to agriculture, but we learned later that most of the money sunk in it has been lost. That is the danger in this measure, that having got the power, the State may seek to operate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that if the State does not move some time or other we will not get anywhere in these matters, and people may point to the hydro-electric works on the Shannon as an example where the State had to move.  But the circumstances are not the same.  In one case we had a proposition to work on, and a definite plan, as well as estimates and examples provided by experts. Here we have nothing of the sort and we shall, probably, be asked in the next few years to sink a great deal of money <Col N="1936" /> in something which nobody in the country knows anything about.  It will be brought in with the usual flourish of trumpets.  We shall be told that it is a great investment, that it will give a lot of employment and that the results will be very satisfactory.  That is one side of the matter&mdash;the expensive side. This Bill opens the door to experimentation and affords an opportunity for putting public money into a mine, which means that that will be the end of the money.  In the next place, there does not appear, so far as I can judge at the moment, to have been any attempt to deal with a person who obtains a right and then sells that right to somebody else.  To my mind, that type of individual should not have his operations facilitated in this country.  I should be prepared to support a bonafide mining proposition, but it is inadvisable to encourage the person who, having obtained certain information, puts out a prospectus, invites other people to put up the money and gets away with the commission.  In the earlier years of this State, there descended upon it quite a number of persons who were anxious to get rich quickly.  They got short shrift.  In recent years we have had quite an invasion of persons more Irish than the Irish themselves and, according to all accounts, much richer since they came here than they were before.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is merely an oversight that Section 17 refers to a person who gives information which is false or misleading, and imposes a penalty, while Section 27 refers to a person who &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; gives such information.  Is there any reason for making a distinction in these two cases?  I asked the Minister whether the old mining board had operated or not, because this board is the same, and we have in all these Bills an addition to the cost of running the State. This mining board will represent but a small item in the cost, but, if we add up all these small items, we shall find that they amount to a considerable sum in the aggregate.  The Bill provides for a member of the mining board who is a practising barrister or solicitor of ten years' standing, an experienced arbitrator&mdash;presumably one who <Col N="1937" /> has experience in connection with the acquisition of property under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts &mdash;and an officer of the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us why it is proposed to have three members on this board&mdash;why an arbitrator accustomed to this work could not carry out the duties himself.  What is the necessity for having, in addition to a practising barrister, a member of the Minister's staff?  Of all the people in my experience who have no knowledge whatever of the world, the civil servant is the most outstanding.  He knows all about his own department, about his files, and about what might happen, but of business transactions he knows nothing in the world.  It is unfair to put a proposition of this sort before a civil servant, because the whole existence of civil servants is devoted to putting up propositions.  I suppose the best civil servant is he who produces a white sheet, and when told that it was a black sheet which was wanted, provides an equally satisfactory sheet of black.  Civil servants are never called upon to take decisions.  They always put the decisions up to the Minister, and I can foresee the civil servant on this board being a regular torture to the unfortunate barrister and arbitrator when the question to be decided is whether a person should receive £140 instead of £120.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some reason for the maintenance of the board at the strength which was thought advisable eight or nine years ago.  We are not as rich as we were then.  We cannot afford to spend so much money, and unless civil servants have had experience of business during those nine years which they had not at that time, there cannot be any very strong reason for putting a civil servant on the board.</P>
    <P>I notice that what is called &ldquo;a prospecting licence&rdquo; is provided for in the Bill.  That may be with a view to helping the individual who comes in to find what there is to sell and, having got the information, sells it to somebody else.  If that were the purpose of the provision, I should be very much opposed to it.  If the intention is to provide for an ordinary <i>bona fide</i> examination of what there is to mine, <Col N="1938" /> that is a different question.  I notice that, in one clause of the Bill, it is provided that if, in a particular case, the compensation to be awarded is less than the sum which the Land Commission has advanced on the holding, the board, notwithstanding its judgment and its conscience, is to alter its award and make one which will indemnify the Land Commission.  I could imagine the Land Commission introducing a clause of that sort, but for the Minister, who is interested in mining, to do so is quite a different proposition.  If, by reason of mining, land is less valuable than it would be if worked as an agricultural holding, there is no reason for converting that land into a mine. We should lose rather than gain in that event.  Perhaps the Minister would take a note of that matter, which arises on Section 65, and tell us the reason for it.  Section 67 provides for compensation for State-acquired minerals and for unworked minerals licences.  Sub-section (b) of that section refers to purchase by the owners for valuable consideration &ldquo;within a period of ten years prior to the date of the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  Why was the period fixed at ten years?  If this Bill means that we are to have a series of expensive experiments, it were better it were never introduced.  The Minister may say that that will have to come before Parliament on a future occasion.  We are getting the medicine in two doses so that it will seem not to be so severe.  I should like to know if there is any intention of sinking money in this business and, if so, to what extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have thought that the provisions of the 1931 Act were sufficiently stringent without repealing that measure and bringing in a Bill which imposes still more severe conditions on the landholders concerned. I refer to the position of the property owner whose land is taken over and his whole place disturbed while he gets little or nothing in the shape of royalties or compensation. According to the Minister, these landholders are not losing anything except the loss due to disturbance of the surface of the ground.  Even the value of <Col N="1939" /> a field in which an ordinary quarry is opened is very considerably impaired and the field is a danger.</P>
      <P>But the opening of a quarry is nothing to the opening of a mine.  I have in mind the silica deposits near Cloyne, in the area where I reside, and while we are always glad when any wealth turns up, and, by the export of such a deposit, money will be brought into the State, at the same time, in every single instance that I know of where these mines were opened, the landholder concerned got practically little or nothing, and the place was more or less destroyed as an agricultural holding.  The prospector has the right already, under the 1931 Act, if he gets a small grant from the mineralogical section of the Minister's Department, to sink shafts here, there and everywhere, make investigations and probably to go very far afield and acquire, as a vast source of wealth for himself, something that rightfully should belong to the owner of the land.  I have also in mind a case where the landlord was able to get a substantial amount while the unfortunate tenant got practically nothing except some slight compensation in the shape of a small royalty on the goods delivered.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that should be safeguarded in this measure, and I should like to draw special attention to it.  That is the export of silica deposits to England or elsewhere.  Where industries in this country require that particular substance to carry on manufacture, they should be supplied.  I am aware of one instance when they could not get it.  The Carrigaline Pottery wanted some silica, and they could only get a limited quantity.  They were not able to get the amount they required, and they had to do with other commodities. That has been already proved through information which was given to myself and other members of the House in a lecture in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give you that information, but I know the material was not available for the pottery work, which should have the first call.  Where we have established an industry by private enterprise and without any great help from the State, that industry should have first call on that material rather than a foreign firm. Those are a few of the factors to which I should like the Minister to give some attention.  There are various forms of this commodity turned out in the parish of Cloyne.  It is put to various uses, one of which is moulds for ironwork.</P>
      <P>I would like to make special reference to the way, under the 1931 Act, in which an industry or anybody who has acquired an option on these deposits can actually hold up the sale of an estate.  The sale of the estate at Rostellan is held up in this particular manner simply because for some reason or other they had not arrived at an agreement with Silica Industries, Ltd. There is another side to the question. There is, for instance, the improvement of roads to the particular deposit or mine, and that has had to be attended to by the local authority.  Will the Minister take over that responsibility or will it still remain part of the duty of the local authority to give assistance in that respect?  I feel that that should be part and parcel of the Minister's responsibility.  We have very valuable marble deposits also. Would marble come under the heading of a mineral that the Minister would control or would it be something that the private owner would still own under the heading of &ldquo;stone&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  What I will ask the Minister to do is to relax in some degree the rather harsh position which he has taken up by insisting on acquiring and giving little or no compensation to the property owner concerned <Col N="1941" /> or the farmer.  I think he will agree that there is an element of harshness entering into that position. A man who has his farm completely destroyed is entitled to something a little more generous than a royalty on the deposits removed.  This matter should be approached from a very different angle than what the Minister proposes.  He says that all that happens to a man's property is the disturbance of the surface of the ground. I am afraid I cannot agree that the disturbance to the surface of the ground is a thing that can be lightly passed over.  These places where minerals or other deposits are may be places with valuable amenities and those would be completely destroyed by the setting up of workings of the kind contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at what my colleague has said in connection with this matter.  I wonder if we could get some information from the Minister as to what was the price paid for the mineral rights in the Cloyne area by Cloyne Company, and if this company has held up the sale of Rostellan, as Deputy Brasier alleges. Is the Minister aware that the silica clay in Rostellan was completely worked out by that company some five or six years ago, and that no work was since carried on in that place?  As a matter of fact, Rostellan was only used as a kind of stalking horse for the purpose of extracting money from the Department of Public Works by that particular company.  They spent about four months making a passage through the sloblands for a ship that never came there.  If these people are holding up the sale or the division of an estate by the Land Commission over an alleged mining right&mdash;in a place where there are no minerals&mdash;we should like to have some information on that point.  I do not know how those people got the mineral rights that they allege they hold.  I have seen one unfortunate individual down there where there was a regular hill of silica.  They would come this month and prowl around there through a corn or wheat field and take out a load, and in six months' time they would take out another <Col N="1942" /> load.  They went across the road then, with the same alleged mining right, and entered on the 20 acres of land belonging to an unfortunate widow.  They insisted on taking a few bags of stuff out of the holes they made here and there in her fields.  They went away and returned in six months' time, dug more holes and took more stuff. I should like to know what are the rights of the ordinary farmer in cases of this kind, and what are the rights. of the alleged mine owners.</P>
      <P>I think the House should be enlightened as to the amount of money given to that particular company, because the allegation in the district is that it got either a grant or a loan from some Government Department. It seems rather amazing that there should be plenty of money for any wild cat scheme of that description that crops up, while there seems to be no money at all for an unfortunate farmer who may have to look for £100 in order to stock his farm.  The allegation, as far as I understand it, is that this company got five or six different loans or grants from the Department.  The position is that there is plenty of work going on while the loan or grant holds, but as soon as it becomes exhausted, the work stops.  There is no more work until there is another pull from the Government.  I honestly think that if the Government have money to throw away in that fashion, it would be far better to give it to farmers in the form of capital to enable them to stock and work their land.  It would be far better to do that than give it to the university professors and buckshee lawyers who are going around the country exploiting unfortunate farmers.  That, at any rate, is what has happened in this particular instance.  I know that of my own personal knowledge&mdash;that you had buckshee professors from the university here and a couple of general schemers called lawyers going down the country and making well out of that area.</P>

      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon.  I have told what has happened, and I have the right to form my own judgment on it.  I want to protest against the manner in which the previous Act was used in that respect. I think it is an outrageous thing that individuals can go in on a farm, dig holes and take away a couple of loads of stuff out of the middle of a field.  At the field that they did enter, there was a road at one side and on the other the hill of silica out of which they took about four tons of stuff in the year.  They had the silica exposed there, but in spite of that they insisted on going in on the 20 acres of land belonging to this unfortunate widow, and in digging holes on her land.  All they offered her was 5/- a time by way of surface damage.  I say that is a shame, and that that kind of thing should be ended.  The unfortunate farmers are not in the happy position of being able to get cheap law which would enable them to follow one of those bucks into the High Court or into the Supreme Court, or the other courts that are the curse of this country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> The farmers, as I have said, are not in the position of being able to follow those people up.  How could that unfortunate widow who has only two cows, four goats and an ass start proceedings in the High Court against the King's Counsellor who had got those mineral rights?  Where he got them I do not know.  The law would be cheap for him because he could get other K.C.'s to act for nothing for him, but the law would not be so cheap for the poor widow, whose lands had been entered on.  I would like to have some explanation as to what has been done in this case, and the reason for doing it.  I only want the people of this country to get fair play.  In my opinion they are not getting that, because of the manner in which these things are being jiggered round.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell us that this is a matter that might be raised under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts.  We find there is a very big difference between going to the Industrial Credit Corporation and the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It might be well if in the case of these bodies there was a swop round.  If the industrial people went over in charge of agriculture for some time we might be able to get a little more money, at the same time giving those in charge of the Agricultural Credit Corporation the opportunity of inquiring into the <i>bona fides</i> of the gentlemen who are at present getting money at 2 and 3 per cent.  If there was a swop of that kind, things might be straightened out.  It is time at any rate that we had some definite explanation about this, because it is common knowledge that the only money spent in the area up to the present has been money obtained either by way of loan or grant here in Dublin.  We, in this House, are entitled to know what was put up against the loans given, and to be told also how much the people who got the loans were supposed to spend out of their own moneys on the enterprise.</P>

Apart from his sympathy for the widow, Deputy Corry made one statement that struck me as being rather peculiar.  He admitted that money was spent in giving work in the area.

It was surely that Deputy's duty to get that situation straightened out and to inform the Minister and the Government, if there were something in the 1931 Act that was not right.  I want to know from Deputy Corry if he will now put down an amendment that will help to rectify that situation.

      <P>There is one anomaly in this Bill that I desire to bring to the Minister's notice.  I am not clear as to whether the Minister can deal with it under this Bill or not.  It relates to the question of the ownership of minerals.  Every tenant purchaser is paying for his farm by means of his annuity.  On his land certificate, or folio, it is stated that his ownership does not apply to the mines and minerals therein.  As far as I understand it, that means that, under the Land Purchase Acts, the mines and minerals are vested in the State.  In fact, however, the money which the tenant purchaser is paying, by way of annuity, represents interest and sinking <Col N="1946" /> fund on the money which the original landlord was paid for that particular farm.  I do not object to a proposal that all mines and mineral rights should be reserved to the State, but you have the peculiar position that where the lands are not subject to the provisions of Land Purchase Acts, the mining and mineral rights are still the property of the original owner.  When, however, it comes to the question of the tenant purchaser, that tenant purchaser is deemed to own his farm, but he does not own the mines and minerals therein because, where the Land Commission bought out the landlord's interest, they did not allow him to transfer these rights to the tenant purchaser.  Yet the tenant purchaser is paying for the whole lot.  He is paying back the entire amount that was advanced to the landlord.</P>

      <P>You have in this country two kinds of ownership in these minerals; they are either owned by the State or by the original landlord. Actually, these people, in my opinion, were very well paid for their land when they were purchased under the 1923 Act.  I do not think there is any justification for compensating these people again for the mineral rights under lands already sold.  If people are going to walk in on my land for the purpose of working mineral rights, and are only to pay me for the surface value of my land, why should somebody whom I have shifted several years ago be allowed to come in and claim payment for the mineral rights?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would read sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the Land Act of 1903, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the sale under the Land Purchase Acts of any land by the Land Commission, or of any land comprised in an estate by the owner of the estate, there shall be reserved, in the prescribed manner, to the <Col N="1947" /> commission the exclusive right of mining and taking minerals and digging and searching for minerals on or under that land, and the said right shall be disposed of by the commission in manner hereafter to be provided by Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Land Commission owns it, the tenant purchaser has paid for it already.  The Minister surely does not tell me that when the Land Commission purchased the farm they fixed the purchase money on the basis of so many years purchase for the surface rights and paid that sum to the original owner?  If the Land Commission got the mineral rights, they got them for nothing.  If these rights are owned by the Land Commission, they are already paid for by the State, and the tenant purchaser is paying back the money to the State by means of his land purchase annuity.  If the lands are not subject to the Land Purchase Acts, they are still in the ownership of people who got them probably by the Plantation Acts of 300 or 400 years ago.  It strikes me as extraordinary that everybody is going to be paid for the mineral rights except the ordinary tenant purchaser.  I cannot for a moment agree with the Minister that the tenant, by means of his land purchase annuity, is paying only for the surface value of the land.  He is paying the Land Commission an annuity to pay off a debt in respect of moneys advanced by the Land Commission for whatever interest the landlord had in the land, whether it was surface rights, minerals, or anything else.  If it were a question of sporting rights, it would be an entirely different matter, because you will find that these sporting rights were either specifically reserved by the Land Commission, were given to the tenant, or were withheld by the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Corry, in 1903, became the tenant purchaser of his farm, and if the advance made for his farm was £1,000, he is now repaying by means of an annuity that £1,000.  The annuity he is paying represents what he owes to the State for what they paid to the landlord, and they certainly did <Col N="1948" /> not pay the landlord any extra moneys for the mineral rights.  On Deputy Cosgrave's assumption, an occasion may arise when the amount of compensation fixed will be less than the amount due to the Land Commission in respect of the redemption of the annuity.  That reveals an extraordinary state of affairs.  A time may come when the Land Commission may walk into the farm and say that the surface value of a farm is less than the balance due to the Land Commission in respect of the holding.  I would prefer to see it stated bluntly that all these mines and mineral rights are the property of the State.  One may say that that means you are going to take away from certain people property they have had for hundreds of years. I do not mind that very much, because there are other people who bought these rights from them and are paying for them by means of their annuities. I believe myself that the sooner you say that the mines and minerals are the property of the State the better.</P>
    <P>The hard-lines story of Deputy Corry's widow with 20 acres makes me almost cry, and it urges me to impress upon the Minister that his Department should have some regard to the surface value of the land.  I do not believe that any farmer should be paid compensation on the bare actual value of the surface of the land, and I hope that when the mining board come to assess compensation, they will take into account the fact that the farmer and his forbears have made a home on that farm for generations.  I do not believe it is fair to any farmer to be walked out of his farm with compensation based on the actual surface value of the land.  The compensation should be assessed on the basis of what it will take to reinstate that farmer on another farm of equal size and value, and what it will take to put that farm into some condition.  We had an extraordinary story from Deputy Corry about this unfortunate widow from East Cork to whom people only paid 5/- every time they entered on her land.  She had 20 acres of land, bounded on one side by the road and on the other by a mountain of silica. She was obviously a friend of Deputy <Col N="1949" /> Corry's, and I am sure a supporter of his, but she was not able to go to the High Court in Dublin.  She was, I presume, a hard-working farmer, but all she had on the 20 acres was two cows, four goats and a donkey.</P>

      <P>There are some aspects of this Bill which the Minister did not mention.  We are all aware that there are minerals in this country, but the extent and value of them are very problematical.  Some Deputies have stressed here, that although certain minerals were mined in Ireland, the people of Ireland could not get a sufficient supply of those minerals. Now, that may be quite possible, because it brings one to what is at the root of the development of a number of these minerals.  Now, a mineral may be found in this country&mdash;and, mind you, it does seem that this is an auspicious time to go into the question of minerals because, in a lot of cases, they have considerably enhanced their value&mdash;but the difficulty is that these minerals have to undergo several processes before they are suitable for being used by the manufacturer.  That, in most cases, is a highly specialised work which requires very expensive plant and equipment, and what happens is that the minerals that are developed over here have to be brought across to the other side, passed through certain processes over there, and then only a a small quantity is sent back.  That brings me to one of the questions that I should like to ask the Minister.  Is it contemplated under this Bill that if, say, some mineral were found here which did look as if the prospect of exploiting it would be profitable to the State or to the country, a duty would be put on supplies of that mineral coming into this country, so as to encourage mining of those minerals in this country?  My reason for asking that question is that, if that is going to take place, a position somewhat analogous to that which arose in connection with certain manufacturers and the Government in their industrial <Col N="1950" /> policy will arise again in regard to this Minerals Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to put this up to the Minister.  Let us say that there is a mineral found here that may look as if it would be a very profitable field for development, and then some change may take place as a result of which it might be found absolutely valueless. There are all sorts of hazards to be taken into consideration, such as changes of manufacture, changes in the taste of the people, and so on, which make wonderful differences in the demand for certain commodities. Take, for instance&mdash;I have only taken this at random&mdash;some valuable deposit of coal being discovered in this country, and let us say that the Government saw fit to put a duty on the import of coal into this country in order to protect the mining of coal here.  I take it, of course, that the effects on other industries would be examined.  In fact, I am afraid they would have to be examined more carefully than some of the reflex actions which took place under the protection granted to manufacturers at present in this country.  Another thing that I should like to ask the Minister is whether he can give us some assurance that there is nothing else but the mining rights contemplated being handed over to any person.  If the State is going to undertake mining, of course that is their hazard, and if an individual is going to undertake it, of course, he undertakes it at his own risk; but in any case, if we are going to have duties imposed, you are entering into a very serious field for speculation, and I should like the Minister to assure us that it was only the protection of the mining that was concerned and that people would not be allowed to step outside of that and take on the distribution or, in other words, the rest of what is concerned in the placing of those minerals in the hands of the inhabitants of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of illustration, let us say that coal, for instance, were found in this country and that it was decided to put a prohibitory tariff on the import of coal.  What I mean is that the distribution and the sale of that coal <Col N="1951" /> should not be given to the manufacturer or to the person who was mining the coal.  I have only used that by way of illustration because, probably, the Minister knows perfectly well what I mean when I say that, in certain industries, by reason of protection, the manufacturers, instead of confining themselves to their own end of the business, which is manufacture, have really gone in for the distribution and sale end which belonged to the native Irish long before the manufacturer was brought on the scene.  If that is going to take place by reason of the provisions of this Minerals Bill I think that some people might yet live to curse this Bill and its provisions. Accordingly, I should like to ask the Minister how far he can give us any information as to whether any protective duties would be imposed in support of the mining interests of people engaged in mining these minerals in this country, and, if so, if rigid safeguards would be provided to prevent these people from encroaching on the legitimate business of other people who have been engaged in the distribution and sale of those products. I think, Sir, that these are all the matters I wish to raise in connection with this Bill, and I hope the Minister will deal with them in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that most of the Deputies who have spoken on this Bill forgot or, perhaps, did not hear me say, that, with the exception of possibly three main provisions and a slight adaptation of the terminology here and there, this Bill is merely a recasting of the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931.  The principal changes have been, first, in relation to Section 4 of the Act of 1931, under which the question as to whether a certain substance was or was not a mineral vested in the Land Commission, upon the vesting of the land, fell to be determined by the Land Commission. I pointed out that this procedure had this disadvantage&mdash;first of all it held up the person who was anxious to work minerals, and in one case it led to prolonged litigation which ultimately ended in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> In order to avoid that in future, we propose to amend Section 4 of the Act of 1931 and to set out definitely and specifically in the Schedule to the Bill a list of the mineral substances which would be regarded as vested in the State under the Land Acts. That is the first change.  The second change was this: the Act of 1931 failed to make sufficient practical distinction between the prospecting for minerals and the working of the mineral deposits with the consequence that persons who wanted to find out whether, in fact, there was a mineral under the soil and, further, whether it was there in sufficient quantities to make the working of it a commercial proposition, found themselves involved in the same troubles, formalities, expense and delay as if they were looking for a mining lease and were satisfied that, in fact, there was a mineral deposit there and that it was in sufficient quantity to make the working of it a commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>The first change that we propose to make is this: first of all, we propose to issue a prospecting licence which will enable a person to go in on land where the Minister is satisfied that there is reasonable ground for doing so, and where he is satisfied, as pointed out under Section 9 of the Bill, as to the character of the applicant for the prospecting licence, his financial standing and technical qualifications; and where the applicant is prepared to give security for the due fulfilment of his obligations under the licence.  In these circumstances the Minister may give a licence to that person to go in, provided that he pays compensation for whatever damage he may do by way of disturbance or injury to the surface of the land.  At the same time there are reserved to the owner of the land whatever rights he has in his mineral deposit if the prospector finds that such a deposit in fact exists.</P>
    <P>We have been listening to what Deputies Brasier and Corry have said about this Bill and the damage that was going to be done to the poor widow, and now, when we consider the position in the light <Col N="1953" /> of what I told the Dáil, what do we find?  First of all, the prospector takes the trouble of applying for a prospecting licence.  He has to satisfy the Minister that he is, in fact, competent to prospect for the mineral. Then he comes to the place where he thinks the mineral is, to the place where the owner had no idea there was a mineral at all, or, if he thought there was, was not prepared to take the trouble and undergo the expense of satisfying himself that it was there and in paying quantities.  Then this qualified prospector walks in and does what the owner of the land failed to do for himself and does it with this risk, that if he does any damage to the surface of the land he is to compensate the owner of the land.  Even then the owner of the land retains all his rights to the minerals if they happen to be there.  We are told that that is a great hardship on the poor widow.  The person who is going to get substantial benefit out of this successful prospecting is the person who has the ownership of the mineral.  In the light of that I fail to understand why there should be all this pother about the way the farm is going to be ruined or about the way in which this or that thing is going to be done by the prospector.</P>
    <P>We are told of the harm that is going to be done by those people who are going to rush in here.  The Government has been urged from time to time to develop our mineral wealth; in fact, the Government has been criticised from time to time for not doing enough to develop the mineral deposits of this country.  In my view, some people have somewhat exaggerated ideas about the value of these deposits.  But here, where we have the Government taking to heart the admonitions of those people who want to see the resources of this country developed, and where we are coming along and taking the first step, then immediately we are assailed by Deputies who have not read or studied the Bill.  We are assailed as if we were doing something that was wrong and something that was calculated to injure the general interests of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> I am not going to be led into a byway about the Cloyne Colloidal Clay Company and as to why it was not able to supply silica to the native company which asked for it.  I am sure there are rather a whole lot of aspects to that question.  But the Cloyne Colloidal Clay Company and the State have sunk a great deal of money in this silica deposit.  Not merely have the State sunk a great deal of money in it, but the founders and promoters of the company themselves have sunk very substantial sums of between £20,000 and £30,000 in that company in order to prove the value of that so-called silica deposit.  One of their difficulties was that they believed that they had silica in a form in which it is very rare, but they failed first of all to find a use for that silica.  They had to discover a process which would make it of commercial utility.  They had to prove to the pottery manufacturers in other areas that, in fact, they would be justified in changing over the whole of their traditional processes so as to be able to use this silica from Cork.  If they had succeeded in that, and if they had induced a number of pottery manufacturers of Great Britain to utilise this Cork silica, there would be no unemployment to-day in East Cork. The company, however, set out to try to do that, and sunk a great deal of their own money in the project.  We felt bound to support them by a Trades Loan Guarantee.  I do not know what the ultimate future of the company is to be.  It may be that the company has been mismanaged.  I have no rights of investigation into the matter.  But it has got to be remembered that the working of these deposits was a purely experimental one, and when a quantity of mineral was taken from one place and found to be unsatisfactory for the purpose the owners of the mining rights had in view, why they had to go to another part of their deposits and see whether the minerals there would be more suitable.  In the light of that fact, I think the attacks which were made upon these men were most uncalled for.  These pioneers, whether lawyers or university professors, sunk over £20,000 of their own money in trying <Col N="1955" /> to exploit these minerals.  I want to say that the attacks made on them are not likely to encourage other persons who have money and ideas to go ahead and try to carry out not the Government programme, but the people's programme, the programme of every Party in the State&mdash;to try to develop whatever resources are in the country.</P>
    <P>The next important difference between this Bill and the Act of 1931 lies in the fact that we have found that, for one reason or another, ordinary private individuals in this country are unwilling to risk their capital in developing such mineral deposits as we have.  That is, perhaps, due to the ill-starred history of mineral development in this country.  Hundreds and thousands of pounds have been lost in it.  The difficulties in the way of developing our minerals and of bringing them to the places where they are likely to be of commercial use are very great.  After the ten years which have elapsed since the Mines and Minerals Act, 1931, was put on the Statute Book, we have had to come to the conclusion that it may be necessary for the State to step in and acquire minerals where we believe they are valuable, where we believe they could be worked, but where they are not being worked, or where they are not being worked efficiently, in order that we may try to make the best use possible of these deposits.  That is the third important difference between this Bill and the Act of 1931.</P>
    <P>Another difference&mdash;it is not of such great importance&mdash;is that a person can get a mining permission to go in and, without actually going through the, perhaps, somewhat expensive process of prospecting, have the right to take away a limited quantity of mineral in order that he may make a preliminary test.  With these four exceptions, I think that the Bill now before the House substantially re-enacts the Mines and Minerals Act, of 1931.  With the four exceptions I have mentioned, I am not asking the House to adopt any new principle in relation to our mines and minerals code.  My predecessor having consulted the legal <Col N="1956" /> advisers felt, on the whole, that in view of the number of very minor alterations which experience has shown to be desirable in the existing Act, it would be much better and much more convenient to have the whole of this mines and minerals code in one Act for easy reference, rather than to bring in an amending Bill with all the difficulties which reference would involve for the lay people who, in the first instance at any rate, would be concerned with this Act.  That is why, instead of an amending Bill, we have a Bill which consolidates the new provisions with the old and repeals the Act of 1931.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me a couple of questions in relation to the mining board with which I should like to deal. Nine applications for mining rights were made to the board set up under the 1931 Act; eight of these were granted and the other was withdrawn; in that case the issue was settled by agreement.  In six of the cases where rights were granted compensation was granted by the board; in the other two cases it was settled by agreement.  The board is not at all an expensive board. I think those who are on it are only paid a daily fee for the days upon which it sits.  In so far as its composition is concerned, that was settled by the Act of 1931, and I do not propose to change it.  The probabilities are that a lawyer was put on because questions of title and of legal interpretation might arise; that an arbitrator was put on because questions of land compensation would arise; and I suppose an officer of my Department was put on because he was familiar with the Act and perhaps because, since a third person had to be found, it was as good to have an officer familiar with the working of the code and with the general policy of the Minister and of the Government as to have any other person.  That is how the board came to be constituted.</P>
    <P>Another point was the question of the omission of the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; in relation to giving a misleading return.  I am not sure whether that is of very great import.  Perhaps, if it were found to be, it might simply mean this: that there are certain circumstances in <Col N="1957" /> which it would be difficult to prove wilfulness, even though wilfulness did in fact exist, and perhaps the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; has been left out by the draftsman in consideration of that position.  I do not think it makes very much practical difference to the operation of the code.</P>

Coal&mdash;we have not very much of it&mdash; is, I suppose, the one mineral deposit for which there would be an immediate sale in this country and which seems to afford possibilities of early development, but the quantity of coal which we should be producing here would certainly not warrant the imposition of any duty in order to keep out supplies from abroad.</P>

      <P>The board does not sit permanently, and, taking it in connection with the Act of 1931, I think that on consideration the Deputy will, perhaps, agree with me that in cases like this, where questions of title arise, it is desirable to have a lawyer on the board.  In fact, he will be chairman. There has also to be an arbitrator, as he has a knowledge of the value of land and is expert in the valuing of property.  There is also a third person: I think that the Act of 1931 prescribed an officer of the Minister responsible for the administration of the Act, as he would be familiar with the code and general policy of the Department and would, perhaps, treat the Act from the point of view of the public, as a checkup. The board is not expensive.  We have had nine hearings, I think, before the board in a period of nine years. The board granted mining rights in eight cases; one case was settled by agreement without having to go to the board.  The board settled compensation in six cases.  In addition, the board is only paid by fee for each sitting, and the number of sitting has not been many.  I think it is as cheap and equitable a way of settling these questions as any other that could be devised.</P>

      <P>The Minister has raised a very nice question about title. I was a member of the Dublin Corporation for about 18 months when I discovered that in connection with one plot of land the compensation was assessed at £9, but the cost of proving title was £59.  There arises in connection with this, the question for the Minister's consideration, when he is bringing this Bill before the Seanad, as to whether he should not take a short-cut through title and have it in the Land Commission.  It is ridiculous to have to pay £59 in order to prove title when there is only £9 compensation. Presumably the arbitrator will hear counsel on both sides, and if he <Col N="1968" /> is able to be satisfied in regard to title I think that should be sufficient.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say what is the meaning of paragraph (b)?  The Land Commission is given a right to decide something there&mdash;&ldquo;such compensation or so much thereof as is payable under such agreement to the Land Commission shall, when received by them, be applied by them, as they think fit, either in discharge of the arrears (if any) of such land purchase annuity or towards the redemption of such annuity or in both of those ways&rdquo;.  The first charge there is the arrears.  I have no faith in the honesty of any public Department of State&mdash;none whatever.  If there are arrears there they let them go and get every penny for themselves, and the county council then has to be at the loss.  The ratepayers are at the loss.</P>

      <P>Under this section, if the amount of compensation is not sufficient to pay up the Land Commission annuity, the occupier of the land in that case will not get 6d.  We will assume there was an advance of £1,000. £200 is paid off, leaving £800.  The arbitration board fixes £600 as compensation.  It is not sufficient to amortize the Land Commission <Col N="1971" /> advance.  Apparently there is nothing then whatever for the occupier.  Is not there something wrong there in proceeding to mine land to make it less valuable than it is?  At the moment the occupier is getting a living out of it.  The Land Commission are getting their money.  An arbitration board, consisting of a barrister and an officer of the Minister's Department, decides that the value of all this is less than would pay out the advance that has been made by the Land Commission. Obviously, in a case of that sort it would be better not to mine that land at all.  Would the Minister look into that point?</P>

      <P>I will, but I think the Deputy is stating an extreme case.  It is difficult to conceive that the compensation given for a mining right that would affect a whole farm would be insufficient to extinguish the land purchase annuity on the farm.  I am not prepared to say that that is not a possibility, but it is difficult to conceive that it would happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not debar him from receiving compensation.  It means that if he bought more than ten years ago and had not worked it since he would have to be content to take compensation by way of royalty on the actual <Col N="1972" /> minerals raised.  In the other case, where he purchased within ten years, or where a person has to pay rent or make an annual payment the board may award compensation in the way of a fixed sum or royalties or in any or all of such forms.  It merely goes on the basis that if a person had mineral rights, which were not exercised for a prolonged period, then he is only entitled to get compensation by way of royalties on the actual quantity of minerals raised.  If, however, his right is subject to the payment by him of a rent, then the Mining Board will take that into account, and presumably provide for the payment of the rent and equal the rent which he is paying. On the other hand, if he bought property within ten years then they could provide for some alternative form of compensation.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1940&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Col N="1974" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to authorise the provision of an additional £6,000,000 for issue as local loans.  The Local Loans Fund was established on a statutory basis on the 1st May, 1935, pursuant to the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935. Section 4 (3) of that Act limited the issues that might be made out of the Fund by way of loans to a total of £5,000,000.  Section 2 of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1937, authorised an additional £6,000,000. Authority is sought in the present Bill to raise the limit to £17,000,000.</P>
      <P>The aggregate of loans issued from the fund from its establishment in 1935 to the 30th June, 1940, was £10,319,309, made up as follows:&mdash;housing&mdash;urban, £2,877,009; rural, £4,387,548; small dwellings acquisition, £658,718; Gaeltacht, £65,857&mdash;a total of £7,989,132; Public Health, £941,865; hospitals and county homes, £736,382; vocational education, £452,711; drainage, £149,593 and other services, £49,626, making a grand total of £10,319,309.  The total commitments of the fund over the same period, including the carryover of loans sanctioned but not issued before the 1st May, 1935, amounted to £13,246,487. As the full amount of a loan is sanctioned before any issue is made on foot of it, and as loans are ordinarily paid out in instalments, the aggregate of loans sanctioned up to a given date will always be substantially in excess of the aggregate of the issues up to that date. The existing statutory limitation of £11,000,000 applies only to issues of loans.</P>
      <P>The issues, aggregating £10,319,309 up to 30th June, 1940, left a balance of less than £700,000 available for subsequent issue.  This should not last beyond about the end of next month. The additional £6,000,000, for which the authority of the Oireachtas is now being sought in Section 2 of the Bill, should suffice for about three years, or up to about the summer of 1943, when fresh legislation will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few subsidiary matters are also <Col N="1975" /> included in the Bill.  Section 3 extends to all borrowers in arrear with payments in respect of local loans the provision in the existing law in the case of local authorities, which enables such arrears to be recovered out of any Government moneys payable to the borrower.  Section 4 applies to borrowers, like harbour boards and public utility societies, the provisions of Section 2 of the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, which gives protection to the Local Loans Fund against evasion of repayment of a loan on the ground that the borrowing body was not properly constituted or exceeded its powers. Section 5 regulates the making of local loans by the Minister for Finance through an intermediate body like the Commissioners of Public Works. Section 6 is designed to remove doubts that have arisen as to the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the making of harbour and other loans.  Sections 7 and 8 are designed to clarify the position as regards the disposal of money received in repayment of loans made before the establishment of the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A danger is apparent in Section 4, that, in the administration of the Local Loans Fund, care which an institution of State like the Local Loans Fund should take, might be omitted.  In the normal course, one would expect that part of the duty of a body in charge of a fund like the Local Loans Fund would be to ensure that the constitution of bodies with which they were doing business, and such matters, would be the subject of special investigation.  There have been cases in which the authority of local authorities was defective by reason of their constitution or for some other cause.  Bodies which were not legally constituted got advances from the fund.  If this provision is inserted, the grip, from the Ministerial point of view, on the money is secured.  However, it ought not to be taken by the Ministry that it is no business of theirs to inquire into the constitution of each body which makes application for these loans or to ensure that the bodies concerned are legally performing their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> In my own experience in connection with local government many years ago, there were cases in which members of local authorities put up the objection that their predecessors had not been acting according to law and that the Local Government Board had responsibility for this position.  The ratepayer, it was argued, should not be saddled with responsibility for burdens illegally incurred by persons who were, for a time, in apparent control of these local authorities.  If the Minister will give an undertaking to the House that there will be no relaxation of vigilance on the part of those responsible for distributing these local loans and that care will be taken to ensure that the bodies are properly constituted and are acting legally, there will not be so much objection to those other clauses, which are, however, very extensive. They are all on one side&mdash;designed to secure the fund against loss.  After all, somebody must pay, and it is scarcely fair to ratepayers in any part of the country that they should be saddled with responsibility for laxity on the part of the central authority when persons in temporary control of local authorities abuse their powers without suitable action being taken by the central body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there should be more care in the lending of money under the Local Loans Fund. In Cork, a group of men, numbering five, was able to get a £10,000 loan from the Board of Works, and it might surprise the Minister to learn that their capital amounted to £7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Their credit was so good that the corporation had to come to the rescue.  We had very strong strictures to pass on the Department which allowed them to get that money without adequate inquiry.  The Board of Works gave £10,000 to them and the local authority gave them £3,500. When about £20,000 had been expended on the houses, the corporation had to come to the rescue.  If they had not done so, somebody might have got <Col N="1977" /> the whole property for £5,000 or £6,000.  It shows a lamentable lack of attention when men with capital amounting to £7 could get loans of £10,000 and £3,500.  Like Deputy Cosgrave, I hope that, in future, when people look for this money, more inquiries will be made as to their credit and their financial status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely at one with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Hickey, that the fullest possible examination should be made by those responsible&mdash;the Ministry of Finance and the Board of Works&mdash;into the <i>bona fides</i> and legal position of every applicant for a loan, whether an individual or a local authority.</P>
      <P>I must say that I was rather surprised to hear that there has been any such liberality and want of due investigation in the case of public authorities, such as in the cases Deputy Cosgrave referred to and in the case that Deputy Hickey referred to.  Since I came into the Dáil, and particularly since I became a Minister, only one case came under my notice where a local authority, or persons acting on behalf of a local authority, claimed that their predecessors, who had got a loan from the fund that was there before the Local Loans Fund was set up in a statutory way, had exceeded their powers or had not acted legally.  I heard of one case; only one case came under my notice.  No doubt Deputy Cosgrave has heard of others.  I am surprised to know there was a number of cases, but I take it that Deputy Cosgrave, who has an intimate connection with local government, does know of cases.  I was under the impression that there was always the very strictest scrutiny and the closest examination of the legal position and the bona fides of every individual and local authority. I thought that was so, and I am sorry to hear from Deputies that there have been cases where there was not that strict examination that should have been carried out.  All I will say is that I will see to it, as far as I, as Minister for Finance, can, that it will not occur in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is that the House should adjourn to-day for a prolonged period.  I think, before it does so, it is only proper that the attention of the Government should be directed to the very serious economic position which exists in the country and the fact that all the indications are that that economic position will become very much worse in the ensuing months.  We have, according to Government statistics, approximately 60,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges.  We know that 31,000 persons are virtually prevented from registering there since they find no advantage by such registration through the operation of the First and Second Employment Period Orders under which that number was deprived of unemployment assistance benefit.  Recently we had the most amazing action of the Department in issuing, for the first time, a Third Employment Period Order under which, according to a reply by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day, 16,700 additional persons were deprived of unemployment assistance benefit.</P>
      <P>Whatever case may be made for the First and Second Employment Period Orders&mdash;and I question whether any case can be made&mdash;there is no reason whatever, no justification whatever, for the making of the Third Employment Period Order.  Under that Third Employment Period Order married men, even those who may have dependents, are deprived of unemployment assistance benefit, not merely if they live in the rural areas, but if they live in towns with a population of 2,000 or possibly 3,000.  As Deputy Harris knows, the operation of the Third Employment Period Order prevents an unemployed man with a wife and six children, living in a town like Kildare, with a population of close on 3,000, from receiving unemployment assistance benefit between June and October.  It prevents a man in a place like Kilcullen, Maynooth, Celbridge or Lucan from obtaining unemployment assistance benefit, notwithstanding that there is no employment in these areas available for such persons and notwithstanding that it is known to the employment exchanges that there is no employment available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> The Department are quite unconcerned whether or not there is employment available.  They make their Third Employment Period Order, and in towns such as I have mentioned, and in rural areas, all these married men, with their dependent wives and children, are cut off from receiving benefit.  Not only are they hungry when they lose such benefit, but they proceed to turn to the local authority, the board of health and the home assistance officer, and they endeavour to extract such sums of money as they can manage to get in order to sustain them during the period when unemployment assistance benefit is not available.</P>
    <P>I should like somebody, on behalf of the Government, to attempt to justify depriving such persons of unemployment benefit in these areas and in these circumstances.  It could not have been done as the result of an inquiry or because the Government believe that employment would be available. The fact that 60,000 people are receiving unemployment benefit is a definite indication that there is no employment available any more than it was available for the 16,700 who were deprived of benefit by the Third Employment Period Order.  I hope the Government will take an early opportunity of reviewing the operation of that order.  I do not think its issue can be justified; I do not think the poverty it has created can be justified, and I hope the Government will realise that an unwise step was taken when that order was issued, and that the equity of the situation demands that the order should be discontinued and the benefit restored to married men with wives and children dependent upon them, where they have been deprived of that benefit.</P>
    <P>The most serious lesson to be learned from these figures is that we still have 60,000 registered as unemployed, that we have 31,000 at present temporarily standing off benefit under the First and Second Employment Period Orders, and a further 16,000 under a Third Employment Period Order.  These orders will cease to operate normally in October.  Those who are losing benefit under the operation of these orders will go back to the employment exchanges <Col N="1981" /> looking for unemployment assistance benefit in lieu of the work which they cannot get.  In October and in November next we will, again, be presented with the situation of having 107,000 persons, if the figure is not higher by then, seeking an opportunity to work, and with no work available for them.</P>
    <P>I think that is a most serious position, one that no Government can contemplate with equanimity.  No Government concerned for the economic welfare of the State can be unconcerned at the existence of such a gigantic unemployment problem in this small State.  One has to remember, too, that that by no means exhausts the wide strata of poverty in the country, because it must be added to by the existence of another problem related to unemployment, namely, the problem of home assistance and outdoor relief.  In March of this year 92,000 people, approximately, were receiving such relief.  With all that you get some picture of the widespread poverty and destitution which exists for many thousands of our people to-day. In a situation of that kind, one which tends to get worse by reason not merely of our national inability to face up to our responsibilities under that problem, but because of international repercussions&mdash;a situation which, as I have said, tends to become very much worse during the next few months&mdash;we are surely entitled to ask what solution the Government have to offer.  Already, those who have experience of industry report that firms, in many instances, have been obliged to curtail their activities due to a falling-off in the demand for goods, and to their inability to obtain raw materials.  One may be sure that during the next six months industry generally will not be able, unless some special steps are taken by the Government in the matter, to retain on their pay-rolls various of the staffs that they are at present giving employment to.</P>
    <P>In view of that we surely are entitled to ask what are the Government's proposals for dealing with a situation of that kind.  Are they still going to allow this problem of unemployment to drift? Are they still going apparently to <Col N="1982" /> tinker with the problem by making available relief schemes for a few weeks or a few months in the year, schemes of work under which men can only obtain employment for three or four days a week, and with that employment only available for them for a few weeks or a few months?  Is there going to be any serious effort made to cut down deeper into the problem to try to find a solution for it, a problem which, if allowed to continue, can have no other effect but to weaken the whole national economic structure, and to create here in our midst a feeling of unrelieved despair such as the continuance of this unemployment problem has inevitably created in the past?</P>
    <P>We were discussing a few moments ago the question of extending the Local Loans Fund so as to make money available for advances in various directions. That reminds me of the very serious position which has arisen in the building industry.  According to statistics issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce, 10,500 building trade workers are unemployed.  That number would be still larger were it not for the fact that, in recent months in particular, a substantial number of building trade workers went to England, Scotland and Wales to try to find employment there.  This country has lost their skill, and their families have had to do without them, but those workers realised apparently that the position in the building industry here was so bad, and was likely to get worse, that they felt it preferable to go across to Britain to obtain employment in the building trade there rather than carry on here under a condition of affairs which held out no prospect of their being absorbed into employment.</P>
    <P>While that is so, you have this position in the country: that you want, and still want, thousands and tens of thousands of houses for our people. There is a housing shortage on the one hand, and on the other hand we have 10,500 building trade workers idle and unable to get the opportunity to build houses, although the Minister introduced a Bill to-day to enable another £6,000,000 to be made available for house-building activity.  Is it not possible for the Government to find some means of harnessing the unemployed <Col N="1983" /> building trade workers to the necessity for erecting more houses, and of utilising the State's credit to ensure that these three elements can be brought together and applied to a solution of the housing problem?</P>
    <P>Another matter which in recent months has pressed with extreme rigour on all classes of the community, and in particular on the working class section of the unemployed, is the rapid rise in the cost of living.  Again, according to Government statistics, the cost-of-living index figure, taking July, 1914, the base as nought, was 73 in mid-August, 1939.  The figure had risen to 104 by May of this year, and the declarations which issue weekly from the Department of Supplies indicate that an ascertainment of the figure now would clearly demonstrate that it is higher than the figure which obtained in mid-May last.  You have, therefore, the position by which the cost-of-living index figure has risen by 31 points between August of last year and May of this year.  That would be a very substantial increase at any time within such a short period, but it is a particularly rapid increase at a time when large sections of our people are living under conditions inevitably associated with long periods of unemployment. It does not need a vivid imagination to realise the serious effects which such a substantial increase in prices has upon all citizens. A still less vivid imagination will suffice to picture the position of rural workers and town workers subsisting on a small wage, and of unemployed workers subsisting on the miserable pittance obtained under the Unemployment Assistance Acts&mdash;to realise the hardship which that substantial increase in the price of commodities has inevitably inflicted upon them.</P>
    <P>To get a picture of what that hardship is, it is only necessary to go back to 1933 when the Unemployment Assistance Act was first introduced. In that Act we set out to provide certain rates of unemployment assistance benefit, and, obviously these rates were related to what the cost of commodities was in 1933.</P>
    <P>According to the Department's <Col N="1984" /> records, the cost-of-living index figure in 1933 was 49, and when the figure was at that level, we provided certain scales of unemployment assistance benefit.  Now the figure is 104, an increase of 55 points since 1933, and we continue to pay the same rates of benefit, the same miserable pittances as in 1933, although an examination of the figures will clearly demonstrate that whatever 13/- or 14/- purchased in 1933, it is purchasing a substantially smaller quantity of food to-day.  We have tried by Parliamentary question and debate to awaken the Government to a realisation of the hardships which are endured by tens of thousands of our unemployed people who are endeavouring to subsist on these rates. We have tried to awaken the Government to a realisation of the fact that these rates were related to a certain price level of commodities, that that price level has been departed from very radically, and that the benefits provided for in 1933 do not purchase anything like the same quantity of commodities that could be purchased then.  The Government so far has shown no realisation of the hardships and the sufferings endured by those who are, unfortunately under our scheme of society, condemned to exist on rates of that type.</P>
    <P>I should like either of the two Ministers present to picture the situation of a man with five or six children paying a rent of 3/6 a week to a local authority&mdash;and many of them have to pay a higher rate&mdash;trying to keep himself, his wife and six children out of an all-in income of 14/- a week.  That leaves 10/6 to feed a family of eight people for seven days in the week and give them three meals a day.  Yet that is the condition of affairs to which we are sentencing, and sentencing with the utmost complacency, thousands of our unemployed people to-day.  I hope again that the Government will realise that that condition of affairs cannot continue.  The money you save by not increasing such miserable rates of benefit shames whoever saves it.  The State can never prosper by saving money while permitting that condition of affairs to continue.  I hope the Government will take early steps to revise the scale of unemployment <Col N="1985" /> assistance benefit and fix new rates on a scale which will at least enable these poor people to purchase the barest necessities of life.</P>
    <P>Widows and orphans were similarly granted certain rates of benefit when the prices of commodities were at a certain level.  By reason of the rapid increase in prices, the value of the income which widows and orphans receive in the form of pensions, whether contributory or non-contributory, was correspondingly decreased in proportion as prices increased.  The position of widows in receipt of pensions&mdash;those in receipt of non-contributory pensions particularly&mdash;is, to-day, deplorable in the extreme. Similarly, old age pensioners who, in 1933 had an old age pension of 10/- a week at a time when the cost-of-living figure was 49, are still compelled to try to exist on that 10/- a week, although the cost-of-living figure has risen to 104.  These are facts which no Government can blink.  It is easy to realise the widespread hardship and deep sufferings of people who are placed in a situation of that kind. Here in this legislative assembly, the bigger international issues of the moment may obscure a realisation of what is happening in the high-ways, the by-ways and the lane-ways throughout the country, but a visit to them occasionally gives us some conception of the amount of hardship and poverty which is being endured by people living in conditions such as I have described. Their problem every day in the week is the problem of trying to buy food, to buy clothes, to pay rent and to discharge the other responsibilities which our Constitution imposes upon them but which it does very little to assist them to discharge.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any Party capital out of a situation of this kind. I believe to-day, as I believed always, that the problem of poverty is not a Party problem.  It is a reproach to our conception of humanity, and it is an indictment of our conception of values, that we can pay so much attention to some things which have an artificial value for us while allowing human beings to subsist under conditions which are a reproach to our vaunted Christianity.  On this question, I plead <Col N="1986" /> for the creation of some national thinking box, for the creation of some organisation that will apply itself to an examination of this economic problem as it exists in the country to-day, for some national thinking box that will realise the environment surrounding that problem and the circumstances in which it arose and which it had been allowed to continue for the past 20 years.  I would hope that even to-day the Government would realise that there is a necessity for setting up in this country a body&mdash;if necessary an all-Party body; if not an all-Party body, a body concerned with social and economic problems representative of the various groups in the nation&mdash;to apply its brains to a survey of our economic problems in the hope that by national co-operation, whether through political Parties or industrial groups, it will be possible to evolve in the course of time, a solution of the problems to which I have adverted here.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made to the Government through the Trade Union Congress and this Party, that an economic council might be established to plan, even now, to deal with the problem of unemployment and underemployment, to deal with the problem of artificial and endemic poverty, to try to eliminate from our national life the criminal waste involved in having over 100,000 people idle in a relatively undeveloped country, in a country the agricultural and industrial potentialities of which have been scarcely scratched.  I think it is desirable we should do that now; we have postponed doing it too long.</P>
    <P>There is even a greater reason why we should create an organisation of that kind than the necessity of dealing with the present problem, serious though that is.  The present European war will be settled one of these days. Its duration will determine in a large measure the condition of Europe during the next generation.  We live in Europe; we are part of the European family of nations.  We can never hope to escape the repercussions of the military conflict in Europe.  Undoubtedly the termination of that war will create problems for us, and every problem <Col N="1987" /> that affects Britain as a result of the war will have its repercussions here.  For one thing, tens of thousands of Irishmen and women who now get employment there will probably be sent back to this country.  When this military spree is over the headaches will have to be paid for.  It may well be that this country will find itself in a situation in which it will not be able to provide for its own unemployed and in which it will have clamped on top of these, thousands of our people from Britain, who will come back here hoping to get work which will probably be denied to them there.  Yet there is no organisation in this country to-day thinking about that problem at all.  It is useless to imagine that any busy Minister could attempt to apply himself to a solution of that problem, or to think of that problem in any profound way, or, possibly, to frame in his own mind any solution of that problem, even in the sketchiest of ways.  I plead for the establishment of some organisation which will survey our national problems, which will ascertain our potentialities, which will ascertain our manpower, and which will ascertain the agricultural and industrial possibilities of the nation, and I hold that, with that information before them, the Government should endeavour to find a solution of the very serious economic problems which exist to-day.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that this suggestion of the establishment of an economic council used to be a pet child of the Taoiseach and that, in former days, he pleaded for the establishment of such an economic council.  I think that he was then reasoning on sound economic lines, but since that, however, I am afraid he has thrown over that idea of an economic council, just as he has thrown over some other ideas, and I suggest that if it is not the idea of the Government now to plan national economic development or to endeavour to provide a solution of our economic problems, we should be told that to-day before the Dáil adjourns until the 2nd October.  I suggest that we should be told what are the Government's plans for dealing with the situation <Col N="1988" /> in which we find ourselves to-day. We have endeavoured to provide a solution for these problems, and we have endeavoured to grapple with them in a co-operative way, and we wish to assist in any way that is within our power, because the victims of this depression and this chronic misery are our own kith and kin.  It is in that spirit that we approach this matter, and only in that spirit, and if the Government is not willing to do what we suggest to deal with the problem, then I hold that we are entitled to know what are the Government's alternative proposals for dealing with it.  If our proposals are not acceptable to the Government, then I think that we are entitled to know what the Government's alternative proposals are, if they have any.  These problems are very serious, and something should be done to grapple with them and prevent them from becoming more serious than they are, if not to eradicate them altogether.  Let us hope that this debate will afford some opportunity to the Government to tell the House and the country what it intends to do in order to grapple with these very serious economic problems&mdash;problems that are very serious now and that are calculated to be more serious in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The eyes of the country are naturally turned to-day to what is happening in Leinster House, because of the rather infrequent meetings of the Dáil that have been taking place recently, but a good many citizens of this country will look in vain if they think they will find anything on the agenda of to-day's meeting of the Dáil, after a lapse of six weeks, dealing with the economic situation in this country such as Deputy Norton has described. We have had all kinds of legislation on the agenda to-day, dealing with matters that may be of interest or may not, but it would appear as if the question of the economic depression that exists in this country must be hidden from the eyes of Deputies in this House, and I think it is an indication of the fact that these things cannot be concealed that the Government, for some reason or other, are trying to conceal the fact that the <Col N="1989" /> problem is there or to shelve its discussion.  I say to the Government that you are not going to solve these problems by shelving them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton has given the figures with regard to the unemployed, and those are the Government's own figures.  The only contribution that the Government has made with regard to that problem in recent months was that inglorious episode of the Third Period Order.  Even with the example given to-day of 16,700 people being stricken off the unemployment roll as a result of that Order, and thereby deprived of any sustenance whatsoever, I think it would be no exaggeration to say, making a conservative estimate of the families of these people, that there must be some 60,000 whom the Government have picked out to be deprived of employment and, indeed, of any sustenance whatsoever.  These people have been struck off the unemployment list as a result of that Order and no provision has been made for them since.  If you take these, in conjunction with the other people who were struck off under the Nos. 1 and 2 Period Orders, I think that the number so affected could be easily arrived at. I want to tell the Government that, as a result of this Order, something like 68,000 persons have been deprived of the means of subsistence in this country without any explanation being given by this Government.  The Government have made no attempt to employ them, and they say that they have no employment for them.  We were told on a former occasion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there was plenty of work to be done as a result of the Compulsory Tillage Order, and we also understood that the Minister had some other scheme in his mind.  The Minister was asked why he should wait until that sacrosanct date, the 6th June, before providing that work, but the fact is that the Government did not wait, and that willy-nilly they struck these people off the unemployment roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who lives in the country&mdash; and I challenge any Deputy here who has experience of the country to deny it&mdash;must know that in the small towns in the country we have these people <Col N="1990" /> manfully doing their bit to cut turf and save it as a result of the Government's appeal, but they cannot eat the turf.</P>
    <P>I think it is a pitiful thing that, in any Christian country, we should have such conditions existing, and yet, although we only meet for one day between June and October, we find nothing on the agenda for this day's meeting of the Dáil to deal with that problem. We are all very glad and proud of the harmonious response that has been made to he appeal of the Government by every section of the community in the national emergency.  Both rich and poor&mdash;with the emphasis on the latter&mdash;have rallied to the call of the Government in the present emergency. What has been the response of the Government?  The unemployed have been called upon for the digging of air-raid shelters, and they have responded, although we have been told that the unemployed did not want work.</P>
    <P>We were called upon to repudiate that <i>canard</i>, but I think it has been repudiated sufficiently by these half-hungry men who were called from the labour exchanges to dig these air raid shelters and who responded so well, but we have cases now where men who were employed in excavating these trenches, some of whom got blood poisoned fingers as a result of their work there have been struck off from the labour exchange, and rightly so, if you like, because of the operation of the Act.  That is the thanks they have got for their response.  That is what they have got for going down to dig these trenches.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that it is a very unwise policy for them to act like the ostrich and stick their heads in the sand and ignore the existence of these problems.  The existence of the present situation cannot be unknown to the Government.  They cannot be so much remote from affairs as to be ignorant of the poverty and misery that exist.  Deputy Norton has dealt very fully with the matter so far as statistics are concerned.  We are all aware at the moment of what the purchasing power of money is.  Take the case of old age pensions.  Nobody ever dreamed of taking an old age pension as being worth more than 10/- a week, <Col N="1991" /> but now, with the change that has taken place in the value of money, have we not reason to be assured of the fact that these veterans of ours are still expected to be able to carry on with a pension of 10/- a week which is not worth more than 7/6 at the very outside?  Money has gone down by at least 25 per cent. in value.  Then, what about a widow who is given 5/- a week? There are plenty of them trying to live on that amount, with this corresponding decrease in the value of purchasing power of money.  In spite of all this, we have not had one word from the Government to suggest that they are going to take serious stock of the situation or to deal with that section of the community who are living, or endeavouring to live, on these fixed incomes. Apart from that, there are plenty of workers in the ranks of the Government services who are working at standard wages, and who also stand to lose as a result of that decrease in the value of the purchasing power of money.</P>
    <P>The workers who are organised throughout the country have been able to secure through their organisation from private employers a reasonable war bonus on their wages.  Notwithstanding the ukase in the Budget statement that the Government have set their faces against all increases regardless of the rise in the cost of living, the workers have succeeded in getting from private employers a reasonable war bonus.  Hence the only people who are suffering are the unfortunate widows, the old age pensioners and the employees of the Government themselves.  While the agenda has not been smudged to-day by the appearance of anything indicating a change of heart on the part of the Government, there has been some hope encouraged by the introduction of a Bill entitled an Act to make provision by the local authorities of works of public utility and to provide for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith. Were the Government sufficiently broadminded or wise to the fact, they could make the provision to read as to whether it is a continuation <Col N="1992" /> of the doles and grants given to local authorities.  What is the necessity for calling it an Act at all?  It is only a continuation of doles of two or three days' work a week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has suggested that the time has gone for tinkering with this problem and that the time has come for the Government to decide that the wisest policy is wise spending and the utilisation of the brawn and brains of the people properly applied. That is the biggest asset we have in this country.  Will we ever have the courage to face up to the fact that the unemployed are our people and that these and the people I have mentioned are entitled to a living just as well as we are, that they are prepared to do their bit and that the job of the Government is to bridge the gulf between the unemployed and the work to be done?  We can provide plenty of money for all kinds of purposes except when it comes to boil down to the provision of the necessaries of life.  In conclusion, I join with Deputy Norton in the appeal he has made.  We are not looking for political capital out of this question.  It is an unpleasant thing to discuss.  We are prepared to offer our services in any shape or form in joining with the Government in solving the problem, but we feel it our duty to shock the Government into a sense of the irresponsibility that they have shown up to now in dealing with a matter that is so vital to our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>All sections of the people have shown a wonderful response to the appeal of the leaders of all Parties to co-operate in the efforts towards making this country strong and independent and in preserving our neutrality.  It seems that this House and the Government have not made a fair effort to meet that noble response on the part of the people.  They have not made a reasonable effort to meet the response of the working people, the ordinary workers and the unemployed who have in every town and village turned almost to a man to join the Local Security and the Defence Forces also.  Surely the least these men should expect from the <Col N="1993" /> country which they are prepared to defend with their lives, is a living. Surely those men are entitled not to doles or home assistance but to regular constant work that would enable them to live independently and decently in this country.  So far, however, no effort has been made to meet that reasonable demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers, as a body, have always condemned the dole as demoralising and degrading in the first place and also injurious to their interests.  But the farmers have never demanded or suggested that the abolition of the dole should not be accompanied by the provision of work for the unemployed. Therefore, the first step on the part of the Government before abolishing unemployment assistance should have been to ensure that regular constant work would be provided for everybody. It has been frequently suggested that there is not money available for the purpose, and also that there is not work available in the district.  As far as money is concerned everybody knows that such things as food, clothing and the essentials of life are really money.  The labour of the now unemployed people in this country, if properly organised and diverted, can be converted into food, fuel and the ordinary necessaries of life.  There is no difficulty with regard to the problem except the question for organisation, direction and leadership. As far as work is concerned there is no shortage of work in any part of the country.  I know that there is a difficulty facing this country with regard to certain food supplies.  We know there is a difficulty with regard to fuel supplies.  Yet if the men who have been unemployed in the last six months had been employed in the provision of fuel there would be no shortage.  There would be an enormous surplus of fuel available in the country.  The same applies to a great extent to necessary food supplies.  We know that while we have a surplus of certain commodities, there are other commodities of which there is a shortage.  So far no effort has been made to organise or encourage production of those commodities of which there is a shortage. One of the remarkable features of the <Col N="1994" /> ordinary life of this country is the fact that the health of the population generally is not improving, notwithstanding the fact that enormous sums are being spent annually under the Medical Charities Acts on medicines and hospitals and upon every artificial means of preserving human life.</P>
    <P>But what has been neglected is the most important, namely, the provision of adequate nourishment for our people, and particularly our young people.  It seems to me that the Government have never got down to the root of that problem.  They have never, perhaps, realised how important it is for our young people in the early stages of their life to be provided with the necessaries of life.  They have endeavoured to make certain limited provision for the unkeep of the destitute and the unemployed and to make that provision out of the limited resources of the State.  But they should realise that, as long as this State has to maintain a very large percentage of its people unemployed, its resources will always be limited.  Therefore the first essential is to increase production by increasing employment.</P>
    <P>There are various simple means by which the wealth of this country could be increased by utilising unemployed labour without any cost to anybody. We have, as I mentioned, the development of our peat resources.  Similar action could be taken in regard to the conversion of rough timber and old wood into fuel.  There again the unemployed could be usefully set to work.  There is also the clearing and reclamation of what is called waste land, land which is overgrown with furze or heath, but land which could be easily put into production.  That is a type of work which would be immediately reproductive.  These are works which could be put in hand without any great organisation, without the need for any great experts, either Irish or foreign.</P>
    <P>Again we have the position that poverty not only exists amongst the working classes and the unemployed, but that there is also a very wide measure of poverty and destitution existing amongst other sections of the <Col N="1995" /> community who are supposed to be independent&mdash;farmers, small shopkeepers, and people of that kind who find, owing to the higher cost of living and, in the case of small business people, owing to the various restrictions on their business, that it is impossible to make ends meet.  Then there is the position of the farmers who find that every article which they require on their farms has been increased in price, while the price of the products of their land is drastically restricted and controlled.</P>
    <P>A question as to the price of wool was raised to-day.  There we have a position in which the poorer section of our farmers, farmers on the mountainy lands and the poorer lands generally, find that their chief source of income is cut away.  They find that wool is now unsaleable.  It might be well to ask the Government if they have allowed any wool or wool products to be imported into this country during the past six months.  If they have, I am afraid that they have been very neglectful in their duty.  They have neglected a very grave problem, I am afraid.  It may be said that Irish wool is unsuitable for Irish uses.  But, in a case of emergency, I think the Government should see to it that Irish woollen mills and the Irish people generally should be satisfied with their own products.  I should be very anxious to know if the import of wool or wool products is still being permitted at a time when Irish wool is unsaleable.</P>
    <P>Then again nothing is being done to assist the people who have increased their acreage under tillage and who, because their land is not suitable for growing wheat, have concentrated mainly on the growing of oats and now find the produce of their labour unsaleable also.  Some urgent measures should be adopted to ensure that these people will secure a market for at least portion of their oats and that some provision will be made to enable them to hold over the balance until the spring.  It has been suggested by the Minister for Agriculture that farmers should use the oats exclusively as a <Col N="1996" /> feeding stuff on their farms.  Anybody who knows anything about farming knows that on farms which are suitable for the growing of oats it is impossible or extremely difficult to grow wheat and barley.  It is hard to understand how a Minister could expect a farmer to produce a food ration for live stock exclusively out of oats, or how a farmer growing ten or 12 acres of oats could utilise that quantity upon his own farm.</P>
    <P>If some steps were taken by the Government it should be possible to provide a market for that oats and enable it to be distributed to other parts of the country where it is not grown.  Such a scheme is necessary and unless it is provided there is going to be very widespread poverty and destitution in the areas where oats are grown extensively.  What will happen is that the farmers will be forced to sell their oats at any price they can obtain.  Merchants perhaps will take a chance and buy it at the smallest possible price in the hope that they may be able to make a profit out of it later. But the unfortunate producers will be forced to sacrifice it.  No benefit will be derived from that sacrifice by any section of the people, except perhaps a very few who are prepared to speculate.</P>
    <P>That is a problem to which the Government should face up.  If they want the farmers to extend and increase the acreage under tillage they must give them an adequate return or ensure that they get an adequate return for their labour.</P>
    <P>The same considerations apply to farmers who are being very severely pressed for bank debts.  I understand that in the last few months banks, for one reason or another, have been most zealous in seeking to collect debts from farmers.  That is not a thing which the Government should tolerate. They should at least ensure that the banks, as the most important financial institutions in the country, should take some interest in the economic condition of the country and avoid putting people engaged in the most important industry in the country out of production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> The same applies to land annuities. Some relaxation of the pressure in respect of the collection of land annuities was expected, at least during the last two or three months, when farmers were engaged in extending their operations on their farms.  They could not be expected to have the necessary capital, not only to finance increased production and increased employment on their farms and, at the same time, to act on the advice of the Minister for Supplies and to lay in additional supplies, while the most extreme pressure was being brought to bear upon them by the officials of the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Justice.  These are things to which the Ministers responsible should give serious consideration during the next few weeks.  They should see that every unemployed man is put to work on the production of food, on the production of fuel and the provision of necessary housing accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government which has told us repeatedly that we are in imminent danger of invasion has decided to-day to adjourn this House for two months, and I think it only right and proper that, before agreeing to such an adjournment, we should hear something from the head of the Government, or from one of his Ministers, of what he thinks is the present position of the country and of what the Government's plans are for dealing with the situation which, I am sure, they know will confront the country during the coming winter months.  I have travelled around a great portion of the country, and particularly of my own constituency, in the past couple of months and I admit that I have never seen the country look so well and have never seen so much tillage.  Provided the clerk of the weather adopts a friendly attitude towards the farmer, we are likely to have perhaps one of the best harvests in the country's history, but if, as I hope we will, we are going to have such a good harvest, I think that, so far as one can judge from present conditions, there is going to be less money available amongst the poorer classes to buy <Col N="1998" /> the increasing quantity of food that will be available to feed themselves and their dependents.</P>
      <P>There is evidence in the Government statistics published from time to time that there has been no reduction in unemployment compared with last year.  The fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the instructions of the Government issues a first, second or third period order and by the operation of such orders wipes so many registered unemployed from the register, is no proof that the number of unemployed has been reduced. This Government&mdash;it is not necessary for me to quote again the Taoiseach on these matters&mdash;took upon itself the responsibility of providing work for the unemployed.  I remember the Taoiseach and his Ministers, when they sat on this side, censuring on many occasious the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the previous Government for making the statement in the House that it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for the unemployed. They took on that responsibility and that responsibility involved the provision of work at the expense of the taxpayers and not of the ratepayers. They regarded it as their duty to provide the money from the Central Fund for the provision of work and I admit that they proceeded for some time to make an attempt to give effect to these pledges and promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say quite definitely that the issue of a Third Period Order for the first time this year and the wiping of so many married men with dependents off the labour exchange register has not had the effect of providing employment for those who were wiped off the register, and I ask the Minister on that point to give us the number of persons whose names were struck off the register as a result of that order who, to the knowledge of the labour exchanges, found employment and the number of days for which employment was found by them.  The number of persons struck off as a result of the order was given to us here to-day, and repeated by Deputy Norton.  How many of these married men with <Col N="1999" /> dependents were provided with employment through the machinery of the local labour exchanges?  I say that the majority of them were merely transferred for maintenance purposes from the Central Fund to the local ratepayers, and if the Minister wants evidence of that, will he quote for us the increase in the amount of money provided by boards of health compared with the amount provided in the corresponding week or month last year for the maintenance of the unemployed population?</P>
    <P>I know that in my constituency&mdash;and I have discussed this matter with some of the local officials&mdash;there has been a considerable increase this year compared with last year for the provision of home assistance as a result of the coming into operation of the Third Period Order.  I know that the same position exists in other Midland counties and information on that point has been supplied to different Ministers. If that is so, it merely goes to show that the responsibility for the relief of unemployment has been transferred from the Central Fund to the fund provided by the ratepayers in the localities in which these unemployed people reside.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to a suggestion recently put forward to the Government for the setting up of an economic council or an economic advisory committee.  That suggestion has been turned down and reasons have been given for turning it down. If there is no necessity for the establishment of an economic council, it must be assumed that the Government has a plan or policy for a solution of the unemployment problem and of all the other problems that arise from it. If they have a plan, I say that it is their duty, on the eve of the adjournment of the House for two months, to produce their plan and to give the House and the country information as to how they propose to deal with the situation during the coming winter. In the ordinary course of events, we are going to have less employment provided out of State funds this year than was provided last year, and if <Col N="2000" /> any evidence on that point is required it can be found in the Estimates for the Land Commission and for the Department of Local Government.  It can be discovered by those who study the Estimates that there is considerable reduction in the amount provided this year under cover of the Land Commission for the improvement of estates.  There is a reduction in the Estimates for the Department of Local Government of not less than £250,000 for the provision of houses for our population at present living in condemned houses.</P>
    <P>It is well-known that in many parts of the country housing activities have been suspended, not altogether because of a shortage of money, but because there is a shortage of material, apparently, as well as a shortage of money.  Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;if he speaks in the debate&mdash;deny that such is the case? Shortly after they were elected in 1933, the Government decided&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;to set up a Banking Commission. That body of financial experts sat for a period of four years and reported at the end of something like that period.  The publication of the report was held up for some time but, in any case, it has been in the hands of the Government for almost two years. I should like to know from the Minister who will speak in this debate whether the Government, after a period of six years, have yet made up their minds as to whether they are going to take any action arising out of the majority or any of the minority reports of the Banking Commission.  The Taoiseach told this House shortly after he was elected as head of the Government, that, if he could not solve the unemployment problem within the present system he would go outside the system in order to do so.  That was in the early part of 1932 and this is the 7th August, 1940: he should have been able to make up his mind, as a result of the experiments and experiences he has had during the intervening seven years, as to whether he hopes to solve this problem within the existing financial system.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this <Col N="2001" /> country to-day who would not listen to proposals for the changes that were made a year or two ago in the existing system.  I do not know what view the Taoiseach holds in that matter but surely, inside a period of seven years, he ought to have been able to make up his mind as to whether in this land, which is full of plenty of wholesome food this year, the people who work and those for whom work cannot be provided are to be given food in order to maintain themselves and their dependents.  As Deputy Norton pointed out&mdash;and as it was also pointed out by Deputy Keyes&mdash;money can be found in millions&mdash;I am sure that will not be denied&mdash;for the purchase of implements of destruction or, if you like, implements of protection.  If money can be found so freely for guns and implements of destruction of that kind, surely in a Christian country under a Christian Constitution, we can find the money to provide work for our unemployed so as to enable them to provide food, clothing and shelter for themselves and their dependents.</P>
    <P>If money can be found for implements of destruction in this year, surely in the same year we should be able to find the same amount of money as was found last year for the erection of houses for those living in condemned dwellings.  I agree that, at the moment, and perhaps, for the next month or so, the conditions in the rural parts of the country may not be anything worse than they were last year: in fact, I am prepared to admit that they may be something better and that that position is likely to continue until the end of the harvest period; but I do seriously say that the position in the towns, villages and cities, with the increasing number of unemployed and with the increase in the cost of living, is going to constitute a very serious problem confronting the Government before this House resumes its sittings on the 2nd October.  I hope, therefore, that we will get some indication of the plans that were decided upon to meet the situation which exists in the cities, towns and villages of the country to-day and also a detailed outline of the Government's plans for the provision of work and for <Col N="2002" /> the maintenance of the civilian population during the coming winter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the credit facilities which are being provided by our banks.  I agree that he suggested that credit facilities which the Minister for Supplies told everybody on the wireless one night were being made available have not been made available. Any credit facilities worth talking about that have been made available for the purchase of necessary supplies have been made available to our importers and not to our traders. Many cases have been brought to my notice where people in country towns, anxious to respond to the request of the Minister for Supplies to purchase food, coal and other necessary commodities and store them, could not get them from the local traders because the bankers locally would not give those traders the facilities which the Minister for Supplies stated would be available.  Of what use is it to give unlimited credit facilities to coal importers to bring coal into this country at a peak price and at a time when there is no other market for British coal in any country in the world, and not give facilities to the local traders to buy the coal from the importers and sell that coal to people in the country towns and villages?</P>
    <P>Cases have been brought to my notice, and I have made representations to the banks concerned, where banks have been pressing country traders more so this year than last year.  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues, and the Government generally, to look into that very serious aspect of the economic position.  The Minister for Finance said to me some time ago&mdash;I think it was during the Budget discussion&mdash;that the bankers had been opening their purses much wider&mdash;and that he could prove that to me&mdash;than they had been doing in previous years.  I agree that they have been giving credit to the people who do not want the money, to the people who have the credit; but they are not giving it to the people who require credit in order to feed the community and in order to meet their <Col N="2003" /> reasonable requirements on the usual short-term credits which were available many years ago.  The banks in England have been taken over by the British Government, but there is no move in this country, as far as I can see, to make better credit facilities available to the people in urgent need of them.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the Government set up the Banking Commission and we are still waiting to hear what the Government thinks of anything contained in their very lengthy document. They set up a Drainage Commission, and I am not quite sure at the moment whether that commission has handed its report to the Minister for Finance or to his Parliamentary Secretary.  I assume that there must be some kind of proposals contained in the report of the Drainage Commission.  A preliminary report has already been submitted which should provide useful work for the people in the rural parts of the country.  I wonder, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaks on the matter, will he give us any information as to whether the report of the Drainage Commission has been received so far and, if not, what action, if any, has been taken or is being taken as a result of the preliminary report of that body which was submitted some time ago.</P>
    <P>I have given up hope of getting any satisfactory answer from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the reports of the Transport Tribunal.  I trust it will not be an offence under the Emergency Powers Order if I mention it in this House on this occasion.  Two reports were submitted by that tribunal which was set up by a decision of this House in the early part of December, 1938.  The reports were submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 4th and 11 August last year.  I have sufficient knowledge to say here&mdash;and I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not contradict me &mdash;that the financial position of the principal transport concern of this country has been very unhealthy for some considerable time.  I have been supplied <Col N="2004" /> with a copy of the evidence which has been tendered by various parties who appeared before that tribunal and I know that proposals were submitted to the tribunal which, if accepted by the tribunal and which, in turn, if accepted by the Government, would mean the provision of a considerable amount of additional employment in modernising our existing transport services.  I know, in fact, that as a result of the shortage of money many new works which it was intended to carry out during this year have had to be suspended.  To some extent, unemployment has been created as a result of the failure of the principal transport concern to find the necessary money to carry out maintenance works which are essential and reconstruction of rolling stock and works of that kind which, if carried out, would give a large amount of additional employment.</P>
    <P>In view of the danger of invasion that exists&mdash;and I know it exists&mdash;I have been wondering what is to be the position of the principal transport concern in this country in such circumstances. Is there any country in the world to-day where there is so little Governmental control over the principal transport industry as there is in this part of Ireland to-day?  There is much more Governmental control over the transport services in the Six Counties of the North than is exercised in this State by our own Government. I do not want to go into that, but I think it is an essential part of our defence scheme to have very effective control over our transport services and I think it is not right that the principal transport concern in this country should be under private ownership when we are threatened with an invasion.  I put that point to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have put that point elsewhere as a matter for very serious consideration.  I am not now suggesting that the Minister has overlooked that matter but, at the same time, I am not aware of any action that has been taken to take more effective control of the principal transport concern of the country in the dangers which exist to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> I repeat what Deputy Norton and Deputy Keyes have said: These questions are not being raised for Party or political purposes.  We are entitled, however, to know and the people of the country are entitled to know on the eve of a two months' adjournment what is the Government's view of the economic position and what are their plans, if any, for dealing with the situation which is bound to grow worse as the weeks go by.  I am aware&mdash; and nobody has better information on this point than the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that, as a result of the shortage of raw materials, industries which were giving a large amount of employment have been closed down.  I am aware of cases in my own constituency where the number of persons employed has been considerably reduced as a result of the difficulty in getting raw materials, and of the fact that there does not seem to be the same demand for some manufactured articles this year that existed last year.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government, particularly in view of their decision to reject the proposal for the establishment of an economic council, will give us some information as to their plans for the solution of the unemployment problem and whether it is their intention to review the decision to bring this Third Period Order into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate what Deputy Davin has said, that he and his colleagues have not asked for this debate in any factious spirit or in order to create difficulties for the Government, but mainly because they feel anxious about the present situation and about the future developments of that situation and have felt it necessary to express that anxiety here in the House.  I am sure this anxiety of their springs rather more from the anticipated reactions of the circumstances of the present time than from those which actually exist. When the European war broke out last September, I think, there was none of us in this House but felt that before it closed this country and its people would be in a sorry plight indeed.  We foresaw, perhaps, even physical attack. <Col N="2006" /> At any rate, we felt that if we escaped actual engulfment in the physical combat we should not escape the disastrous reaction of a complete blockade of our seas.  Thanks to Providence, our worst anticipations have not been realised and I think that, generally, the people of this country feel relieved that the situation is not at all as bad as they thought it might be.  That gives a certain colouring to our whole outlook upon the situation at the present time.  We admit it is not as bad as it might be, but we are reluctant to believe that it is in present circumstances as good as it is.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not in the House when the Leader of the Labour Party opened this debate but I gather that in the course of his speech he emphasised that unemployment was much worse than it had been this time last year and that it was particularly bad in relation to the building trade. I think that note of his has been characteristic also of Deputy Davin's speech.  I do not want to minimise or make light of our unemployment problem. In so far as there are people in this country who are able to work and willing to work who cannot find work, it is undoubtedly a very serious problem and one which has very ill reactions upon the morale of our citizens and one which, if it were possible, should be dealt with by the Government or, if not by the Government, then by some better agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it would be a mistake that we should paint the picture blacker than it really is, that we should allow our appreciation of the present situation to be distorted by the fears which were widely prevalent here last September; because, if we do, we are going to depress our people; we are going to dishearten those who might be anxious to engage in enterprise; and, perhaps, make the situation much worse than it is.  Accordingly, if I try to correct that impression here, an impression which apparently Deputy Norton, Deputy Davin and their colleagues labour under, it is not to make light of such hardship and suffering as unemployment might cause, but that we <Col N="2007" /> should see the situation in its true light.</P>
    <P>Strange as it may appear, the situation in regard to unemployment, in so far as that situation is disclosed by an analysis of the live register, was better, perhaps one might say a good deal better, on the 27th July last, the latest date for which I have figures, than it was on 21st August, 1939.  It was better than it was on the 13th July of this year; that is to say, that since about April last there has been a slow and gradual improvement in the employment situation in certain industrial groups, as compared with the 21st August of last year and with some of the earlier months.  It is a real improvement, and not a nominal or fictitious improvement such as might be secured by the operation of one Employment Period Order or another.  It indicates, as far as these figures go, and as far as the analysis is correct&mdash; and we have no reason to doubt the figures on the live register and every care has been taken to ensure that the analysis will be as accurate as possible &mdash;that in certain industries the details of which I will give in a moment, employment, so far from having decreased, has in fact improved.</P>
    <P>If we take the industrial group for food, I find that the number of people on the live register for that group on the 27th August last was 85 less than a fortnight earlier, and 247 less than on the 21st August, 1939.  In relation to the industrial group under the heading of drink, the position is that there were six more people on the live register than a fortnight before, but 131 less than on 21st August, 1939.  In the wood-working and furniture group, there were 42 less than on the 30th July, 1940, but, unfortunately, 176 more than on the 21st August, 1939. In the fertiliser group there were 12 fewer on the live register than a fortnight earlier, but 354 fewer than on the 21st August, 1939.  In mining and quarrying there was a decrease of eight over the previous fortnight and a decrease of 126 compared with August, 1939.  In brick manufacture the number had decreased by 16 over <Col N="2008" /> the fortnight, and by 57 compared with 21st August, 1939.</P>
    <P>In relation to the building and contracting industry, which was one of the industries, I understand, that was singled out by Deputy Norton as one in which the unemployment position had been growing increasingly worse, and one which, he suggested, the Government ought to do more to help, the figures are, in fact, surprising. In relation to all activities included under the heading of building construction there were 508 people less on the unemployment register on the 27th July than on 13th July, 1940.  On the 27th July, 1940, there were no less than 6,363 fewer people on the live register in respect of that industrial group than on the 21st August, 1939.  In transport and communications, other than shipping, docks and harbours, there were 146 fewer registered on the 27th July than on the 13th July last, and no less than 405 fewer than on the 21st August, 1939.  In the case of shipping and motor transport there has been an increase, but it is an increase which has taken place practically within the last fortnight.  There were 122 more men on the live register than a fortnight earlier and 128 more than on the 21st August, 1939.</P>
    <P>In regard to those registered in respect of employment on docks, harbours and piers it is only natural to expect that there was a corresponding increase in the number on the live register to correspond with the increase in unemployment amongst those who follow a seafaring life.  That is borne out by the figures I am giving, because in respect of docks, harbours and piers there is an increase of 545 compared with the fortnight before but a decrease of 524 as compared with the 21st August, 1939.  These figures indicate the trend and do not substantiate the accentuated pessimism which has characterised the speeches we have listened to to-night, and the speech, I understand, of the Leader of the Labour Party.  When I use the term &ldquo;pessimism&rdquo; I do not want in any sense to use it in a way which would reflect upon the anxiety which the Deputies who have spoken feel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> I realise that last year, and particularly at the beginning of this year, most of us thought that things would grow very bad indeed in this country, and that, consequently, we are a little blinded by our worst fears and do not realise that around us there has been, in a considerable number of occupations at any rate, what could, taking all the circumstances into consideration, be justly described as a remarkable improvement.  We must ask ourselves: If there has been this improvement and if it is manifested over so many groups&mdash;very peculiar groups in some ways&mdash;to what is that improvement due?  I think we should have to answer: To Government policy.</P>
    <P>I think, for instance, we could say that the increase in employment in building and construction would have to be ascribed to Government policy. The fact that we have succeeded in preventing an undue rise in building costs here may have encouraged some people who, a few months ago, had decided that they could not afford to build, to come along and give some private employment.  We could, also, say that the Government has done everything it possibly could to continue, notwithstanding the present adverse circumstances, its attack upon the housing problem in Dublin and that that may have had a lot to do with the improvement.  The money which the Government is spending on building and constructional work of one sort and another for the purpose of national defence is having its reaction.</P>
    <P>When you leave that large group aside and look at the places where, undoubtedly, the increase in employment has not been so marked but where, nevertheless, there has been, so far as the live register shows, an increase in employment, to what are you going to ascribe it?  It is, certainly, not due to improvement of conditions outside this country or to decreased interference with our trade which renders it easier for us to get supplies of essential materials to maintain these and other industries.  Must Deputies not admit that, in so far as there has been an improvement and in so far as there has not been a widespread increase in <Col N="2010" /> unemployment and in the depressed conditions generally, it is due to the policy which has been pursued by the Government?  Perhaps, I ought to say &ldquo;by the Dáil&rdquo; and, perhaps, I ought to ascribe it, in part, to the psychological reaction which our people have experienced as a result of the changed relations which have prevailed amongst all Parties in this House ever since our defence problem became an acute one. While we are quite justified in being anxious for the future, I do not think any purpose is to be served by painting the present situation worse than it really is.  After all, if the Government is &ldquo;doing nothing&rdquo;, in present circumstances, that is a reflection not only on the Government but upon all sections in this House, because it is only right to say that we have received an amount of consideration from all sections in this House during the past few months.  Therefore, that sort of statement&mdash;that we have no plans and that we have done nothing&mdash; is something of a boomerang.  Sometimes, it may hit the Government but, when I get up and produce the figures which I have produced, I think it is more likely to rebound on those who have made use of the expression, because, after all, it can be shown that there are certain industries, which people know perfectly well, in which there has been an improvement.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in the course of his speech, the Leader of the Labour Party referred to the fact that, through the operation of the employment period orders, the number of persons registered on the live register had decreased by roughly 47,000.  He said that the first and second of these orders had resulted in 31,000 being struck off the register and that, according to the figures which I gave to-day, the third order had resulted in 16,700 going off the register.  Surely that was the purpose of these employment period orders.  That was why the Dáil embodied in the Unemployment Assistance Acts this particular machinery.  These are all persons who are not expected to register at the exchange day in and day out.  They are not people whose condition, whether of employment or unemployment, <Col N="2011" /> can easily be checked.  When the Act of 1933 was going through the House, it was quite clearly indicated that we proposed, as part of this machinery and in order to enable us to deal with unemployment in the rural parts of Ireland during the winter months when employment might not be expected to be available, to avail of this machinery of the employment period order and that, in general, in the rural districts, unemployment assistance would not be available during the summer months. The House passed the Bill with that machinery in it.  I am speaking now from recollection, but I do not think that an amendment was put down during the discussion on the Bill to remove these provisions empowering the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make employment period orders because, if such an amendment had been put down, it could, quite clearly, have been shown that, without that safeguard, it would have been economically, financially and administratively impossible for us to put through an Unemployment Assistance Act with provisions so wide and far-reaching. Accordingly, what was to be expected when we made the employment period orders except that numbers&mdash;very large numbers&mdash;would go off the register periodically. We were not surprised when that happened.  What we did also believe and feel was that the great majority of the people removed from the live register in consequence of these employment period orders would be&mdash;the great majority, I say; there may have been a minority of exceptions&mdash;people who would, in fact, be employed or be in a position to maintain themselves either by working for themselves or by working for their families.  That expectation has been justified.</P>
    <P>Of course nobody expected, when first the machinery of the employment period order was used some years ago, that people who had been receiving money from the State week after week were going to relinquish the gift of that money without a murmur or without protest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> It is only natural, if a person has been drawing 2/-, 2/6, 5/6 or 7/6 a week simply because he is registered as unemployed, and if suddenly that source of income is cut off from him, that he is going to put the worst face he possibly can upon his plight.  That happened when the employment period order machinery was first put in operation some years ago.  It happened when the Second Employment Period Order was put in operation this year and it happened again when the Third Employment Period Order was put in operation last June.</P>
    <P>I want, at this stage, to make it quite clear that when these orders were made the Government was not callous in the making of them.  It had not merely to have regard to the hard cases in the community, to those who might be occasioned real distress in the operation of the employment period order, but it had to have regard for all the other interests in the community as well, for the people who were providing the money which was being received week after week by those affected by the employment period order, and those people were in many cases&mdash;perhaps I could say in the majority of cases&mdash;not so much better off in present circumstances than many of the people who were in receipt of unemployment assistance and who were fortunate enough to live either on land of their own or on a farm belonging to relatives.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we could not simply say, because there might be a few hard cases, because there might be even many hard cases, that so long as the hard cases represented a minority of those affected by the employment period order, &ldquo;Well, the interests of this minority must be paramount, and everybody else, even the people not so very much better off, have got to suffer in order that the minority may be looked after.&rdquo;  We had the prospect, if we permitted this minority to go on uninterfered with, of allowing a considerable number of people who did not, in fact, require State aid in the from of unemployment assistance to continue to draw money of which they were in no real need.  That was the choice we had to make, whether <Col N="2013" /> we were going, in order to avoid occasioning temporary hardship in a minority of cases, to allow a majority of those 16,700 people to draw money from State funds out of the pockets of every section of the community, workers as well as the rest, money which, in fact, we were not justified in paying on the grounds of the necessitous circumstances of the recipients.</P>
    <P>That was the situation and, when we had to take action in that regard, we had this in front of us also, that if there were really hard cases in the areas affected by these employment period orders there was local machinery to deal with them still in existence, local machinery which was bound to deal with them.  The hard cases had home assistance to fall back on and, according to the code, if there were able-bodied men or others in real necessity, they were to be looked after by the home assistance officer; so that in making this order while there might have been temporary hardship in a very few cases, we nevertheless had this assurance, that no person who was really in need would go destitute.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the position came down to this, whether we were going to tax the general taxpayer unjustly in order to provide for a minority who were in real need, or whether we were going, as the lesser of the two evils, to ask the local ratepayer for a brief period to look after the people who were going to be affected by the employment period order; whether, in short, we were going to hand out £150,000 or £160,000 to persons who were not in real need of it in order to avoid asking the local home assistance authorities to look after the comparatively few hard cases in their districts; whether we were going to give public money to thousands who did not require it or ask the local ratepayers to assume a burden for a short period and look after a comparatively few people in their own areas.</P>
    <P>That was the situation and, in the light of that situation, we took what I think in the general interest was the best course.  We said: &ldquo;We are not going to pay public money to thousands of men who do not want it; we <Col N="2014" /> are not going to give hundreds of thousands of pounds to men who do not require it; and if there are people in need, well, for that brief period the local authorities will have to discharge their Christian duty to them.&rdquo;  And remember, in this matter there is a great deal to be said for the principle of charity beginning at home.  For one thing, the local people can exercise some check on the expenditure of this money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has now suggested a good argument for the parish council.  There would be a great deal to be said for a parish council or any other local authority that did ensure that men who did not want the money, either because they would not work or because they had other sources of employment, would not be permitted to draw this money out of the public purse.  If the Deputy could suggest some agency which would operate in that fashion we could go a great deal further to meet the position of the real and necessitous unemployed in this country.  It is because we have no adequate check on this money that we must be careful as to how we spend it and if, at a season when it is natural to expect there will be employment available in certain districts, we can fall back on the local authority and put a burden on them which will compel them to exercise some checks, I think that is a very salutary proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of these employment period orders have been somewhat surprising. Deputy Davin asked me for the number of people struck off the live register because of the employment period orders who found employment through the local labour exchanges.  I am not able to add anything further to the information I gave the Dáil this afternoon when I pointed out that, though the number who had been disallowed by reason of the operation of the unemployment assistance period order up to and including the 27th July, 1940, is approximately 16,700, nevertheless, during the period from the 3rd June to the 27th July, 9,323 men were placed <Col N="2015" /> in employment through the local offices of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Now, we cannot assume, as the Deputy does and as apparently Deputy Norton did, that of those 9,000 people who are placed in employment not one of them was a person who had been affected by the employment period order any more than we can assume that the whole 9,323 were persons who were affected by the employment period order; but, it is reasonable to assume that, in so far as they, being anxious to get employment and being in actual need of employment, registered at the local exchange for employment, a certain number of those 9,323 people were, in fact, persons who had been affected by the employment period order.  I say it is only reasonable to assume that.  I do not press it any further than that: that in so far as those people who were affected by the Third Employment Period Order were anxious to get employment and in their anxiety had registered at the local labour exchange for employment, are concerned, it should be reasonable to assume that some part of the 9,323 people did find employment through the labour exchanges and were persons who had been affected by the employment period order.  But the point I was really coming to was the statement made by the Deputy, that the number of people who had been disallowed unemployment assistance by reason of the Third Employment Period Order, amounting to 16,700&mdash;that the majority of those people had been, in the Deputy's words, simply transferred as a burden to the local boards.  He said that there had been a considerable increase in the amount provided for home assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On that I have not got any figures available at the moment later than the last Saturday in June of this year.  The employment period order came into operation on the 5th June, and on the last Saturday <Col N="2016" /> of June, which would perhaps be nearer to four weeks than three weeks later, the number of able-bodied men who were in receipt of home assistance was 6,086.  For the corresponding Saturday in June of 1939 the number was 5,466, so that the increase in the number of able-bodied men who were in receipt of home assistance at the end of June, 1940&mdash;three or almost four weeks after the operation of the employment period order&mdash;was only 620 more than it had been in June of the year earlier.  Now, where is the evidence in those figures to substantiate the Deputy's statement that we have simply transferred the burden of maintaining those 16,700 people from the central authority to the local authority?</P>
      <P>Because I want to be as candid with the House as I can in discussing this matter, I do not want to press these figures too far, but I do not believe that in the month of July there has been any significant increase in the number of able-bodied persons who have been in receipt of home assistance. If that impression is correct, we can relate these figures to the argument which I made with regard to the making of these employment period orders.  We ceased to pay unemployment assistance to 16,700 people, and a month afterwards the number of able-bodied men in receipt of home assistance had only increased by 620.</P>

      <P>The employment period order was part of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The Deputy <Col N="2017" /> should not forget that.  If the local authorities have an obligation to their constituents to ensure that no person who is not justly entitled to home assistance gets it, we also have an obligation to our constituents, and I think it is the overriding obligation in this matter, to ensure that no part of the moneys wrung in taxation out of the people of this country will go to men who are not entitled to it.  I am asking the House again to relate the figures which I have just given to the argument which I made for the employment period order.  We have 16,700 people disallowed for unemployment assistance by the operation of the Third Employment Period Order, and, according to Deputy Davin, the majority of those people, all of them in need according to him, were transferred to the local authority, but in fact the figures show this: that out of the whole 16,700 people who were disallowed under the employment period order, only 620 of them were able to convince the local home assistance officers that they were in real need.  If we had not made that employment period order what would have been the position?  That we would have been giving out public money to 16,700 people who were not entitled to it.</P>

He and I discussed it, and he told me&mdash;and I believe him&mdash;that in so far as there would be real hardship the local authorities were bound to look after that.</P>

      <P>Let us look at another aspect of this matter.  We have been told that through the operation of this harsh employment period order we have disallowed 16,700 people, all able and willing and anxious to work.  Now would one not think that the first thing a man who was out of a job and was anxious to get one would do would be to go and register at the labour exchange, particularly for this reason: that for the purpose of allocating employment schemes in any area regard is going to be had to the number of people who are on the unemployment register in that area, and to the number of people who were previously in receipt <Col N="2019" /> of unemployment assistance in that area?  Take the case of the 16,700, all able and anxious to work, all in need of work.  Perhaps, I laid emphasis there on the wrong aspect of the matter.  There were 16,700 all supposed to be in need of work.  If a person is in need of work, is anxious to get work, and has been told that the mere fact of his registration at the employment exchange is likely to bring work to that locality, would you not expect that of those 16,700 men, every one of them was in need of work and who was anxious to work would have gone and have registered at the employment exchange?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might we not assume that those who were really in need of work would make the journey at least once to see if any work were available for them, now that the money was cut off.  What, however, is the position?  The average number of persons registered who were not entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for the five weeks prior to the making of the Third Employment Period Order, the five weeks prior to the 5th June, was 5,307.  The average number for the five weeks after 5th June was 5,485. The increase in the average number over the five-weekly period was 178. So that out of the 16,700 persons, there were only 178 who thought it worth their while to go to the employment exchange and put their names down for work if any were available. We are told that these 16,700 people needed work.  I must say that I certainly for one am sceptical, and I think as long as my head is hard I shall continue to be sceptical, when a man tells me that he <Col N="2020" /> is in need of work and will not even put down his name in the hope of getting it.  If you want to get work in this country you have got to look for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man thought it worth his while to make the journey to the labour exchange to get 1/- a week, as a very large number of them did, or if he thought it worth his while going there to draw 2/-, 5/- or even 10/- a week, surely if he was in need of work, it was worth his while making at least one journey to register for work?  Let us for goodness sake not completely bemuse ourselves with sickly sentiment in regard to this matter.  Let us, by all means, feel deeply for a person in genuine need but, for goodness sake, let us not blind ourselves to this aspect of the problem, that the very fact that money can be got easily, and can be got without a good deal of investigation, lends itself to abuse. Let us make up our minds that we are going to take every possible precaution that we can to ensure that that assistance which the Government is making available at great sacrifice to the people, will not be abused because it is only by the prevention of abuse in regard to the service that you can avoid the evils which are almost inevitably associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given you figures.  I can give you a few instances, a few actual examples, of the sort of thing which we have been up against in relation to this matter.  There is one area in the country which was brought particularly under my notice.  I investigated the statements which were made and, <i>prima facie</i>, there seemed to be a case for giving special consideration to that area.  I was told there had been works in that area which had been shut down, that men had been employed in these works, and that now, even though agricultural employment might be available in the neighbourhood, it would not be available for them.  I approached the Parliamentary Secretary and I asked him to pay particular attention to that area because of the <Col N="2021" /> stories told me by members of the House in relation to the district.  He did make special provision because the case seemed to be one of real hardship &mdash;with what result? As soon as money for schemes of work was available, the men to work on the schemes were not available; they were employed elsewhere. Of course, as long as it was a case of simply drawing money from an employment exchange they were in need, but when the money stopped they were not available for the special employment that might have been provided for them.  I am not going to say that that is the general case, but it is at any rate one case which does, at least, indicate that special care must be taken in relation to the whole of this matter.  It is not quite an isolated case.  There have been others.</P>
    <P>In the light of this and other cases, in the light of the figures which I have given to you, showing the surprisingly small increase in the number of people who registered merely for the purpose of obtaining work, and the moderate and not astonishing increase which has taken place in the number of able-bodied men who are in receipt of home assistance, I think, on the whole, the making of the Third Employment Period Order has been fully justified and that a number of people who had been receiving that money without giving any return to the community as a whole, are now fending for themselves, as it was always the intention of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and the Dáil as a whole, that they should.  We never said that, because a man was unemployed, all the obligations for his maintenance fell back on the State, that we were to find him a job, a job that he thought would suit him, a job that he would like, a job that remunerated him sufficiently for the labour he put into it.  What we said in relation to that matter was that if a man had exhausted all the possibilities of getting work, and it was quite clear that there was no work available for him, then, since he had no possibility of maintaining himself, we would come in and would help him during the period that such circumstances prevailed.  But we must be very <Col N="2022" /> careful not to convert this Unemployment Assistance Act which is meant to tide men over temporary hard times, into a means of providing a permanent pension for men who will not work. That I am afraid is the situation which was developing and which, if we were to accept all the statements of hard circumstances which are made to us at their full value, would lead to nothing but to the general demoralisation of our people.</P>

      <P>What does that mean?  It means that there were 16,700 who felt themselves entitled under the terms of the Unemployment Assistance Act to draw this money when, in fact, they could maintain <Col N="2023" /> themselves and who are, in fact, actually maintaining themselves now as the figures show.  That was the position.  I am not saying that these people were slackers.  I have not put that interpretation on the figures at all, but that they were not in need of unemployment assistance because they had other ways of maintaining themselves. Mind you, that is the position as it ought to be: that we should not pay unemployment assistance to people who can maintain themselves by any effort of their own.  We cannot put ourselves in the position that, because a man has a holding which is not a good holding, he is therefore going to be relieved of the obligation of working that holding in order to keep himself and his family.  We cannot be put in the position, where a man who can get a job or work to do but does not like that particular job and, because he does not like it, will not take it, of having to pay that man a few shillings a week to enable him to eke out a miserable existence, which he would rather content himself with sooner than do the particular job that was available for him. We cannot do that.  We cannot, for instance, in the case of the fishing industry, pay unemployment assistance to men who formerly maintained themselves and their families in fishing; and who, because the work of fishing is too hard or arduous, or too dangerous, if you like, are simply going to stop fishing altogether and live on unemployment assistance.  These are the things that we must avoid doing, so far as we can.  We have a duty to perform in regard to people who cannot find anything at all to do.  Our duty there is to try to help such people to live, but we have no duty&mdash;on the contrary, we have an obligation to ensure that no man will abandon his accustomed occupation simply because the State enables him, through the provision of unemployment assistance, to live without working.</P>

    <P>It is between these two rocks that we have to steer, and I am convinced, from an analysis of the situation as it has manifested itself by the operation of the employment period order, that <Col N="2024" /> we can do that without inflicting any appreciable hardship on any considerable section of the people of this country.  I am not going to contend for a moment that, due perhaps to friction in administration or to inertia on the part of local authorities, or to some other causes, there are not hard cases, but we cannot allow these hard cases&mdash; at any rate, in these instances&mdash;to make bad law.  It cannot be denied that there are such hard cases, and undoubtedly somebody will have to relieve them.  If the local authority cannot relieve such cases then they will have to be relieved through local voluntary charities, which will look after them, and it is in the interest of the community as a whole that that fact should be realised.  It should be realised that the Government cannot look after every individual in the community. It can only act in a broad, general way, by rule and regulation, and undoubtedly, in the operation of these employment period orders and other administrative regulations of that sort, individual cases of hardship will crop up from time to time.  We hoped that, so far as unemployment assistance is concerned, the local authorities would be able to fill up the void in such cases and that, if they were not able to fill up that avoid, we would have to ask the local charitable organisations to help them; and we will have to ask them to do so because the alternative to that would be a greater evil, and that is to give money to people who are not entitled to it, and that would ultimately end in the complete demoralisation of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening for an hour and 15 minutes to the Minister and I hoped that he would give us some indication as to what will be done in the future.  His whole speech was: Leave things as they are.  Well, I want to say, as man to man, to the Minister, and I say it very sincerely, that his speech is a menace to the country rather than a help, and I want to suggest, very respectfully to the Minister that he does not understand the position of the unemployed or the gravity of the unemployment problem. I say that, having listened to the Minister <Col N="2025" /> speaking for an hour and a quarter.  The Minister stated that we should not make unemployment assistance a permanent pension for people who do not want to work.  Does the Minister seriously suggest that the working people of this country are willing or anxious to travel in to the labour exchanges of the country for six days in the week just to get a few paltry shillings which certainly would not suffice to maintain themselves and their families?  I suggest to the Minister that the people in the labour exchanges probably have much more insight than he has into the problems of the unemployed and I suggest that, if he were to consult his officials, he might get a better insight into these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister's whole speech was an insult to the unemployed, especially in the way he has treated this whole matter of the cutting off of people from unemployment assistance by means of the employment period order.  The Minister spoke of home assistance, but I want to tell him that there are thousands of young men and thousands of married men with families who refuse to look for home assistance relief because their sense of pride and dignity will not allow them to do so.  The Minister should realise the danger there is in the country as a result of the way in which the unemployed are being treated.  I suggest that democratic governments are on trial to-day and it is for us to show what democracy can do and not to wait for what dictators can do and are doing.  The Minister asks, where are we going to get the money?  Will he take any lesson from the present war where millions of men have been drawn from productive work and put on work of destruction, where millions of men are working seven days of the week, both day and night, producing engines of destruction, and yet the industrial machine is not breaking down?  Yet, where is the money got in these cases? We all know that in the neighbouring country they could not find money in times of peace to increase unemployment assistance or for other such things.  But now they can find millions of pounds a day for the purpose of <Col N="2026" /> destruction.  Do not tell me that any statesman that can organise for war or against war cannot also organise for peace and construction.  The man who will tell me that, I say, is a traitor to humanity.</P>
    <P>I am very much concerned about the present position.  I am not saying this because of Party interest or anything of that nature, but in my opinion the Minister does not realise the danger to the country as a result of the present unemployment position.  I say that after listening to the Minister for an hour and a quarter.  The Minister purported to give reasons why these men were knocked off, but these men had been attending the labour exchanges for two or three years, and I want to say here that the labour exchange officials are most helpful to the unemployed&mdash;that has been my experience&mdash;and if there is any work available they put the men to that work.  It is ridiculous to think that these men come in day after day to the labour exchanges merely to get 14/-, in the case of a man with five in family.  These men come in to sign at the labour exchanges because they are looking for work.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that this statement about the unemployment problem is very far removed from reality.  I read this morning in the train coming up from Cork, the medical officer's report for the County Cork.  I have read the report also of our own medical officer of health.  I find that in each of these reports there is a definite statement that malnutrition is on the increase all over the country.  I find that the infant mortality rate in Cork County which is a purely agricultural county is higher this year than it has been for the past six years.  I attribute that to malnutrition and to insufficiency of food.  I tell the Minister that he has to change his mind and his outlook about the unemployed.  The Minister should not think that for the sake of a few shillings the unemployed man is prepared to rob the community at the labour exchange.  I notice also that the Minister wishes to stress the difficulty of providing this money.  I have never yet heard a complaint from the <Col N="2027" /> workers who are in employment about any grievance in providing this money for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is now ten months ago since I asked that something should be done to increase those benefits for old age pensioners and others.  I warn the Minister that old age pensioners and widows and orphans are suffering very keenly through an insufficiency of the necessaries of life.  The old age pensioner gets 10/-; I know of one organisation that is helping those people. They have to pay 3/6 for their bed for the week and then they have to exist and provide themselves with food and clothing on the remaining 6/6.  I do sincerely hope that the Government will not wait until the 2nd October to end this Third Employment Period Order but that they will decide on doing something this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody wants to paint a picture here through the Press or the people as to the state of the unemployed. What we want to do is to remove, if possible, the feeling of depression that undoubtedly prevails throughout the country.  The Minister himself seems to be out of touch altogether with the position as it is in the country.  I am perfectly convinced that if any Deputy in any constituency tells the truth he will have to admit that all over the country to-day there is a feeling of depression especially amongst the unemployed.  The Minster, in the course of his long statement, seems to think that the Government has no obligation at all so far as the unemployed are concerned.  If we compare that with the statement that the Taoiseach made in 1933 in response to a motion put down by Deputy Morrissey that we should provide work or maintenance, one sees the inconsistency. I think the Taoiseach on that occasion accepted very definitely that it was the Government's job to provide employment or maintenance.  The statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day does not accept that liability at all.  I would like to think that the picture painted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2028" /> reflects the situation as regards the unemployed.  But I find it hard to believe that the figures quoted are the facts of the situation.  We all know that figures can be analysed in a particular manner to suit the particular type of statement a man wants to make.  I am not at all suggesting that the Minister's figures are cooked, but they can be analysed in such a manner as to mislead.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not serious in suggesting that there was as much done this year in the building trade as there was last year.  That was the statement made.  But we know there was a very serious slackening down so far as building is concerned.  Some of the architects' offices in the city have been shut down because of the fact that building has practically ceased. We know that the county health boards all over the country have ceased to build; that the corporations and borough councils and the people who have been building houses for years in the past have also practically ceased building.</P>

      <P>Dublin is a serious problem, I admit, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in a position to know that at present it is almost impossible to proceed with the building of houses to cater for the working classes and especially for the slum dwellers with whom the Government have to deal.  Now, in Wexford two years ago, the corporation could build a house for £340.  The tender price for the same house to-day is £486.  The amount in the way of rent which has to be paid by the slum dwellers, after taking into full consideration the subsidy given by the Government, would be 10/11 a week. In God's name, what municipal council with any sense of responsibility would proceed to build houses at that price and take a tenant and ask him to pay 10/11 a week?</P>

      <P>I want to know how the Minister has arrived at the figures he has given us to show that there is a very small difference in the number in the register of house construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite fail to understand that.  It must be that numbers of them have left the country and that others of them have gone into the Army.  The Minister, in speaking of 16,000 people taken off the register because of the Third Employment Period Order, stated very definitely that it was the duty of the local authorities to look after those people. In the first place the local authorities have made no provision to cater for those people.  The Minister knows that the local authorities start to prepare their estimates in November and December and that the rate is practically made in February and March.  This Third Employment Period Order was not made until June, and it is very hard to know where the money is to come from to enable the local authorities to give relief to the people. I am a member of the County Wexford Board of Health and since the first week since this order was made it has cost the Wexford Board of Health £20 a week.  That is a very serious impost. One wonders how that deficiency is to be met when the end of the financial year comes.  It means an impost of £500 during the period of this employment period order.  Then the Government cannot have it both ways.  As the Minister knows there are a number of urban areas in which the population are called upon to pay 1/6 in the £ towards financing the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Because of the fact that the Minister must get the gross value of this 1/6 rate it means that the <Col N="2030" /> local authority has to strike a rate of 1/8 in the £, that is, in order to meet the deficiency caused by unpaid rates. The urban authority of Wexford is the only public authority in the county that has to pay that 1/8 rate, and it will have to pay each year in addition to that rate £500 extra in home assistance. I suggest that the local ratepayers should be taken into consideration to such an extent that when there is an employment period order there should be also some relief given to the urban authorities who have to pay that 1/8 in the £ on the understanding that the unemployed people in the county will be relieved during the financial year. The Minister has it both ways.  He is asking the urban authorities to pay 1/8 in the £ and is also asking them to pay their proportion of home assistance.  It is costing the Wexford County Board of Health £20 to £30 per week to look after these people during the employment order period.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I look upon the Minister's statement as a confession of bankruptcy of policy so far as dealing with the unemployed is concerned.  As I said at the beginning, I do not want to say anything which would cause a feeling of depression; but unfortunately the depression is there and, I am sorry to say, there is more than depression there.  There are rumblings and murmurings amongst the unemployed week after week. Those of us who are members of local authorities come into close contact with these people and know what their conditions are.  Even people who are drawing unemployment benefit find themselves unequal to meeting the rising cost of living which has been brought about by the war.  The British Government and the Northern Ireland Government within the last few months have increased the amount of unemployment assistance given to their people because of the increase in the cost of foodstuffs.  They have also raised the amount given to old age pensioners.  If the Government want to have people contented they will have to take some action of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey referred to the widows and orphans.  So far as the contributory pensions are concerned <Col N="2031" /> they are comparatively good; but a woman who is in receipt of a non-contributory pension and who has a large family is in a very precarious condition. I came across a case the other day of a woman with five children whose husband had been ill for a number of years before his death.  That woman and five children have to live on 11/6 per week.  It was not her fault that her husband was not able to work during the period laid down in the Act.  It is very hard on that woman to try to keep herself and five children on 11/6 per week.  The Minister referred to the payment of unemployment assistance as being a permanent pension so far as some workers are concerned.  I must say in fairness to the people drawing unemployment assistance that every one of them I have come across in my constituency would prefer to be working rather than drawing what is described as the dole. All those people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, bad though the system of rational employment is, would prefer to work for the three days a week and get money for doing honest work rather than draw unemployment assistance for doing nothing. I think, therefore, that the statement of the Minister is certainly uncalled for and unworthy of him.</P>
    <P>I had a question down to-day to the Minister for Local Government in connection with housing.  I asked the Minister if there was a possibility of the interest on housing loans being brought back to the pre-war rate and if it were possible to pay a subsidy to the local authorities to cover the whole cost of building.  At the moment two-thirds of the interest and sinking fund is paid on a house costing up to £350. I indicated in the question that, if the Government were prepared to advance a subsidy on the whole cost of a house and reverted to the old rate of interest, in my opinion there would be a good deal of employment given in the country.  The extent to which that would help people in need of houses would be 2/10 per week.  That means a big thing to a poor person.  Along with that, it would provide much-needed employment for a number of people.  I <Col N="2032" /> suggest to the Taoiseach that he ought to have that question examined because he can take it from me that there is going to be very little house building all over the country owing to the high building costs, and these high building costs have been brought about entirely by the cost of materials. None of the building trade operatives have sought an increase in wages since the outbreak of the war.  In my opinion they would be well satisfied if they could get employment at present, and I think their attitude would be helpful to enable the Government and the local authorities to provide houses for the people.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say other than to urge again that the Government should seriously consider the whole circumstances so far as the unemployed are concerned.  The position is very serious.  There is a definite feeling of depression in the country. People are looking forward to the winter months with awe, thinking of the sufferings they will have to endure if they are still to continue unemployed. The Third Employment Period Order has brought a good deal of hardship in its train.  It has been specially hard on people living in the immediate vicinity of towns.  All those people are town workers even though they are living immediately outside the borough.  They are living under town conditions and have been working in towns all their lives.  They are the victims of this Third Employment Period Order.  They have never done agricultural work and would not be capable of doing it, as they were never used to it.  No farmer would employ a man unless he has been reared on the land and is capable of doing agricultural work properly.  Those people have been specially hard hit, and I suggest to the Government that the best thing they could do would be to take steps immediately to put these people back on the unemployment assistance register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When this war began I warned the people that we had naturally to anticipate that it would mean for our community a considerable amount of suffering, that there would <Col N="2033" /> be hardships which we could not avoid, even though we were not directly and immediately involved in the war.  That represented the apprehensions of the Government.  Since the war began we have never ceased to be anxious about the possibilities of such hardships. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated that from our examination of the situation the hardships are less than we could reasonably have anticipated.  It would be altogether a mistake for anyone to imagine that the Government are taking this situation with complacency&mdash;far from it.  We anticipated at the start, and we believe still, that this war is going to mean for every section of the community a considerable amount of hardship, that it will mean hardship for everybody in one form or another, and that the most we can do is to try to equalise the hardships and see that no one section will suffer more severely than another as a consequence, so far as we can prevent it.</P>
      <P>At the beginning I also pointed out that we should naturally anticipate that the hardships would be felt most in the cities and large centres of population; that just as in the economic war we could anticipate that it was the farming community that was going to be in the front line trenches and would need the support of the rest of the community in that position, so in the present set of circumstances we could reasonably anticipate that it was the people in the cities and towns and large centres of population who would be in the front line trenches and who would need the support of the rest of the community.  We have on that account been watchful of the position in the large centres, and we have said in regard, for instance, to the Third Period Order, that on account of the increased work that was going to be available in the rural areas, taking them generally, and excluding particular areas where we had reason to believe that the opportunities for extra work would not be available, our attention and our support should be mainly concerned with those who were in the large centres of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> We have had complaints from the Labour Party that there are people who have suffered as a result of that Order.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out that we cannot provide from the central authority, which has to make general regulations, against exceptional cases of difficulty, and it is because the local people are in the best position to recognise these cases of hardship that we think it reasonable that they should come to the assistance of such people by means of home assistance.  I cannot understand the statement made by the Deputy who said that people will take unemployment assistance who will not take home assistance.  They are both contributions to the individual by the community, whether it be the local community or the larger community of the State as a whole.  There is no difference, in my mind, between accepting the one and the other; but the advantage in the local case is that the local circumstances are known, and I think that everybody who wants the State, the community as a whole, or the local community to assist those not able to assist themselves will want to see that that assistance is not abused, and there is not one of those who have been criticising us who does not know that there have been cases of abuse.</P>
    <P>I pointed out long ago that the greatest difficulty was to separate the goats from the sheep, and that there were people who were prepared to abuse the laws which were made to relieve a certain section of the community by utilising them to get community money where it was not necessary.  What the Minister has said should not be interpreted as meaning that we are going back from any position we took up about the rights of the individual in modern society to live and to get from the community, in some way or other, the opportunity to live.  We have not departed from that, but, as the Minister has pointed out, we have to be very careful that the means we are taking in order to help those who really should be helped, and who need help, will not be abused by those who do not need help.  The best help that could be given by the Labour <Col N="2035" /> Party, or any other section of the community interested in the relief of those who are genuinely in need, would be to expose those who take it when they do not need it, and to support every step that can be taken by the Government to see that that abuse does not obtain.</P>
    <P>I think nobody will deny that there is a problem here, a problem which is facing practically every organised community in the world at present: the problem of unemployment.  The fact that it should exist at all seems. somehow or other, to be a blot on our social organisation.  I have been often reminded of the statement I made when we were in opposition, that the cure for unemployment should be easier to find here than in most other States.  I spoke back in 1933, and I think the number of unemployed mentioned at that time was something around 80,000 or 85,000.  I actually went into figures to prove that if we built up the industries which we could reasonably hope to build up successfully here, there would be employment in these industries for some such figure.  I pointed out that, from the industrial point of view, we were practically undeveloped and that that gave us an opportunity which States which were fully developed industrially and which had unemployment had not got.  We set out at once to build up these industries and, by a remarkable coincidence, I think the figures of extra employment in these industries coincide almost to 1,000 with the figures we anticipated at the time.</P>
    <P>The world, however, has moved on since then, and other causes of unemployment have cropped up, and the fact is that though we have been relieved in these directions, there are other directions in which, due to other causes, our unemployment problem, such as it is, has developed.  We do not want to say that it is not a serious problem, because it is a serious problem, even though we do not exaggerate it.  The question is: what is the solution?  It would seem that, in human affairs, no matter what system you adopt, there will be evils <Col N="2036" /> attached to it, and what human beings have been striving for is to get a system with the least possible evils. There has been revolution after revolution in the history of mankind, due to the fact that the evils mounted up in one particular system and people thought they could, by revolution, get rid of these evils and secure a better system, but not that they could get an ideal system.  I am afraid that it did happen that, often, the revolutionaries thought they were going to get an ideal system, but what they got was another system which, after a time, showed such evils associated with it that there was need of another revolution to change it.</P>
    <P>We ought to strive hard to find a remedy for this evil, which is admitted, and the first step towards finding a solution is to know exactly what is the magnitude of the problem, and to separate the classes of people who are prepared to take advantage of the interest of the community in those who cannot find work, those who are abusing the good will of the community, from those who really need the assistance of the community.</P>

      <P>For the moment, the question is this: Why is it that the transport system is not able to pay a dividend; why is it, with the capital invested in the railways in this country, they are not able to pay dividends at the present time?  There has been a change very largely in various ways, because the private individual probably is doing a great deal more of his transport directly <Col N="2038" /> than he did before.  Changes and developments are taking place which affect the community, and it is foolishness to try to ignore them.  Though I agree with it in principle, I do not think that the public control of credit which is demanded would make such a big difference in the social system. Personally, I agree with it as a principle, but I do not think that, in fact, any more than the public control of transport, it would make a tremendous difference.  While I am saying that as my belief, I do not suggest that a view of mine will convince those who think it ought to be tried, but that is another matter.</P>

      <P>If you talk about helping sections of the community, remember that such help must be got through production by other sections of the community, and nowhere else. When we talk of production, it seems to me that we ought to relate what goes out to what comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Who controls production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us keep closely to the question&mdash;not, who controls it, but what it is going to do in any case. Is it not a fact that, if the members of any section of the community go to do a certain piece of work, they would reckon whether the work is valuable or not, whether it is worth while, by considering what is used in the production of it.  If you consume more in the production, in any form whatsoever, than you produce&mdash;reckoning by some method by which you can determine values&mdash;will you call it production or the reverse?  Rightly or wrongly, I usually compare this community as a whole to a large landholder with a big family.  Can he afford to put the members of his family, or a large number of them, building avenues and making ponds and proceeding with the beautification of his property, from the point of view of its amenities?  It is quite clear that only a certain number of the members of his family can engage in that work and <Col N="2039" /> that the other members must be able to produce enough to supply those not immediately engaged in the production side, to carry them on and support them whilst they are doing the beautification of the farm and providing those amenities.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that a small community such as ours will have to be content with frugal comfort, if that comfort is to be universal, and if we are to expect to have the universality of that comfort at some time and to have each member of the community better off, relatively, in regard to the remuneration that he gets.  In other words, if we want to see that every member of this community is given an opportunity to enjoy frugal comfort, a large number of us must be prepared to revise our standards.  If we want houses built, there is the cost of the material, and those producing that material cannot expect to have relatively as high standards as in other countries with large communities.  What I am afraid of is that none of us&mdash;or few of us&mdash; think fundamentally about this thing and that we are not prepared to face the consequences of our desires in regard to making certain that everybody has an opportunity to obtain at least frugal comfort.  The first thing is that those producing must produce more.  To produce more we will have to work harder, we will have to diminish the cost, whether it be of houses or of any other work we do, by making the materials available at lower prices; and again we cannot do that unless we get more production from the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour section of the community can do a tremendous service.  I am quite willing to admit that they represent&mdash;at least, they claim that, even if they do not represent in numbers&mdash;the interests of the workers of this country and that they have at heart the interests of those workers.  I believe that the best service which they can render to the workers is to cooperate with us in developing the right mentality abroad with regard to these problems, We cannot solve them without taking some drastic measures in <Col N="2040" /> various forms, and the first people to object to those forms will be the very people claiming to have a solution of the problems.  The moment you set out to get a practical solution for any one of those problems, you are opposed just by the people who, of all others, ought to be most interested in getting a solution.  Facing&mdash;the consequences, can we get that genuine desire for a solution from the Labour Party?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they? Suppose we were to say, as an example, that if we want to get houses built we will have to have a bigger standard of production in regard to the output of labour as an individual.  I am only taking that at random.  I am not saying at all that it is a good example, but let us take it.  It has been asserted, rightly or wrongly, that it is one of the difficulties about house building that we have not got as big an output here as elsewhere. I know that has been denied by the workers, but suppose it were found to be a fact, and we say that this is a vital factor in getting houses built for those who want them and who need them, would we have the support of the Labour Party in trying to get that extra output, assuming again, the assertion were true?</P>

      <P>I only want to know. There is first of all the determination of the fact and I am assuming that the fact as determined will be as asserted.  Another problem in which I am personally greatly interested is the problem of young people who are in danger of being spoilt and demoralised when they come to the age of 18 from the fact that no work of any kind can be provided for them.  Suppose we are able to inaugurate some schemes of work in one form or another by which those people would not be a burden on themselves or their parents and that they would get some support during the period which would be really a period of training in one way or another, are we going to get support <Col N="2041" /> to take such measures as might get these people into work or are we not?  Again, we cannot solve this problem by giving out money because it will be abused.  We know it will be abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If people have got savings in one form or other that they have been using, and if they make them available to the community they are entitled to get a certain percentage for it, assuming they could use that money in other ways themselves.  I say here we have never really been prevented from doing useful productive work by lack of money in the sense suggested. We have been prevented in many cases by the fact that either our costs were higher because, for one reason or another, higher wages were paid or there was something else of that sort or that there <Col N="2042" /> were, if you like, to put it on the other foot, greater profits being obtained by certain people.  But the fundamental fact in this community that we have got to realise is that if we are going to see that there is frugal comfort for all, everybody must do his share in contributing to that, and the way to do it is that, to start with, there must be harder work for everyone of us, because, without hard work, in a small community such as this, we cannot do the thing we set out to do.</P>
      <P>Those are the fundamental things that we need&mdash;the help particularly of the section of the community which the Labour Party represent or claim to represent anyhow&mdash;the part of the community whose interests they have at heart&mdash;because it is there that the beginning has to be made.  I know this country for 50 years and there is no one who is here and of my age who does not know that there has been a wonderful change in this country in that time.  Standards have been adopted here which would probably not have been the standards that would have grown up naturally in this country.  They are standards which were imported from outside, from a country that was the centre of an empire and that had, therefore, opportunities of drawing upon and exploiting, if you want to use that word, a great part of the earth's surface.  If we want here to be in ourselves a separate community, trying to live within ourselves, to provide for ourselves, then we will have to revise our standards.  Again I say it: we will have to revise our standards all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question is: How far can we, within ourselves, provide for all our needs and get that frugal comfort? Is it possible to do it?  The first thing you want to ask yourselves is: &ldquo;What are the various things we can provide for ourselves?&rdquo;  We set out, as you know, as a Party and as a Government to try to make this country as self-supporting and as self-sufficing as it could be.  We had no illusions about some of the consequences of that programme. We knew perfectly well that if that programme were to be given effect to a number of things would have to change as a consequence.  Take, <Col N="2043" /> for instance, the cost of agricultural implements.  Were we going to be able to provide those implements for the farmer as cheaply as he could get them outside?  As a matter of fact, in many cases we have done that.  We have been able to provide these things as cheaply, but there are certain things which it would be quite unreasonable to expect that in a country of 3,000,000 souls we could provide as cheaply, in view of the advantages there are in many respects in regard to mass production, as a community of 40,000,000 could do it.  That is obviously one of the consequences of trying to be self-supporting&mdash;even though I still believe in it, notwithstanding anything in addition to what had been anticipated that the actual experiment has shown up.  But it is ridiculous to expect that we could have these things as cheaply here and that the section of the community which was consuming these things could get them as cheaply as if they were able to get them in from outside.</P>
    <P>We hoped that there would be a general balance, that if it was true to say that the worker in the town would have to pay more for his food because of the protection which we were going to give to the farmer, that protection was benefiting the farmer to an extent which would enable the farmer to meet the extra costs that might have to be borne by him through having to pay the workers in the towns the extra amounts for making boots or whatever he required over and above the price at which he could get them from outside. But, obviously, taking it all round, there must be some loss somewhere. Formerly, that loss was not recognised because there was emigration and the diminution of your population was taking place at the same time as, for example, the competition for agricultural produce in outside markets was getting more severe and it was not shown up immediately. With the terrible stress after the last war that there was in regard to getting markets and pressure of that sort, we had a slump, as everybody knows here, which brought reactions over and <Col N="2044" /> above those which might be anticipated otherwise.  But the fact is that if we want here to build up an economy, basing it on frugal comfort for all, we will have to be content with frugality in all cases and we will have, as part of that frugality, to work harder and, therefore, to accept standards which would be considered lower standards than the best that could be got elsewhere.  If our aim is to have standards equal to the best elsewhere, we must not forget the fact that, if we want to do that, we will have to give up some of our ideas with regard to being a self-sufficing community, or a community that can last with the present numbers.</P>
    <P>Stress has been laid on the fact that money can be got for war purposes. Does any person think that money that produces all that expenditure of energy on the production of war implements is not going to have consequences? Does anybody think that the communities that are spending that money will not have to pay one way or another later on?</P>

      <P>There must be people who are prepared to accept these services; otherwise people cannot render them, and if they are prepared to accept these services they must pay for them by giving services in return.  The question is: Have we that situation in this country?  We are asking people if they are prepared to render services in return for services which they may get, to render return in a form in which other people consider they are getting a fair bargain.  I am doubtful as to whether we can or cannot find these opportunities for service for everybody.  We ought to aim at doing that, and the whole effort should be to find them.  We seem to have tremendous difficulties in finding them.  I was listening to the debate in the hope that some people would indicate in what direction useful practical work lay, productive work in the sense that the community is richer when it is done than before it was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people needing food, clothes and shelter will be among the first people to refuse their services because they say they will cost too much.  We had examples from the opposite benches time after time, in which the cost to the farmers, for instance, of boots was brought up as a reason why they were suffering.  In other words, the farmers said that the <Col N="2046" /> price at which people were prepared to render their services was too great for them while they were giving too much in return for the services rendered them.  That is the whole problem.  I was looking forward to hear of useful works.  As a matter of fact we have built up the boot industry here at the present time to a stage when I think everyone who wants a pair of boots can get them.  It is rather difficult to get any others.</P>

      <P>I say thank God as heartily as the Deputy.  We went out in other directions, as far as possible, to do the same thing, where there was an opportunity as in the case of cement.  We have exploited these opportunities, and we have come very near exhausting our list.  Take, for instance, the question of wool which was mentioned to-day.  We have here the raw material, but, apparently, we have not the machinery, as it was designed for a different type of wool. We have not the machinery available to use our wool, and it is possible that that wool would not produce the best type of material.  I would be willing to say: &ldquo;All right, let us wear the clothes which can be produced from the raw material if we can get the machinery to do it.&rdquo;  But we have to build the machinery, and we have to remember that a certain section of our community will have to be prepared to wear rougher material.  Perhaps with an effort it could be made finer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held that we ought to be prepared in a case like that, where the raw material is here, to use a substitute, because it would put us in a position of independence in regard to supplies, and give wider opportunities for the mutual service about which I have been talking. If you go through the list you will find that we have, at least, skimmed the cream in the direction in which we could industrialise ourselves with particular advantage.  People have been <Col N="2047" /> talking about public works, about works of a somewhat different character than those that produce the immediate necessities of life.  The fact is that as a community we are producing far more food than we require for ourselves, and if we want to exchange that surplus of food for other things that we require, we would have to do so in an outside market and have to be prepared to pay as a community.  However, we may adjust the remuneration for the individual, as a community we will have to be prepared to take whatever opportunities we are able to get for that purpose.  That is the only way we can buy the things that we cannot produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that there are many raw materials lacking which we require, and so far substitutes have not been found for them.  One of our difficulties at present is that there are certain materials lacking and they are expensive to get in present circumstances. We would be in a stronger position if we were able to get substitutes for these things.  As far as the fundamental feeding of our people is concerned, there is no question but we have food enough.  What we have to do is to see that people who want food have some opportunity of giving service to get it.  As far as clothing is concerned we are not too badly off. With regard to shelter there are large numbers of houses to be built, but those who are going to enjoy them naturally are expected to give some service in return.  The question is: Are they able to do so?  Deputy Corish says they are not able to give service in return because they are not able to pay the rents.  They are not able to give service in return for the advantages given to them by the people providing the houses.  So far as the fundamentals are concerned, we can get them here, but have we got the mentality, as a community, to face these things in their nakedness and to realise that, if we want to work as a community in that way, we shall have to be prepared to revise our standards?  I am afraid we have not. One of the standards we have to <Col N="2048" /> revise is the amount of work an individual should do and the amount of leisure and enjoyment he should have at the same time.</P>
    <P>On the question of an economic council, I admit that, when I was in Opposition, I urged very strongly the setting up of something like an economic headquarters planning staff or an economic council&mdash;some such idea as the Labour Party have put forward. On more than one occasion, I sat down and tried to see how that could be put into operation.  On each occasion that I tried to do so, I came up against certain hard facts.  These facts I have already communicated to the leaders of the Labour movement.  If you want to have an advisory body for the Government which will advise on all economic affairs, seeing the complexity and variety of these, it is obvious that you will require a very large body.  Otherwise, it will not be representative at all.  Nobody need tell me that a couple of members of the Labour Party would be able to bring to any such conference that universal acquaintance with the details of industry which would be necessary if the economic council were to function fully.  They would have to go to other people to get the information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We never said we would be able to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I am trying to show that, if you are to have an advisory body, it will be necessary to have a large body, if it is to be at all representative and to be able to give you that help which can only come from people who know intimately the details of the particular industry in question.  Such a body would have to be as large as this House in numbers if you were to get anything like the measure of help which it would be supposed to give.  If it is mere criticism of proposals that is required, the criticism can be given openly in this House.  If it is urged that the Government, once committed to a measure, would not be open to a suggestion here, then there is a mechanism by which, in advance of legislation, information <Col N="2049" /> can be got.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is in touch with a variety of interests and meets groups from time to time.  Whenever any particular problem would arise, he would bring into consultation the body which would be precisely the best body he could get to give him intimate advice. The presumption, naturally, is that the knowledge of that particular group with reference to the problem under consideration would be much more helpful than that of any general group.  In the same way, the Minister for Agriculture is in touch with various groups.  When any question arises concerning a particular aspect of agriculture, he meets some of these groups. If a problem were to arise concerning the tillage areas or a particular part of the country, he would deal with the people of the area affected and, in that way, get the intimate knowledge required. A number of consultative bodies have been created with regard to measures for which the Government takes responsibility.  These groups are consulted from time to time.  A general council, if it were to be fully representative of the complexity of industry, would have to be a large, unwieldy body which could not meet regularly. Instead of that, you have a large body which can be availed of by taking section after section of it, as required, and it is felt that, in that way, the needs of consultation are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the idea of an economic planning staff.  That was the idea which was behind my proposals when I made them&mdash;not so much this consultative body which, by the way, would best be got if we had vocational organisation.  If we had vocational organisation, then we might, possibly, get a certain group which would be in a position to give expert advice and which would be in a position to consult others and use the information obtained in that way.  We have not got so far as that yet.  If we had vocational organisation, it is possible that we could have a consultative group, and that the necessary series of groups would be naturally forthcoming instead of being picked out by the Minister for the time being. Whether that would or would not be <Col N="2050" /> better than the present system is an open question.  Some people think it would be, and some people think it would not.</P>
    <P>What are the difficulties in the way of the operation of an economic headquarter staff?  Something like that was tried in Britain and had to be abandoned.  As regards the difficulties, you have, in your present organisation, a planning staff in, for instance, the Department of Agriculture.  The Minister and his principal officers are the natural planning staff there.  They are the best planning staff for that work, because they are more intimately in contact with the needs and details of the industry than others would be.  If you put some outside group of officials in their stead&mdash;they would have to be whole-time people if they were to be of any service&mdash;they would have to consult the Department as to whether certain proposals were or were not feasible.  They would have, too, to get, by consultation with the Department, the material from which they could form their plans.  When their plans were made, they would have to depend on the Department of Agriculture to see that they were executed.  Our opinion is that you will get better execution of the plans if they are made by the people who have to execute them.  You would have friction otherwise. You would have people making plans who would not have the responsibility for putting them into operation or, if you put that responsibility upon them, they would have to be working through people who might feel that they knew more about the matter than they did, and who might have different ideas.  The moment you try to plan for agriculture, your planning staff will be a duplication, and it may bring about friction in the machinery; it will be a duplication of the work supposed to be done at present in the Department of Agriculture.  The same thing is true with regard to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  If you put a planning staff outside the chief officers of that Department, who are supposed to do such planning as can be done, if you impose another body outside them, they will have to come to these officers for the detailed information which will <Col N="2051" /> enable them to plan, if they are to have any relation to the facts of the situation.  Then you will have the difficulty of execution, just the same as with regard to matters connected with agriculture.</P>
    <P>With regard to industries other than agriculture, I find myself in the same position as before.  It will mean duplicating existing machinery and perhaps introducing friction, instead of making things go easier.  There will be problems which will have to be solved by a proper consideration of the balance existing between the claims of one or other of the Departments.  The moment it comes to that, you have to depend on the Government as a whole to bring about the necessary co-operation. The Government is the body to decide between the rival claims of Departments and ultimately it has to provide for whatever co-ordination may be necessary in the activities of one or other of the industrial departments.</P>
    <P>When you examine this it looks attractive, but, in fact, it is very difficult. Yet, I will admit I have always had a hankering for it.  Even though the arguments seem to be unanswerable, I still have a hankering for such a body, but I have not been able to plan it in such a way that it would work without friction.  The only way I can see that planning done is to have a position when there are Ministers free enough to devote their time to that rather than to some of the administrative details of the Departments which they have to supervise at present, and the Ministers ought to be assisted in doing that either by having people to whom they can delegate the work, having Parliamentary Secretaries, let us say, who will look after the details, or else the Secretaries of the Departments should be given a greater freedom than they have at the moment from supervising some of the administrative details.  They should be given a larger scope and one of the thoughts that occurs to me in this matter is whether it would not be possible to relieve the Secretaries of Departments from the responsibility that they have at present as accounting officers.  I do not know that that can be done without <Col N="2052" /> some inconvenience, but that would be one way in which we could try to relieve Ministers of various Departments from some of the administrative details and similarly relieve the Secretaries of these Departments.  These are the only people who, with the Government as a whole, in the long run can do this planning.</P>
    <P>Everybody, I think, must admit, that if there is one group of individuals in this community who have everything to gain and every possible incentive towards providing a plan to solve these problems, it is the Government.  I do not think anybody can imagine any stronger incentive than the incentive we would have to provide plans, but we must remember that there are certain things to be considered.  The moon is going to keep the same distance from us, no matter how much we may desire to change it, and there are things in life, hard facts, which there is no use in our trying to change. Whilst we agree that everything should be done to try to get substitutes for the raw materials which we have difficulty in obtaining at the moment, and so help to provide more productive employment than is being provided, there are limits.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of productivity, the person who endeavours to talk on that subject will find himself up against a difficulty.  One Deputy dealt with the production of turf. There has been an organisation set up to try to get turf produced here in a manner which will enable the community without too great a sacrifice to utilise it.  I refer to the Turf Board. Every possible inducement has been given to people to try to provide turf because the competing article may be difficult to procure at certain periods and there may be high prices.  If these things do not stimulate turf production, the development of the turf industry, I do not know anything that will.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about turf and about the furze that you have on farms.  Whenever I see a clump of furze in a field I wonder why they do not root out these things so as to make the ground available for pasture.  I <Col N="2053" /> wonder why people do not do that. The fact is that it is not done, and I ask myself why.  Is it that the farmer is lazy or that the type of land that would be produced after rooting out the furze would not give an adequate return for all the labour involved?  I think in many cases it will be admitted that there would not be an adequate return for the labour involved.  No matter how desirable it might appear from a general point of view, making more land available for the production of food, whether for home production or as a surplus with which to buy other things, in many cases the labour involved, the cost in energy&mdash;whatever standard of value you may wish to apply&mdash;would not be commensurate with the results achieved.</P>
    <P>We have many things like that in the country where, when we set out to do them, the results do not appear to be commensurate with the energy involved.  We have the case of drainage. I am not now saying that we should not go on with drainage, but I remember how shocked I was when I observed the small economic return one case and the small economic return in another case in contrast with the labour content.  If the community goes on expending more than it is able to get out of work, you will have to admit that the community will not get richer by that process and will not be able to keep up the standard of comfort of all its citizens.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to meet the Labour people in conference.  I have always suggested it and I am always ready.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is always ready to meet them in regard to any practical suggestions, but the trouble naturally is that they represent a section of the community.  They are interested in the highest possible standards for that section and, when we try to approach it from the community point of view as a whole, the moment it conflicts with the interests of the section they represent, naturally they try to resist that in every possible way.  We would have the same thing if we were meeting the farmers.  If there was a particular thing we thought of in the <Col N="2054" /> interests of the community as a whole, and if it affected the interests of the farmers they would naturally resist it. For instance, if there was something relating to the price of butter, some suggestion that the price should be less than it is, we would have to give very definite proof to the farming section that they would benefit in some way before they would agree.  So it is with the Labour interest, the workers.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself would be very glad at any time to meet the representatives of Labour and consider with them any practical suggestions that they may have to offer.  I am talking now of practical suggestions that they may have for dealing with the present situation.</P>
    <P>I am taking it for granted that they are as interested in getting solutions as we are.  There are certain things in relation to which the facts can be put before everybody, but the problem is how to provide a solution on the basis of the facts, because there is no use in talking in generalities and in assuming the facts to be otherwise than they are.  I have spoken at some length on this because I want Deputies and the people in general to realise that it is not for want of trying that this problem has not been completely solved. It is not that we have closed our minds to any solution that can be put forward, but there are things that are beyond the control of this community as a whole, given even the best good will on the part of everybody.  Unfortunately, we have not yet reached the position in which we think as a community as a whole.  We think, unfortunately, in sectional terms or in individual terms.  That is the truth.  If we want to solve this problem we have got to change our attitude of mind towards it.  One of the things that will have to be driven into the people is that this is a small community with certain resources which are not unlimited. I think the worst service that could be rendered to the people would be to give them false notions in that regard.  Our resources are not unlimited. They are very limited, in a <Col N="2055" /> sense; but, fortunately, we have here the fundamentals of existence.  I think, if we were prepared to do it, that we could be just as happy if we were to moderate our desires in a number of respects.  Here below we want very little, and we could be happy with the little if we approached it in the right way; but we want the people to approach it from the point of view that our resources are limited. <Col N="2056" /> What has been called frugal comfort is the most that, at the present time, we can hope for, and I think that in order to achieve that standard of general frugal comfort all of us will have to shed a number of the ideas that we have.  As to how that can be produced, I think everyone of us will have to work harder.</P>
