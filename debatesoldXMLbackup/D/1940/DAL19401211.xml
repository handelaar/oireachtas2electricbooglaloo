    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Family Allowances Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will cause statistical inquiries and calculations to be made forthwith whereon a scheme of family allowances can be founded when the present emergency has passed and finance can be provided out of revenue to meet such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have already had under consideration the practicability of establishing a scheme of family or children's allowances suitable to the circumstances of this country.  Without committing myself in any way to the adoption of any scheme for such allowances, I have appointed a small committee representative of the Departments principally concerned to go fully into the matter and furnish a report on the many complex questions involved.  Such a review will necessarily take some time to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, seeing that he has come so far to meet the suggestion which I have repeatedly made, of instituting a system of family allowances, by appointing an inter-Departmental committee, does he not take the view that a wider inquiry into this subject is requisite and that, in the financial circumstances in which we find ourselves, there is ample time for such an <Col N="986" /> inquiry profitably to be made; and, if he does take that view, will he not agree that social workers and economists of standing should be combined to review this matter from an extrainter-Departmental point of view, without in any way committing the Government to adopt or act upon such findings as they may come to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Having appointed this Departmental committee, I shall await that committee's report before going into the matter from any other point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that an inter-Departmental committee's function is to advise him from the very important Civil Service point of view on this question?  It may be that, in the light of the findings of social workers and economists, the Government would determine that policy overrode Civil Service views in connection with a problem of this kind, and in view of that would he discuss the matter with me, hereafter at least, with a view to further considering the advisability of a commission on the lines suggested in my question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to discussing that matter later with the Deputy or with anybody else, but I think we could usefully await the report of the Departmental committee before doing anything further in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I know anything of such reports there will be another fence to cross before we put the work in hand, as it certainly will be put in hand some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the highest, and (b) the lowest rate of interest paid on short-term advances (Treasury Bills) from 1st September, 1939, to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period mentioned by the Deputy there was only one borrowing by way of Exchequer Bills and I would prefer not to be <Col N="987" /> pressed to a public declaration of the discount rate paid as this might affect other negotiations for borrowings of a similar character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each county the area of (a) arable, and (b) non-arable land in the possession or under the immediate control of the Board of Works; and if he will state further the percentage of the arable land in each case which was tilled in the year 1940, and the percentage which it is proposed to bring under tillage in 1941.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The particulars are in the form of a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Tabular statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">COIMISINERI NA NOIBREACHA POIBLIDHE.</P>
      <P>Statement showing in respect of each County the area of <i>(a)</i> Arable and <i>(b)</i> Non-Arable land in the possession or under the immediate control of the Commissioners of Public Works, and the percentage of the Arable land in each County which was tilled in the year 1940, and the percentage which it is proposed to bring under tillage in the year 1941.</P>
      <P>It will be observed that two Park properties are included in the Statement, viz., The Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, County Kerry, and The Longmeadows Estate, County Dublin.  At the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, County Kerry, besides the maintenance of a large herd of prize cattle, a considerable area of land is under cultivation.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the commissioner received an application from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union on behalf of the staff of Kilkenny Mental Hospital to have the present wages increased by 25 per cent., but I have no information that any agreement was entered into between the commissioner and the union on the specific matters referred to in the question.  The proposals of the commissioner were received on the 4th April last.  They have not been approved.  The community as a whole is affected by the present economic conditions and there were no adequate reasons why any particular sections of the community who are in permanent employment and enjoy pension rights should be secured at the expense of others who may not be so well circumstanced. Moreover, economy in local administration is of vital importance at the present time if the standard of local government service is to be maintained without imposing undue strain on the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>The Emergency Powers (Control of Export) Order, 1940, and the Scrap Iron (Control of Export) Act, 1938, prohibit the export, save under licence, of scrap metal, including scrap iron.  A licence under the Emergency Powers (Control of Export) Order was granted to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company for the export of a quantity of steel rails to be recovered from the Burtonport and Letterkenny extension of the company's line.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  Eighteen vacancies were filled&mdash;eight by the re-engagement of clerks who had previous experience at Letterkenny Employment Exchange and the remaining ten by new appointments. For the latter ten, 47 candidates were interviewed.  Each male candidate of military age and unmarried was asked to state on his application form whether he had offered his services to the Defence Forces and whether, if his services had not been accepted, he was in a position to produce documentary evidence from the military authorities to that effect. Five of the eight clerks who (as already stated) were re-engaged on account of previous experience were between 18 and 30 years of age and unmarried. The only other male candidate who was appointed is over 30 years of age and is married.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The methods by which an increase in the number of Irish registered ships could best be effected have been under consideration for some considerable time.  The difficulties in this connection have been increased by the fact that the outbreak of war in Europe has greatly aggravated the risks attendant upon the <Col N="998" /> ownership of ships, even though they sail under the flags of neutral nations, so that this country has already sustained losses on that account which have been relatively very heavy.  The whole question, however, has been the subject of close investigation in the light of the circumstances existing since the war began, and I hope to come to a conclusion in regard to it at an early date.</P>
      <P>So far as the shipbuilding industry is concerned, I may say that I have had continually in mind the desirability and possibility of reviving it, and every effort has been made by me to this end.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, these efforts have been successful to the extent that the Dublin Dockyard has been at last re-opened. The position elsewhere is under active consideration, and I can assure the Deputy that, in the national interest, no effort will be spared to bring about an extension of the industry to other centres.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that his failure to prepare a storage scheme for grain crops has resulted in the exploitation of small producers, who are in immediate need of money, by grain speculators; and what measures he proposes to take to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there has been any exploitation of producers such as is suggested in the Deputy's question, or that there is any shortage of storage accommodation for grain crops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Minister himself published the notice through the Government Information Bureau that, if the speculators continue to store barley, he might find it necessary in the spring time to fix a maximum price, in order to prevent speculators profiteering at the expense of the producers?  Does he not realise that what has happened is that he has found himself unable to provide storage, as we asked him to do, and that speculators with stores, which the Minister should have commandeered, have gone into the market and forced the small farmer to sell at whatever price they were prepared to give him; and in the spring of the year those <Col N="1001" /> speculators hope to cash in upon it? Our proposal was that the Minister should take the grain in and hold it for the small farmer and give him a reasonable price for it, after deducting the cost of storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that barley which was worth 18/- a few months ago is now worth 25/-?  The speculator is going to net that profit, not the farmer, simply because the Minister would not agree to fix a fair price when we asked him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see that if he had taken the barley, or would now take it, and pay the farmers a sum on account and sell it in April to the millers, when they are ready to take it and use it, at a fair price, and then debit the farmers with the cost of storage and give them whatever extra is due to them, he would ensure that they would get the profit and not the speculator?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the question with regard to the present position, as put to me.  Whatever may be the position of farmers selling their oats and barley below what it was actually worth two or three months ago, at the present day if any farmer has barley to sell and if he communicates direct with the maize miller he can sell it direct.  I do not know if he can get 25/- per barrel, as Deputy Hughes has suggested.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that a great deal of damage has been done?  If he realises that, it may mean an improvement in the future.  The small man is forced on to the market because he had no place to store his barley during the last three months and is now constrained to sell at 20/- when he could sell at 25/- if he waited until the spring of the year.</P>

(b) None of these supervisors is a permanent officer of my Department or a permanent civil servant, but the work of the supervisors is under the direction of permanent or quasi-permanent officers of my Department.  (c) All the supervisors have been recruited from outside.  A number of them who had previously been employed on schemes, such as the land reclamation scheme, and who had given satisfactory service, were re-employed on the farm improvement scheme.  The remainder were selected following an interview by a Departmental selection board.  (d) The <Col N="1005" /> supervisors were selected because of their fitness to deal with the problems, including drainage, arising out of the farm improvement scheme.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is not available, and I am not prepared to incur the trouble and expense of attempting to procure it. The amount of land in the hands of the Land Commission varies almost from day to day according as lands are acquired and distributed, and, similarly the tillable area is constantly varying as lands are fenced, drained and prepared for division.</P>
      <P>During the current year special steps were taken to see that the requirements of the Compulsory Tillage Order were complied with in respect of all lands for which the Land Commission had responsibility and an area was, in fact, tilled which was substantially in excess of the statutory quota.  This tillage was not always done holding by holding, or estate by estate; inspectors were given authority to have arable land on hands cultivated wherever the work could be satisfactorily done to the intent that the Department's liability in respect of all their lands would be fully met.  A similar method will be followed in 1941 when, as the Deputy will be aware, a larger percentage of tillage than in 1940 is being called for.  It is quite impossible to make even a guess as to the amount of arable land for the cultivation of a proportion of which the Land Commission will be responsible next year.</P>

Section 68 is entitled: &ldquo;Application of compensation: purchase money payable to parties under disability amounting to £200 to be deposited in the bank&rdquo; and it provides for the application of moneys so deposited.  Section 70 is entitled: &ldquo;Order for application and investment meanwhile&rdquo;&mdash;I presume pending the distribution of the moneys deposited to the parties rightfully entitled to receive them.  Section 71 is entitled: &ldquo;Sums from £20 to £200 to be deposited or paid to trustees.&rdquo; Section 72 is entitled: &ldquo;Sums not exceeding £20 to be paid to parties.&rdquo; Section 73 provides &ldquo;All sums payable under contract with persons not absolutely entitled, to be paid into bank&rdquo;.  Section 74 provides that &ldquo;Court of Chancery may direct application of money in respect of leases or reversions as they may think just&rdquo;. Section 76 provides &ldquo;Where parties refuse to convey or do not show title or cannot be found, the purchase money to be deposited&rdquo;.  Section 77 provides &ldquo;Upon deposit being made, a receipt to be given and the lands to vest upon a deed poll being executed&rdquo;. Section 78 provides for application of the moneys so deposited and also provides for application of the compensation. Section 79 provides that the party in possession is to be deemed the owner, and Section 80 covers the question of costs in cases of money deposited.</P>

      <P>In case the money is lodged in the Bank of Ireland, is the person applying for compensation to be put to any expense in asserting his right to it?  The Electricity Supply Board are in this case looking for something that is not theirs.  They get Parliamentary authority to acquire it.  The person concerned gets the lowest possible price that can be paid.  That money is put into the Bank of Ireland. Is the person concerned to be put to any expense in securing its release? I have a particular interest in this matter because many years ago, when I was a member of a <Col N="1019" /> local authority, £9 compensation was awarded in respect of a small piece of land and it cost £59 to prove title.  In this case, I am sure the Minister is taking every precaution to secure that the Electricity Supply Board will pay the lowest possible price and, if they find themselves in any difficulty, will the expense be passed on to the person to whom compensation is awarded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question.  Whether a person will get compensation at all or not, will depend on his ability, to prove title. He will, I think, be under no more expense than he would be if we do not adopt these provisions.  These provisions may, in certain circumstances, save him expense.  It is quite obvious that, if he is to get compensation from the board, he will have to prove his title.  We do not want the work to be held up merely because a person may have difficulty in proving title.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) is the only sub-section which deals with compensation in respect of this matter &mdash;the suffering of loss through the taking and use by the board of any supply of water.  I understood this amendment to have a particular meaning&mdash; that a person could not say: &ldquo;I am entitled to get damages through an action in a court for loss caused by being deprived of the supply of water&rdquo; and, at the same time, to get compensation. The terms of this amendment would seem to have a wider application than is intended.  Suppose a workman gets injured, while a contractor is engaged in taking away water.  The taking away of water is a thing in respect of which compensation is payable.  Does this amendment mean that the workman will be precluded from taking a legal action for compensation against his employer and that he will have to go against the individual who gets compensation for loss of the water-right.</P>

      <P>On this stage, I should like briefly to call attention to a couple of points.  There is one matter which I desire to mention to see whether we can clear up certain confusion which has occurred.  The Minister told us during the course of an argument on the Committee Stage that the State had made profits out of the moneys which it had advanced to the Electricity Supply Board.  He was questioned about the amount, and I think his answer was that it was considerable. <Col N="1024" /> When I asked him would it go as far as £100,000&mdash;my meaning was £100,000 a year&mdash;I was told that no precise answer could be given me, but it would probably be as much as that.  Accordingly, I put down a question asking the Minister to state for each year in which such profits accrued the amount of profit made by the Government through the rates of interest fixed on advances made to the Electricity Supply Board under the various Acts.  The answer I got was that the rates of interest had varied from time to time.  I was told that the balance may be, if anything, slightly in favour of the Exchequer, but any profits that might accrue would be only casual, and due to the fact that borrowing had been effected at more favourable rates than were anticipated. So the Minister's successor, the Minister for Finance, does not think so much of his efforts to get profits for the State?  I asked for a statement of the amount, but the present Minister for Finance refused, or at any rate neglected, to give it.  The previous Minister told us they were considerable, and had in fact made it a point in argument that the citizens were to get some profits from the board.  He used that more or less as a buttress to an argument he was advancing.  Now we are told they were merely casual.  I think the idea of the present Minister for Finance is that they are not considerable at all.</P>
      <P>The second point is with regard to the advances to the board.  On the Committee Stage the Minister told us that, under the various Acts, the amounts which were, so to speak, at the disposal of the board, amount to about £9,000,000&mdash;I am giving general figures&mdash;that the advances which had been sanctioned by the board to date amounted to £7,000,000, and that accordingly the board had £2,000,000, so to speak, to draw on, about which they had not made commitments.  It was because of that I put down an amendment to cut down the sum voted now by £2,000,000, and when I asked about that on the Committee Stage I was told it had been answered earlier on the Financial Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first amendment, which was down in my name. May I come back again to the simple point?  The Minister told me in the course of the debate that the sums, so to speak, voted by this House to the board amounted to £9,000,000, and that the advances were about £7,000,000.  I find here that sub-section (1) of a particular Act&mdash;I am stressing that&mdash;is repealed, and it is hereby enacted that the sums advanced shall not exceed the sum of £10,000,000.  The old sum in that sub-section was £6,259,000.  There are advances here of £4,000,000.  If under various legislation the House had voted to the board something over £9,000,000, and under this Liffey Reservoir Act which we are proposing to amend there was a limit of £6,250,000, there is £2,750,000 somewhere else.  We are, therefore, voting to the board £10,250,000 under this, and £2,750,000 elsewhere.  There is about £13,000,000 voted by the House for the purposes of the Shannon and various additional schemes.  Of that, according to the Minister, advances had been sanctioned up to an amount of £7,000,000, and the board has in fact £2,000,000 at its disposal for which advances had not been authorised.  As far as I can make any calculation there is now not merely £2,000,000, but an additional £4,000,000. We got a White Paper which showed us how the £4,000,000 was to be disposed of, so there is still £2,000,000 somewhere hidden, and it is on that matter I should like to have information. The Minister could satisfy my curiosity if he would tell me what are the various Acts&mdash;I mean prior to this Act&mdash;under which sums were voted to the board which came to that total of £9,000,000 odd.  If the Minister would give me a statement of the various Acts prior to the amendment which is proposed here, and the sums voted under each amounting to a total of £9,000,000, then I think it would be easy or at least possible to work out the rest.  I should like to have that point cleared up, because I understood from the Minister's language that <Col N="1026" /> somewhere or other there was a reserve fund of £2,000,000&mdash;prior to our voting this sum&mdash;at the disposal of the board but not allocated to them.  We are now handing over another £4,000,000, and have a White Paper telling us what that £4,000,000 is for.</P>
      <P>I did ask the Minister during the course of the debate, and I think he gave me an assent to it, if it would be possible now at last to get the accounts of the Turf Development Board published.  The Turf Development Board is now going to be run in some sort of double harness with the Electricity Supply Board, and it becomes more important than ever that the people should know what moneys they have got, what moneys they have expended, and whether any success has so far attended their efforts.  The Minister, I think, did assent to my request that the accounts of the Turf Development Board should be published, and I should like to have an assurance from him that as soon as may be we shall see those accounts in proper form.  In connection with the accounts, the Minister again gave me an assurance that we would get such figures through the annual reports of the board from this time on as would enable us to get the cost of generating electricity at the Portarlington station. In that connection, I should like if he would see that the cost which will be produced for us will be one comparable with the cost of generating electricity elsewhere.  In other words, the Minister will take certain matters into account, notably this, that the board has certain obligations under the Electricity Supply Act of 1887 which Portarlington would not have on it in the ordinary course.  I should like to have the figure, when it is brought out, brought out in such a way as to be comparable with the figure which the board has put down as its cost of generating under its various overheads compulsorily put upon it by other Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point of detail to which I want to refer is in connection with a matter which was stressed very much here, that is the superannuation scheme for employees.  The Minister told us it was now only a question of <Col N="1027" /> agreement as between the Department of Finance and the board itself in order to have the superannuation scheme introduced.  He was pressed as to a date and, while he would not say to Deputy Norton that he would promise it for early next year, he did say that the employees of the board could expect to have it some time in the year 1941.  I am stressing that because at a later stage there seems to be some little decline from that particular promise, and I want to have the promise reinstated, the promise being that as soon as certain detailed particulars, that apparently were the only thing in conflict, were agreed as between the board and the Department of Finance the superannuation scheme would be introduced.  There is no longer any point of principle.  I understand from that phrase of the Minister's that the principle has been accepted that there should be superannuation for these employees of the board and that it is only a question of arranging the detail.</P>
    <P>I suppose two-thirds of the discussion that has taken place on this measure has taken place on the question of the money it was proposed to devote to the Portarlington station, whether that would be a proper experiment as opposed to the moneys which the House generally believed should be expended upon the development of electricity in agricultural districts in rural Ireland.  There are two points which arise there.  One is as to whether the Portarlington scheme is a scheme already approved of by the board or whether it is one regarded as a risk and experiment by them, as it is by the Minister, and therefore only taken on by them on certain assurances given by the Turf Development Board backed by the Minister and the Government.  I think we got precise information from the Minister that the board's independence of action has not been abandoned.  I fear it has been somewhat compromised.  The Minister has told us they are still in a position to reject this Portarlington scheme if the board so desire.  I put it to him also that they would be bound to report in their next report upon this <Col N="1028" /> scheme and to tell us their view on it and let the public see what was their attitude to the scheme.  The Minister apparently agreed that it would not merely be open to the board but incumbent upon the board to let the public know what was the board's idea of the Portarlington development.</P>
    <P>The further matter was the general matter of policy.  When the whole electricity measure was under discussion many years ago the biggest point, the point that gave rise to most discussion, was the question of the economics of the scheme.  There was a general feeling in those days, as it was very precisely put, that Dublin, with its relatively vast electricity-consuming population, was going to be made the scapegoat for all the other schemes throughout the country.  The phrase was generally used that Dublin, with a properly developed scheme, was going to have put upon its shoulders all the bankrupt concerns elsewhere through the country That was always spoken of in the usual context that the scheme itself would never pay and was generally a hare-brained matter. Events have, of course, turned out much more happily than were forecast, and with the board last year selling about 300,000,000 units, when it was believed that they never would sell 110,000,000 units, the early fears have been dissipated.  It was arranged, as a result of the original arguments, that no district would be obliged to bear the cost of bringing electricity to any other district.  That was in order to satisfy those people who were vocal in regard to Dublin and, generally speaking, the district was established by relation to the transformer station.</P>
    <P>The situation under the measure we have at the moment is that the country is divided into districts which are grouped around transformer stations. The obligation that was put on the board is phrased in a negative way&mdash; that it shall not be possible or legal for the board to charge any district with the expense of bringing electricity elsewhere than to that district.  As I understand, the situation has been reached that the board have developed all the areas which can be called <Col N="1029" /> economic, developed all the areas, in other words, which will pay for themselves at a price which will make electricity a desirable commodity for the people.  There is quite a number of areas, of course, outside the area of development, quite a number of small towns, which would be even aimed at in the original scheme, to which electricity has not been brought, and when the board are asked about these, I understand the formal answer generally given is that it would not be economic to bring electricity to those areas. You have, therefore, this situation in certain counties that there are small towns in which the board have at the moment an area of supply&mdash;that generally being occasioned by the fact that prior to the board coming into existence there was some small local company which supplied electricity but which, of course, charged exorbitant rates; the board stepped in for the relief of the population of those areas, took over the small unit and fed into it Shannon or Pigeon House power. There is, therefore, this anomaly, that you have in a particular area certain towns of a particularly small population, somewhere between 1,000 and 500, tied on to the general Shannon development and other towns, with larger populations, not so tied on.  The board feel themselves in the position, I understand, when they answer deputations from those places, that they cannot move any further because their resources are limited and can no longer expand except where it is shown to them that the consumers in a particular area will pay for the cost of bringing the electricity to that place. If a particular view written up in the Banking Commission Report is accepted, the board have at this moment quite an amount of money in hands and that amount will grow from year to year as the board progresses. The board, however, feel that even if they had any money on hands they are prohibited by the Act from bringing electricity to places where they feel that it would be in the interests of the community to do so.</P>
    <P>The scheme when projected was looked on as a national scheme.  It was thought it was going to bring the <Col N="1030" /> amenity of light at least to all people grouped together in communities with a minimum of 500 in number.  In the main it was accepted that, irrespective of the distance to be travelled, whether the small area paid for itself or not, electricity would be supplied to the sections of the community grouped in those small towns.  One has only to glance through the Electricity Supply Report to see that there is quite a number of places&mdash;not so many now as there used to be&mdash;where there are small supplies which have not been taken over by the board, but one has only to glance over the history of the development to realise that there is quite a number of places to which electricity can be brought and which are left out.</P>
    <P>In the original discussion of the whole electricity scheme the phrase that was generally used about it was that electricity should be brought to the towns of this country of 500 population and upwards.  There are three places I want to mention.  The town of Ballinrobe has a population of 1,300; Cahirciveen has a population of 1,700; Dingle has a population of 1,800.  There is no electricity supply brought by the Shannon to any of these places.  There are small stations there.  As far as I remember, the price for electricity is 10d. or 8d. a unit for lighting purposes.  The board have been requested by all these three places to join on the Shannon supply, and the reply is that on account of the geographical position of these places it is not exactly economic to do it; that they are tied by the phrase in the Act and the policy that was imposed upon them by the Act not to bring electricity there.</P>
    <P>We have already had an example in this country of decay that was caused to certain towns in the old days when the railways were planned.  It has always been asserted, with certainly a great deal of truth, that the railways as originally planned in this country were planned for strategic purposes and did not follow the ordinary run of trade as trade then was.  The result of it has been, one can get the records from <Col N="1031" /> history, that certain places which were on the point of flourishing collapsed into decay simply because the railway line was not brought into their neighbourhood. With that example before us, it would be rather fantastic if we allowed the same sort of thing to develop and that one town would be better placed from the development of electricity and the provision of this amenity than another simply because of geographical position.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the time has come&mdash; it might be that it would arise on an Electricity Supply Board report, if not on some measures that would be specially introduced for the purpose&mdash; when the House should get a chance of discussing and coming to a conclusion upon that one big point of policy&mdash; whether the supply of electricity is to be spread into other areas, whether we will permit people to get this particular amenity in this way, and whether or not the electricity supply to a particular town is going to pay for itself. We might consider whether it would be desirable to have a change, and if the phrasing in the Act could be loosened somewhat in order to allow the board more discretion.  If there is to be additional expense, how that is to be met is another matter.  It might have to be done by widening the district, bringing it under some of the Local Government Acts or under a system of county groupings, making special provision for a place like Dublin, which takes nearly one-third of the entire electricity produced in the country.</P>
    <P>There is, it could be suggested, a case to be made for making definite areas of charge.  In that connection I said earlier that there were certain resources at hand.  In the Report of the Banking Commission, on page 373, and continued on the next page, there is an addendum signed by Professor Duncan in connection with the Electricity Supply Board.  He draws attention to a specially important matter. He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But contrast the position of the Electricity Supply Board with that of <Col N="1032" /> a public company formed for the same purpose: the latter would not be under any obligation (indeed, it would not normally be permitted) to repay its capital to its share-, stock-and debenture-holders.  Similarly, municipal undertakings are permitted by statute to provide either depreciation and obsolescence funds or the repayment of their capital, but not both.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The situation revealed in that paragraph indicates the very heavy burdens that were originally put on the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not know whether the time has exactly come for the lightening of these burdens, but we are approaching the day when these burdens should be lightened.  When the scheme was originally planned, there were numbers of contingent liabilities which could not be precisely estimated.  It was thought desirable to make the board do what Professor Duncan calls attention to, not merely to repay its capital, but also to provide for depreciation and obsolescence.  Let us take it that 25 years may be regarded as the useful life of the scheme and that after 25 years we are to regard the scheme as having completed one phase.  At the end of that period the whole machinery will have been remade, the whole plant reequipped and all the capital will have been paid off, so that the generation 25 years after the introduction of the first Shannon scheme will find itself with a completely remade plant in its possession and no debt.  As Professor Duncan says, that is a position that no public company is put into.  It is a position that municipal authorities running schemes are not allowed to get into.</P>
    <P>There are certain points to be remembered. It was thought unwise, when the scheme was first undertaken, to depart from the arrangements made by Siemens Schuckert.  Again, at the time when the scheme could be looked at from a near view, it was recognised these large contingent responsibilities had to be met.  On top of that, a huge bill was sent in by the contractors, amounting to over £1,000,000.  Until that difficulty was <Col N="1033" /> cleared up it was thought desirable to keep the Electricity Supply Board in the position to which Professor Duncan refers.  The most of the difficulties facing the inner finances of the scheme have disappeared, but the position at the moment is that, with no big contingent liabilities facing them, the members of the board are forced by law to do that to which Professor Duncan calls attention.  They are bound to repay capital and provide for the depreciation and obsolescence of the machinery.</P>
    <P>Professor Duncan arrived at the conclusion that, without increasing electricity rates by a farthing, there was £250,000 which could be saved, and this £250,000 could be set aside to form a growing fund for the wiping out of a debt which, he thought, was growing too heavy.  If that £250,000 is there, it would appear to be possible to leave the electricity charges as they are at the moment and have a surplus gathered in every year which could be used for the bringing of electricity to small towns or spreading it to the rural community.  I do not know whether the time is exactly ripe for that to be done now, but we ought to be getting very close to that period.</P>
    <P>The answer may be made that if it is not economic to bring electricity to those towns and small villages, then the £250,000 per annum will soon be dried up.  The board usually takes a conservative view at the beginning.  When asked to bring electricity to a small town or village they usually begin by estimating the existing number of consumers, if there has been a local undertaking, and they get a pretty accurate idea of how much it will cost to bring electricity there and how many units they will be likely to sell.  In that way they are able to estimate the price per unit.  But once the electricity is conveyed to the small town or village the records show how amazingly rapid has been the development.  I will give one example.  At a conference of municipal authorities held in September of this year a gentleman from Kilkee was rash enough to say that a house-holder who now paid from 18/- to a guinea every two months for electricity formerly paid from 6/- to 8/- to the local undertaking. <Col N="1034" /> That drew a response from the Public Relations Department of the Electricity Supply Board, a response that was a complete refutation of the phrase used by the Kilkee gentleman.</P>
    <P>But there was something else to be got out of the response.  The public relations officer said that the Electricity Supply Board went into Kilkee in April, 1938, at the request of the townspeople and, in particular, of the Kilkee Town Commissioners.  Prior to this the electricity supply was obtained from a Kilkee electricity undertaking. In its last year of trading this body sold 23,538 units, for which it received £1,075.  In the financial year ended 31st March last the Electricity Supply Board sold 217,000 units, for which it received £1,937.  If that is to be regarded as typical, the electricity consumption in two years increased by ten times, while the revenue which the board derived increased by only £900 on £1,000.  They were able to sell ten times the number of units which Kilkee previously consumed and the residents of Kilkee paid only £900 more.  If progress of that type can be achieved in a small place like Kilkee, it seems to be almost a platitude to say that Cahirciveen, Ballinrobe, Dingle, Clifden, Manorhamilton, and a variety of other places with small populations, if they could get electricity at anything approaching favourable rates, would advance to the point where the supply would become economic.</P>
    <P>But the board hesitate, because of the rigidity of the existing legislation, to bring electricity to these places. They are afraid when they consider possible consequences.  Supposing one town did not make as much progress as another, they might like to be placed in the position that they could charge other districts to make good any losses, but that is a thing that, by the existing Act, they are forbidden to do.  There are certain places like Ballinrobe, Cahirciveen and Dingle which leap to the eye, but I could take other places. For instance, in Louth, you have Termonfeckin, Baltray.  Dunleer, Castlebellingham and Clogher, where one would imagine it would be easy enough to bring a supply.  The people <Col N="1035" /> in those areas are deprived of the use of electricity.  In Kilkenny there are Gowran, Goresbridge and Borris; in Leitrim, Drumshambo, Leitrim and Drumkieran, and in Galway, Oughterard, Headford and Shrule which are similarly circumstanced.  There is a number of places where it seems to me that a business board would make these advances and would certainly find that success would result.  The board, confined as it is at the moment, cannot undertake this work.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should consider quite soon the possibility of relaxing two points in the scheme under which the board was built up.  The first point has reference to area of charge or the district, as the phrase is.  Secondly, I should like him to begin to consider the point to which Professor Duncan drew attention&mdash;that he would have regard to the internal finances of the board and try to come to a conclusion as to whether or not one of these very heavy obligations could not be removed from the shoulders of the board.  Let them either repay the capital so that when the next generation comes to think of its electricity problem, it will have no debt outstanding from the Shannon electricity scheme.  Alternatively, let him see that the board will keep the machinery in good order and provide against depreciation and obsolescence so that they will hand it over at the end of 25 years in good condition. Then there is a certain sum of money on hands.  I am always speaking, of course, subject to the reservation that Professor Duncan's phrases were written in connection with the accounts of two years ago.  Although the account we have for 1939-40, is a rather favourable one, it is by no means as favourable as the one which preceded it and it may be that, for some reason or other, the board's finances are relatively in a decline.  Taking the finances as they stood at the time Professor Duncan wrote that phrase, the situation is that by removing one of these obligations there is in the hands of the board a sum of £250,000 a year which could be used to inaugurate a more generous policy on the part of the <Col N="1036" /> board in the way of bringing electricity to some of the smaller towns in the country or of bringing electricity to the country.  The board, I understand, are anxious for a further extension, but they are not allowed to proceed with it by the present Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to endorse the request made by Deputy McGilligan for an early and, hereafter, a regular segregation and publication of the accounts of the Turf Development Board.  The Minister, speaking recently at some scientific gathering, where there was a symposium of turf development in this country, stated that he sought informed criticism and that he would be glad to hear it.  He admitted that the turf development on which the Government had embarked and in which it had sought to involve the Electricity Supply Board was of an experimental character.  On the following day a distinguished geologist turned up and proceeded to furnish in the columns of the newspapers of the day a highly informed criticism of a character which I have heard before but which I have never mentioned here before.  That was that there was grave misunderstanding within the councils of the Turf Development Board itself. He suggests that they are approaching this whole turf and bog problem in Ireland on the assumption that the nature of the bogs in Ireland is closely analogous to that of the bogs in Germany and Russia, an analogy, he hastens to add, that does not exist. The nature of the bogs is quite different and the appropriate treatment for them is also quite different.  He states that what might be a comparatively economic operation on a Continental bog, which is very dry and which is differently constituted owing to the time taken for its deposit and its different nature, might not only be uneconomic in Ireland but would be quite unfeasible.  I admit that once the name of the late Professor Sir John Griffith is associated with any experimental work, one is inclined to approach the matter with respect and to give the experiment the benefit of any doubt one has because one has the feeling that a man of such distinction who had such long and honourable public service <Col N="1037" /> thought the experiment was something worth following to the bitter end or he would never have allowed his name to be associated with it.  It was because his name was associated with it that I have foreborne speaking about this turf business very much more trenchantly than I otherwise would.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i> the whole thing seems to me the wildest codology.  Mind you, when I heard of these latest proposals about turf development, my mind went back to an incident that took place in this House when the most irresponsible member of the Fianna Fáil Government first approached the subject of turf.  He had the insolence and the brazen audacity to say in this House&mdash; I refer to a statement of the Minister for Supplies, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was initiating the scheme for hand-won turf; I think it was on a Financial Resolution to supply money for the purchase of bags in which this hand-won turf was to be disposed of&mdash;that the Government was satisfied that this industry would be second only in importance to the agricultural industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I am sure, is cognisant of the fact that we are discussing turf development in this Bill only in so far as it is associated with the generation of electricity; not the turf development scheme in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that, but having regard to the fact that the Executive Council came forward with this proposal in regard to hand-won turf, and that a member of that Executive Council assured us that it was going to be the second greatest industry in the country, while our experience up to this date is that the only man who made anything out of it was the man who supplied the bags, most of which were subsequently lost, can we be blamed if we look with suspicion on the same Executive Council when they now produce a scheme of turf development in connection with the production of electricity, which will rival the hydro-electric schemes already established and which they say is preferable to the hydro-electric <Col N="1038" /> schemes at present available?  There is plenty of power to be got in the rivers of the country at present.  Yet this Clonsast proposal is being put forward in preference to the hydro-electric scheme by the same Executive Council who told us that the hand-won turf industry was going to be the second greatest industry in the country.  My time as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee is spent in trying to ascertain what became of the bags purchased for this hand-won turf scheme.  A quarter of a million of them were purchased; 200,000 of them have gone up the spout and we do not know where they are.  That is all that is left of the hand-won turf scheme&mdash;the inspectors going round looking for the bags&mdash;all the rest has gone.</P>
      <P>If that is all that is left of the hand-won turf scheme after four years, are we going to have nothing but derelict machinery left out of the Clonsast power scheme after five years?  If we are, is it right (1) to spend £1,000,000 of money on this enterprise; and (2) is it right to drag the Electricity Supply Board into it?  Because, remember this, the electricity supply scheme was started in this country in the face of the most savage opposition from the Fianna Fáil Party, who denounced it as an extravagant, reckless, mad enterprise which could only properly be described in the classic words of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce as &ldquo;Cosgrave's white elephant&rdquo;.  After that barrage of criticism, it has now become the Fianna Fáil Government's pride and joy.  But, what is much more important, it has maintained a standard of financial rectitude and solvency which would reflect credit on any enterprise of the same character operated under the auspices of any Government in the world.  Will the Government that sought to destroy it when they were in opposition, now that they are in government, achieve their fell purpose, not through malice, but through incompetence? They are going to drape round the neck of the Electricity Supply Board a turf development scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at all this problem, I think we ought to ask ourselves: Is <Col N="1039" /> this Clonsast electric turf development scheme designed to supplement the present available supplies of power, or is it designed as a means of salvaging the immense losses of public money for which the Turf Development Board have been responsible down to date? Because, if it is the latter, then I ask this House seriously to consider the fable of the man who lost his cheese which rolled out of his hand down the hill.  He had two other cheeses, and he rolled a second cheese down the hill after the first cheese.  Then a friend came up and said: &ldquo;What are you doing throwing your cheeses away?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I am not throwing my cheeses away.  One cheese rolled down the hill and I sent the other to look for it.  If that does not come back shortly, I propose to send the last one I have.&rdquo;  It was with the greatest difficulty that the friend persuaded that man to go home with the last surviving cheese and abandon the other two, and so preserve for his family one-third of the provision which they ought to have if the father had been a rational man.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Government are a bit more rational than the man who rolled the cheese down the hill. I believe they are capable of just such follies.  What Deputies have to ask themselves is: Are we rolling the Electricity Supply Board down the hill with the Turf Development Board in the foolish hope that by staking all that splendid property we can redeem the wreckage for which the Turf Development Board has been responsible?</P>
    <P>Now, there will be articles in the newspapers to-morrow and there will be loud protests from all the gentlemen on the Turf Development Board; every vested interest getting a living out of those bogs will be up on their ears and saying: &ldquo;I protest against this foul slander&rdquo;, and time will have to tell whether I am right or whether they are right.  I am not easy about this proposal to hypothecate the funds of the Electricity Supply Board and the funds of the Exchequer.  I am not easy because I remember the hand-won turf scheme, which was the second greatest industry in the country, and I know <Col N="1040" /> what has become of the bags, or some of them at least, and before I am finished I will find out what has become of the rest of them.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister this question: Why is he staking his reputation on this scheme while he is still in the position of looking for informed criticism? Why did he not get all that criticism, why did he not invite all that criticism, why did he not seek it out before he made up his mind to commit us to this plan?  Was it because his colleagues came to him and said: &ldquo;The bottom has gone out of the Turf Development Board and if you do not patch that quickly the hulk will sink; do not wait for prudent inquiry; do not wait for a careful survey; do not wait for informed criticism; save the hulk of the Turf Development Board and we will finance the damage somehow afterwards&rdquo;?  I suspect that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>Now, that is bad enough if the extent of the patch we are going to put on the sinking hulk can be measured in cash and we know what it is.  But are we going to stake the whole of the Electricity Supply Board, in addition to the money provided in the Financial Resolution?  Remember, this situation can develop.  You start off with an assurance from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there is no question of hypothecating the assets of the Electricity Supply Board for this purpose.  But, once you involve the Electricity Supply Board in this enterprise, what is to prevent the Minister for Industry and Commerce putting in force Deputy McGilligan's suggestion to-day of suspending the obsolescence fund or the capital extension fund for a period of years in order to derive from that source further sums which may be devoted to development? When we come to examine the nature of the development, might we not discover that, instead of developing distribution along the lines outlined by Deputy McGilligan for which I think there is a great deal to be said, we may discover that that development was the further subsidisation of the then sinking Clonsast scheme?  And all this at a time when the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself comes into <Col N="1041" /> public and says, &ldquo;I want informed criticism&rdquo;, and within 48 hours gets it, and of a most alarming character.</P>
    <P>Now, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce were in a position to say to-day: &ldquo;Well, I threw out that challenge in a friendly way; I wanted to draw any public-spirited citizen who had comment to make supported by scientific information and I have elicited no replies,&rdquo; then he would be able to claim a certain amount of confidence that there was no unseen pitfall before him.  But he calls for informed criticism and within 48 hours he gets a pretty long criticism. I do not profess to be capable of passing judgment on the merits of the opinions on this subject of that obviously public-spirited gentleman who delivered the lecture which appears in to-day's papers or on the opinions of the technical advisers of the board.  These are engineering problems and I am not an engineer. That is the situation.  I wonder is there any more informed criticism coming forward and if we can get an assurance from the Minister that this critic, who obviously spoke without acrimony or desire to hinder useful public work, will be secure from acrimonious assault and misrepresentation as a <i>saboteur.</i>  There is that danger.  If that once happened, then nobody is going to risk the same misrepresentation to try to help the Government and the Oireachtas to do what is right in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that I contemplate the association of the Electricity Supply Board with this Clonsast experiment with the greatest, the gravest, possible misgiving and I do not think that I am far wrong if I add that, were the Minister for Industry and Commerce perfectly free to speak frankly about this problem himself, he would be obliged to say much the same thing.  I am very sorry that the Electricity Supply Board has been brought into the matter at all.  I do not see how it advantages the thing at all to incorporate it in the Electricity Supply Board scheme.  I think this thing should have been allowed to stand on its own legs.</P>
    <P>Let them enter into a sub-contract with the Electricity Supply Board for <Col N="1042" /> the distribution of the power, if that were deemed the most efficient and economical way to get rid of it.  Mind you, there would have been a precedent for that procedure, because I understand that certain of the national electricity undertakings in the United States of America have, in fact, farmed out their power to existing public utility companies who have distributed it on a commission basis or who have bought the power in bulk and re-sold it to their consumers.  I see no reason whatever why Clonsast should not have established some such relations with the Electricity Supply Board, and that would have enabled us to see whether the company was a desirable entity to maintain perpetually or whether it would be better to cut our loss and get out of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>However, I suppose the die is now cast, and we are committed to certain expenditure, but I hope the Minister will make it perfectly clear at this initial stage that there is no intention in his mind, or in the minds of the Executive Council, at any future date-to hypothecate the securities or solvency of the Electricity Supply Board in order to make this Clonsast venture pay if it should prove eventually to be less satisfactory than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>Another thing is that I should also like to go on record as agreeing cordially with what Deputy McGilligan said on behalf of these small towns that have not yet secured supplies of electricity. Subject to the safeguards mentioned by Deputy McGilligan, I subscribe to all he said in that connection, and I desire to confirm, by my own experience, the hardship and seeming injustice of which these small communities appear to have a right to complain.</P>
    <P>Now, the third and last matter that I want to refer to is this.  On a previous occasion the Minister was good enough to say that he sympathised with my view that schedules of rates for every area in which the Electricity Supply Board was operating might, with advantage, be published from time to time so as to refresh the consumers memories as to what they were actually paying.  I should be glad to re-emphasise that request: (1) so as to ensure <Col N="1043" /> that widely differing rates would not be charged by the Electricity Supply Board in closely similar areas; and (2) so that from time to time the attention of the consumers could be directed to the advantages they derive from the national supply available; and, lastly, so as to apply a certain permanent pressure on the Electricity Supply Board who will be comparing their published rates with the commercial rates obtaining in the United States of America and in Great Britain, so that under that goad of constant competition by comparison they will be moved to effect reductions at the earliest possible moment that financial rectitude and prudent economics will permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to make a few brief observations.  Personally, without posing as an expert, I should like to favour a hydro scheme.  The Minister gave us a number of statistics which showed how the expenses of running a hydro scheme rose when the water was short, but taking a long view, and considering the available resources in this country, I should imagine that, having regard to the fact that cement is now manufactured here, that the rock would have to be crushed on the site, and so on, there would be very many points in favour of a hydro scheme.</P>
      <P>Now, I want to mention one other point.  I understand that some of the boilers in the Pigeon House have been adapted for burning turf, and I should like to ask the Minister how far, if that is a fact, any records have been kept as to the performance of a boiler burning turf, because, after all, there is turf available, and we must say that, if there is any enterprise which is capable of using local fuel, now is the time to get all the particulars in connection with that matter, and they ought to be placed before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be possible for Deputy McGilligan and myself to satisfy each other as to what is exactly the point of difference between us in relation to this matter of the unutilised resources of the Electricity Supply Board.  I understood that the point which he wished to have cleared up in that connection was whether or not the <Col N="1044" /> Electricity Supply Board had spent without due authority, and in order to show him that there was no substance whatever in that suggestion, I mentioned that so far from the Electricity Supply Board having availed up to the present to the full extent of the power which this House had conferred on the Minister for Finance to lend to the Electricity Supply Board, the board, in fact, had not so availed of that to the extent of, in round figures, £2,000,000. I mentioned in that connection, I think, the figure of £9,200,000, and roughly indicated what was the amount of the board's borrowings as against this power to lend up to £9,200,000.  It was, as I have said, roughly £2,000,000 less.  I quoted other figures subsequently, and again the margin remained the same.  The only difference is that we started, so to speak, at different points of the time schedule in computing the total lending powers of the Minister for Finance, and we did that&mdash;at least I did that&mdash;because of the fact that, subsequent to the passage of the Electricity Supply Act of 1931, the Parliamentary draftsman thought fit to start with that Act as from scratch, and to leave out of consideration the authority which had been granted to the Minister for Finance under earlier Acts to finance the requirements of the board.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that I should now set out to the full, as Deputy McGilligan has asked me, the sums which have been provided for the general purposes of the board under the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 and subsequent Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advances which the Minister for Finance is empowered to make to the board fall into two categories.  First of all, the advances which he may make for the special purposes laid down in the appropriate Act and, in addition, advances which he may make for the general purposes of the board.  Under the first of these categories, that is to say, advances for specific purposes, the Minister for Finance was empowered by Section 12 (2) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, as amended by Section 2 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1929, to advance to the board the sum of £156,000 to meet the liability <Col N="1045" /> of the board for interest and arrears of interest and sums advanced from the Central Fund under the Shannon Electricity Supply Act, 1925, and also for expenses incurred by the board in the operation, maintenance and repair of the Shannon works.</P>
    <P>In the same category, that is, advances for special or specific purposes, we can include the sum of £530,000 which was to be provided under the Shannon Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act (No. 2), 1934, for developing the water storage capacity of Loughs Derg, Ree and Allen.  The position in relation to these two advances for specific purposes is that £156,000, provided under the 1927 Act to meet interest and other liabilities, has been advanced to the board, but no advance has been requested or made in respect of the £530,000 which the Minister for Finance was empowered to advance to the board for the purpose of developing water storage under the 1934 Electricity Supply Act.</P>
    <P>Within the second category of advances which the Minister for Finance has been empowered to make since 1927, that is, advances for the general purposes of the board, we find that by the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, Section 12 (3), the Minister for Finance was empowered to advance £2,500,000 for any purpose other than to meet liability for interest and arrears of interest, etc., upon sums advanced under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925.  Under the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1931, the same Minister was empowered to advance £2,000,000 for the general purposes of the board.  He was empowered to advance a further £365,000, likewise for the general purposes of the board under the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1932, and a further £1,160,000 under the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1934, and finally £2,734,000 under the Liffey Reservoir Act, 1936, for the Liffey hydro-electric scheme and the general purposes of the board.</P>
    <P>The advances which I have mentioned, for the general purposes of the board, amount to £8,759,000, and if we add to that the sum of £530,000, which <Col N="1046" /> the Minister for Finance was authorised to advance in respect of increasing the storage capacity of the Shannon lakes, we get £9,289,000, which I mentioned, in reply to Deputy McGilligan's interjection, as the amount which the Minister for Finance had been empowered to advance for the purposes of the board.</P>

Under the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1934, a sum of £1,160,000 was provided, and again the original Act of 1931 was amended accordingly.

I was told they had got advances up to £7,000,000.  There is a sum of £4,000,000 here.  I take it that no part of that £4,000,000 has been advanced to them or allowed to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's contention was quite clearly this: that the board had spent money without ministerial authority.  That was the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Deputy's point.  I have assured him that they have not spent money without ministerial authority.  Then he suggested, that, even if they had not spent money without ministerial authority, they had committed themselves in such a manner that we should subsequently be called upon to honour obligations which they had entered into.  That might be so in this case, but with this big reservation, that the board, having secured ministerial authority for certain expenditure, had incurred the expenditure on the assumption that they would have to finance that expenditure <Col N="1050" /> out of their own resources, until such time as we could come to the Dáil and ask for the necessary authority for the Minister for Finance to lend the money, if the board wanted it, to recoup them for the expenditure which they had financed out of their reserves or cash resources.  That is the full position in regard to these moneys.  In relation to the £2,150,000, the board have got ministerial authority to incur that expenditure; they have incurred it, I think, to the extent of about £1,900,000.  They have been able to finance all that expenditure out of their reserves and cash resources, and I would say that the Minister for Finance has statutory authority to lend the board a large part, if not the whole, of the moneys which they have already expended.  I think it is desirable that the Minister for Finance should have a margin of that order on hand.</P>
      <P>But as I indicated, speaking on the Committee Stage of this Bill, I do not think that it is desirable that we should defer coming to the Dáil until we require so large a sum as £4,000,000. I am sure the Minister for Finance would wish that the Dáil should be aware of the board's requirements at very much shorter intervals, and that the draw upon him at any time should not exceed perhaps £2,000,000 or £2,500,000, as the case may be. However, there were special circumstances in this year and we have to make allowances for that.  It would not have been possible for the board at an earlier stage to have formed a very clear opinion as to what its ultimate commitments would be in regard to some of the works which it has undertaken and which it has carried out. There were the difficulties of preparing the legislation in existing circumstances and, accordingly, we have to come and ask the House to give the Minister for Finance authority to lend the board as large a sum as up to £4,000,000.  I do not think that is a figure which will be reached again, except in abnormal circumstances, for a very long time.  I do not think that it is desirable that the Government should defer coming to the House until the board's requirements have reached as large a figure as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> As I have said, I think we could make the case that, as far as the board has incurred any expenditure up to the present, the Minister for Finance has full authority to deal with that expenditure, at least full authority to deal with practically the whole of it and to finance that expenditure, if the board should call upon him to do so. I do not want, however, in that connection to make any great point of that, because I think that as we have an opportunity of re-establishing the former position, wherein the Minister for Finance had a fairly reasonable margin in hands to deal with large contingencies which might arise from time to time, and that as circumstances are at the moment, from the Parliamentary point of view, more or less normal, we must ask the Dáil to put the Minister for Finance in the same position as he was in, say, 12 months ago in regard to the requirements of the board.  I do not know whether there is any other aspect of that matter which I can clear up.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In that connection I might say that, if it were not Portarlington, it would have to be some other station.  The £800,000 is for steam plant which would be required either at Portarlington or at some other generating station of the board. The Deputy may recall that when I was, I think, speaking at the conclusion of the Second Reading debate on the Bill, I mentioned that the difference between the capital cost of putting down the necessary steam unit at the Pigeon House and putting it down at Portarlington would be only to the order of 10 per cent., so that, in fact, you might say that out of this £1,850,000 which remains in respect of future development, only £100,000 should be ascribed as the net sum to the Portarlington site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is leaving everything else aside: as to whether the money will be recouped or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, leaving aside future contingencies.  The Deputy suggested that we ought to reconsider the terms of the original 1927 Act in so far as it imposes conditions upon the board in regard to the general management and extension of the undertaking, and in that connection he referred to some suggestions which were made, I think, by Professor Duncan a member of the Banking Commission.  I think the matter is not at all as simple as is suggested in that passage of the Banking Commission's Report, and as the Deputy has suggested here, because we have to consider the interest, and I think the rightful interest, of the Exchequer in regard to this matter.  The Minister for Finance, in present circumstances, has to borrow upon terms which virtually demand the repayment of the amount originally borrowed within a period of from 20 to 25 years.  In the case of the last loan which was issued <Col N="1053" /> by the Exchequer the repayment period was fixed at 20 years.  In order to meet the sinking fund obligations in respect of these loans, the Minister for Finance has to raise from the taxpayers every year a considerable sum of money, and accordingly if he were to forego the repayment of the loan, as has been suggested, in order that the board might extend its system and develop an electricity demand here, it would be a complete departure from the original principle underlying the Act which was, that the consumers were to pay for the development of the board's undertaking and not the community at large: the Minister for Finance would have as I have said, to forego the amount which he should receive from the board in respect of the redemption of the loans, and, at the same time, would have to make provision out of the ordinary proceeds of taxation for the redemption of those loans.  It would, perhaps, be very difficult to justify such a departure to a farmer, say, who, no matter how widespread the electricity supply network might be would never have the opportunity of enjoying the benefits and the amenities of the electricity supply, and who, during the period of his lifetime, and during the currency of the loan, would be compelled to make provision to meet the sinking fund requirements of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor can I think that there is a duplication of provision when the board has, at the same time, to make allowances for depreciation because we are dealing there with different conditions. In the case of the provision which is made for depreciation, the board, if it wants to keep its electricity supply up-to-date, if it wants to ensure that electricity will be available to our industrialists at rates which will not be exorbitant as compared with the conditions under which an electricity supply may be available to their competitors elsewhere, will have to make the fullest possible provision to cover obsolescence. It will not suffice to say that the board's stations will be standing at the end of 25 years and that the original plant and buildings may have been maintained in good order, if that <Col N="1054" /> plant can only generate electricity a cost which is perhaps 25 to 50 per cent higher than the cost at which it could be generated by a more modern plant.</P>
    <P>This whole question of obsolescence and the provision which has to be made for it is a difficult one.  The only thing about it is that engineers' ideas are being enlarged as to the extent to which provision should be made for it, because, while the technical advances in plant in the early days of electricity supply were comparatively slow, they have taken place in the last 15 or 20 years at a very rapid rate, and plant which was up-to-date and modern seven and eight years ago is obsolete and out of date to-day, or perhaps not obsolete, but is so rapidly falling into a state of obsolescence that it would pay you, if you had made proper provision in time, to replace it by more modern plant. Accordingly, while we are making provision for the redemption of the loans on the one hand, that is to say, while we are allowing the board to fulfil its obligations to the community at large, on the one hand, in redeeming these loans, and while, on the other hand, we are enabling it to fulfil its obligations to the consumers by maintaining its plant in the most up-to-date and efficient condition possible, I do not think we are, in fact, covering the same ground.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which perhaps we might advert.  If the Minister for Finance fulfils his obligations to the public and does redeem the national loans in due course &mdash;and accordingly, as far as the taxpayer is concerned, he is imposing no burden on the taxpayer of the day &mdash;that is, at the time&mdash;when these loans have been redeemed for the purpose of meeting the sinking fund in respect of the moneys which were advanced to the Electricity Supply Board and if, at the same time, the Electricity Supply Board was continuing to pay interest upon the advances which the Exchequer had made to it, which it had not repaid, then, the loans which the Exchequer had raised having been repaid to the public, we know how such a situation could be quite easily misrepresented.  We would then have a clamour arising and statements made <Col N="1055" /> that: &ldquo;After all, the Minister for Finance has paid off his obligations to the public.  Here is this money which he advanced to the Electricity Supply Board, but in respect of which he has now no obligation to the public.  Why should the consumers of electricity continue to pay interest to the Minister for Finance when, in fact, the Minister for Finance is paying no interest on the moneys which the Electricity Supply Board has had from him and is paying nothing to the public in regard to it?&rdquo;. Of course, we know then that the demand would be to wipe out, at the expense of the community and for the benefit of a section of the community, the board's commitments to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>However, I will go as far as this with the Deputy, that, perhaps, the original basis could be relaxed with advantage now, though I do not think that we are entitled to assume that, so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, the position is even yet very secure.  The total amount which has been advanced to the board under the various Electricity Acts is something like £13,610,000, and, towards the repayment of that very large sum, all the board has been able to contribute up to the present is a sum of £57,105. It was able, in the year 1939-40, to make a first payment of £57,105 towards the repayment of the sum of £13,610,000, and, as Deputy McGilligan has suggested, existing conditions and future conditions so far as we can foresee them during the period of this war and perhaps for some time afterwards, are not going to be at all easy for the board, so that I would anticipate that even if the board and myself came to the conclusion that the restrictions imposed upon the board by the 1927 Act could be somewhat relaxed, we might find that the Minister for Finance would have a very different point of view in regard to it, and that, as we can see in the light of the figures I have quoted, he would have some justification for that attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan again reminded me of his statement that he hoped there would be a regular segregation and publication of the reports of the <Col N="1056" /> Turf Development Board, or, at least, that the costings for the Portarlington station would be published in the board's accounts in such a way as to clearly demarcate these figures from the costings for the rest of the undertaking. I have no hesitation whatever in agreeing to that.  I think that the allocation of costings to the various generating stations of the Electricity Supply Board is a very salutary and desirable practice and so far as I have the power, and I think I have the power, to ensure that these costings will be taken out in such a way as to be easily and readily ascribable to the Portarlington station, and to allow comparisons to be made between the working efficiency of that station and the other generating stations of the board, I shall ensure that it will be done.</P>
    <P>I think I also indicated to the Deputy that I would see whether we could not publish the accounts of the Turf Development Board.  These will be published in due course and as soon as we can get them in proper form for publication.</P>

      <P>I think that the Dáil and the general public are entitled to this information and I do not see that there is any advantage or benefit to anybody in withholding it.  One of the reasons why I am anxious that the accounts should be published is that it would be then quite clear to everybody&mdash;even, I think, to Deputy Dillon &mdash;that the Turf Development Board has ascribed to it a lot of things for which, in fact, it was not responsible. Deputy Dillon was very eloquent about <Col N="1057" /> the hand-won turf and the bag containers which had been procured for the transport of that turf.  I think that it is only right to say this&mdash;I say it very emphatically and I am sorry that Deputy Dillon is not here to hear me say it&mdash;that the Turf Development Board had nothing whatever to do with the inception of the bag scheme for hand-won turf.  Nor had they anything to do with the ordering of the bags so far as I know.  When the Turf Development Board was established, this scheme, which was then in operation, was handed over to it and it was asked to work it if it could be worked conveniently and economically.  Having, apparently, decided that the scheme could not be made to work, the board dropped it.</P>

      <P>May I make this point, which the Minister, who was Minister for Finance, will appreciate?  In the Estimates we very often find a note under, say, Estimate 22, stating that expenditure was also incurred under Estimate 37.  The note runs somewhat in this fashion: &ldquo;In addition to the money provided under this sub-head, expenditure has been incurred for this service under Estimate 37&rdquo;.  Can we get a note appended to the accounts of the Turf Development Board regarding expenditure of that character which, I think the Minister will agree, was substantial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to commit myself to that, because the Deputy may be under a misapprehension regarding the matter.  The Turf Development Board has been financed by grants-in-aid, and, accordingly, it has had to carry the whole burden of its organisation on its own shoulders. Out of these grants-in-aid, it has had to finance all its works except when, on occasion, it has been asked by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="1059" /> for Finance to undertake minor bog-drainage works as agent for the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give the Minister a case in point?  There was a scheme on the Bog of Allen, or one of the adjacent bogs, in which an immense system of roads was built by the board through, I think, relief grants which were declared to be ancillary to Turf-Development-Board work.  The expenditure could only be justified in anticipation of such work, as the junction is away out in the middle of the bog without any county road at all.  In cases of that character, will the Minister require a note to be appended to the accounts stating that money was spent from public funds on road-making or other preparatory work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not commit myself to that, for this reason: In regard to a lot of mineral development undertaken here from time to time&mdash; the opening up of quarries and so forth &mdash;it is not unusual, where a district as a whole will be benefited, to provide some part of the cost of the road work out of the employment schemes votes where the unemployment situation in the district justifies that course and where no more useful work is available. I should have to consider the Deputy's request.  I do not want to be, and I am sure the Deputy does not want to be, unfair to the Turf Development Board.  I want to get a clear picture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall.  In all fairness to the men tackling the job, I want to make quite clear that they are not blameworthy in regard to these bags. <Col N="1060" /> Deputy Dillon has alleged that the Turf Development Board has been responsible for an immense loss of public money up to date.  I do not think that that allegation is well founded.  Again, I feel that the Deputy is perhaps confusing the Turf Development Board with the Peat Fuel Company, which has got nothing whatever to do with the Turf Development Board.  It was operating an undertaking at Lullymore, in which considerable sums of public and private moneys were lost.  We lost large sums of money, but the original sponsors of the undertaking lost considerable sums of money also.  Our misfortune was their misfortune.  I did hear the Deputy praise the product of this company in the House, and I think he will agree with me that if we could find an economical process for producing those peat briquettes it would be well worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an attempt to do it.  It was an ill-starred attempt, an unfortunate attempt, and did not give us the results which we anticipated, but&mdash;and this is the only point I wish to emphasise, and I hope the Deputy will accept it and bear it in mind&mdash;the Turf Development Board had nothing whatever to do with that enterprise.  They have taken over the bog at Lullymore where that enterprise was operating.  They are renovating, overhauling and remodelling the plant there, and next year they may again make an effort to see whether they can produce those briquettes much more economically.  It will be, as I will tell the House to-morrow, something of an experiment, but the amount of money which is going to be involved in it will be definitely limited.</P>

The Minister is very much concerned at the moment with warning us that the Turf Development Board had nothing to do with certain failures. <Col N="1061" /> The fear I have in mind&mdash;one which is shared, I think, by Deputy Dillon&mdash;is that five years hence some Minister will be standing up there and telling us equally emphatically to remember that the Electricity Supply Board had nothing to do with Portarlington.

I said there what I have said here, that with half their complement of machines they had, even under very unfavourable conditions and starting from scratch, got half their normal output; that the balance of the machines which are required for the full development of the bog are on order; part of them are coming from America.  We hope that the full complement of machines will be on the bog next year, and, in the light of what they were able to do this year, with practically green untrained hands, I do not see any reason&mdash;subject only to circumstances remaining normal&mdash;to anticipate that they will not secure their full output next year.

      <P>No; half of their normal output, half of the output upon which they are banking&mdash;120,000 tons &mdash;and I gather that the produce which they have produced there is one for which they are finding very satisfactory sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire as to whether that 120,000 tons is based on dehydrated turf or turf as it comes from the bog?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Turf with a moisture content of 30 per cent.  The position in Clonsast this year has been somewhat unfavourable to the Turf Board on account of the very dry weather, because the moisture content of the turf as dried fell, and their output in terms of avoirdupois has been less than it might have been in an ordinary normal year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also wanted to know whether we are going to stake the whole Electricity Supply Board upon this venture; he wanted to know whether we would hypothecate the assets and securities of the Electricity Supply Board in order to salvage the Turf Development Board.  I think there is no possibility that that will be done; I do not think there is any danger of it.  I think, even if the worst came to the worst and we had to close down Portarlington station, that the £800,000 involved therein need not be written off as a total loss.  A very large part of the plant could be transferred and utilised elsewhere.  All the generators, the switch gear, and most of the auxiliary plant could be utilised. I would not commit myself to the same extent with regard to the boiler house plant, but I am sure a very large part of it could be utilised in the Pigeon House or in any other steam-driven station.  Therefore, so far as the risk of loss is concerned, it certainly is very much less than £800,000, even if the worst should befall the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But that loss would fall as a charge upon the revenues or reserves of the Electricity Supply Board if it fell to be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In present circumstances, yes, but as I indicated to Deputy McGilligan my view is that if such a position were to arise it <Col N="1064" /> would be the duty of the Government to consider the whole matter, and to the full extent to reimburse the board for any losses which may have arisen otherwise than through the neglect or mismanagement of the board in regard to the concern. The Deputy also stated that he would have preferred that this generating station had been run as an independent undertaking.  Well, all I can say in that regard is that I gave a great deal of consideration to that idea, and I came to the conclusion that, as we should probably have to borrow part of the board's engineering staff in any event, and as the board could, perhaps, operate this station more economically with its existing staff rather than having two independent staffs operating separate generating systems, and as the principle of one electricity supply authority had been established here, it was better that we should proceed, if we could, within the framework of the existing order.  The station has not been built yet; the commitments in respect of it are not very large and, as I said, it is always open for us to reconsider the other proposal and to adopt it if circumstances indicate that it is the better line to take.</P>
      <P>With regard to the publication of a full schedule of its rates of charge by the board, I have already intimated to the board that I desire that to be done and I am sure it will be done in due course, perhaps in the board's report for the coming year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell stated that he would favour a hydro scheme.  I think I may say that the Deputy would not find the board in agreement with him in that regard, that their view is, the Poulaphouca scheme having been almost completed, that for the proper development of their plans they require a steam-driven station.  I think that, whatever view they may have in relation to the station at Portarlington, they certainly would be rather strongly opposed to the development at this stage of another hyrdo electric project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The orders which this Bill seeks to confirm are seven in all.  Four of them, Orders Nos. 209 to 212, inclusive, are orders which were made arising out of the agreement which was arrived at between our cotton manufacturers here and cotton manufacturers on the other side of the water whereby the reference to the Prices Commission under the London Agreement Act, 1938, was withdrawn and an arrangement was made under which a certain portion of our market which was supplied by imported goods would be reserved for the products of the British manufacturers and whereby also, in return, the British <Col N="1066" /> cotton manufacturers would secure to our manufacturers an adequate supply of raw materials as long as these were available.  Some of the orders, notably Orders Nos. 209, 210 and 211, provide for a reduction in the duty.  The former duty in respect of these orders was at the rate of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> or 4d. per square yard on articles covered by the order.  In the case of Order No. 209, the duty there fell upon bed ticken and bed mattress cloths, bed sheeting of a width not less than 45 inches, shirtings and pyjama material which are not less than 4 ounces in weight per square yard and which are without pattern and colour; and cloth for the manufacture of dungarees or similar protective garments which is not less than 4 ounces in weight per square yard, all of these being woven piece goods not containing more than 60 per cent. of cotton and not exceeding 10 ounces in weight per square yard.  As I have said, in the case of these materials the duty formerly was 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> or 4d. per square yard, whichever was the greater.  In the case of bed ticken, mattresses and bed sheeting, and cloth for the manufacture of dungarees and similar protective garments, the duty was 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  The new duty is at the rate of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> preference in the case of products of the United Kingdom and Canada.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The same applies to the cloths which are covered by Order No. 210, which refers to woven piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. of cotton and not exceeding 10 ounces in weight per square yard.  The former duty was 40 per cent., or 4d. per square yard, whichever happened to be the greater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the preferential rate has.  In the case of Order No. 211 there has been a modification in the duty, but in the case of certain materials covered by this order there was formerly no specific duty. There was a duty of 40 per cent. <i>ad <Col N="1067" /> valorem</i> on woven piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. of cotton and of a weight not less than four and not more than 10 ounces per square yard, or which had a pattern woven in colour and were used in the manufacture of shirts and pyjamas.  The new duty will be 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> with a preferential duty of 20 per cent. in the case of United Kingdom and Canadian products.  Order No. 212 imposes a duty of 45 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> with 30 per cent. of a preferential rate in the case of United Kingdom and Canadian products on woven piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. of cotton and not exceeding 10 ounces in weight per square yard and not chargeable with the duty imposed by Orders Nos. 209, 210 or 211.  Formerly the materials which come under the duty imposed by Emergency Order No. 210 were liable to a rate of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i></P>
      <P>Order No. 213 imposes a duty of 60 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential rate of 40 per cent. in the case of the United Kingdom and Canada, on piece goods not chargeable with the duty imposed by any of the emergency orders I have cited&mdash;Orders Nos. 209, 210, 211 and 212&mdash;and which are woven piece goods, cotton or union piece goods consisting of a combination of two or more fibres such as cotton, flax, jute and artificial silk.  The materials covered by the order were formerly liable to a duty of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the licence is given in respect of goods originating elsewhere than in the United Kingdom or Canada, there is a 10 per cent. duty added.  Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 214) Order, 1940, imposes a duty on linen piece goods as follows:&mdash;Linen piece goods which are terry or are the type used in the manufacture of dungarees or similar protective <Col N="1068" /> garments for wear by men, bed sheets, ticken or mattresses, 40 per cent. or 4d. per square yard; all other linen piece goods, 40 per cent.  There is a preferential rate of 20 per cent. for goods produced in the United Kingdom or Canada.  Originally, the linen piece goods were liable to duty under Order No. 131 of 1937, which applied also to cotton and union piece goods. The Revenue Commissioners have suggested that as we are amending the duties we should make a separate order in respect of linen piece goods.  That has been done with the retention of the original duty and the granting of a preferential rate in respect of the United Kingdom and Canada.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the old preferential rate.  Order No. 215 imposes a duty at the rate of 37½ per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential rate of 25 per cent. on candles, tapers and night-lights.  These were formerly liable to a duty of 30 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential rate of 10 per cent. in the case of the United Kingdom and Canada and 20 per cent. in other Commonwealth countries.  In addition to the duty there was also a quantitative restriction, but that quantitative has been removed.  The new duties have been imposed as a result of a finding of the Tariff Commission following a request for a review of the duty, in accordance with Article 8 of the London Agreement.  The Commission has recommended that the quota should be removed and the duty imposed at the new rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said my say on the woven tissues and the other materials.  I am principally concerned now with the candle business because it reveals a most interesting development. If you watch the operations of the quota racketeer closely, you occasionally catch sight of him shooting through the grass.  &ldquo;Racketeer&rdquo; is the word, Sir. Candles, as everybody in this House knows, are used by the occupants of small poor houses and, virtually, by nobody else in this country.  I am now talking of paraffin wax candles, not of altar candles or candles of a special category.  Candles started to go up in price some months ago.  It is hard to carry the figures in one's memory but candles very nearly doubled in price in the last 15 months. If you did not like to pay the price asked for the candles you could go and lump it, because there was nobody else from whom you could get them.  There was a quota on candles and you could take the candles offered to you or go without them.  I was astonished a few days ago to hear that the price of candles had gone down by 6/- per case. Then I discovered that the candle business had been before the Tariff Commission and that, as a result of the findings of the commission, the quota was going to be taken off and a tariff of 30 per cent. put upon candles. Now, of course, it will be said that this was in the normal course of events. Candles came down by 6/-, but they came down only the minute the quota came off.  Observe that they came down 6/- to compete with candles which would have to carry a tariff of 30 per cent.  That is the way to get the hang of it.  When they had a quota, the candle manufacturers were able to get for candles, from the poor of this country, not only 30 per cent. over the world price, but 6/- a case on top of that and they got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a lot of innocent people here will say: &ldquo;I did not see any change in the price of candles.  A penny candle was still a penny candle.&rdquo;  There was no change in the price of single candles; a penny candle was still a penny candle, but where I used to sell the people a size eight candle 12 months ago, I was giving them a size ten <Col N="1070" /> candle up to a fortnight ago.  A size eight candle is a good stout candle, and a size ten candle is about as thick as my pen.  The average person would not recognise the difference if he did not see a size ten and a size eight candle together, and nobody but a chandler would distinguish between a size eight and a size nine unless he had the two in front of him.  The average countrywoman buys, on the market day or on a Friday, two candles that will keep her going until the following market day.  She does not ask for a size eight or a size ten; she asks for a penny candle and that is what she gets.  If she were in the habit of getting size seven, she was constrained for the past year to accept size ten, with the result that she found that where two candles kept her going before, under the new dispensation it would take three.  That meant that on every house in Ireland in which candles were used there was levied an annual tax of about 3/-.</P>
    <P>When the quota operated in this country, it authorised the oil company and the candle merchants of this country to levy a weekly toll on every small house in the country, and did they forbear to take it?  Not on your life!  Up to the very hour when the quota went off, they got the last drop of blood they could squeeze out of these miserable candles.  I am told by some of the poor simpletons who speak in this House that that kind of thing could not happen, that the Prices Commission watch them.  The Prices Commission !  Did anybody read the report of L. J. Jordan and Company, published a few days ago?  Profits £4,000 last year, which they regarded as normal; profits £24,000 on the same business this year, as disclosed by the accounts published the day before yesterday.  And I am told that the Prices Commission are watching these things!  The firm which could make a fair profit of £4,000 in 1938-39, watched from day to day by the Prices Commission, kept under constant review, could make a profit of £24,000 in 1939-40.</P>

      <P>I am then told that I am wasting public time in talking about excessive charges and the exploitation of the consumer in this country, because, as the Minister for Supplies is watching this problem from hour to hour and day to day, there is no group in the country which can extract a penny surplus profit from consumers here, because he is on their track all the time.  Yet, here we have an instance in which £24,000 was raked off in one year's trading by a company which has a complete monopoly, directly protected by a quota, whereas £4,000 was considered a reasonable profit the year before.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter in this House because whenever a quota is mentioned here, I am going to read the history in this House of those who seek it.  I am going to read the history of the profits they make out of it, and I am going to relate the wealth they accumulate out of it to the poverty of those they rob by virtue of it.  Let those who come seeking quotas in future know that so long as I am here, even if I am the only person to do it, I shall seek out their history, I shall name them and expose their bank balances and profits, and relate them to the poverty of the poor people they rob.  Some day the people of this country will revolt against that vile exploitation of a defenceless people.  Some day those who are supposed to represent simple people living down the country, who do not understand the machinations of the tariff racketeer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It means something worse.  I sympathise with the difficulty of a Deputy who is trying to understand this business and who is not in the trade himself.  He has his suspicions, but the statement is made: &ldquo;Here is a quota, but there is a licence attached to it.&rdquo;  That is quite true.  In theory, anyone can get a licence, but in practice, once you establish a quota, the average merchant who is driven into the markets of the world, by the attempt of the domestic manufacturer to exploit him, finds that the elaborate <Col N="1072" /> forms he has to fill, and the elaborate operations through which he has to go in order to get that licence, and subsequently to use that licence in getting his stuff in, make it impracticable for him to get a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in theory.  Most of these licensing provisions provide that, if you were in the habit of importing this commodity in the past, you are entitled to get a proportion of your previous imports now.  In practice, all the small fellows drop out of the business of importing, and the business falls then into the hands of five or six big importers.</P>

      <P>What happens is this. There is complete silence for about 12 months until everybody has forgotten that these goods are subject to a quota.  Then you have established here the racketeers who got the quota put on in order to protect the industry in which they are interested.  They go to the four or five fellows who have applied for the quotas and who are now recognised importers.  They say: &ldquo;Look here, boys, you are in on the ground floor.  Why bother competing with us any longer?  Let us make a deal.  You have all got your import quotas; O.K., bring that stuff in and sell it and we will give you agencies for our goods as well.  You are not allowed to import as much of this commodity as you used to import, and we will make up the difference in the quantity of material on one condition, that you will not cut prices against us and we will undertake not to cut prices against you.  We have to give you a share of the spoils.  We are generous and openhanded fellows; we are plucking the bird, and we will pass over to you three out of the seven feathers which we pull out of its tail.&rdquo;  The five or six fellows with the quota say: &ldquo;Three feathers are better than none.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have no doubt it would not.  My point is that I can relate all this to each quota order that is brought forward, except that I am dealing with a different group of people. The line of conduct is common to them all.  It always happens.  Take the candle fellows.  There was a group of candle manufacturers and they were the big oil companies.  The boys all got together and up went the price of candles.  The big oil companies could submerge the small domestic candle manufacturers if they wanted.  What happened was that the big fellows said: &ldquo;We are going to take nine feathers out of the hen's tail and we will give you two if you play ball.&rdquo;  The little fellows said: &ldquo;If we do not play ball, the big fellows will wipe us out. We are to have two feathers and that is better than nothing at all.&rdquo;  They took what they got.  What enabled them to do that was that they were within the steel fence of a quota. Suppose they had a tariff of 60 per cent., there would come a point, if they raised the price of candles sufficiently high, when, if they came to sell candles to me, I would say to them: &ldquo;No, I will import candles from Great Britain and pay the 60 per cent. and still I will have them cheaper than you give them to me.&rdquo;  I had no form to fill, no licence to seek, no elaborate investigations to make, and I would have got my candles in, where upon the boys would have to come down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, there is this consideration: that if I come in here <Col N="1074" /> and say, &ldquo;Here are men who are asking for a tariff of 75 per cent.,&rdquo; that sounds bad; people will begin to prick up their ears.  One warrior came and asked for a tariff of 100 per cent. and got it.  That created such a stink in the country that they dropped it.  If those racketeers ask for a tariff of 75 per cent., it looks bad; it stinks at once.  But, stick in a quota and no one knows anything about it.  The candle fellows have got the biggest tariff they could squeeze out of the Tariff Commission and candles have come down by 6/- a case.  Do not have any doubt that they fought to the last inch to get the highest point tariff they could out of the Minister.  Remember, he is a tariff Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government is a tariff Government. But, with the highest tariff they could squeeze out of a reactionary tariff Government, candles came down 6/- a case.</P>
    <P>There could not be too much time spent in this House on each one of these transactions.  The more public attention is concentrated on the activities of these gentlemen, the more it is brought home to them that, every time they come in with exploitation proposals of this kind, they will be exposed, the less scandalous proposals will be brought before this House, and the stronger the Minister's hands will be in resisting, as I believe he is now concerned to resist, the quota racket in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Army Pensions Bill, 1940, has been introduced mainly for the purpose of dealing with late applications under Part II of the Army Pensions Act, 1932, and Parts V, VI, and VII of the Army Pensions Act, 1937.  There are about 515 persons affected in that, for one reason or another, they did not apply within the statutory periods prescribed by the Acts, and as a number of cases appeared to constitute a real hardship, it was decided to introduce the present Bill in order to allow the Department to deal with all such applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the present Bill extends <Col N="1078" /> the date of application for: (1) Disability pensions, widows' and children's allowances, and gratuities in repect of disablement under Part II of the 1932 Act; (2) disability pensions under Part V of the 1937 Act; (3) aggravatory pensions under Part VI of the 1937 Act; (4) dependent's allowances under Part VII of the 1937 Act; (5) special gratuities under Part VII of the 1937 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that where any award is made under the date as extended, the pension or allowance shall commence from a date not prior to the passing of the present Bill.  While extending the date of application, the Bill amends the previous Acts in certain particulars.  Thus, Section amends Section 19 (3) of the Act of 1937 by making clear the original intention of that section that a widow shall not be entitled to a gratuity under Part II of the 1932 Act unless her husband was at the date of his death actually in receipt of a disability pension under the Act of 1932.</P>
    <P>Again, Section 11 deals with a problem which has arisen in administering the Acts.  A number of persons have been called for examination by the Army Pensions Board and have failed to attend even when dates were arranged to suit their convenience.  As the Acts stand at present, there is no power to compel attendance, or, failing attendance, to determine the claim. Such power is now being taken in Section 11 of the Bill, which provides in effect that if the applicant fails to attend after a second notice given after an interval of three months, his claim shall automatically fall for refusal.</P>
    <P>Finally, under Section 12, the allowance granted to a widow or child under the Pensions Acts may be reduced by an amount not exceeding the amount, if any, granted to such widow or child under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to go away, Sir, to a public appointment, and, therefore, I have asked Deputy O'Higgins to allow me to say a short word before he proceeds to deal with this Bill on behalf of our Party.  The short word I want to say is that the parties with <Col N="1079" /> which these Military Pensions Bills are concerned would have been deemed to be soldiers in the service of this State who, in fact, served Ireland before the international recognition of our independence, and that is very proper. There are, however, a few old soldiers of the fight for independence who, in their own way, were just as much soldiers as the men of 1916 or the men who took part in the subsequent struggles which led up to the evacuation of this country by the British Government.  I am proud, Sir, to claim that I was brought up in and belonged to that constitutional movement in which they served, and I know the sacrifices those men made and the hardships they endured during their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be known to many Deputies of this House that one, who is now gone and who was recognised throughout the English-speaking world as the silver-tongued orator, Thomas Sexton, served in the British House of Commons and lived in a tenement room on the Vauxhall Bridge Road because he had not the wherewithal for a better lodging, and although he was the equal of any when he championed the cause of Ireland in the presence of the mighty, when he went home at night he went home to poverty and sometimes even to hunger because he had no money to purchase the luxuries which fortified his rivals in that struggle.  He is gone, as most of them are gone, but there still survive a few.  One I am thinking of at this moment, who is well on in his 'eighties and who was a Fenian, and, at a meeting in Tipperary, he saw Michael Davitt come to ask the help of the Fenians in the New Departure in order that the tenant farmers of this country might be delivered from slavery.  He saw an irresponsible throw a missile at Michael Davitt, and although this man was standing afar off, because he was a Fenian and did not subscribe to the constitutional method of advance, he felt that it was more than any Irishman could bear to see Michael Davitt insulted and assaulted in Tipperary, and he sallied into the fray and rebuked the person who had assaulted Davitt and asserted Davitt's right to <Col N="1080" /> speak wherever he chose to open his mouth in Ireland.  That began an association which brought to Davitt's ranks the Fenians of Tipperary, and it opened a long life of hard struggle for these men in the cause of Ireland, punctuated by such incidents as taking the chair at the Mitchelstown meeting, and time and time again reflecting glory on this country when he represented it in the British House of Commons, and at other places where he was called on to speak in its name.  I remember another man of whom I am thinking now, who defended Ireland and suffered bitterly in her cause.  I can think of another man, who is present in my mind at the moment, who saw his colleagues in his profession secure preferment, but who deliberately of his own election, to my own personal knowledge, because it was to my father he made the choice, chose poverty to the profits of his profession, because he said if he were to succeed in it, he must neglect the duties he had undertaken to do in advancing the cause of Ireland when that cause stood badly in need of men to defend it.</P>
    <P>These men have grown old.  Many of them are dead.  All their leaders are gone.  They have never made it a practice to ask for anything from anyone. They never got anything from Ireland and never expected anything. They were brought up to believe that it was a privilege to serve Ireland, and that to secure that privilege was sufficient reward for any sacrifice that the service demanded.  We have managed to carry on, and to look after those who have fallen by the wayside up to now, and it has been a privilege and a pride to help in doing that.  But there comes a time when the limited resources of individuals cannot meet the deficiency and with increasing years, and the financial stringency of which we are all cognisant, I know that one of these men, if I cannot get something for him, has got to go to the workhouse.  I would not ask for this if I could get it in any other way.  I do not want to suggest that these men have been treated with callous indifference by members of the present Government.  They have not.  I have no hesitation in saying that I have had help, both on this side and on the other <Col N="1081" /> side of the House, to meet the obligations that have arisen in connection with the difficulties to which I have referred. I want that to be clearly understood. It is only fair that it should be.</P>
    <P>I make no disguise of the fact that I would prefer not to have been contrained to ask for any financial recognition by the State of these men's services, and but for the stringency that has now come upon us all I should never have had to do this.  Nevertheless, I should not let my personal pride stand between these men and the public expression of their rights to the modicum of comfort which they are entitled to expect from a nation they served so faithfully, for the few remaining years they have to live amongst us.  One of them, and one of the bravest of them all, died two or three days ago in Limerick. There are very few left, and there are few women who will be widows when they go.  I am asking Oireachtas Eireann now to secure these men against destitution.  That is all I ask.</P>
    <P>I want no gratuities.  I want no reward for them.  They would not want it.  All I am asking is that you will not allow them to go hungry.  I do not care how you do that.  They are entitled to it.  They have not charged me to make this request.  There is not one of them who would ask me to do it.  I do not disguise that it is not a request that I take any pleasure in making; but, as the son of one who was privileged to lead them at one time, I think it is my duty to do it.  I claim it as a right.  I ask for no favour.  I am not asking for mercy for them from strangers.  I am asking for justice from their own.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for every generation of men who served this country since.  Do not let it be said that those who are really the veterans because they could not combine in claiming favours are denied justice by those who enjoy the liberty which is the fruit of their labour.</P>

      <P>I should like if the Minister could give a little more information regarding Section 5 of the Bill.  Are you now reducing the disability standard from 80 to 50?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the position is that where the degree of disability is reducing from that which obtained when <Col N="1082" /> the pension was awarded if it reduces beyond a certain figure the men can go on the flat rate scheme.  They could do that before.  The disability from which they were suffering might possibly disappear altogether.  They can opt to go on the flat rate scheme, that is a pension which would be equivalent to 20/- a week for disability between 50 per cent. and 80 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is possible when a man was originally examined the degree of disability would be 80 per cent. or over, but through treatment the degree of disability begins to decrease.  If it decreased below 50 per cent. and disappears, the man's pension disappears with it.  This is providing for a flat rate system of 15/- or 20/- which he can opt to take before he reaches that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say straight away that I have no objection to the Bill, and I am not offering any opposition, but I put it to the Minister that he is really trying to carry out an impossibility through the medium of an administrative machine and a multiplicity of medical boards.  He is endeavouring to deal in terms of percentages, to assess the degree of disability from which a person is suffering whose disease originated 18 to 25 years ago. With all due respect to the Minister, and also to the members of my own profession, there is not a doctor living, or a board of doctors, which could examine a man to-day who is suffering from a disability acquired on service 18 or 20 years ago and, in the first place, say dogmatically, that that disability was or was not attributable to the service of twenty years ago, and further say dogmatically, that that disability is between 50 per cent. and 80 per cent. and not over 80 per cent. nor under 50 per cent.  To a great extent, this Pensions Bill and the Disability Pensions Act of 1927 hark back to the Wound Pensions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Wound Pensions Act applicants were pensioned according to the degree of disability resulting from wounds.  Neither a medical board nor <Col N="1083" /> a lay board would have any great difficulty in putting into figures the disability a man suffers as a result of a wound.  There is a simple table of disabilities and even those not mentioned in the table could easily be assessed by reference to it.  The loss of an upper limb, a lower limb, of two upper or two lower limbs, the loss of one eye or of both eyes&mdash;each carried a certain percentage of disability, and other wounds and other disabilities as a result of wounds could be, in a rough and ready way, brought on the level of one of those scales.</P>
    <P>We then moved on from wounds to disease and we attempted to pension people for disabilities as a result of disease attributable to service, on the percentage scale.  At the time that Act was passed, if it was not an impossible proposition for a medical board, it was about as difficult a proposition as could be set.  However, there is this to be said: at the time that Act of 1927 was passed, they were dealing with disabilities attributable to disease which had been acquired within eight or nine years previous.  This is an amending Act, or an extending of that Act of 1927.  Roughly, 515 cases did not apply within the time limit of the 1927 Act, or the extending Act of 1932, and we are now giving a further 12 months for these 515 cases to apply.  They will apply.  They are suffering, presumably, from some disability attributable to disease which originated on service possibly 18 years ago, possibly 25 years ago.  They are going to be medically examined by a board, and the first question that will be put to that board is this: that man is suffering from a certain disease; is that disease directly attributable to service, 15, 17 or 25 years ago?  There will be an answer&mdash;either yes or no.  It is a matter of luck more than anything else: it is a matter of mood&mdash;the mood of the board on that particular morning&mdash;as to what the answer will be.  But no definite answer, either yes or no, can be given with any real knowledge or foundation in fact behind it.</P>
    <P>Most of these difficulties arise through administrative delays in dealing with these cases at a time when <Col N="1084" /> the origin of the disease was comparatively recent.  I urged time and again that, if one board could not get through the work more expeditiously than it has been done, there should be a multiplicity of boards.  My attention has been called to a considerable number of cases of people either dissatisfied with the verdict given or who have got no decisive answer to their claims, and I have put the case to them that I am putting here.  You can bring up a case to-morrow of one who suffered from a lot of hardship on the hills, or in imprisonment or internment, in 1918, 1919 or 1922.  That man has a bad chest now, or bad state of nerves.  Where is the member of my profession who is going to claim that he is in a position to assess definitely whether that man's bad chest or nerves are attributable to conditions 18 years ago?  Yet, people are either getting pensions or being refused pensions on the certificate of specially selected and experienced men&mdash;honest, reliable and trustworthy men who, if their backs were to the wall, would say that too many years have passed and that too much water has flowed under the bridge, for them to be definite.</P>
    <P>I handled the documents of a case within the last 48 hours which was examined some four years ago.  This man got his certificate to the effect that he had no disability attributable to service, and the service he was hanging his alleged disability on was 18 years ago.  That man was able to mobilise immense influence in his case, such that only one in 5,000 applicants could mobilise.  He was re-examined&mdash;&ldquo;reboarded&rdquo;&mdash;some three years ago and the result of that &ldquo;re-board&rdquo; was that he had a disability attributable to service, but that it was not 80 per cent. Whatever disability he had three years ago he had before that.  He had the same medical document saying that he was continuously from 1922 to 1927 in medical hands.  One board finds no disability attributable to service and the other finds a disability attributable to service 18 years ago, but not 80 per cent.  They were both reliable, trustworthy and honourable boards, but is it right to be administering or refusing public funds with that margin of error?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Is there an engineer who would look at a building in 1940 and assess its condition in 1916?  That is the kind of question that is being put to medical boards.  There may be an answer given to satisfy the official mind, but there could not be an answer given that would satisfy the knowledgeable mind. The point I wish to make is that, if cases have been left unattended, unexamined, &ldquo;unboarded&rdquo;, we are trying to achieve the impossible now and trying to get a board to assess whether the disability a man has to-day was or was not attributable to some experience, some hardship of his, 20 years ago.  I think it would be better to link up the whole thing with service and, if the service board has already found, as a result of investigation and evidence, that a man did give service of a lengthy and reliable kind, to increase his service pension by a reasonable percentage and accept his &ldquo;crockiness&rdquo; as having been at least associated with service.</P>
    <P>I remember that the wording of the original measure was about as rigid a wording as was ever put into an Act, namely, that the disability must have been acquired on service and be directly attributable to service.  Now, these words were stolen from the Wound Pensions Act.  It is easy enough to say whether a wound was acquired on service and was directly attributable to service, but, even dealing with cases of three months ago, it is impossible to say, with equal definiteness, that pneumonia was acquired on service and was directly attributable to service.  You have no witness who can come forward and say: &ldquo;I saw the bug of pneumonia enter his chest and he was on service at the time,&rdquo; but you can bring witnesses forward to say: &ldquo;I saw him hit with a bullet.&rdquo;  You cannot bring witnesses forward to say: &ldquo;I saw him hit with the bacilli of tuberculosis or the germ of pneumonia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In its very origins, a major blunder was made when you tried to work the phraseology of a Wound Pensions Act into a diseases Act.  It was a mistake at the time when you were dealing with a matter that only went back five or seven years.  It was a blunder then, but it is a blunder on the double and <Col N="1086" /> on the treble now when you are presuming to deal, in an official way, with cases that may be 25 years' old.  It cannot be done.  If there are hard cases to be met, and if public money has got to be spent, do not give it the appearance of being spent in a rigid watertight way, in conformity with the most rigid phraseology that could be invented by the most vigilant Department of Finance because there is no one, from the Minister down to the actual board, and from that down to the applicant himself, who can say with any definiteness that any disease disability from which any man suffers to-day was attributable to any particular phase of activity 18 or 20 years' ago.</P>
    <P>I would rather see the Minister put his mind down to the justice of what I am saying.  I guarantee that if the Minister calls his medical advisers before him he will find there is not one of them but will agree absolutely with every word I am saying: that it is correct to say they are being set an impossible question to answer reliably. They are giving the best answer they can.  It may be a good answer from the applicant's point of view, or it may be a bad answer.  The answer depends as much on the mood of the examiner as it does on any evidence he can have before him to-day.</P>
    <P>Now that is not fair, either to the State or to the applicants.  It would be better to take these arrears of cases&mdash; take the cases that have not yet been dealt with, take the cases that have a disability swinging between one percentage and another, take the association between that disability without any of us attempting to say whether it is a 40 per cent., a 45 per cent. or a 51 per cent. disability&mdash;and say that there is reasonable evidence, that there is a reasonable amount of medical certification to demonstrate that a man's disability could have been attributable to such a period of service and because of that &ldquo;increase his service pension&rdquo;. If I were in the Minister's position, if I were giving disability pensions now under this Bill or under the Acts of 1932 or 1927, and found that those disease disabilities were hanging around and harped back to service and hardships <Col N="1087" /> undergone in 1916 or in 1917, I could not look into a mirror, address myself and say: &ldquo;Conscientiously I am entitled to give that, or conscientiously I am entitled to refuse that.&rdquo;  One might as well take a coin in his office when each claim came in, toss it, and say: &ldquo;Heads I will get a pension and harp I will not.&rdquo;  Now, that is not a proper system for dealing with cases of disability and cases of genuine hardship. It would be better to mobilise all your applicants, get them together, and decide to do the best you could for them out of some lump sum; but do not perpetuate the mistake of pretending that there is any board that could be created that is capable of assessing, in percentage degrees, the disability that any man is suffering from to-day, and say, further, that that disability is directly due to disease which was acquired 22, 24 or 26 years ago.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to support a hurried passage of this Bill through the House, by my vote if necessary, if we can get an assurance from the Minister for Defence that it will be the means of speeding up the administration of the many disability and service Acts passed by the two Governments we have had in this State during the last 17 years.  The Minister indicated that this Bill was being introduced for the purpose of meeting 515 claims.  Are we to take it that all these claims have been closely examined departmentally, and that the Minister is prepared, when this Bill becomes law, to sanction the payment of pensions in these 515 cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or any additional number there may be as a result of amendments made to the Bill, or of representations to the Minister arising out of its <Col N="1088" /> passage.  I should like to hear from the Minister the reason why payment in the 515 cases referred to will only operate from the date of the passage of this Bill.  If they are genuine cases, arising out of past service, I think they should receive the same treatment as the other thousands of persons who already benefit by the many Acts passed during the last 17 years.  I understand&mdash;I am speaking from memory and not from accurate figures given to me recently&mdash;that about 12,000 persons are benefiting by the service and disability pensions Acts passed during the last 17 years.  I remember sitting here a number of years ago, and hearing a Minister for Defence in the previous Government, who is now a member of the other House, saying that, in his opinion, not more than 3,000 persons could be given credit for having taken an active part in the pre-Truce activities, whereas we have four times the number now in receipt of service and disability pensions.</P>
      <P>I mention these figures because I agree with the moving appeal made by Deputy Dillon, which, if accepted by the Minister and his colleagues, would add only six or eight persons to those who should be given credit by way of pension or gratuity for service rendered to the country.  I support the appeal made by Deputy Dillon, and I recognise that he speaks with considerably more authority and knowledge on this matter than I could, but I have personal knowledge of three cases of members of the old Irish Parliamentary Party who are at present in a destitute or semi-destitute condition.  I know that representations, and detailed statements in support of representations, have been submitted to some of the Minister's colleagues, and I should like to hear what action he proposes to take to meet the very reasonable and moving appeal made by Deputy Dillon on behalf of these six or eight persons. I understand that nearly all, if not all, of them are over 70 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody, in my opinion, can speak with greater knowledge or authority based on experience than Deputy O'Higgins can in the case of persons claiming disability pensions, and nobody will disagree with the case he <Col N="1089" /> has made here.  As a Deputy with a very limited knowledge of the administration of the existing Pension Acts, I should like to see inserted in the Bill a more understandable definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  The administration of the 1934 Service Pensions Act is a disgrace to the present Administration. I have come across cases of individuals who were in the same engagement who have been treated differently in regard to claims for service pensions.  I know of cases of persons who made claims under the 1934 Act and who were before the Service Pensions Board in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, and who are still waiting and hoping for some decision on their claims in the near future.  If the passage of this Bill will help to make up the mind of the Minister and those who advise him in respect of the hundreds of cases of claims which are deferred, everybody in the House who has any experience of dealing with communications from these persons will be glad to support the hurried passage of the measure.</P>
    <P>There is no justification whatever for a position in which individuals who appeared before the Pensions Board in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938 should be still waiting for decisions on their claims. Some of the cases I have come across are cases of men who were in the same engagement as men who have been receiving pensions for two, three and four years.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some assurance in regard to these cases which are still awaiting decision and that, before the end of 1941, that is, 18 years after the first Pensions Act was passed, we shall have heard the last of the claims of those who are entitled to look for either disability or service pensions, arising out of their service to this country in pre-Truce days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister must realise that the administration of an Army Pensions Bill providing for the payment of pensions on an assessment of wound or disease disabilities is very difficult, particularly as the board is set the task of ascertaining, under the rigid phraseology of the earlier Acts, whether the disability from which an applicant suffers is <Col N="1090" /> attributable to or arose directly out of his active service over 20 years ago. Deputy O'Higgins, with his wealth of medical knowledge and extensive military experience of a kind that brought him into close contact with cases of this type, has made a very convincing case for an amendment of the Act, or, at all events, for an alteration of the method of administering it; but although he has made a very convincing case on medical grounds, it really does not require medical knowledge to realise that it is almost impossible, in 1940, for any board of doctors to ascertain, with any degree of reliability, whether a disability from which a man suffers to-day was attributable to and arose directly out of his active service 20 years ago.  As Deputy O'Higgins rightly pointed out, the decision which the board will give on a question of that kind is just a matter of chance, and no matter how zealous doctors may be and no matter how they may desire to be microscopically fair, it is almost impossible, in the circumstances obtaining and having regard to the passage of time, for them to pronounce authoritatively on an issue of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the fact that such an impossible task is set the board of doctors has been responsible for the abnormal delay which has taken place in deciding claims for disability pensions. One case which came to my notice some considerable time ago, and on which I have had a considerable amount of correspondence with the Department, relates to the claim of a man who contends that, arising out of his treatment while under arrest by Black and Tans in 1921, he now suffers, and has since that time suffered, from a chest disability and a neurasthenic condition.  That man has made claim after claim for a disability pension to the medical board.  He has produced what at first sight looks to be convincing evidence from local doctors who knew that he underwent this ill-treatment, who knew him before he was arrested, who knew him after he was arrested and who know the change brought about by his imprisonment and ill-treatment by Black and Tans; but notwithstanding the evidence of these local doctors who were in a position to say that they attended him after the <Col N="1091" /> event, that man for years and years has been seeking a decision on his claim for a pension, and it is not possible for him to get it.  The reason, of course, is that the doctors to-day are not in a position to certify with any certitude that the man now suffers this disability arising out of the treatment he then underwent.</P>
    <P>With Deputy O'Higgins, I think that you have now got so far away from the period of active service, a minimum of 17 years, that you must realise that it is extremely difficult for a medical board to be able to certify with any definiteness that a disease was attributable to active service and arises directly out of such service.  I think that, in dealing with disability pensions, the Minister might amend the Act either here or in the Seanad in such a way as to give the board a fairly wide discretion to do as Deputy O'Higgins suggested&mdash;to ascertain, in the first place, whether there was definite active service; if there is fairly convincing evidence that, as a result of that active service, the man's physical condition has been impaired, the board should have some discretion to award a basic pension in respect of service and a supplementary pension in respect of disability.  I hope the Minister realises the difficulty in the way of the applicant for a disability pension.</P>
    <P>Everybody wants to be fair to those who have suffered disability due to active service and we must realise the enormous difficulties caused by the fact that we are endeavouring to assess disability almost a quarter of a century after it has occurred.  I am afraid we have set the board an impossible task. With Deputy O'Higgins, I appeal to the Minister to review the administration of the Act and give the board pretty wide discretion in assessing disability due to disease.  It is easy enough to assess disability due to wounds and it is easy enough to ascertain if the wound was inflicted during active service but, as pointed out by Deputy O'Higgins, it is quite impossible to say now, with any degree of accuracy, whether the disability from which the man is suffering and in respect of which he claims a pension <Col N="1092" /> arose directly out of his active service over 20 years ago.  I think that the Minister himself ought to be glad to see the end of those claims, but I think we are laying out a great deal of trouble for ourselves and not reflecting any great credit on our legislative or administrative measures if we set a board the task of ascertaining whether a disability now being endured by a man was contracted while on active service over 20 years ago.  I hope the Minister will be able to say that he realises these difficulties and that, whether by amendment of this Bill or administrative Act, the board will be given wider discretion in assessing disease-disability in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in respect of the speech made by Deputy Dillon, with which I have much sympathy, is that I shall bring it to the attention of the head of the Government and see if it is possible to do anything on the lines suggested by the Deputy.  I should like to remind the House that this is merely a Bill extending the period during which persons can claim disability pensions.  I should also like to point out that every case under the 1932 Act has been dealt with.  The 1932 cases have been wiped out completely and the only cases left over are those which come under the 1937 Act.  I am informed that they will be dealt with not later than the middle of March, so that the work of this board has been expeditious, considering the vast amount of information it was necessary to secure from applicants from time to time.  I do not contest for a moment the technical or professional statements made by Deputy O'Higgins.  They may be perfectly correct, but I am certain that the case he made was made when the Bill was originally introduced and, again, when the amending Bill was introduced in 1937.  I am sure that the case was then examined and considered from every possible point of view.  The medical men who are examining these cases do not attempt to find out the degree of disability at the period when the wound was received.  They could not do that.</P>

I find that they are always inclined to err in favour of the applicant, and to give him the benefit of any doubt that arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that the board leans in favour of the applicant, if it leans in favour of any party.  The applicant, in making his case, is encouraged to bring forward evidence dealing with the period when the disease originated or the wound was received.  For instance, certificates have been accepted from medical men giving it as their opinion that the disease, at the time when it was contracted, was the result of active service.  Wherever that type of evidence was brought before them, the board accepted it after discussion with the medical men concerned, if available, and if not available, after other inquiries.  Large numbers of applicants have brought forward voluminous evidence of that kind from different medical men, and, so far as I know, that type of individual has nearly always had his case successfully dealt with.  The 1937 Bill was, as Deputies are aware, brought in to help applicants still further.  Where a man had a disease which was not attributable to military service, but which was aggravated by military service, that was taken into consideration also, and he got a pension, an aggravatory service pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is quite possible that there might be certain diseases which would not be aggravated by service.  I am not saying whether they could or could not, but if there was any disease which was aggravated by service it was taken into consideration. Needless to remark, I have as much sympathy as any other Deputy in the House with the cases of those applicants.  As a Deputy, I took a great interest in trying to press forward several of those claims made by old I.R.A. men.  I had one experience myself where the board convinced me that, although the disease did appear to arise out of service&mdash;I was trying to prove that I knew this man to have been a very healthy and strong type of man&mdash;the disease of which this man died was hereditary, and that if there never had been any trouble in this country he would have died almost precisely at the time he did die.  I was not in a position to dispute such a statement with the medical officers, and I do not know if Deputy Dr. O'Higgins could have disputed it either.  The fact remains that I was more or less convinced that here was a case where, although there was a certain amount of convincing evidence that the disease could have arisen out of service, it was proved to me anyhow to be a type of disease which would have arisen in any case, and would eventually have brought about this man's death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the flat rate question I should have mentioned that that has been operating for years, and that this was merely extending the time.  As I mentioned in the beginning, there are practically no unboarded cases.  There are just a few which came under the 1937 Act, but the 1932 applications have been completely cleared off.  Those people who are coming in now, the 515 people whom I mentioned, are people who did not apply within the statutory period.  Deputy Davin urged that those people should be entitled to receive pensions, as the other people did, from the beginning.  I would contest that, because those people <Col N="1095" /> either did not consider themselves as having a disability, or for some other reason decided to ignore this particular statute and did not make any attempt to apply.  They have changed their minds now, and are coming in and making applications. We feel that in justice to them their cases should be examined, and, arising out of the large number, we are asking the House to agree to an extension for 12 months for this particular type of individual.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister mind if I put a question before he concludes? There is a point on which I want information.  Under this Act, pensions are given to people who are disabled as a result of disease.  Take the case of a person boarded, where the decision is that he has a disability attributable to service, but that that disability is not up to the 50 per cent. which entitles him to a pension.  That disease is a progressive one; in other words, it is becoming a little bit worse each year.  Could that man apply during the following year for another board, and in the year after that for another board?</P>

But take a case of chronic rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis; the board may find that that rheumatic condition is attributable to service, we will say, last year, but that the applicant is suffering from it only in the fingers, that he is only 20 per cent. disabled, and is therefore not entitled to a pension.  But the disease is progressive, and next year or the year after every joint may be locked up.  Could that man then apply for another board?</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy O'Higgins, the Minister's attitude would be understandable if the assessment were made not so much on the basis of the present stage of the disease, but having regard to the fact that it is a progressive one, and will develop as time goes on, but, if the position of affairs as laid down in the Bill is that a person suffering from a progressive disease due to service will be awarded a pension calculated on the stage which a disease had reached at the particular time, then that is a manifestly inequitable basis upon which to make the assessment.</P>

      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1940, prepared by the Minister for Defence with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the terms of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932 (No. 26 of 1932) and the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938 (No. 33 of 1938) and laid before the Dáil on the 28th day of November, 1940, be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, empowered the Minister for Defence to prepare a scheme of pensions and gratuities for:&mdash;(a) members of the forces; (b) nurses of the Army nursing service; (c) certain ex-members of the Army who had been transferred to the Civil Service or the Gárda Síochána prior to the passing of the Act on the 16th December, 1932. The Act also stipulated that any scheme could not come into operation <Col N="1098" /> until confirmed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The scheme took five years to prepare, and it was not confirmed by the Oireachtas until 27th October, 1937.  It provided: (a) pensions and/or gratuities for members of the forces actually serving on the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; (27th October, 1937) together with pensions or gratuities for the widows and children of officers who died on or after that day; (b) pensions or gratuities for Army nurses; (c) pensions for the ex-members of the Army transferred to the Civil Service or Gárda Síochána.  But between the passing of the Act on the 16th December, 1932, and the confirmation of the scheme on the 27th October, 1937, four officers died while serving; one officer resigned the day before his death, and one officer was transferred to the Gárda Síochána.  As the five officers had died before the appointed day, their widows and children were not entitled to pensions; and although the officer transferred to the Gárda Síochána had about 13 years' pensionable service, as the scheme and the Act stood, the provision made for officers similarly transferred could not be applied to him.</P>
    <P>It was decided that these six cases should be covered&mdash;subject in the case of the five widows to the recovery of any gratuity they had received under Defence Force Regulations &mdash; and, accordingly, the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938 was passed.  That Act itself is not sufficient. It is necessary to implement it by amending the original scheme and by having the amendments confirmed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the principal object of the present amendments.  The six persons concerned are covered by Articles 8 (a), 9 (3) and 9 (4).</P>
    <P>The necessity for amending the scheme so as to implement the Act of 1938 is being availed of as a suitable occasion for carrying out the following other objects:&mdash;(a) to provide for the widow of a captain who was a serving officer on the appointed day, but who had not the requisite 12 years' service to entitle his widow to a pension. This is effected by Article 9 (2); (b) to provide gratuities for officers who received <Col N="1099" /> short-term commissions in the Air Corps.  This is done by Article 6; (c) to provide for officers who may in the future be transferred to the Civil Service or Gárda Síochána.  This is the effect of Article 8 (b); (d) to redraft some Articles, and to make certain verbal amendments in others so as to clarify the meaning of those articles where experience has shown their meaning to be obscure or the original intention not fully expressed. This purpose is given effect to in Articles 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>Thus, Article 4 raises the age-limit for children's pensions; Article 5 provides a gratuity at the rate already obtaining for a second lieutenant where an officer had a number of years' service in non-commissioned rank, but had not the requisite five years' service for a gratuity in commissioned rank; Article 7 brings the terminology of the scheme into line with that of Defence Force Regulations which has altered since the principal scheme was confirmed; Article 9 (1) makes it clear that the widow of an officer who had retired on grounds of ill-health is entitled to pension; Article 10 ensures that the term &ldquo;additional pay&rdquo; does not exclude certificate, band, flying or extra pay granted to certain classes of soldiers other than tradesmen, clerks and so on.  The Article also secures that men in receipt of such additional pay will not be deprived of the benefit of such pay in calculating their gratuities by the fact that they had been granted pre-discharge leave; Articles 11 and 12 correct slips in drafting, and Article 11 also extends the grounds on which gratuities will not be payable; Article 13 ensures that an officer's widow's right to pension will not be prejudiced by the fact that her husband may die between the date of his retirement and the date of the effective grant of pension; and, finally, Article 14 provides that a soldier's widow or orphans will be entitled to the gratuity which the soldier would have received if he had been discharged from the Army on the date of his death.  I ask for confirmation of the scheme by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend existing legislation dealing with reformatories and industrial schools.  In 1936 a commission of inquiry, which was set up to deal with the reformatory and industrial school system, reported and made certain recommendations which included proposals for the amendment of the law regarding the care and protection of children.  Experience of the administration of the industrial and reformatory school system has also shown amendment of the Children Act in certain respects to be desirable and this Bill provides for such amendment.  The provisions are explained fairly fully in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated.</P>
      <P>The most important amendments, I think, are those relating to the grounds for committal to industrial schools. These are laid down in Section 58 of the original Act and it is proposed to make certain amendments to that section.  For example, in clause (b) of the Children Act, 1908, where the ground for committal is laid down as &ldquo;is found wandering and not having any home or settled place of abode, or visible means of subsistence, or is found wandering and having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship,&rdquo; it is proposed to delete the two words &ldquo;wandering and&rdquo; in both places where these words occur.  The position is that there is no legal definition of the word &ldquo;wandering&rdquo; in the Principal Act, and I am advised that in actual practice the provisions of clause (b) of Section 58 are interpreted as if the word had no material effect in the context. It is therefore proposed that the other circumstances mentioned in the clause, apart from wandering, should be regarded as sufficient for the court to commit a child to an industrial school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to clause (c) in the section, which is mentioned on page 1 <Col N="1102" /> of the memorandum, where the child &ldquo;is found destitute, not being an orphan and having both parents or his surviving parent, or in the case of an illegitimate child his mother, undergoing penal servitude or imprisonment,&rdquo; a case has actually arisen where a parent, in prison for a rather serious offence, refused his consent that the child might be committed under the Children Act, 1929, which governs the committal of children against whom no offence has been charged but who are found in a state of destitution.</P>
    <P>Under that Act the consent of the parents is necessary, but we have had this case where the father, although in prison, refused to give his consent.  In any event, quite apart from such cases, I feel that the court ought to have discretion where not both but one of the parents is either in penal servitude or in prison. The court in such a case should have discretion to consider whether in the child's best interests he or she should not be committed to an industrial school.</P>
    <P>The next provision in the Principal Act reads: (d) &ldquo;is under the care of a parent or guardian who, by reason of criminal or drunken habits, is unfit to have the care of the child.&rdquo;  Cases have arisen where it has not been possible to deal with children satisfactorily under the provisions of Section 58 of the Principal Act and neither has the coúrt had that discretion under the Act of 1929 to commit the children by reason of the fact that, although it felt that in the child's best interests committal was necessary, the consent of one or other of the parents was not forthcoming.  It has been represented to me that an endeavour should be made to give the court more discretion to deal with such cases.  While I do not think it advisable to recommend an amendment of the 1929 Act which might appear drastic, an amendment involving the question of the consent of the parents, I feel, even if there is a relatively small number of cases, and these cases may be very exceptional or they may be border-line cases, that so long as there is even that small number of <Col N="1103" /> cases where it would be in the child's best interests that the court should have discretion to consider whether he or she might or might not be committed, the best course is to endeavour to increase as far as possible the reasonable discretion of the court.  I am proposing to delete the words &ldquo;by reason of criminal or drunken habits&rdquo;, though I admit frankly that I feel some further amendment of the clause will be necessary and that as it is at present set out in the Bill it may not command the assent of the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendments affecting committals to reformatory and industrial schools, there are a number dealing with the age of committal. The House will have seen in the explanatory memorandum that the proposals in the Bill involve increasing the age where a young offender may be committed to a reformatory school from 16 to 17 years.  The definition of a young person formerly was from 12 to 16 years.  We are now proposing to alter it to read from 12 to 17 years.  This is following on the lines of legislation elsewhere.  In the case of committal to industrial schools, we are making no change in the age for committal. A good many people feel that there should be discretion given to the courts to commit children to industrial schools even above the age of 14 years. I have not found, however, after an examination of this matter, that those who are in the best position from practical experience to speak on these questions feel that that is the best solution.</P>
    <P>It is felt that after the age of 14 years boys in particular undergo certain changes in character and development, and that they present a somewhat different problem to that of boys under 14 years of age.</P>
    <P>I should have explained to the House that we are changing the period of detention which ends at the age of 16 years in the case of industrial school committals.  A boy at present may be put into an industrial school up to 14. After 14 he is sent to a reformatory or dealt with in some other way.  I am informed, as I have said, by those who are best in a position to judge, <Col N="1104" /> and who have most experience of the actual handling of young people of that age who have been committed, that after the age of 14 years conditions, sociological or otherwise, make the treatment of young people over 14, different from the treatment of those under that age.  We are, therefore, taking special powers to continue the detention of such children until they are 17, but only with the consent of the parent or guardian, where it would appear that the child would benefit substantially by giving him a special educational training, by sending him, for example, to a secondary or a vocational school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the period of detention, we are reducing this in the case of the reformatory schools, from three to five years to two to four years.  It is felt that at present justices who might feel that it was in the child's best interest to be placed under the care of one of the religious orders who have the management of these schools, might have a certain reluctance in committing a young offender for such a lengthy period.  Experience seems to indicate that the shorter period of from two to four years may be more satisfactory and may work out to greater advantage.</P>
    <P>There is then the important question of after-care supervision.  At present, a child or young person may be released on licence by the manager or conditionally released by the Minister.  In certain cases the manager has power to bring him back again to the school if the conditions on which he was granted release or the terms of the licence are not fulfilled but, in order to do this, he has to be brought formally before a court.  I feel that this procedure is unnecessary, and that it should be sufficient, when the licence is revoked, and when it is clear to the manager or the Minister that the conditions attaching to it are not fulfilled, that the Gárda should be empowered to bring the child or young person back to the school from which he was licensed or conditionally released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean that that can happen on the initiative of the Gárdaí?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on a communication from the Office of Education, or the manager.  It is proposed, in order to make this position water-tight from the legal point of view, that in all cases where young persons are released before the completion of the period of detention, the manager should be compelled to issue a licence.  When the manager issues a licence formally, which he does not always do at present, he will have full legal rights to see that if the terms of the licence are not fulfilled, the young person can be brought back.  The legal authority of the manager to remove any such person from a place of employment or from unsuitable conditions ceases at the age of 18 at present.  It is proposed to extend the period of after-care supervision. In the case of industrial schools, in special cases at the Minister's discretion, where he considers it advisable having considered the circumstances of the particular case, the after-care supervision of the young person released may be increased from the age of 18 up to the age of 21 years.  In the case of young offenders committed to reformatory schools, the after-care supervision period at present extends only to 19 years.  It is considered that this period should be extended.  If the Minister considers, after consultation with the manager, that it is necessary for the protection and welfare of the young offender that the period of his supervision should be extended, it may be so extended for a period not exceeding two years, that is to say, two years after the time he has reached the age of 19.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a position to which we have not adverted in the Bill. At any rate, where the Minister, in consultation with the manager, as in the case of the industrial school people, considers that the reformatory school boy requires further supervision, the period may be extended from the present age of 19 to the age of 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1929 Act, which dealt with cases of destitution, and which provided that, subject to the consent of the parents to the committal order, children might <Col N="1106" /> be committed on the ground of destitution, is being embodied in the present Bill.  There are certain small amendments. As in the 1929 Act, the consent of the parent or parents must be obtained, but in case their consent cannot be obtained, or even if their whereabouts are not known, provision is being made that they may object within 14 days; and, if objection is not being made, the court will have discretion to consider committing the children.  Cases may arise where possibly the parent or parents cannot be found.</P>
    <P>I understand that the actual position at present is that, in order to give consent, it is not absolutely necessary that the parents should present themselves in court.  For example, if the parent is out of the country, an affidavit of the parent may be accepted by the court.  But, we feel that to cover these exceptional and border-line cases as far as possible, some amendment of the 1929 Act may be necessary, and we have put in this provision for the consideration of the House providing that, when the whereabouts of the parents are not known, they should be given an opportunity of making their objection felt within a certain period, before which time the court could not take action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the whereabouts of the parents are not known, how can they within 14 days, or whatever the time is, know that they are to make an objection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that we shall have to go into more fully on the Committee Stage.  As the provision stands at present at any rate, we have put it in to cover certain cases in accordance with the recommendations made by the commission:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii) notice of the proposal to make such order having been given to the child's parents, surviving parent or, in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, such parents, parent, or mother fail or fails to object to the making of such order within 14 days from the giving of such notice, or,</P>
      <P>(iii) the Court is satisfied that the child's parents, surviving parent, or, in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, cannot be found....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Our object is, in cases of difficulty in connection with destitution, to give the court somewhat more discretion without appearing to interfere with the fundamental principle that in those cases of destitution the consent of the parents must be obtained.  We are continuing, of course, the proviso that, where a child is being committed on grounds of destitution solely, the court being satisfied that the parents are not in a position to maintain or support the child, as soon as that condition no longer obtains, and the Minister is satisfied that the parents are in a position to maintain the child, he forthwith arranges for the discharge of that child.</P>
    <P>There are certain provisions dealing with the payments made by local authorities.  Under Section 19, the Minister may make regulations prescribing the payments to be made by local authorities to managers of industrial schools.  Provision is also made that the local authority must comply with the regulations; that, if money is due, it can be recovered in the usual way as a contract debt, and that regulations made by the Minister, which must have the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, must be laid on the table of each House.</P>
    <P>The reason for these provisions is that it seems to have been intended by law that the primary responsibility for the maintenance of young persons in industrial schools should be placed upon local authorities.  I think the 1908 Act makes it clear that the duty of maintenance is imposed on them and that the onus is placed upon them in the first instance.  Although for a very long period prior to that the State had been paying grants and contributions towards the maintenance of those institutions, or capitation grants, nevertheless it was clearly the intention that the onus for the maintenance of the children should be placed primarily on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>When, after the last great war, the Treasury increased the basic State allowance from 5/- to 7/6 per head, it was on the understanding that the local authorities should make a similar <Col N="1108" /> contribution.  The position, however, is that the average contribution from local authorities is only 4/10.  There is no uniformity.  I notice in one case that the local authority is paying such a small amount as 2/6 per week per child, while in other cases local authorities are much more generous.  There is a wide discrepancy and there is the fact that in no case is the original intention of the law, that the local authority should contribute at least as much as the State, being fulfilled. We have found it necessary to insert this provision in the interests of the schools, who, at the present time particularly, are passing through a rather difficult period, as they have very heavy expenses and their costs and charges are increasing with the war situation. Quite apart from that, even if there had been no war situation, it was our intention, and was recommended by the Commission of Inquiry into the industrial school system, that steps should be taken to clarify this matter. Accordingly, we have inserted this provision, that the Minister, with the consent of the other two Ministers, may make regulations.  He has a certain amount of discretion, but, when the regulations are made, the House will have the opportunity, if it so wishes, of discussing them.</P>
    <P>In that connection, there is a question which is dealt with in Section 18 of determining the place of residence of the youthful offender or child committed to an industrial school.  As the law stands, it appears that county boroughs feel that they are suffering a certain disability in this matter. At present the responsibility for contributing to the support of a child or young person in a certain school is placed on the local authority of the place where the committal takes place, unless it is proved that the child resided elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Commission expressed the view that the present arrangement was unfair to the county boroughs, and the purpose of the section is to remedy this as far as possible and to impose the responsibility on the local authority of the place where the child or the child's parents resided, if this can be ascertained. <Col N="1109" /> If no definite place can be assigned by the court as the place of residence of the child's parents or the child itself during the 12 months prior to the commission of the offence, the position will be that the court will have discretion to consider that the place where the offence is committed is the place of residence of the child, and for the purposes of the contribution from local authorities in that case the local authority of that place will be responsible. The Minister, under Section 3, may also make regulations for the conduct of certified schools, and the section provides that it shall be the manager's duty to comply with these regulations.</P>
    <P>Finally, under Section 5, the prior consent of the Minister is required in future for the appointment of managers of certified schools.  This is in accordance with the recommendations of the commission.  I think that these are the chief points, Sir.  I regret that the Bill has had to appear in its present form.  Only one portion&mdash; Part IV&mdash;of the Children Act of 1908 concerns me.  That is the portion dealing with the industrial and reformatory schools, and if this Bill is not considered complete I hope the House will take into consideration the fact that other Departments as well as the Department of Education are concerned in this question of juvenile offenders.  The whole question, for example, of children's courts is outside my province, and in this Bill, therefore, I have had to follow closely and only seek to amend or extend those provisions which seemed to deal specifically with reformatory or industrial schools.  I am not attempting to carry out any fundamental alteration in the law.  The amendments are technical and I am hopeful that, in the discussions which may take place in the House, probably amendments will be made which will improve the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say much on this Bill at this stage. I think the Minister himself more or less indicated that it was a matter for discussion on Committee.  There is one point, particularly, that interests me and to which I should like to direct <Col N="1110" /> the attention of the House and of the Minister.  I do not think I am incorrect in saying that this Bill is an attempt to tighten up the law, and, so far, we might approve of it without any hesitation, but it seems to me an attempt to tighten up the law, almost in every case, against the rights of parents, and that is what I do not like about certain provisions in this Bill. The Minister himself spoke of exceptional cases.  He spoke of border line cases.  I think that more than once he used those expressions.</P>
      <P>Now, I put it to him that it is not wise further to restrict the fundamental rights of the parent, which I was under the impression was one of the things that still remained guaranteed by the Constitution.  I doubt if it is wise further to restrict the rights of the parents and give a court, or anybody, further power to interfere with these rights.  Consequently, I leave aside how far our legislation now conflicts with our present Constitution and the principles solemnly laid down there so far as the rights of the parents in educational matters are concerned; but when it is a question of taking a child out of the control of the parents, its natural guardians, I think the onus is altogether on the shoulders of those who try to do that, and I think no such vague and general words should appear in a Bill of this kind as appear in Section 9 (c) &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo;.  In other words, what you are doing is taking discretion away from the parents and putting it in the power of a district justice&mdash;I do not care whether he is a district justice or the Chief Justice&mdash;for a reason that he thinks fit&mdash;not that this House thinks fit, but that he thinks fit&mdash;to deprive the natural guardians of the child of their rights and their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I question very much the wisdom of the adoption of a policy of that kind in order to meet a few exceptional cases.  I think that, in a matter of this kind, the first consideration ought to be&mdash;and I thought that we had, if not guaranteed it, at least expressed a pious opinion to that effect in the Constitution&mdash;apart from any provision of the Constitution, that there is no undue interference with the <Col N="1111" /> rights of the family, and that if it is found necessary to interfere with them, then it will be done on stated grounds, and not have the <i>carte blanche</i> that is given here to a judge to determine it according as suits his fancy.  There is nothing to guide him here as to taking the child away from its parents and sending it to somebody else, however excellent these other people may be.  All this is not to deal with the great mass of cases of this kind that the courts have to deal with, or that the Department has to deal with, but in order to make the law water-tight and cover the few exceptional cases that now escape.  I doubt the wisdom of that policy, and I would ask the Minister, between this and the Committee Stage, to think, not of how he will further tighten up the Bill, but rather to think of the rights of the parents with which this Bill may unduly interfere.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister spoke as if there was one case that could be produced. Well, that is the spirit of the Bill.  I do not think that a fundamental principle&mdash;it is more even than a fundamental principle of State policy&mdash; should be lightly set aside or, if not set aside, at least endangered, merely because there are a few exceptional cases.  Furthermore, there is a case here to which it might be well to draw attention.  Let us take the case of a widowed father.  It very often happens in the case of a father who is a widower that he appeals to the court and asks the court to commit his child to an industrial school, owing to his being a widower and no longer in a position to look after the child.  I think it should be definitely laid down in such a case that it is the right of that parent&mdash;at least for one occasion &mdash;to get that child out of the school if he asks for the child to be let out, and that the Minister should be compelled to release the child if the father demands it.  I admit that a case could be made that, by making frivolous demands, a person might almost adopt a kind of cat-and-mouse system, but at least for the first occasion the parent should be entitled to get the child sent back.  He put that child in the <Col N="1112" /> school in circumstances that he thought&mdash;not that the Minister or the court thought, but in circumstances that he, as the natural guardian of the child, its parent, thought&mdash;were proper and he demanded or asked the court to come to his assistance and see that the child was taken care of in an industrial school.  He was acting in the best interests of the child, as he thought.  Perhaps circumstances change, and anyhow he makes up his mind to get that child back, and I hold that he is entitled to get it back.  It may be difficult.  If he again applied for the child's committal then I submit he has shown his personal mind in the matter and that that position can be covered.  It should not lie with a judge, with a Minister or with a head of a Department to say whether or not a parent could exercise the right to get back a particular child.</P>
    <P>I notice that the provision still remains that the Minister may release a child.  I hold in that case that he ought to release the child.  That is a matter really in the right of a parent. In the existing Act, as far as I remember, it is not insisted upon that the Minister must not do it, but it is sound policy that the Minister should do it.  If we are passing legislation I would rather see that principle acknowledged in it than a provision which is turned against the right of the parent in the present Bill.  There are certain things in the Bill that I confess I am not clear about, and that the Minister, perhaps, would be good enough to clarify when concluding.</P>
    <P>There is the period of supervision after a child leaves an industrial school. That can be continued.  What is the sanction for that?  Remember that 21 years is rather an advanced age at which to treat a person as a child.  It seems a long time to keep a young man in leading strings.  If necessary, you can increase the age to 21.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten the House as to what supervision consists of. What is the sanction if a child, or those into whose employment he goes, do not fulfil the conditions?  Can the child be brought back?  Can anything be done?  What is there to make the supervision effective?  The Minister <Col N="1113" /> should clarify the position when replying.</P>
    <P>If I may put it to the Minister, and I speak merely my personal opinion, there is too much of a tendency to bring the court in where the parent ought to be sufficient.  Even where there is an instance of conditions not being fulfilled, there was at least some kind of safeguard&mdash;not the kind of safeguard I would like&mdash;that the courts had to be consulted.  Now, the Minister, presumably on the advice of the Guards, can bring a person back into custody.  I confess I do not like to have people sitting in judgment there. I admit that their knowledge and evidence may be more profound than mine, but my personal opinion is that there is too much of a tendency to encroach upon what ought to be practically the inviolable rights of parents, and that good reasons should be given for that encroachment.  I feel more than ever at present that all the tendency in legislation goes in that direction.  My views may be somewhat out-of-date on this particular matter, but I wish the Minister would give some consideration to the points raised. That was my purpose in intervening in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be recalled that in 1934 a commission was set up to inquire into the industrial and reformatory schools system, being known as the Cussen Commission.  It issued its report almost five years ago, and in this Bill we have legislation to give effect to some of the recommendations made.  While the Bill purports to do that, it completely ignores some of the more valuable recommendations.  Some of these recommendations proposed that the arrangement which obtains in Dublin for the housing of children's courts separately from ordinary courts should be adopted where possible throughout the country, but the out-of-date system of bringing children into the District Courts remains in the Bill, except for Dublin.  The important suggestion that the term committal orders should be abolished remains. That term savours of the criminal courts.  The very important proposal, that the titles &ldquo;reformatory school&rdquo; and &ldquo;industrial school&rdquo; should be <Col N="1114" /> abolished remains a recommendation. There is no reason for such an archaic and obsolete term.  Some alternative names should be provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Another recommendation was that each school should have a medical attendant paid on a school capitation basis at a rate prescribed by the Minister.  There is an attempt to implement that recommendation by legislation. The practical proposal, that primary teachers in the schools should have the same general training and qualifications in Irish as teachers in national schools, is not included in the Bill.  It does not move along the lines laid down for ordinary national school teachers, whose academic and Irish qualifications are examined.  The old happy-go-lucky system is still to obtain in industrial schools.  I am sorry the Minister does not see his way to implement another important matter, and that is to put the teachers in these schools who have qualifications&mdash;and there are teachers in the industrial schools with very high qualifications&mdash;on a proper basis.  The conditions of service of lay teachers in these schools call for substantial improvement. That was recommended five years ago by the Cussen Commission, and to-day we were told in a reply to a Parliamentary Question that the Minister cannot now see his way to implement that very important recommendation. The teachers in these schools, many of whom are very highly qualified, are wretchedly underpaid. That condition is still to remain, although I understand that the Minister has in his department all the necessary information in regard to implementing it, but it is a question of finance.  It is rather paradoxical to talk like that when we have been talking in millions, for the last couple of weeks, for other things.  This is a matter, the Minister informed me to-day, of £20,000.  That cannot be found in order to see that these teachers have proper remuneration and, incidentally, that the children will be provided with the very best teachers&mdash;a thing to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other very important recommendations made by the Cussen Commission, and all these have been ignored and left entirely untouched in <Col N="1115" /> this Bill.  From a casual glance, it might be said that it does go some distance to improve the present conditions in these schools, but in some respects the improvements effected by the Bill are far from satisfactory.  Take for instance the payments made.  These payments have been unsatisfactory, in as much as they are inadequate in most cases.  It is recognised that, in certain instances, managers of schools refuse to accept juveniles committed, because the allowance paid is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the Minister to remedy this defect by fixing a minimum that the local authority has to provide, but there is no provision, either by the local authority or by the State, for the upkeep of the buildings and, in many cases, the result is that the conditions of the buildings are wretched.  No provision is made for upkeep, heating, sanitation or cleaning, so that the position is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Another point, which is of considerable importance and which is not dealt with in the Bill, is that the first payment for the child, I understand, is not made until the boy or girl is six months in the school.  That means that payments are from three to six months behind time.  The school, of course, has to bear the burden in the meantime. The amount, as anybody with a knowledge of these things understands, is very inadequate.  Besides that, this system of deferred payments causes great hardships to the managers of the schools.</P>
    <P>There are other very important omissions in the Bill, and there are things put into it which are objectionable. I cannot understand this idea of licensing.  The child will be licensed by the manager and allowed out on a kind of ticket-of-leave system.  I strongly object to that kind of legislation for children.  Many of these children are in these schools because their parents were destitute or dead.  Professor O'Sullivan has cited one case. Many of these children have characters which are above reproach.  This system of licensing or ticket-of-leave will, I am afraid, have a very bad psychological and moral effect on our children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> Reference was made to supervision. I should like to ask the Minister if there is any way in which this supervision could be carried out.  The net result will be that nobody will bother with the child once it comes out, as there will be no further payment or grant from any source, unless there is somebody definitely charged with the responsibility of supervising these children when they leave.  There is very great need for supervision.  Very often these children are exploited by unscrupulous employers.  Though there is need for supervision, no provision is made for it beyond a pious wish in the Bill.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on that point in his reply and to let us know exactly what he means and what his intentions are.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point that the reason he did not touch the suggestion about children's courts, and so on, was that it concerned some other Department and that he was dealing only with his own Department.  At the same time, he brings in this idea of licensing and empowers the courts to bring children back to the schools and have them detained there again.  If that is the reason for ignoring the point about children's courts and other recommendations, I cannot see how it is that he can bring this into it, as that is also part and parcel of the very machinery for dealing with these children.</P>
    <P>Then there is the point that the manager of the school has to issue a licence.  He is compelled now to issue a licence to the child, in order to safeguard the legal position, I take it, as far as bringing the child back to the school is concerned.  I wish to say emphatically that I strongly object to that system.  I do not know what would be the proportion of children in industrial schools through the rotten social system under which we are living, but I am sure a very big proportion of those children would come under that category, being there because their parents are destitute or dead.  It is no reproach to their character but, under this Bill, those children will be licensed and a ticket of leave be given to each child on leaving.  I mention <Col N="1117" /> these points so that the Minsiter may look into them and may answer with amendments.  I may take the opportunity myself to put in amendments on the Committee Stage, in an effort to improve what I consider is a very bad mess of things in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that some form of tribute is due to the framers of the 1908 Act.  After 32 years in operation, the Minister only finds it necessary to amend that Act in these few particulars.  I take it we consider that, in the 32 years, we have advanced somewhat in social science, and I think it must be a tribute to the framers of that Act that they were some years ahead of their time, whoever they may be.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely difficult Bill to understand because of all the amending and references.  At the same time, there are one or two points to be considered. There is, of course, the question as to whether in actual fact this Bill is improving the 1908 Act or not. Professor O'Sullivan mentioned one point, and Deputy Hurley referred to another.  In regard to Deputy Hurley's point it appears to me that this may be a retrograde step.  This Section 13 (c) makes the licensing compulsory, instead of permissive, as it was before. That objection by Deputy Hurley probably would be met by leaving it in its original form.  The manager would then confine his licences to those most requiring after-supervision and probably he would be interested in those particular children and would see that that supervision was carried out effectively, whereas under a compulsory licensing scheme, it is possible that the demands in supervision would be so great that they could not be carried out effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill sets out to amend Section 65 of the Principal Act by reducing the terms three and five years to two and four.  There is another section of the Act of 1908&mdash; Section 84&mdash;which also determines the periods but, in that case, it deals with children who have been conditionally pardoned.  I take it, therefore, that in that case the Minister does not consider <Col N="1118" /> that there is any necessity to alter the periods.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a slight discrepancy between the explanatory memorandum and the Bill.  About half way down page 2 of the explanatory memorandum, in referring to Section 9 of the Bill, it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proposed to amend paragraphs (c) and (d) of the Principal Act in the manner shown in Section 9, paragraphs (b) and (c)...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>which it says &ldquo;do not necessitate parental consent&rdquo;.  Yet, if one looks at paragraph (b) of Section 9 one finds that the purpose of that paragraph is this: to delete the words &ldquo;his surviving parent, or in the case of an illegitimate child his mother&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;one of his parents&rdquo;.  According to the memorandum, this is one of the sections that does not need parental consent.  It may be that I have got the thing entirely wrong, and perhaps between now and Committee Stage the Minister would look into it and see whether there is a conflict between what he intends to do and what is in the Bill or in the memorandum.  I welcome Section 18 from the point of view of the City of Dublin.  As far as Section 19 is concerned, I think the Minister might consider whether he should not have some restriction placed on his generosity when dealing with other people's money.  I suppose no Minister ever did anything wrong, and perhaps I ought to have said that he should consider restricting his successor's generosity.  Under sub-section (1) of Section 19, the Minister may make regulations, but there seems to be no necessary relation between the amount which he may mention in those regulations and the amount which, in fact, it may cost to keep a child in a certified school, with the result that the local authority may be paying considerably more than it really ought to.  These are the only points I wish to raise, and perhaps the Minister will look into them between now and the next stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 19, I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the <Col N="1119" /> fact that, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, he is proposing to take certain powers which they have at present out of the hands of public bodies appointed under the Local Government Act.  He is reserving to himself the sole right to say what contribution a public body should make for the maintenance of a child in one of these schools.  The present allowance payable by a public body for a boy sent to a certified school is 5/-, plus 7/6 from the Minister's Department, making a total of 12/6 a week.  That is much more than the Government allow for the maintenance of a widow and orphans, or of the unemployed father of a family in the rural areas.  This 12/6 a week is payable in respect of a child in the charge of a community.  These communities make their purchases in bulk.  This 12/6 is 2/- a week higher than the sum allowed for the maintenance of patients in up-to-date hospitals.  The Minister is now seeking power to increase the 12/6 by another half-crown, thereby making the weekly payment 15/-.  While the Minister is doing that, he voted to prevent widows receiving more than 10/- a week to maintain themselves and perhaps five or six children in a rural area, and all the Government allow to an unemployed man is 8/- a week to maintain himself and five or six children in a rural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to be consistent, then I suggest to him he should do something to improve the allowances payable to the unemployed father of a family and to widows and orphans in rural areas.  In this Bill he is not showing much consideration for public bodies.  He is taking power to compel them, regardless of the state of their finances and the difficulty they experience in getting in their rates, to increase the allowances for children in these certified schools.  Some more consideration should, I suggest, be shown towards the poor people in the rural areas who will have to contribute their share in the rates towards the payment of this 15/- a week for each child in one of these schools.  I will oppose the Bill as long as that section is in it.  We <Col N="1120" /> have too much dictation, I think, in a number of the Bills that are being introduced by the Government at the present time.  I, for one, will oppose the Minister getting further dictatorial power over our public bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I see nothing to enthuse about in this Bill.  If the measure is to be taken as representing the Minister's efforts, I must say that I am thoroughly disappointed with it. With the report of the Cussen Commission in his hands, one would have thought that he would have brought forward a measure containing some of its good points.  To my mind this Bill is all against the juvenile offender. There is not a word in it about the parents' rights.  Children may be taken from their parents because they have committed what the parents may think were trifling offences.  Yet, the Bill gives no right to parents to appeal to the Minister over the heads of those who have ordered the children to be removed from their control.  In my opinion there should be the right of appeal from the decision of a justice. There are many parents in this city of the opinion that their children have been unjustly sent to industrial schools. If the Minister were to investigate some of the cases decided during the last 12 months or two years he would, I think, take steps to have the sentences passed reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What disappoints me about the industrial school system is this, that there seems to be no intermediate stage between the sending of a child for five or six years to an industrial school and of allowing the child to remain at home. In Glasgow, and in all parts of America, there is a home to which a child offender may be taken for a month or two.  Again, in Glasgow children are not taken to a police station.  They are brought before a lay committee, the members of which do their best to discover the faults of the child, and apply a remedy.  There a very distinguished order of nuns have a home for such children, who attend it voluntarily.  Medical experts and others with a good knowledge of children do their best to find out what has led the child to commit some offence, and then seek to apply a remedy without <Col N="1121" /> sending the child to an industrial school for such a long period of seven years.  Would it not be possible to have something on these lines here: that for a month or two a close watch would be kept on a child and a remedy sought for whatever fault it has committed, the child all the while being left under the parents' control?</P>
    <P>What I think we really want here is the provision of more probation officers. In other countries the probation officer visits the child's home, and, in some, cases, doctors make recommendations. The probation officer keeps an eye on the juvenile offender, and reports on his conduct over a period of 12 months or so.  It very frequently happens that the doctor reports that a juvenile offender, as a result of the care exercised over him has turned out to be one of the best children in the district.</P>
    <P>If it were not for that system in Glasgow and America, that child might spend five years in an industrial school. I hold that if a child goes wrong, the first or second offence should not be a reason for taking him from his parents and putting him into an industrial school, no matter how good that school may be.  I want to say that most of them are exceptionally good and have done splendid work, and I do not wish anyone to think that I am unduly or unfairly criticising the industrial schools.  What I want here in this city is a medium&mdash;something different from the system of the industrial school, to which a child must go for a first offence.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, especially in school attendance cases, it ought to be the right of any justice in this city to take a child from the parents, especially when members of the House have experience of parents coming to them and appealing to them to get their cases re-heard and stating that the mother is breaking her heart, the father is discontented, and the home is broken up.  We have all heard these statements made and, in some cases, with justification.  I think the best remedy would be more probation officers and a voluntary committee to look after children.  I do not think that it was ever right to bring children of tender years into a police court and there to threaten them and to play on <Col N="1122" /> their fears of police-court surroundings. We ought to copy the system in operation in those places, which I have visited, in Glasgow and New York and not the old system of industrial schools, reformatories and borstal institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the problem with which this Bill is supposed to deal a very important problem, and I should have thought that a measure of this kind could best be dealt with by a select committee of the House, with power to call in whatever authorities it wished&mdash;and there are many authorities in the country&mdash;to assist in dealing with it.  Like Deputies who have already spoken, I dislike the practice of committing children to industrial schools, but in saying that, I want to make it clear that I am making no reflection whatever on the management or on the persons connected with the control of industrial schools.  I say they do their best in the circumstances, but, from the very beginning, the children in many instances are under a tremendous disadvantage, and that disadvantage is very manifest in a number of cases when they leave these schools.</P>
      <P>I am speaking now of children who may be in an industrial school because one of the parents is dead, because they have been deserted in one way or another, or because of some minor offence, but I refer particularly to the first class, children who are sent there because one of the parents is dead and the other is unable to support them, or because both parents are dead. Children in that position leave the industrial schools with a very definite disadvantage, with, as it were, some particular brand or stigma which has been the source of the failure of a good many boys who have turned out badly &mdash;not, I think, through any particular fault of theirs, or any inherent defect in their characters, but because, from the very start, they labour under that very serious disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak particularly of the section of the Bill which purports to provide some after-care and supervision for children leaving industrial schools.  I do not see any provision of that kind in the Bill because there is no attempt to provide the money <Col N="1123" /> necessary for that work.  It is most important, and if the system can be altered or improved in any way, I think that some definite steps in that direction must be taken.  I have seen a number of boys who left industrial schools appearing before courts of referees seeking unemployment assistance. To anyone who wanted to realise facts, their condition was in many cases pitiable.  They were wretched-looking, ill-clad and, in many cases, hungry-looking, and it would be a very hard heart that would not be moved by their condition.  I have questioned some of them and have heard a number of them questioned by others, and I ascertained that they were getting no wages whatever, that they were being employed to do certain work by their employers, that they were badly fed, badly treated, badly housed and bore in their countenances clear and unmistakable evidence of the fact that they were neglected and were nobody's children.</P>
    <P>I grant that in many cases&mdash;and I have brought cases of the kind to the notice of the authorities in industrial schools&mdash;every attempt was made to do something for them.  Every attempt was made, in the first instance, to place them properly, but in many parts of the country that is very difficult. There are quite a number of people who are always willing to take boys, particularly, from industrial schools, to exploit them for whatever they can get out of them and to turn them adrift afterwards, that afterwards often leading to their ultimate failure as citizens.  It is a particularly sad story, and I think that any measure which purports to deal with this problem and which omits that essential of after-care and supervision in the years when children have left the industrial schools, is simply avoiding the most important part of the problem.</P>
    <P>There are certain other objectionable terms employed in the Bill.  There is the term &ldquo;licence&rdquo; and the provision which asks a district justice to have regard to a child's antecedents and to the possibility of a child having an inherent tendency to crime or developing <Col N="1124" /> such a tendency at a later stage because of some hereditary defect. I think that is all wrong, and I agree with other speakers who said that if there have been failures of children from industrial schools, if such children have turned to crime in some cases and have found themselves in the grip of the law at a later stage of their lives, to a very large extent they are more sinned against than sinning because, from the very beginning, everything has been against them. Their services have been obtained for very little; they are known in every district as boys who have come out of an industrial school; and, in that way, the stigma which, in another generation, attached to the poorhouse and the union and which left in our vocabulary that ugly word &ldquo;pauper&rdquo;, is associated with them.</P>
    <P>This whole matter should be dealt with along lines of humane and considered treatment, and I think that there are sufficient people in the country, in the Church and in other walks of life, who could usefully contribute suggestions and an ultimate solution of what is a very serious, a very important and a very human problem indeed.  I should like to see the number of children sent to industrial schools limited as much as possible, and I should also like to see some kind of wide extension of the system of boarding-out children whereby they could be taken into certain homes, the conditions in which would be ascertained, and in which they could be given some kind of home-life.  That is the great disadvantage and difficulty with which children of industrial schools commence.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a miserable contribution to the solution of a very big problem. It does not give effect to a number of recommendations made by a Commission which sat five years ago.  This Commission has had the same fate as most Commissions, and we have had a large number of them in the last 20 years.  The Bill deals only with the fringe of the problem here and there. Some of its provisions may effect improvement but the improvements will be small.  Running right through it is the stigma that marks out the industrial-school <Col N="1125" /> child as a member of a class apart in the community.  You find that in the definition of &ldquo;licence&rdquo;. That is a particularly sad business and, like Deputy Byrne, I see little in the Bill about which I can become enthusiastic. The contribution of the Bill to the solution of the problem with which it purports to deal is small and insignificant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction because there can be no doubting the value of the industrial school as a unit in our social and educational scheme.  At the same time, there has been a certain feeling about this matter in the City of Dublin &mdash;I think it was this feeling which Deputy Byrne had in the forefront of his mind when he was addressing himself to the Bill.  The feeling I refer to was general in this city&mdash;that, in the past, children had been committed too readily and on too slender pretexts to industrial schools and similar institutions. I have heard it said by responsible people at meetings of public bodies in this city that children were very often committed to these institutions not so much because it was felt that it was in their own interest to commit them, but because it was very good for the institutions in question.</P>
      <P>There are serious defects in this Bill &mdash;notably those referred to by Deputy Hurley and Deputy O'Sullivan.  One aspect of the matter strikes me as very serious, that is, that in some of these schools the teachers have not got the recognised technical qualifications and experience to deal with children of school-going age.  It must be perfectly clear that children of the type committed to reformatory or industrial schools will be somewhat more difficult to deal with than the average school-going child.  Consequently, there is all the more reason why teachers engaged in such work should be more expert, better trained, and if possible, better qualified, than the average teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from the remarks made here this evening that these schools are somewhat deficient in medical and dental services.  I should like to know from the Minister, when replying, whether or not these schools enjoy the <Col N="1126" /> benefits of the School Medical Acts and whether or not the school medical services extend to them.  This is a matter which I am sure the Minister will have no hesitation in setting right&mdash;the provision of proper medical and dental facilities.  I am sure that nobody recognises more readily than the Minister the truth of the old adage <i>mens sana in corpore sano.</i></P>
    <P>With regard to the financial arrangements for the maintenance of children in industrial schools, I am sure the provisions of this Bill will not be enthusiastically accepted by the members of local authorities.  It must be borne in mind that in the old days&mdash;before the introduction of the managerial system&mdash;members of local authorities were much more in touch with the activities of the local authority of which they were members than they are under the present system.  Payment in respect of maintenance of schools, such as those referred to in the Bill, will, in all probability, never come under the notice of members under the present system.  The city or county manager will not deem them of sufficient importance to include in his monthly report.  While the defects of the Bill have been referred to by Deputies who have already spoken, I must say that, in the main, I am in favour of the Bill.  I gathered from the Minister's opening remarks that he himself will introduce amendments on the next stage which will improve the measure and render it more acceptable to the members of the House.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Murphy hit the nail on the head when he said that it should be the aim of the Government and of the House to have a smaller number of children in these reformatory and industrial schools.  I thoroughly agree with that. Members of local authorities who come up against this problem from time to time will agree with me when I say that, of the children committed to these schools from rural Ireland, two-thirds or three-fourths have committed no offence whatsoever.  This is a much deeper and more far-reaching problem than is envisaged by this Bill.  According to the local taxation accounts, local authorities contributed, in the <Col N="1127" /> year 1938-9, £39,000 for boarded-out children and children at nurse.  In the same year, they contributed £54,000 odd for children in reformatory and industrial schools.  The vast majority of children comprised in these categories are similar in type.  My objection to committing to industrial schools is that, when the time comes for these children to leave the schools, they are very often waifs and strays and do not fit into the community.  Many of them will never fit into rural life.  If those children who have committed no offence were taken in hand and boarded out amongst the rural community&mdash;in the cities and urban centres I admit there would be difficulty in boarding out&mdash;they would cost no more than they do under the present system and they would fit into the life of the community later on and be good citizens.  That is an aspect of the question that the Minister should keep in mind.  This Bill is no solution of this problem.  Reformatories and industrial schools will not solve a large part of the problem. There is a tendency for the police authorities and others to bring these children to the courts if there is difficulty in a particular district and get them committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a tendency which I have seen very much in operation.  When the mother of a family dies, and the children are left on the hands of the father, the father is approached by some interested person and is encouraged to have his children committed to an industrial school.  I have known very many cases where that has happened, and I think it is all wrong that the father should be encouraged to send those children to an industrial school for three, five or seven years.  It would be much better if that man were given some other means of maintaining his children. If he were given an allowance by the local authority or otherwise to maintain those children, and have them nursed in their own homes or boarded-out in the rural community, it would be far better.  I believe the system is wrong in that respect.  I have no views on the matter of children who may have committed an offence, or in regard to whom, for certain other reasons, it is believed important that <Col N="1128" /> they should be detained in such places as industrial schools, but I believe the Minister will find, if he investigates the matter, that two-thirds of the children at present in industrial schools have committed no offence whatever. That is my own belief; I do not know how correct it may be.</P>
    <P>It is proposed now to keep certain children in those schools up to 21 years of age.  What is going to happen to them afterwards?  Has the Department thought of that?  How are they going to fit into the life of the community? If they are not able to fit in before they are 21 they will never fit in.  Is it intended that the children to whom this proposal is to apply will be weak-minded children who are unable to look after themselves?  If that is so, there is some justification for it, but if they are ordinary children they should not be detained in any of those schools until they are 21 years old.  If they are so detained, a much greater problem will be created.  There is a proposal in this Bill to make the local authorities pay more than they have been paying.  I think that will be resented by all local authorities.  They cannot be represented by their solicitor. The local authority is notified that it is proposed to commit those children.  There is very little use in the local authority going before the district justice at all, because if he has evidence from the local Gárda that those children are destitute or would be a nuisance in the district they will be committed.  There is little or no use in the local authority being represented in those courts.  I think it is unfair to place any further burden on the local authorities for those children in industrial schools.  As I pointed out, they are paying a very large sum of money at the present time.  I think the State should carry the full cost of those children; I cannot see why it should not.</P>
    <P>On the question of the release of the children, if the circumstances of a parent whose children are committed because he is destitute should change, I think it should be within the right of that parent to claim those children out at any period, and that the court, the Minister or the head of <Col N="1129" /> the school should not have the right to decide that the parent should not get those children out.  I think if the parent claims those children at any time he should have the right to get them, and it should not be the right of the Minister or of the courts to prevent him from having those children released from the school.  It is all wrong to keep them there.  I hope the Minister and the Government will have this whole matter further considered, especially with regard to children in rural areas.  I know there is a different problem there altogether, and that those industrial schools were probably meant originally to a large extent for children from large centers of population.  While I see that there is need for some such system in large centres of population, there is really no need whatever for any children from purely rural areas to be committed to industrial schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputies speaking on this Bill mentioned the question of the provision of juvenile courts in buildings separate from the ordinary district courts in the City of Dublin, they brought to my mind a point that, strictly speaking, may not be within the Minister's powers under the present Bill, but it often struck me, from my experience of court work, that something should be done about it.  Every Deputy concerned with this has objected time and again to the fact that children have to come before the ordinary district courts in circumstances which cannot leave any good impression on their minds.  Incidentally, the Minister's function as the Minister for Education is to look after the upbringing of the children of the country, and I have often wondered whether it had ever struck the Minister that some provision should be made to prevent young children from being brought into court at all, apart from their being brought in on an application to commit them to an industrial school.  Very often children of eight or ten years of age are brought into court as witnesses.  They are asked do they know the meaning of an oath, or do they know whether it is wrong to tell a lie, and they are allowed to give evidence.  To my mind, <Col N="1130" /> that is as objectionable as having children appearing in court on an application to commit them.  Mind you, it is not a very uncommon thing at all, and I mention it to the Minister now because it is not a question which there is an opportunity of raising very often.  I think most people in the habit of practising in the courts would agree that they would never wish to bring in children of tender years to give evidence.  As far as I am concerned, if a child is brought in as a witness in a case in which I am engaged I have made it a habit to refuse to examine or cross-examine that child.  I think it is an entirely wrong practice, and that regulations should be made to the effect that no child under the age of 14 years should be allowed to give evidence in any court whatever.  It is entirely unfair to the child, and it must be remembered that what happens is that the child may intend to be truthful, and the people who bring the child in may intend him to be truthful, but actually the child's mind is influenced by what happens.</P>
      <P>In order to show the effect on the child's mentality I will refer to one occasion when the solicitor asked the child: &ldquo;Do you know what will happen if you tell a lie&rdquo;, and the district justice said: &ldquo;It would be much better to ask him &lsquo;do you know what will happen when you go home if you tell the truth&rsquo;&rdquo;.  That is just as objectionable as having children appearing in court on an application to commit them.  Strictly, perhaps, the matter is not relevant, but I feel that something should have been done long ago to prevent such a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Benson that the real trouble about this Bill is that it does not show much advance after 32 long years.  To my mind, the approach is still the old approach, and we are dealing with those unfortunate destitute children as if they were children who had committed some manner of offence or other. We cannot get away from the fact that in the eyes of the public there is no difference whatever between an industrial school and a reformatory. Actually, that is proved by the explanatory memorandum here, because it sets <Col N="1131" /> out that children of the age of 12 or 13 who are convicted of an offence which, in the case of an adult, would be punishable by penal servitude, should be sent to those schools.  It is hard to disabuse the public mind of the idea that they are reformatories, if children who are taken away from their parents simply because the parents are in poor circumstance, and are not able to provide for them, are to be put in the same category as children who have been convicted of an offence which in the case of an adult would be punishable by penal servitude. I quite see that as much care should be taken of the unfortunate child who is committed for an offence, but at the same time to my mind the approach is wrong.  The whole approach is the mid-Victorian idea that those children are something that is thrown at the State, and which the State is compelled, much against its will, to look after, instead of looking at those destitute children who are in unhappy homes throughout the country in the light that the State should create another home for them, and not something like industrial schools and reformatories.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned that sometimes when these children go through these schools they become the waifs and strays.  I would not say that that is altogether the general experience, but the reason they may become waifs and strays is that when they leave these schools they are not regarded as normally reared children.  They are regarded as children who have been in an industrial or reformatory school and that stigma is going to remain with them forever.  Personally, I should prefer to see the whole present system of reformatory and industrial schools scrapped; that homes should be provided for these children in the country and that they should be regarded as children of the primary and secondary schools who were guests at the expense of the State because their own people were not able to provide for them.  They should never be classed as children who were only lucky to escape being in the position of the unfortunate child who steals something and has to be brought before a court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> I think Deputies are terribly afraid of district justices.  In the main most of the district justices I have any experience of are more than reasonable in dealing with these cases and, to my mind, very often are somewhat too lenient in listening to parents' pleas, because there is a certain type of parent in this country who can go into the district court against an application for committal and tell the finest tale that could be told in that court, and the moment the child is released that child will be treated as badly as ever.  I do not think district justices err on the side of harshness.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Allen that it is entirely useless for the county council to be represented by their solicitor when a committal order comes before the court.  It is not the function of the local authority to oppose the committal order.  In my opinion it should be the duty of the local authority, if there were even the slightest rumour or the slightest suspicion that children were not being properly looked after, or not being properly treated, or that their parents were in any way destitute, to have the matter investigated at once, rather than oppose an application by the Guards in the district court.  Nobody is looking after these children, and unless some good person sends for the &ldquo;cruelty man&rdquo; in the country areas they think nothing is ever done about them.  The local Guards cannot interfere unless some one comes along and makes a definite complaint.  Even in this Bill the question of the consent of the parent is wiped out in every case except one, the one case in which it should have been wiped out.  It is retained, according to this explanatory memorandum, in the case referred to as (h)&mdash;where a child is found destitute and is not an orphan, and his parents are or his surviving parent or, in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother is unable to support him.  That is the one case, which is a pure case of destitution alone.</P>
    <P>In this country at the moment there is an extraordinary problem in rural areas that is entirely apart from our ordinary mode of life.  There is a certain class in the country who are not even tinkers, as they were known years ago, but who are purely and simply <Col N="1133" /> tramps.  They never attempt to do any work.  They do not even attempt to earn a living in the way of dealing, as many hard-working people do who travel the roads, but there is a particular class developing who are to my mind destitute, as far as the children they have are concerned at any rate, because whatever they have, or whatever they get, is generally spent on drink.  They are hawking unfortunate children and babies all over the country and apparently no attempt is ever made to deal with these unfortunate children.  They walk the roads from town to town until the father and mother are caught so gloriously drunk that the Guards have to arrest them. There is quite a number of these people through the country.  They make no attempt to earn a living; they will not hold a horse for five minutes for anybody. They travel from town to town with little children in their arms, who are possibly an excuse for singing a song occasionally in the streets. Nothing is done until they come to the stage that they are so incapacitated that the Guards have to arrest them.</P>
    <P>We have still got the mid-Victorian idea that the unfortunate children of the poor are a burden on the State. They are not.  We are treating them as a burden, and wishing to God they were not there, but as they are there we have to do something about them. We still carry on the idea of industrial schools and reformatories without any attempt to look at the situation from a really Christian outlook, and to realise that these children are as much entitled to every benefit the State can give as the children of well-off parents. They should be treated as the guests of the State in schools provided by the State, and given at least a fifty-fifty chance with the children of parents who can afford to support them.  These unfortunate children are taken away from their parents and are reared with the stigma of the industrial school attached to them.  When a boy leaves such a school, he is pointed to as a lad from an industrial school.  We will have to get away from that idea, and we will not get away from it by tinkering with the Children Act, 1908.  I do not see that in this Bill there is any advance from that Act except, to use the expression <Col N="1134" /> of the Minister, what one may call drafting amendments.</P>
    <P>On the question of licensing, the Minister's amendment is intended to empower the Gárdaí to bring back persons to the schools from which they were conditionally released where the conditions of the licence are not carried out.  He gives the Gárdaí power to bring them back, but who has the power of saying whether they ought to be brought back or not?  They are out on licence; who is going to decide that the conditions of the licence are not carried out?  Is it the local Gárda authorities?  If it is, that is creating, to my mind, a sort of court of appeal over the heads of the people who allow the child out.  I can understand the Gárdaí bringing back a child without any authority in the circumstances where a child was sent out to a certain place to learn a trade, and where the Gárdaí found the child was not being treated properly.  They would be entitled to take the child back.  If it is a question of a breach of a licence by the child, I could imagine a child being sent out and apprenticed to a trade when he was treated badly&mdash;the Gárdaí did not know he was being badly treated, but the child himself knew&mdash;and he decided to leave that master and to say he would not work with him any longer.  Would that be a breach of the licence that would empower the Gárdaí to bring him back? The child might say: &ldquo;I have been sent out; I do not wish to break my licence; the person I have been sent to has broken it; I merely want my case looked into and my position improved. You have not improved my circumstances. Will you come along and do something better for me?&rdquo;  I can understand the Gárdaí having power to bring the child back if he was being badly treated or if he was not being taught his trade, but I wish the Minister would clarify the case as regards breach of licence by the child himself.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister does not suggest that this Bill is to be the final word in the matter of Children Acts in this House for a long time.  I wonder would the Minister say that some day or other&mdash;without appointing a commission; the commission was appointed long ago and the result is not <Col N="1135" /> very obvious&mdash;we will face up to the position in this country that destitute children will have to be treated as ordinary children and not, as it practically amounts to, semi-potential criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that this Children Bill is not wider in its scope.  I should like to know if the Minister has consulted any of those who are concerned with the inspection of boarded-out children or any of the gentlemen dealing with the prevention of cruelty to children. Those people do a great deal of genuine social work in connection with children. I agree with most of what Deputy Allen mentioned in relation to public boards.  Boards of assistance have quite a lot to do with certain types of children.  Then there is another class, the illegitimate children who are sent out to foster parents and who may not come directly under the local boards of assistance.  These children are given over to foster parents, and in respect of them a sum of £50 or £60 is paid.  This amount is spread over four years, in instalments, and when the four years are up the children are thrown over on the public authority.  We have found that some of those children are not even baptised. We have also discovered that the births of some of them have not been registered.  A sad case was brought to my notice some time ago.  A boy was adopted by foster parents and brought to Cork.  When he tried to register at the local labour exchange he could not produce a birth certificate. His birth was not registered.  Recently three cases came under the notice of the Cork Board of Assistance and it was discovered that the children's births had not been registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also consider the cases of deaf and mentally defective children. There should be some home established where they can be taught useful knowledge. Many deaf children are sent to Dublin, and possibly other cities, and they become a burden on the local rates, because they are the children of poor parents.  I am in agreement with Deputy Linehan when he talks about the industrial school boy.  Last Friday a child came to me.  He had been <Col N="1136" /> working for a farmer not far from Cork City.  Not being able to get unemployment assistance, he was hopeful of obtaining home assistance.  He was quite conscious of his disability, because he said to me: &ldquo;I am out of the industrial school, sir.&rdquo;  He told me he was about four years out of the school.  He worked for a farmer and was in hospital for four months.  He believed that he got a cold when he was sleeping in an outhouse, and that cold developed to the extent that he had to go to hospital.  Apparently anything was good enough for that little fellow, because he happened to come from an industrial school.</P>
    <P>A case in Cork recently came to my notice where a mother died, leaving eight children.  There was some anxiety on the part of certain people to have the children put into industrial schools. Five of them were taken away and put into male and female industrial schools. Some of the industrial schools are anxious to get children.  The reason is very obvious, because they get 12/- or 12/6 a week for keeping the children. Where children are sent out by local authorities, all the foster parents get is 5/- a week, and possibly a suit of clothes every year.  If that amount were increased to 12/6, which is the sum you are paying to certain institutions in respect of the children they maintain, and if those children were sent to different places through the country where they would have decent persons looking after them, it would be much more desirable and I think it would be far better than sending them to industrial schools, where they would be mixing with different types of children.  I am not at all enamoured of the future of a good many of these children.  Last Saturday I was approached by the father and mother of a boy who was sent to an industrial school simply because he was not attending school regularly.  I find that it is a rather difficult job to get a boy out of an industrial school.  The parents are anxious to get this boy.  They have now changed into a corporation house and they want the child to live with them.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill simply leaves us in the same position as we have <Col N="1137" /> occupied for years.  I do not think that under its provisions we are going to change the outlook of the children in the industrial schools.  I am afraid there are still people in this country who have the mentality that anything is good enough for the little boy from the industrial school.  The Minister should get in touch with home assistance officers and those people who inspect boarded-out children.  A short time ago I met a lady from the Department who is engaged on the work of superintending children who are boarded out.  I thought she was an ideal person to have engaged on that work.  Her views as to how the children should be treated and the type of provision that should be made for them impressed me very much.  The men who are interesting themselves in the prevention of cruelty to children are doing valuable work, particularly in Cork City and County.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Linehan, I think it is most unfair that children or their parents should be obliged to go through the District Court for the purpose of industrial school committals.  There should be some means other than the District Court.  I observed in Dublin papers the other day that out of 1,500 children in industrial schools, over 900 never committed an offence.  That is a clear indication that the District Court is not the place to bring those children.  Very often the slum conditions under which many of the children are compelled to live are responsible for making them what they are.  I visited several industrial schools in the south of Ireland and I must say that these places are really ideal. Everything possible is done for the children.  At the same time, I do not like to see so many children herded together.  I would much rather that they were distributed through the country.  There are large numbers of people living in cottages and there are numbers of widows who, if they were given 10/- a week, would be very glad to keep a boy and would educate that boy the same as they would their own children.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I mentioned in the House that orphans are often adopted by people for sentimental reasons. <Col N="1138" /> These people get nothing at all towards the maintenance of the children.  I find that in cases where a man joins the Army, his wife, who may be a foster-mother, gets nothing at all for the child.  That bears out the view that we are inclined to look on certain classes of children as a burden on the State whereas we should be endeavouring to make them decent citizens.  These things are not dealt with in this Bill and they constitute some of the drawbacks I have in mind when I say that this measure should be made much wider.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one very sad case.  A man with a wife and eight children was in receipt of 23/- a week by way of assistance.  Out of that he had to pay 3/9 a week rent.  His wife died and 4/- was taken off the weekly assistance.  I should like to contrast that case with any industrial school where those in charge purchase food and other things in large quantities, and where very often the boys are competent enough to do various jobs.  Yet, you give 12/6 a week in respect of each boy.  When one makes a comparison between the lot of that unfortunate man with his eight children and the position in an industrial school, one is inclined to think that such a state of affairs is not worthy of our Government.</P>
    <P>On various occasions, and again to-day, I have urged that allowances for the dependents of unemployed persons should be increased.  Just contrast the position of the child of the unemployed man and the child in an industrial school.  It is time we changed our conception of what the child means to the nation.  I hope the Minister will make some effort to cover a wider field before this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne (Junr.)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in opening the debate, led us to believe that the question of hearing children's cases in court was a matter for the Department of Justice.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  If that be so, I think the least the House might expect from the Minister is a statement that he has been bringing pressure to bear on the Department of Justice for <Col N="1139" /> the setting-up of separate children's courts throughout the country because that was one of the major recommendations of the Cussen Commission which, I am sure every member will agree, produced a very excellent report.  The report stated &ldquo;that the practice of hearing children's cases within the pre-cints of the ordinary courts is objectionable&rdquo;. That appears in their report in black and white, and they strongly recommended that corresponding arrangements to those in Dublin should be made throughout the country. I think the Minister ought to give the House an assurance that these arrangements will be made forthwith because already four years have elapsed since the report of the commission was presented.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should also let the House know what has happened to very many of the recommendations of the commission which he has not implemented in this Bill.  In paragraph 51 they recommended that the term &ldquo;committal order&rdquo; should be abolished, and suggested instead the words &ldquo;admission order&rdquo;.  Paragraph 52 of the report stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We recommend also that the justice, when hearing children's cases, should not wear his robes of office, and that Gárdaí, whether acting as escorts or drivers, should not wear uniform when bringing children to the school.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters, I think, which come within the scope of the Minister's Department, and I think that this is the appropriate stage to let the House know what the Minister's proposals are in regard to them.  The commission also stated that they considered the system of boarding out capable of extension in suitable cases.  As far as I know, the system of boarding out has not been extended in the intervening years, and, on this Bill, I think we should hear from the Minister what his views on that matter are.  In paragraph 62 the commission recommended that the existing title of &ldquo;industrial schools&rdquo; be abolished, and they suggested as an alternative that they should be called &ldquo;national boarding schools&rdquo;.  In the next paragraph they <Col N="1140" /> recommended that the term &ldquo;reformatory schools&rdquo; be abolished in favour of the term &ldquo;approved schools&rdquo;.  Reference has been made on numerous occasions to the stigma that attaches to reformatory or industrial schools, but to a great extent that would diminish or disappear if these recommendations were adopted.  The commission further recommended that each school should be named individually, and that the terms &ldquo;national boarding schools&rdquo; and &ldquo;approved schools&rdquo; should be used for administrative purposes only.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission dealt at great length with the question of training.  They stated that the training in the schools was for the most part unsatisfactory, the boys apparently being regarded as juvenile labourers. That is a most unsatisfactory position. I should like to know from the Minister whether the position has improved in the meantime, and if not, what he proposes to do about it.  In paragraph 130, dealing with the question of supervision and after-care, the commission recommend the discontinuance of the present &ldquo;licence form&rdquo; and its replacement by a &ldquo;school certificate&rdquo; showing the standard of education reached and particulars of any specialised training received, and a &ldquo;certificate of discharge&rdquo; on which should be indicated the right to return to the school as well as the liability to recall. I recognise that, in order to implement these recommendations, it may not be necessary to legislate specifically for them in this Bill; at the same time, I think this is the appropriate stage for the Minister to say what he proposes to do in regard to these matters, which are very important, as is indicated by the fact that the commission dwelt at such great length on them.  Another very important recommendation of the Cussen Commission was that the minimum period of detention in a reformatory school should be two years, instead of three years, and that it should not extend in any case beyond the age of 19 years.  The Minister has adopted that recommendation.  Personally, I do not see the necessity for any minimum.</P>
    <P>I believe that there should be no minimum, and that the justice should be in a position where the offence is very slight&mdash;it may be a little more <Col N="1141" /> than &ldquo;mitching from school&rdquo;&mdash;to commit the offender to a reformatory school for six months, nine months or a year.  It is proposed in this Bill to reduce the minimum to two years, but I would seriously suggest to the Minister that the minimum should be altogether abolished, or at least that it should be reduced to six months.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of the rights of parents in connection with this Bill.  I explained in my opening address that there was no interference with the principle laid down in the 1929 Act, that where children were committed on the grounds of destitution the Minister had no option but to release the children, or to order their discharge, once he was satisfied that the parent or parents were in a position to support the child or children.  I cannot understand, therefore, the misapprehension that Deputies seemed to have in mind.  If they look at the top of page 4 of the Bill they will find the following provision at the end of Section 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided also that if an application is made to the Minister for Education by the parent or surviving parent or, in the case of an illegitimate child, the mother of a child, committed on the grounds stated in paragraph (h) to a certified industrial school for the discharge from such school of such child, the said Minister shall, if satisfied that the persons or person making such application are or is able to support such child, order such discharge of such child.</P>
      <P>I hope that is quite clear.  In every case that comes before me, or in every case that will come before any other Minister for Education, so long as this provision remains the law of the land, the Minister has no option whatever except to order the discharge of the child, once he is satisfied that the parent or parents are in a position to maintain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anything in the Bill is in conflict with the Constitution. We heard a good deal, however, of the rights of parents.  I have not heard any reference, unfortunately, in the <Col N="1142" /> course of the debate to the duties of parents.  I cannot believe but that members of the Dáil know that juveniles are being brought constantly, and in fairly large numbers, before the courts in this country.  We are living also in a rather disturbed period.  We do not know what the future may hold even for our own country, and, in bringing in this legislation, I must say that personally I have been disposed to regard the position so far as juveniles are concerned as rather serious.</P>
    <P>I am not going to make any alarmist statement as I deprecate alarmist statements; but if Deputies are not acquainted with the position from personal experience they have only to go to the probation officers, the officers of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, or representatives of other well-known organisations, such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, who have opportunities of going amongst the people and who make a special study of this subject and therefore have first-hand information.</P>
    <P>What the Constitution actually says in Article 42, paragraph 5, is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My only interest in this matter is to see that the interests of the child are safeguarded, and, while I am Minister for Education, feeling that I have a special responsibility towards those children, to recommend to the Dáil whatever steps I consider necessary to amend the law so as to make better provision in their regard.  The courts, as Deputy Linehan pointed out, are manned by our countrymen, justices and judges, who pride themselves on being the servants of the Irish people and who, like ourselves, are anxious to do the very best they can for the people.  I have not the slightest fear but that our justices are animated by <Col N="1143" /> the deepest motives of humanity and that when they do commit children to industrial schools it is only because there is no other solution.  It may be that the parents are unable to support the children.  It may be that the family circumstances are such that it would be impossible to expect the parents to bring up the children properly.  It may be that for reasons for which the members of the family cannot be blamed, it is not fitting that the children should be left in their present environment. It may happen that parental control is insufficient or that the child is going with bad associates.  The court has to take all these things into consideration. The court has the advantage of having, as I have said, first-hand information from the representatives of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and from its own officers, the probation officers. I have read some of the reports of these officers in these cases and I have been impressed by the sympathy they have shown, the understanding of the difficulties and, above all, the acquaintance with and first-hand knowledge they have of the actual circumstances. I am quite convinced that it is a most important matter and a most useful instrument in the administration of the law that the court should be able to call upon those probation officers for their opinion.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that this is the first Bill dealing with this matter, except the short Bill in 1929, which has been introduced since 1908.  In Great britain legislation has been introduced since, but I think, generally speaking, that the 1908 Act, as Deputy Benson pointed out, has stood the test very well.  In its main provisions it seems to be still quite sound.  Reference has been made to matters for which I am not responsible.  As I explained, this measure is based on the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into reformatory and industrial schools.  As regards the general question of the courts, that would be a matter for the Minister for Justice, just as the question of boarded-out children would seem to be a matter for the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> With regard to the feeling that some Deputies have about a stigma on children who have been in industrial schools, I cannot quite understand that.  I think it should be fairly well known that the vast majority of the children in industrial schools, as was mentioned here, have not been charged with any offence and any persons who take it upon themselves to insinuate that there is a brand or stigma on industrial school children are entirely ignorant, as well as being very malicious and very unchristian.  In the year 1939-40, 37½ per cent. of the committals were on the ground of &ldquo;destitution, not being an orphan and the parent or parents consenting to committal&rdquo;. Approximately 23 per cent. were on the ground of wandering, having no home, or having no parent or guardian, or parent and guardian exercising proper guardianship, 15 per cent. on grounds of begging or receiving alms, etc., 13 per cent. under the School Attendance Act, and less than 10 per cent. were charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment in the case of an adult&mdash;more than 50 per cent. of the latter being under 12 years.</P>
    <P>These figures will give the Dáil an idea of the serious nature and extent of this problem of destitute children. It is saddening to reflect that there are so many hundreds of children towards whose proper upbringing their parents can make no provision.  Failing any other solution, it is the duty of the State to see that as far as possible these children shall not suffer in consequence, but that they shall receive the care and protection which is their due. Now, that is the position.  The great majority of the cases are either cases of destitution or of offences which certainly are frequently not of a very serious character, but rather technical cases.  Ninety per cent. of the children are children against whom no offence, properly speaking, has been charged&mdash; no offence which would be punishable by imprisonment in the case of an adult.</P>
    <P>I have no desire, Sir, to get into a discussion as to the merits of court decisions in these cases.  I simply wish to say that parents have the right of advocacy <Col N="1145" /> in the court.  They have the right of appeal from the lower court if they are not satisfied with the justices' decision, and, as has been emphasised, and I should like to say it again, I think our justices are very reasonable, common-sense, humane gentlemen.  I am not sure that it has been the case to have children committed for a first offence&mdash;in any case, it is outside my province&mdash;but it sometimes happens that you have gangs, and, unfortunately, the children, who may not be the worst offenders, get caught in connection with these gangs, and the justice may have to have regard to the general position if there are serious cases of gang operations in the area or if the previous history of the child denotes that he has come under observation, though he has not actually been charged; or again, from the information which the justice has through the probation officer or through the officers of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, he may commit the child.  I do not think it is usual to do so, but I think it need not be assumed that it is by way of punishing the child that the justice commits him.  I think we ought rather to assume that it is in order to protect the child, to see that it is properly cared for, that its education, its upbringing, its health, are placed in the charge of some responsible person where the parents, for one reason or another, are unable to fulfil their duty.  I think that is the attitude we ought to take up, and in any case we ought to remember that it is only in very exceptional cases, and where there are good and adequate reasons, that children are brought before the court.  It is claimed that the tendency of this Bill is against the parent.  I think it would be more correct&mdash;although I do not subscribe to the view&mdash;if those who urged that particular argument would say that the tendency of the Bill is against a parent who is not fulfilling his duty or her duty where his or her child is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of supervision, the raising of the age during which the child or the young person is to be supervised is only in <Col N="1146" /> special cases such as, for example, orphans.  Instances occur occasionally of young persons, between the ages of 18 or 19 and 21, who have no guardians or parents, and who are unfairly treated by employers.  Power is taken by the school manager to bring such young persons back to the school and find employment for them.  Often, these young people come back to the school quite regularly when their employment terminates for some reason or another.  Each school has its own arrangements.  The manager maintains touch with the person under supervision directly, and possibly also through the local parish priest or through local religious or social organisations.</P>
    <P>It is a very delicate matter to arrange how supervision can properly be carried out.  I wonder does anybody in the House seriously suggest that the State could step in and carry out this work of supervision, even with an elaborate and costly organisation, in a better way than the religious Orders can?  These Orders have a certain approach towards this matter.  They are animated by a spirit of Christian charity.  Their sole desire is to improve the lot of the child, to help the boy or girl to get employment, and to do what they can for them; and while it is difficult for the managers of the schools to keep in touch with the children in all cases, I know that in the vast majority of cases they exert the greatest earnestness and energy in trying to maintain touch with the children.</P>
    <P>Licensing or conditional release is a safeguard for the child, and merely enables the school to recall the child. Sometimes the child is released before the normal period of detention, and the issue of a licence is intended to enable the child to be recalled without bringing him before the court again. Children or young persons would be only recalled from supervision where the manager or the Minister, according as the child was under licence or under conditional release, found it necessary to recall it.  Either the manager or the Minister, having considered the question, would issue instructions, which would be carried out by the Gárdai, for the bringing back of the child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> It is true that children who go to industrial schools are separated from their parents, but children who go to boarding schools&mdash;the secondary schools throughout the country&mdash;are separated from their parents also, and if we could get away from the idea of looking on these schools as penal institutions, and looking on them instead, as the commission recommended, as boarding schools, we would be able to view the matter in a more sensible light.  In fact, these children are only away from their parents for a comparatively short period in the life of a child, a shorter period than that of a great many children, who spend years at secondary boarding schools, have to spend away from their parents; and while I thoroughly agree, as every Irish person will, that we ought not to interfere with family relationships or to intrude except where it is absolutely necessary, I deprecate the sentimentality which often attaches to this question.  Let us recognise that the children who are being brought away are very often getting substantially the same treatment as children in boarding schools where their parents are paying for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of a particular industrial school, carried on in very close contiguity to a secondary school, by the same Order, and if Deputies were to visit these two schools in the morning they would agree with me that there is very little difference indeed between the treatment the children get in the industrial school and the treatment the others get in the secondary school.  I do not think, either, that Deputy Hickey was fair to himself in suggesting that it was for the sake of the money allowance, and only for the sake of the money allowance, that managers of industrial schools are interested in having the children.  Surely, they are interested in it, and have always been and always will be, because they are interested in the welfare of the children, because they feel that the children are not <Col N="1148" /> getting a fair crack of the whip, so to speak, at present, and that they can really do something for them to improve and help them and put them in the way to earn their own living later on.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Hannigan that the inspection of these schools is being constantly carried on.  I am quite satisfied that improvement is being made.  Managers have shown themselves willing on all occasions to accept suggestions from our inspectors, both the inspectors who visit for the purpose of seeing the technical training and those who inspect the elementary education; and our medical inspector informs me that she is very well satisfied with the conditions of the schools from the point of view of the health of the children and the way in which they are cared for and looked after.  Each school has its own medical officer and its own arrangements for the treatment of illness, and in almost every case there is also provision for dental treatment.  I do not think there is any other matter to which it is necessary to refer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Defence a number of questions to-day dealing with the method of recruiting labour for employment in <Col N="1149" /> the Defence Forces at Bere Island. These questions followed questions of a similar kind asked in this House on November 7th and, in my judgment, and from the information I received, the story of employment in the Defence Forces on Bere Island is a story of rank political discrimination over the last two years.  As I stated in a letter which I sent to the Minister some days ago, it is generally known in Berehaven, and the information I have will put the House in possession of a number of points, that nobody will get any employment there except the application is approved by the local branch of Fianna Fáil and a member of the Government Party sitting for the constituency.  The Minister explained that the men employed on Bere Island are not recruited through the labour exchange.  I see no reason why they could not be recruited through the labour exchange and, in reference to the Minister's point, that care has to be exercised in the selection of men for defence work, I think it would be quite easy for the officer in charge to ascertain through any local inquiries that are necessary, whether there would be any danger existing in the employment of any men sent from the exchange.  It would be quite easy to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I venture to suggest that such a thing could not occur in a comparatively small island, where the people are known to each other, and where their principal object is to get a living, and that is hard enough under any conditions.  There should be no difficulty whatever in that respect.  I join issue with the Minister on the point that there is any local power vested in the military officer in charge to recruit labour, because my information is that repeated applications to the officer in charge at Bere Island show that there was no power conferred on him for that purpose, and that application had to be made direct to the Department of Defence.  I have endeavoured in this matter to get independent evidence, and for that purpose I asked the views of somebody in Bere Island with whom I have no political connection whatever, and no possible contact, except that I was given the name of a <Col N="1150" /> reputable man on the island who, in the old days suffered a good deal because of his efforts to help the movement to secure a national Government. He seems to me to be quite an impartial person, having no connection with any effort to secure employment, being an entirely detached observer.  I ask the permission of the House to quote from a letter that I received in reply to my request. It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...I wish to let you know that it would not be easy for me to explain in detail how the employment is arranged on the D.O.D. works here.  In the first place all the men employed are members of a political club.  No others need apply.  That is certain....  Younger men capable of doing the same work and who were trusted to help in the fight for freedom, and who have now young families are not nominated for employment because they do not belong to this political organisation.  The chairman of this club is in supreme command and if you are not a friend of his, even though you were a good man, you could go hungry and, of course, the family as well....  There are two political clubs on the island and it is funny to see the chairman of one club on top of a ladder putting on a slate on a military house and the chairman of the other club attending on him....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The story goes on in that way.  As far as I could get information that state of affairs has been going on for 12 months.  That is the evidence of a man who was not looking for employment, and who has no interest in the matter except to see fair play as regards employment.  The Minister in reply to a supplementary question to-day also declined to institute an inquiry into this matter.  I asked the Minister why there was any objection to having such an inquiry.  If the story that I told is true then it represents a state of affairs that ought to be remedied.  If there is no foundation for the story then the ventilation that it will get in public will certainly do no harm, but will do a great deal of good.  None of us has any desire to <Col N="1151" /> see charges of this kind made except they are founded on facts.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied, from all the evidence I have got, that the charges in the questions were not over-stated in any way, but represent what has been the normal position on Bere Island for the last two years.  The Minister also stated on a supplementary question to-day that men were recruited for employment there on the recommendation of Deputies and other responsible persons.  Speaking with the authority of Deputy O'Neill, Deputy O'Donovan and on my own behalf, I must say that there is not a single man in employment on Bere Island as the result of any recommendation from us.  I am quite free in the matter, because I never made a recommendation of any kind.  Possibly that would apply also to the other Deputies.  So far as employment there as a result of representations by Deputies is concerned, not one of the three Deputies for West Cork, who are not members of the Government Party, is responsible for the employment of a single man on defence works on Bere Island.  I propose to quote briefly from a letter received by an individual applicant for employment.  One man applied for employment frequently over the last two years and got a reply in identical terms from time to time.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed...to refer to your letter of the...regarding employment and to inform you it is regretted that there is no suitable vacancy which could be offered to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that particular case the man was employed by the Admiralty, the predecessors of the present Government on Bere Island, for some years.  So far as I can ascertain, he was a competent workman&mdash;a workman against whom no complaint whatever existed and one who, in the old days, though in employment with the British Admiralty, risked his employment and liberty by assisting indirectly&mdash;as he could&mdash;the national cause in this country.  That man has found that, though he has <Col N="1152" /> received letters of that kind frequently, it has been nothing unusual for him to see, three or four days afterwards, nine or ten men employed.</P>
    <P>In the case of another man, he received one letter on the 1st April, 1940, to state that it was regretted there were no vacancies which could be offered to him.  That man holds a military certificate, I understand; his brother was connected with the Flying Column in West Cork in the old days; the man himself was on the run during portion of the years 1920 and 1921 and was on of a family exceedingly active and one of the few families who at that time were active in Bere Island in connection with the national struggle. That man has been refused over and over again.  He has been told openly the reason&mdash;there is no false modesty about the reason in Bere Island&mdash;it is because he has declined to join the local branch of the Fianna Fáil Party. If he decided to drop any scruples he has in that respect, there would be no difficulty in securing employment for him immediately.</P>
    <P>Another letter is from a man who says he applied on several occasions for employment on the Department of Defence works on Bere Island and on each occasion received a reply in the following terms: they regretted they were unable to offer him any post and could not hold out any hope that they would in the future.  Since that, however, between 20 and 30 men have been employed on the works, yet his name has not been included.  He states also that the officer in charge of the works would be anxious to make a vacancy for him if the local Fianna Fáil club would nominate him, which they have failed to do.  This man has a wife and family and is a reliable workman, and the local view is that he has been badly treated.  These letters go on in the same strain and there are quite a number of others.  There is one very notable case in the island, who is very deserving of employment and for whom an appeal was made locally by a responsible person on the island to a Government Deputy for West Cork. The answer was that the man would not be employed because &ldquo;he is not <Col N="1153" /> one of our men&rdquo;.  Again, the person who gave that answer was quite frank, when he said: &ldquo;Our own men first; there can be no employment for people of this kind until our own men are placed.&rdquo;  There are a certain number of people of that kind who have been completely barred from employment. Another case is that of a man who had the temerity to act as a polling agent for another political Party about two years ago and that indiscretion has cost him employment since.  As far as the Department of Defence is concerned, he has not got one day's employment on the works since that time.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is a particularly sordid story.  I could understand it if the viewpoint was that, in this matter of employment, the spoils ought to go to the victors.  That is the viewpoint in Bere Island.  There has been no disguising of that.  It seems to have been made perfectly clear to all and sundry that the victors are in possession and that consequently the spoils are theirs.  There have been allegations of gross and rank political discrimination in this particular connection. I can only conclude that the Minister is entirely unaware of the facts, in view of the terms of his reply to me to-day.  All the inquiries that one can make in this connection&mdash;and I invite the Minister to make any inquiries he wishes to make&mdash;point to one conclusion, definitely and clearly.</P>
    <P>There are certain rather picturesque results arising from this method of selection.  Certain people there rank as bricklayers and tradesmen of various kinds.  I understand that the local secretary of Fianna Fáil ranks for that purpose as a bricklayer and that his qualifications for that trade are about as complete as my own.  He has no knowledge whatever of it: he blossomed into a bricklayer in recent years and holds his position by virtue of the fact that he is the local secretary of Fianna Fáil.  It seems to me&mdash;and this is again borne out by local enquiries&mdash; that when the post was handed over by the British, a completely clean sweep was made of all and every person employed there whose viewpoint <Col N="1154" /> was not in accordance with the viewpoint of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I have concluded from the evidence I have got before me that the statements I have made are correct.  The Minister has a different point of view. I can only suggest that the Minister has been misinformed in this matter and that he has not got the full facts. I suggest that there is one way of getting the facts and proving that the information I got is wrong or, on the other hand, that the Minister has been misinformed; and that that way is by holding some inquiry, to satisfy the local people, who feel they have been completely shut out from any contact with anybody able to obtain fair play and justice in this country.  The only way is an inquiry into the whole matter, to find out the facts, to find out why men who are eligible for unemployment assistance cannot get work there, and to find out if the Minister is right or wrong.  As I am informed, he is wrong.  It is suggested that men employed there must be registered at the labour exchange, but I am informed that a number of people employed there were not registered at the labour exchange, and could not be regarded in any circumstances as eligible for receipt of unemployment assistance.  I ask the Minister to have this matter enquired into and to end a state of affairs there, that redounds to the entire discredit of the Department. One can understand&mdash;and I think one could pardon&mdash;a certain amount of sympathy with political friends in this matter, but nobody could justify a complete sweep of every particle of employment there, to the exclusion of everybody except members of one Party.</P>
    <P>There are two branches of Fianna Fáil in Bere Island, and I am informed that all the work available there is divided between a Deputy for the constituency and the local branches, and there is no opportunity for anybody else.  That is an intolerable and tyrannical state of affairs, if it exists, and the only way that matter can be examined is by giving publicity to it and then arranging some sort of inquiry into it.  I ask now that the <Col N="1155" /> Minister institute that inquiry in the interests of fair play.  If I am proved wrong, I will apologise very fully for, unwittingly, misleading the House.  If the Minister is proved wrong, then his duty as a Minister of State is to put this matter right and to ensure that this sordid chapter in Bere Island is ended.</P>

      <P>There are really only nine, to my knowledge, who are members of Fianna Fáil, while 13 or 14 belong to the other political Party. I have recommended men to the Minister whom I considered to be suitable for such employment: men who were good men in the past.  I want to state definitely that many of those who were given recommendations were men who did not belong to the Party that I represent.  I have no apology to offer to anybody for doing that.

    <P>I consider it is my duty to recommend to any Department men whom I consider suitable in that respect.  That is a privilege that has been used by many members of this House at all times.

Of the total number of men <Col N="1156" /> employed at any time I can state very definitely that the members of the Fianna Fáil organisation were always in a minority, and are still.  I did not recommend all the men who are working there.  I recommended men, irrespective of what Party they belonged to, and I did so because they were good men in the past and are good men now, and, as I have said, I offer no apology for doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Murphy that the necessity for securing reliable men to work within the precincts of military works did not originate in this Party.  It was operated before this Party secured control of Governmental organisations, and it was as necessary then, as it is now, to see that the people employed within the precincts of military works were people upon whom reliance could be placed.  It is also correct for me to say that the lists were prepared within the Department of Defence.  They were prepared from names submitted by Deputies and by other reliable people such as local councillors, local shopkeepers, or persons of that type.  They gave recommendations for employment to certain individuals whom they thought they could strongly recommend.  Deputy O'Sullivan is the man who submitted the recommendations to me.  I can see no reason why any other Deputy should not have availed of that opportunity as well.  Deputies meet me to discuss various subjects.  I try to facilitate them all, and there is no reason why they should not do the same on this particular subject if they thought it well to do so.  Now, there is no power vested in the O.C. or in the engineering officer to employ any of those men who apply direct to them for work; but there is this power vested in the engineering officer, that if he finds men are unsuitable for the class of work which he wants to engage them on, he need not employ them, and does not, in fact, always employ them, because he does not deem them sufficiently suitable. On that, I hope that in what I am about to say I am not misquoting what Deputy Murphy said.  The Deputy made a statement which, if it was intended in the way it was made, would <Col N="1157" /> be a slur on the engineering officer on the island, inasmuch as he stated, I think, that there was a bricklayer employed there who was not, in fact, a bricklayer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say here as definitely as I can that, whenever an officer in a military works&mdash;it does not matter in what part of the country&mdash; tells me that a man is unsuitable either from the point of view of the work that he is engaged on, or because the officer is suspicious in respect of the man's movements, I have on every single occasion endorsed the view that that man should be removed from the precincts of the military works.  I have consistently done that.  I want to assure the House, further, that I have never inquired into, and do not intend to inquire into, the politics of any individual whose name is sent forward to me for that particular type of work. I do not want the House to believe for a second that, when Deputy O'Sullivan sends me a recommendation on behalf of some individual, I am going immediately to believe that he is a political opponent of mine.  Deputy O'Sullivan has stated to me what he has now repeated in the House, that on a recent occasion four people whose names he sent forward were opponents of his in politics, but they were men who, as he has stated, had given good service in the past, and because they had given good service in the past he did not discriminate between them.  In this particular case, the men whose names he sent forward were, in fact, employed. I cannot say whether or not that is a fact, but I am prepared to believe that Deputy O'Sullivan would do that.  I do not know whether the <Col N="1158" /> House is prepared to agree with me. Deputy Murphy spoke of the difficulty of young men securing employment on the island.  It has always been my policy to employ, as far as possible, married men with families, because I think it is a fair and proper policy: the policy of the greater good of the greater number.  I have done that, and, as far as I can, I shall always do it.</P>
      <P>I do not think any case has been made by the Deputy for a public inquiry into this.  If the Deputy can produce evidence to me that is not mere hearsay&mdash;what he recited here to-night was something that he heard from somebody else, that somebody else had been told by another person&mdash; but if evidence can be produced of any case that should be examined, then I give this guarantee to the House, that I will have it examined.  If action has to be taken I can assure the Deputy and the House that I will have no hesitation whatever in taking any necessary action that I should take.  I do not think I can go further than that. I stated here last week, arising out of the debate on the question of employment at Haulbowline, that I was prepared to take certain action which was suggested by Deputies in the House. If necessary I am prepared to apply that in this case, too.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Murphy has not been entirely misinformed, I am quite certain of this: that a grossly exaggerated case has been made to him in respect to employment at Bere Island.  He referred to a case that was the subject of a letter he sent to me. I do not know whether it is fair for me to mention this, but the Deputy did mention the fact that he sent me a letter.  If the Deputy desires to talk <Col N="1160" /> that over with me, I think I can satisfy him that we had no responsibility whatever for that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, as a result of a public inquiry held last July into the need of a water supply for Kinsale, a grant of £8,000 has been sanctioned towards the cost of the scheme, and, if so, whether he will state:&mdash;(a) the date on which such grant was agreed to by his Department; (b) the date on which this decision was conveyed to the Local Government Department, and whether he is aware that the decision was communicated by his Department to certain members of the Government Party before it was made known to the Local Government Department or the chairman or engineer or town clerk of the Urban District Council of Kinsale; and whether it was with his sanction that this decision was so communicated prematurely.</P>

      <P>By minute of the 4th November, my Department informed the Department of Local Government and Public Health that a grant of £8,000 was approved towards the cost of the water supply scheme at Kinsale.  In accordance with the usual practice a copy of the minute was sent on the same day to the Parliamentary Secretary, who had recommended the grant.  On the 8th ultimo the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to enquiries on the subject from certain Cork Deputies, informed them that a grant had been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that information of this kind has been given by the Parliamentary Secretary's office in many dozens of cases to Deputies of all Parties as a much more desirable alternative <Col N="1015" /> to enquiries made by means of Parliamentary questions.  Such information has been given in the same way to the Deputy himself.  Every possible means is used in the Parliamentary Secretary's office to prevent employment grants being used for political advantage and the office has no knowledge that the information given in this instance was so used.</P>
