      <P>The amount of money in the Hospitals Trust Fund at present is approximately £8,500,000. A sum of at least £3,500,000 will be required for endowment of voluntary hospitals.  This amount may have to be increased if the upward trend of deficits in the accounts of voluntary hospitals cannot be checked.  About £1,000,000 is required for the completion of works in progress, including voluntary hospitals and local authority institutions.  The balance is ear-marked for new voluntary hospitals in Dublin and for the provision of institutions in counties where the need is most urgent.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy pressing the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When we adjourned on Friday last I was endeavouring to convert the Minister to my point of view with regard to committees of mental hospitals.  The Bill proposes that the committees of mental hospitals will in future be regarded only as visiting committees. The case I was making against that was that as visiting committees they are not going to attend at all.  The committes will be scattered over very wide areas; the General Hospitals Committee of Management will form a visiting committee and I cannot imagine people 30 or 40 miles away from a hospital&mdash;as is the case in Ballinasloe&mdash;attending individually at their own expense as members of a visiting committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that there ought to be some committee retained for the purpose of keeping contact between the administration and the manager, that is, between the local authorities and the manager.  As far as mental hospitals are concerned, in the future we will have nothing, if this Bill is passed, except the R.M.S. and the manager controlling the mental hospital themselves.  There will be no contact or link between them and the local authorities whatever except that the local authorities will have to provide the money.  I do not think that is good administration.  I do not think that is going to make for better working of <Col N="1030" /> these hospitals.  Most of them are very big institutions and if we throw our minds back we will find that they are giving more trouble in a way than any other hospitals.  Perhaps that is not to be wondered at, but I think that the Minister ought to be very slow to sever the contacts between these hospitals and the local authorities.  I am consequently asking that the committees be retained in some shape or form as committees and that they be called together at least a certain number of times in the year, say, four times, or as many times as the Minister may think it wise to call them together.  The Minister has the power to make regulations under another section and he can prescribe what duties will be assigned to them, but I think it would be very bad for the administration if the Minister were to wipe out all the contacts he has between the administration of the mental hospitals and the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy knows that the county council will more or less step into the position of the mental hospital committees.  The Deputy refers to the making of rules. What is contemplated in the making of these rules is provision on these lines &mdash;for regular visitation of the mental hospitals; for the keeping of minutes; for reporting complaints to the county councils; for inspection of dietaries, qualities of several commodities supplied, et cetera; for inquiring into matters specially referred to them; for examining the means of occupation and for examining the means of recreation. It is contemplated that when these committees visit the mental hospitals it is not simply to get or inquire about complaints.  They will have to see what way the hospital is run; they will have to see what condition the hospital is in, whether it is in need of repairs or anything of that sort, and report back to the county council.  I think the county council will find that it is in a much better position than it was in many instances in the past.  I think that the position, for example, of public assistance bodies was that when they made out the <Col N="1031" /> amount of their estimate they referred it to the county council and I think that was a demand which the county council had to accept.  In the matter of a mental hospital the estimate will come up to the county council and the council members will be the people who will have to say whether they are satisfied that that demand is reasonable or that they want to have an inquiry made into any particular matter affecting that estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House ought to be given some information by the Minister with regard to those rules which he is empowered to prescribe. The Minister says he can do certain things.  I think he ought to take the House into his confidence and tell us what he is going to do because unless this committee is going to be retained for the purpose of holding meetings and their travelling expenses, as already allowed, at least allowed to them, there will be no meetings.  The Minister knows that perfectly well.  He ought to take us into his confidence. If he foresees something like that he is meeting my point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

The manager is responsible for that and we cannot take these executive powers from him.  We are prepared to go any distance to try and make them useful committees.  So far as having to attend at their own expense is concerned, I do not see why the members could not be allowed travelling expenses in the same way as they are allowed to county council members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the position in a joint committee?  Supposing one particular council may request the Minister to do certain things must they have the majority of those present? Take Grangegorman, for instance, where you have Wicklow, County Dublin, and the City of Dublin, and, say, County Dublin decides on a certain plan of action which is approved by their council and Wicklow County and Dublin City object.  Where they have a majority, what is the position of the Dublin County in that matter?</P>

      <Col N="1033" /> Amendments Nos. 91 and 92 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment standing in my name but perhaps it will not be necessary to move it. My chief worry about this was in regard to sub-section (4) which provides:</P>
      <P>The visiting committee of a district mental hospital shall not inquire into or receive any complaint or make any report in relation to the services, remuneration, privileges, superannuation, or compensation for loss of office of the officers and servants of such hospital or any of such officers or servants.</P>
      <P>I certainly do not want to interfere in any way with the executive duties of the manager, but very often there are other things arising between the officers themselves and I do not know that it is well for the Minister to cut that power out completely.  We have had, I think, more trouble with officers in mental hospitals than in any other place and committees have been very useful in getting to the bottom of things and settling them up.  If you are going to take the right to report complaints back you might be going too far.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the dissolution of boards of health and we take very serious objection to that proposal.  The functions of boards of health are such that, if carried out solely by a manager, they will lack that human touch which is so much evidenced in the work of boards of health.  There may be arguments, such as I have heard here, that boards of health occupy a considerable time in discussing very trivial matters.  I am not myself a member of a board of health but I have seen the system in operation, working expeditiously and well.  I have also knowledge that without that human touch which members of the board of health can impart in the discharge of their duties, and which will probably be lacking if the duties are discharged by a manager, the whole purpose and object of the boards of health will certainly suffer. The purpose of the section is to dissolve the boards of health and to transfer their functions to the manager. There is, I understand, an amendment <Col N="1036" /> down later on in the name of Deputy Norton which will probably give me more scope for discussing this matter.</P>

      <P>For the reason that I have given, I am objecting to this section.  I do not think that it is necessary to dissolve boards of health even to give the powers suggested in this Bill to the manager.  The boards of health with which I am acquainted are doing their work efficiently.  They possess, as I have said, that human touch in local affairs that a manager cannot have and will not have.  The proposal seems to be inspired by that idea of dictatorship which is underlying the whole Bill.  For that reason I strongly object to the section.</P>

      <P>I find it extremely difficult to approach this section at all. In the first place, I am not enamoured of the present boards of health but I think that something better might be found to supplant them than the system proposed in this Bill.  I am not at all in agreement with the method of replacing boards of health suggested in the Bill.  I am not at all satisfied that things will work out under the managerial system better than under the other system, and I think it would be almost impossible to supervise the multiple work connected with poor law and such matters.  I had hoped that, if we were going to make <Col N="1037" /> any reform in connection with poor law work in the counties it would be in the direction of something like the old district councils, but I think that putting the whole of that kind of work under a managerial system will lead to almost as great difficulties as the boards of health had formerly.  One of the greatest excuses that has been made for boards of health in latter years was that they were overloaded with work; many Deputies in this House from all sides have made that excuse&mdash;that the boards of health were overloaded with work and could not get through the work they had to do. Well, I do not see how the case is going to be better now, or how, let us say, one man can get through as much or more work than ten men.  I foresee many difficulties in connection with this section.  I do not propose to vote on the section, but I must say that I am not in agreement with it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 16, line 33, to delete the words &ldquo;enactment and.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down this amendment is this.  The section, as it stands, says that every enactment and every order in force at the commencement of this Act, in relation to councils of counties shall, subject to any order made by the Minister under this section, be construed and have effect with such modifications as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the Act so far as they relate to such councils.  Now, who is going to decide how far modifications may be made or what modifications are, in fact, necessary?  If we allow a sub-section like that to get into the Bill, <Col N="1039" /> are we not in fact giving legislative authority to the Minister himself?  If the Minister can modify enactments, without being subject to any other authority, is he not in fact modifying Acts of this House and, consequently, doing work which is, in fact, legislative work and work proper to this House?  Perhaps the Minister will explain what the position is, if I am not right in my assumption?</P>

      <P>Before paragraph 10, in page 18, to insert the following new paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10.  The administration of the Poor Law Acts.</P>

      <P>The Second Schedule sets out various matters in respect of the powers, functions and duties which are mentioned as the reserved functions of the council. They include the making of a rate, the borrowing of money, and so on. These are harmless kinds of things which were already included in the Acts introduced in 1929 and 1931, the Management Acts introduced by the last Administration.  I am not surprised that there is such unanimity on this Bill.  I am rather surprised, though, that the present Government have learned so quickly the policy and the ideas of the previous Administration with regard to local government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think they would learn in such a short time.  I was rather surprised, having in view <Col N="1043" /> the many protestations they made when the legislation to which I have referred was going through the House. One could scarcely imagine that in a few years, in less than ten years, they would completely change their views and their outlook with regard to local administration.  The Second Schedule contains a list of fairly harmless powers which are to be allotted to the local council&mdash;the making of a rate, the borrowing of money, and so on, just to give some semblance of popular sanction to the work of the manager.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the functions set out, which are really functions that should be carried out by a local authority, should be given to the local council. The administration of the Poor Law Acts is a very important function.  It is a function that appertains more to the human outlook of a body of local people than to the hard and fast Civil Service outlook of a manager.  As regards the administration of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, that again is a function that should be reserved to a body of local people who understand the conditions under which the inhabitants of an area live, and who are anxious to ameliorate these conditions.  The manager may not have the same outlook towards the housing of the people as would a local body composed of people who are in close touch with the residents of a district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have such things as the functions exercisable by a sanitary authority, the administration of the Tuberculosis Acts, the administration of the school medical services, the administration of the free milk scheme, and the Acts relating to the prevention and treatment of disease.  These are all functions that were suggested somewhere as functions which should be carried out by parish councils.  We hear a great lot of talk these days about the establishment of parish councils to deal with such local affairs as are outlined in the amendment.  Those functions are now to be reserved to the manager, and the functions of the county council, not to mind the functions of a parish council, will be nil, so that the whole thing seems to be a <Col N="1044" /> kind of paradox.  On the one hand, we hear the idea of a parish council preached about and extolled.  It is suggested that the local people would have greater touch with, and a more intimate knowledge of, the affairs of a locality than even a county council or a board of health.  If that is so, how is a manager, who has no contact with a locality, to know of the complaints and the hardships and grievances under which local people will still have to suffer.</P>
    <P>We submit that the functions which are outlined in this amendment should be reserved to the local council.  Surely it could not be said that these are executive functions which could only be carried out by a manager?  My contention is that they are functions which require an intimate knowledge of local affairs and conditions and that can only be possessed by a local council. The amendment is a reasonable one.  All through this Bill we have been met by an adamant attitude on the part of the Minister in respect to any amendment we put up.  I do not know what the reason is for such an attitude. I ask him seriously to take into consideration the effect of handing over those functions to a manager.  They should definitely be regarded as part and parcel of local administration.  I do not care whether it is going to be done through parish councils, boards of health or county councils, but this type of administration will require intimate knowledge which can only be possessed by local representatives.  The official attitude that a manager will adopt in such circumstances would be altogether out of place.  You may, of course, get managers who will have knowledge of the working of all the Acts that are enumerated here.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to prophesy that this Act will not remain in force very long. When the people observe how it is being operated and how their local affairs will be taken over by a local dictator, there will be a general outcry against it and definitely there will be a wiping out of this legislation.  I appeal to the Minister to leave those functions with the local body.  They are not functions that can be described as cutting across the principle of the Bill.  If they are to be successfully carried out, those <Col N="1045" /> functions must be administered by local representatives rather than by a manager.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's speech was very much like a Second Reading speech, but I suppose it can be accepted as somewhat relevant.  To my mind it cuts across the whole principle of the Bill.  There is no use in saying that in one way Labour is standing against this thing when we find that in another way it is not.  As a matter of fact, perhaps Labour was converted before we were converted to this idea of the managerial system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin, speaking in the Dáil on the 1st April, 1938 &mdash; columns 1395-97&mdash;said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have listened from time to time, both here and elsewhere, to discussions in regard to the merits and demerits of the managerial system.  I am of the opinion that some people, when discussing this matter, are too much inclined to think of the manager or the man instead of the merits or demerits of the system.  I listened last night to a Deputy, who does not know too much, I think, about the activities or work of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation, paying a proper tribute, in my opinion, to the managerial system as administered in that area. I imagine he speaks from hearsay, <Col N="1046" /> but as a ratepayer in that district and speaking from some intimate knowledge of how the managerial system has been administered in that area, I want to say that, in my opinion, it has been carried out on model lines.  It was administered in a quiet, calm way, without any bluster on the part of the manager, who was wise enough, although there was no obligation on him to do so, to consult the members of the council and to seek their advice on matters on which he was entitled to act on his own....  If the administration is going to be efficient, you must have one central head in charge, as you have in charge of Departments of State, the executive head of each being responsible to the political head of the Department.  I would not like to see, in the case of public concerns in this country, directors, whether a large or a small number of them, constantly interfering in the activities of the executive officers of the different departments.  There are certain concerns that I have some knowledge of, and I am aware that some of the members of the board would not know which was the right or the wrong end of a signal cabin. I would not like to see those people, as sometimes happened, interfering and giving deliberate instructions to the executive heads of a large public service such as that&mdash;to men with a lifetime of experience, men who know their business and hold their positions because they do know it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is enough to quote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that I think Deputy Davin's praise in that quotation is directed more to the manager than to the system?  Any time that I have spoken on this, I have always distinguished between the manager and the system. The manager is simply the mouthpiece of the machinery, but the system is dictatorship in local affairs.  We will probably have it in national affairs later.</P>

What I want to direct the Minister's attention to is that under a Public Assistance Act, passed some time ago, we made a lot of arrangements about other hospitals. In this mental hospitals only are referred to.  What I am anxious to know is what arrangements have been made with regard to other hospitals. Would ordinary medical and surgical hospitals come under the regulations to be made under this Bill?  I do not want a position to arise later by which the county councils will have certain authority with regard to admissions to mental hospitals, and will have no authority with regard to admissions to other hospitals.  I think the Minister ought to look into this and see if the position with regard to county councils is covered in the Public Assistance Act. It did not refer to the powers of county councils, but this Bill does.</P>

      <P>At the end of paragraph 11 (3) to insert the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided always that every person to whom this paragraph relates and who before the commencement of this Act was the secretary of the board shall, if he resigns his position as an officer of the council within two years after the date of his transfer to such office, be entitled to receive from the council an annual allowance for his life not exceeding two-thirds of the annual salary and emoluments to which, at the date of such resignation, he was entitled, and the council shall grant to such person an allowance of not less than three one-hundred-and-twentieths of such salary and emoluments for each year of his service in a pensionable <Col N="1050" /> office in the employment of any local authority prior to such resignation subject to the maximum mentioned in this proviso.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give secretaries of various boards, whose routine may be disturbed in some way through the working of this Bill, an opportunity of considering their position.  For instance, if the board of health for North Cork meets at Mallow, and if it was decided that it should go to the City of Cork, then the secretary of such a board, if he were an old man, would have a time limit of two years to decide.  If his energies or his health would not allow him to go he would have time to think about the position, and to see how he would be affected by the Bill.  I am sure the Minister agrees with the suggestion to give such people a chance to fit themselves into the new position, and if their health or energies would not permit them to do so, they should have an option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to give partial remission of rates on new residences completed within two years from the 1st October, 1939.  The remission, which is two-thirds of the full rates for a period of five years, or until the next general revision of valuations, whichever period is the shorter, will also be given in respect of the improvement of residences.  It is a continuation of the legislation embodied in the Local Government Act, 1927, as extended, but confines remissions to buildings or parts of buildings constructed and designed as residences for separate families.  Local authorities must satisfy themselves that the building getting remission is used as a residence before giving a remission in any year.</P>
      <P>The procedure with respect to determining the houses that are entitled to remission will be the same as hitherto. The Commissioner of Valuation will indicate the houses on the valuation list.  There will be the same right of appeal against these determinations as there is against valuations under the Valuation Acts.  The Bill will not affect exemptions or partial exemptions from rates granted under other Acts.  Under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous) Act, 1932, remission of rates on houses in respect of which State grants are paid was allowed for a period of seven years.  This will still continue, and these grant-aided houses do not therefore come within the present Bill.  Neither do houses which under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, have got relief from rates for 20 years.  The remaining classes that do not come within that definition of residences for the purposes of the Bill are houses erected under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and Labourers Acts.</P>

      <P>Under Section 2 (3) does the levying of rates by local authorities cover all money raised by rates for whatever purpose?  If so, it includes unemployment assistance, a question <Col N="1054" /> that has been discussed at some length, and which I do not propose to go into now.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously that whatever case might be made for the benefits which new buildings may eventually give local authorities, and therefore encourage them to do without a certain amount of rates from these buildings for a period, there is no such argument in saying that on new buildings a local authority may levy only one-third of the amount they have to collect for the Government for unemployment assistance, while the rest of the ratepayers have not only to pay their own contribution but, in addition, two-thirds on all new buildings.  In this case the local authorities get no benefit whatever from the fund.  They are merely acting as a collecting agency for the Government.  The Minister should consider whether that section should not be amended, by allowing unemployment assistance to be levied on the full value, and not on the reduced value as is suggested by the Bill.</P>

I have in mind the case of a local authority that built what might be described as better-class houses, on which no subsidy was given, and which were sold on the hire-purchase system. I think that should be encouraged, and that this Bill should apply to such cases.  No subsidy was given by the local authority or by the Government. People of that class should be encouraged to buy their houses.  The case I am referring to is one where they did that, and I consider they should get the same consideration as other people got.  I am not referring to houses that are let in the ordinary way at a rent, and on which the local authority got a subsidy, but to houses that were sold at the economic value on the hire-purchase system.  Some consideration should be given to such people.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The objects of the Bill are to make certain amendments of the law relating to instalment orders, maintenance orders, and affiliation orders, and to provide for the release in proper cases of persons imprisoned for non-payment of debt.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill, and perhaps all I need do at this stage is to refer to what I think are the three principal defects in the existing law which the Bill is intended to remedy.  The first is that under the existing law arrears of weekly sums due under maintenance orders and affiliation orders have to be sued for in the same way as ordinary civil debts. This is an expensive and cumbersome procedure, and I understand that women who obtain maintenance orders and affiliation orders often make no attempt to enforce them when they discover the difficulties involved.  As will be seen, in the Bill we are providing that a person against whom an instalment has been made can be brought up for examination.  If a satisfactory explanation is not given, he may be committed to prison for three months. If he can show that he is not in a position to pay the instalment, it can be varied.  The court will decide that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second defect in the present law is that when a man is imprisoned under <Col N="1056" /> Section 18 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, for failure to pay an instalment of a debt, he cannot be released before the expiry of the period for which he is committed unless he pays the whole debt.  Payment of the instalment in respect of which he is committed is not sufficient.  I think that that is not right.  We want to remedy the law there so as to provide that if the person pays the instalment of the debt that has accrued due, he may be released.  There is no power to do that at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have to be inquired into to see if it is a proper case. There are cases where even the creditor has said that it is a hard case.  A man is committed for non-payment of, say, £5 per month, or something like that.  He allows the instalments to accumulate until there is a committal order made, and the man is sent to prison.  As the law stands at present, he would have to pay the whole of the debt or he could not be released until the period for which he has been imprisoned has expired.</P>

      <P>What machinery does the Minister propose to deal with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may release him.  He first consults the justice. Section 9 (1) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where a person is in prison in pursuance of an order of a court made on account of the failure of such person to pay a sum of money, the Minister for Justice may, at any <Col N="1057" /> time and for any reason which appears to him sufficient, direct that such person shall be released either (as the said Minister shall think proper) forthwith or after payment of a specified part of the said sum of money.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of that section provides:</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister for Justice shall not direct under this section the release from prison of a person until or unless either the said Minister has consulted the Judge or Justice by whom the order for the imprisonment of such person was made as to the propriety of such release or the said Minister is satisfied that such consultation is impracticable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think that will make the law more satisfactory than it is at present.</P>
    <P>The third defect is that there does not appear to be any clear authority for the release of a person imprisoned for non-payment of debt, even in a case where the creditor asks for the release, or in a case where, for health reasons, it is undesirable that the debtor should be detained in prison. These are the main changes which are being made.  I do not propose to take the Committee Stage until the end of next month, say the 24th April, or longer.  We want to make the law as satisfactory as possible in cases of this kind, and I invite Deputies to put down any amendments which they may think necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's desire to amend the present law seems very reasonable from what he said.  But it is very questionable if the way he proposes to make the amendment is so desirable.  With regard to affiliation orders, it is quite possible, and I think probable, as a rule that these orders are not being enforced because the person who is entitled to the money finds the machinery too expensive or too difficult.  Perhaps the Minister could find some better way than having the man brought up for examination. After all, we have collected the land annuities on the basis of the sheriff sending out notices, and we have made that very simple.  Perhaps in this case something similar could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> With regard to the releasing of prisoners, I am not at all enamoured with the machinery which the Minister proposes to set up.  Persons may be in jail under a court order, and if the Minister says that at the moment the Act is so straightly drawn that a man cannot be released even though it is desirable that he should be released, something ought to be done to amend it.  But that the Minister himself should have the power to do that does not appear to be equitable.  The fact that the Minister must consult the justice does not appear to me to be a safeguard at all.  If the Minister consults the justice, and if it is the Minister's wish to release the person, he will probably be released, and that will be the end of it.  Perhaps the Minister could find some way whereby such a person would be brought before a court.  Why should he not be brought before a court?  Is there not plenty of machinery to bring him before a court?  Why should not a man whom the Minister thinks it is desirable to have released be brought before a court, and the Minister put up his case there, or someone for him?  There ought to be some machinery found in that way to meet that case.  I do not think it is desirable that the Minister should have the last word or the only word as to whether a man should or should not be released, because I am afraid, if it did not lead to abuse it would certainly lead to suspicion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is not aware that that has been the practice in all cases.  I am not saying that that makes it any better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we are at sixes and sevens about the matter. Whatever the Minister is suggesting as a remedy is not what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that in an ordinary case of imprisonment, quite apart from this case of debt, the Minister is the person who can do it.  He has not the power in this case.  I do not think the Deputy is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are different matters altogether.  This is a matter of money&mdash;a matter of debts.  I do not think that the Minister should set himself <Col N="1059" /> up as a judge in that case.  It would not be wise for him to do so. The thing would be open to suspicion on every occasion.  The Minister should devise some machinery whereby the man could be marched back to court for some kind of examination and then released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I have an open mind.  I shall consider any proposal designed to improve the Bill. No Minister wants to take any power in a matter of this kind that he can avoid taking.  Between now and the Committee Stage, I shall have the matter considered.  I invite any Deputy who thinks he can improve the Bill to put down amendments for consideration in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put two questions to the Minister.  I should like to know, in the first place, <Col N="1060" /> the approximate date of the introduction of the Budget.  The second matter on which I should like information concerns an Emergency Order, issued under the Minister's name, authorising the Guards to stop cars and, furthermore, authorising them to use firearms for that purpose.  My opinion is that the Minister has not got that power and, if he has not the power, he cannot pass it on.  The use of firearms by any servant of the State is a very serious matter and; in view of the fact that the Minister has not got the power to authorise the use of firearms, he cannot issue such a power to the Guards.</P>
