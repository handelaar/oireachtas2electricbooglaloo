      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the smallholders of Beara have been refused beet contracts on the grounds that the freight to Mallow was considered excessive, while holders in the Dingle peninsula, farther removed from the factory, have been granted contracts; and whether in face of this discrimination he will see that the whole question of freight charges will be considered with a view to the grant of a subsidy towards the cost of freightage in such cases, seeing that the cost of sugar production is a general charge on every consumer in every part of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann grants substantial subsidies &mdash; particulars of which have been publicly announced&mdash;in relief of freight charges on beet supplied on contract to the sugar factories.  In placing contracts for beet the company, as a commercial undertaking, is naturally concerned to secure the required quantity on the most economic basis, and must have regard <i>inter alia</i>, to the freight charges involved.  It will be obvious that the company's policy in this respect is of benefit to the consumers of sugar generally, to whom the Deputy refers in the latter part of his question.  With regard to the particular case mentioned by the Deputy, it is not my function to intervene in matters of this kind which are within the discretion of the board of the company, <Col N="1062" /> but from inquiries I have made I am satisfied that the suggestion of discrimination in the Deputy's question is unfounded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospitals proposed would cost about a quarter of a million.  Sketch plans for the county hospital submitted to the Department appeared to be satisfactory but the estimated cost was approximately £1,500 per bed, which was regarded as excessive.  Careful consideration was given last year to the possibility of reducing the all-in cost and the matter was discussed with the commissioner administering the Waterford Board of Public Assistance.  No proposals for reducing the cost have since been received.  In the present conditions and having regard to the extent of the commitments on the Hospitals Trust Fund the proposals for new district hospitals at Dungarvan and Lismore must be deferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the price of bran and pollard was increased by £2 per ton recently, and am satisfied that this increase was justified having regard to the increased costs of imported wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that although the price of flour in this country is now substantially in excess of the price of flour in Great Britain the millers have been permitted to increase the price of wheaten offals also to provide them with additional profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of subsidy paid on flour in Great Britain has nothing whatever to do with the price of offals here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that although the price of flour here is more than twice the price in Great Britain, the millers have got permission to increase the price of wheaten offals by £2 a ton?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the price of flour in Great Britain is heavily subsidised by the British Government.  There is, therefore, no point in his remark with reference to the price of flour in relation to the price of offals.  The increase in the price of offals here followed an increase in the price of imported wheat and was fully justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of opinion that the price of flour entitled the millers to expect not only an excess price for the flour but also an excess price for wheaten offals derived from by-products in the manufacture of flour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the consumer I think it is desirable that there should be no great disparity between the price of maize offals and maize meal.  The disparity that existed before the recent increase was caused by the demand for wheaten offals being far in excess of the supply.  In the ordinary course there is a certain relation between one commodity and the other, and that relation, I think, will have to be maintained.  I may say that the price of wheaten offals in this country is now substantially lower than the price at which we could import them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the rate of remuneration paid to No. 1 men in the coast-life saving service and the amounts of the additional allowances payable to them for attendance at quarterly exercises, wreck services and watches during bad weather, and also the prize money for proficiency in signalling and throwing the heaving <Col N="1069" /> cane for which No. 1 men are eligible to compete.  I am not aware of any extra duties without suitable remuneration that have been imposed on No. 1 men as a result of the European war.  The number of occasions on which a number of crews have had to turn out during recent months may be above the average for the time of the year, but suitable additional payments are made to No. 1 men for each such turn out.  No. 1 men have been asked to notify the Coast Watching Service of the Department of Defence of any unusual occurrences observed by them, but this request cannot be regarded as an imposition of extra duties.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that a case exists for an increase in the remuneration of No. 1 men. With regard to the question of supplying No. 1 men with oilskins and marine tunics, I am of the opinion that the occasions on which such clothing would be worn are very rare in the case of practically every station.  At present, two oilskins and two sou'westers are supplied to each station at which a bad weather watch is kept.  Exercises are always held during fine weather and, in the case of wreck services, which are infrequent, the crew conducts the operations from the shore.  In the circumstances, I cannot agree that there is any necessity for supplying marine tunics and additional oilskins.</P>

      <P>John O'Connell, Castletownshend, Skibbereen, County Cork, completed an application for a qualification certificate on 16th November, 1939.  When the inquiries regarding his means, which must be made in such <Col N="1070" /> cases, were completed a qualification certificate was issued on the 13th February, 1940, and sent to the local office of the Department for delivery to him in accordance with the prescribed procedure.  As he was not attending at the local office, a communication was addressed to him at the address he had given asking him to call for his certificate.  It appears that he had then left the district and his present address is not known.  The certificate is still at the local office, Skibbereen, for delivery to him and may be obtained by him at any time on his request.  The delay in delivering the certificate to him is due to his failure to communicate with the local office.</P>

Additional quantities will be distributed before the end of the season and some imported superphosphate has also been obtained.  Satisfactory supplies of potassic manures and sulphate of ammonia are available, and to fulfil present requirements for tillage, farmers have been advised to use heavier dressings of these latter manures with lighter dressings of superphosphate.  Basic slag has recently become available in greater quantity than previously anticipated, and as this manure may be used in substitution for superphosphates for all root crops, farmers have been advised <Col N="1073" /> accordingly.  I am satisfied that all practicable measures are being taken to provide adequate supplies of artificial manures.</P>

      <P>However, if you are prepared to listen I am prepared to talk.  On that occasion I pointed out that, from the point of view of Celtic studies, we were in a very peculiar position.  At the moment we have the leadership of the Celtic nations in so far as we alone of these have a government which can foster, with special interest, the prosecution of such studies.  I pointed out that our <Col N="1078" /> national policy of reviving the language imposed a special duty upon us: that there was a vast quantity of material relating to early modern Irish which had not been properly edited or even properly examined, and that the publication of that material, after careful editing over a period of years, would be of the greatest possible advantage to the present-day spoken language and would enrich it in every way. Now, that mass of material would want to be worked over according to a definite plan under expert direction. That would take a number of years. The work could not possibly be carried out by the universities, because it is of a different character from the work on which they are engaged.  Neither could it be carried out very well by the Royal Irish Academy because, for the most part, that is an institution that was intended to provide a forum for scientists of various kinds who would come together from time to time and acquaint each other of the results of the research work which they have been able to do, and to afford them an opportunity for discussions at comparatively infrequent intervals, whereas the editing of this material, the working through it, would require the day to day constant effort of a number of workers engaged, as I have said, under expert direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That work alone would justify the establishment of the institute, but it seemed to me that there were other branches of knowledge, other directions, in which we could also play our part.  A century or two ago an institute for advanced learning, such as is proposed here, would have been regarded as needless duplication.  That work would have been regarded as the proper work for the universities because at that time precisely the advancement, encouragement and fostering of advanced studies was the peculiar work of the universities.  The universities of the present day have a very different task.  The advancement of knowledge in these later centuries has been so rapid that in order to keep up with the advances made even in a very narrow branch during the lifetime of an individual he would have to give his whole time to it.  The universities, <Col N="1079" /> therefore, if they wanted to perform that task, would really need to have two separate branches, because the man who had to keep abreast of the knowledge that had been achieved up to that particular time would have to give his whole time to that without any question of teaching.</P>
    <P>But, in the case of the modern universities, the greater part of the time of the professors and lecturers has to be devoted to teaching.  At one time I thought it might be a very useful thing if we were to have two parts in our universities: one for teaching, and the other mainly for advanced research work, but then the cost of that to the community would be far greater than what is proposed here under this system.  In fact, what is proposed here is an addition to the work which is being done in universities; but, by doing it in this way, it can be done more effectively and more economically than it could be if you were to divide the various university colleges into two sections, putting in one a number of research professors and in the other a number of teachers and lecturers.  The universities, on account of the complexity of modern life, have to devote most of their time to preparing students, making them fit for the part which each one will have to play in life.  If you want to get a picture of the situation, imagine a young man of 17 or 18 years of age coming to the university to prepare for the medical profession.  The course for the medical profession extends now, I think, to seven years, so that he has to spend that period in intensive work on his own particular profession, trying to acquire the knowledge which is necessary for him if he is to bring to the service of the community the knowledge which has already been gained.  That is intensive work, and by the time it is finished, if he wants to live a normal life at all, he would expect to have left the school period and to be able to support himself by work in his profession.</P>
    <P>Now, if you do not want to extend what I may call the school age until <Col N="1080" /> a man is middle-aged, there is a time limit beyond which you cannot go. Consequently, most of the time in the universities is spent in training men for the different professions, even for business and farming.  If you want to do farming in the best way you have got to get special instruction.  In the National University, for example, we have a section which is devoted to agriculture. All these branches require intensive training, both in the acquiring of the necessary knowledge and in the practice of it.  there is then a limit to the number of years that can be spent in that way.  It is very important that the universities devote themselves to arranging a programme by which, in the shortest time, a person can arrive at the stage in which he is reasonably fit to enter into a profession to earn his livelihood and live a normal life.  With that pressure it is quite obvious that very little research work of a proper kind could be done.  By research work I mean exploring new fields and advancing the frontiers of knowledge.  To do that, one requires, first of all, men who can devote themselves exclusively to it, keeping themselves abreast of the knowledge of the time, and students of special ability who can be trained to succeed such men.</P>
    <P>The need for such an institute as is proposed here has been felt in practically every country in the world.  Side by side with all the universities, in most countries, you will find an institute of this kind.  You will find it in the great and in the small nations. In Denmark there is a number of them. Some can afford to go in for a type of institute which requires elaborate and expensive equipment.  The smaller countries cannot very well do that.  In any work which we may do for the advancement of knowledge generally, we will have to bear in mind what the resources of our people are and what it is possible for us to do.  For example, there would be no point in our trying to compete with other countries in some modern work in experimental physics because the equipment that would be required would be too expensive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> We may be able to do a certain amount in that direction but we could not hope in that way to be amongst the nations that would advance knowledge. In the same way our circumstances, for example, would not fit us to hope to make very much advance in observational astronomy.  We might work on the basis of the observations of other countries that are situated more favourably from the point of view of climate and atmosphere and so on, as well as resources, but we could not hope to do much work from the observational side, though we might on the theoretical.  The universities as they are at present organised cannot be depended upon to do the work of advanced knowledge and to prepare research workers of an advanced type. The type of student who might come to an institute of this sort would be a student such as in the National University would get a travelling scholarship. He must certainly be of first-rate ability and he would have to have done a preparatory course equivalent to securing a M.A. degree.  That is why we have a special reason for having such an institute as is proposed, for Celtic studies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no apple of discord at all.  We have an opportunity, as I pointed out on the last day, of having here one of the greatest mathematical physics schools in the world.  There were available at the time I produced this Bill, three men who could have been kept here as professors of mathematical physics whose names and whose reputation were world wide.  If at some other time at as little expense you could establish a position for other sciences, that could be done if there was a reason for it. But when we get an opportunity such as we have got in the case of theoretical physics it is right to take it, and, as I said, we have a tradition in the case of theoretical physics.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact in the earlier half of the 19th century and going over the first half of the century, we had some of the greatest mathematicians in the world, Irishmen. There is one name that occurs to everybody, and that is Hamilton.  As a matter of fact if I want to go into the history of this idea it was the fact that Dunsink seemed to be available for the nation that turned me to consider this matter in the first instance. Hamilton's reputation in the 19th century was recognised as being great.  He was the foremost mathematician and his fame is increasing because the most recent developments of mathematical physics are going back and are based on some of the principles be enunciated.  We had also men like McCullagh and Fitzgerald and, besides, men who did not spend their lives here but who were Irish.  We had Stokes and Thompson.  I believe this study is peculiarly suited to Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having an opportunity of getting outstanding <Col N="1083" /> men to accept the professorial chairs it seemed to me to be a very good beginning and a beginning that ought to be made here in regard to the sciences in addition to setting up a school of Celtic studies.  The scheme of the institution was very simple.  It was designed to give each school that might be founded the greatest amount of autonomy that was possible.  Professors ought to be able to know the work which is required and then you associate with the actual professors an equal number as proposed here&mdash;an equal number will be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  These will be interested in the particular branch of studies to which the school devotes itself.  You will have an assurance, if the appointment is reasonably made, that the school will look after the work which is given to it to look after, and do so with proper care.  Those who would not know the subjects as well as the governing board, might very well prevent the best work being done. Research work in any case is work which very often is merely haphazard. No man can feel certain when a promising vein is opened up for pursuit that the wealth that was thought to be in it will be found in it.  There are many failures and accidents apparently determining whether a piece of work is to prove valuable or not.  You cannot organise it and develop it in the way in which you can direct and plan a military operation.  You have to make up your mind that the work of the school will depend on the character of the professors and on their ability.  It is intended, therefore, to leave to the schools their own government as far as possible, and it is proposed to relieve them of any business cares in regard to what I might call the administration of the school&mdash;except the actual research work itself.  That is to be done in the main by a council which will be a common council for all the schools.  On that council it is proposed that there should be two representatives from each school, and the general business administration will be carried out by the council.  Of course, if there were a matter which affected a <Col N="1084" /> school, the school would make its request and nothing would be done by the council without consultation with the governing board of the school.</P>
    <P>I think it is not in the draft as it is, but it is to be provided that, in case of any difference arising between the governing board of a school and the administrative council of the institute, there should be an appeal to the Minister, who in all this is the Minister for Education.  Of the two representatives of each school it is proposed that one should be an &ldquo;appointed member&rdquo; of the governing board of the school.  The council will be a responsible corporate body for all agreements, for all legal commitments that have to be made by the institute as a whole.  The senior professors in the schools will be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government and the assistants that might be required in the various schools will be appointed by the council on the recommendation of the schools in question.  The expenses of the schools will be met by grants voted by the Oireachtas, and the accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and presented to Parliament in the usual way.</P>
    <P>In the main, I think, that gives the skeleton of the organisation.  The Bill is, of necessity, fairly detailed and can be discussed in detail in Committee. The principle is not unlike the principle which you have, for example, in the National University, where you have a number of colleges, each with its own governing body, but to a large extent ruling itself.  A certain amount of necessary uniformity is introduced through the controlling power of the Senate.  In the same way here, though the schools will be largely autonomous, in so far as co-ordination is required it is secured through the council.  The value of having the institute and not separate schools lies in the fact that the prestige of each school will be affected by the work done by some of the other schools in the institute.  For example, if the school of theoretical physics became known, it would become known not merely as the school of theoretical <Col N="1085" /> physics, but its work would be recognised as work done by the Dublin Institute.  The value, therefore, of having an institute with separate schools, must, I think, be apparent to everybody.  You have the co-ordination, the simplicity of administration, the economy which could be effected and then, as I have indicated, the fact that each school will reflect a certain amount of credit on the other schools as long as they are associated with one institute.  It may happen that Deputies may have some questions to ask that I will be able to reply to at the end, or even before the end of the debate, but I think I have given sufficient information to the House to enable it to understand generally the nature of the Bill and the reasons for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, in discussing such high subjects as Celtic studies, geophysics and cosmology, my mind should start off and run along the lines of the language of the films. The scheme proposed here, and I might say the object proposed here, in so far as we see in this Bill or from the explanation of the Taoiseach either before or now, makes me unfortunately characterise this whole scheme as a higher humbug production in the language of the films.  It gives you a feeling that we are having a kind of modern saints-and-scholars touch.  We all flatter ourselves that in the past we were an island of saints and scholars and that we held the lamp of civilisation aloft in Europe and kept Christianity alive when there was nobody else to look after it.  We can see the evidence that that was done, but we give no consideration to what exactly were the circumstances here that enabled the thing to be done and why it was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are proposing to set up a higher learning institute and are proposing to have a school of advanced Celtic studies and a scheme of advanced theoretical physics for a start off.  All we are told with regard to the theoretical physics school by the Taoiseach is that we could have three people who are world famous if we had this <Col N="1086" /> a little while ago, but he does not tell us who they were.  So far as we can understand, that was the only stimulus to starting a school of theoretical physics here.  But from what are we going to progress in trying to advance the frontiers of known knowledge in the world in respect of theoretical physics or anything in that particular line if we are not going to advance from a people that, at any rate, have a sound mathematical education?</P>
    <P>What is our position at the present time?  I have already pointed out that year after year there is increased dissatisfaction with the position of mathematics in the primary schools. Last year we embarked on a position in our secondary schools, by which a girl can leave them without ever sitting in a mathematics class during the secondary school period, or ever having sat for a mathematical examination.  A boy can leave the secondary schools without ever sitting for a mathematical examination either for the intermediate or for the leaving certificate.  All that is required is that during the period he is attached to the intermediate class he attends a mathematical class, but he need never sit for an examination, and it is on a foundation like that that we are setting up, with a very inadequate explanation, machinery to which public money is to be devoted in order to advance the frontier as regards theoretical physics.  The Taoiseach referred to the McCullaghs and the Hamiltons, but there are people called Pat Murphys.  We are descending to the Pat Murphy argument now.  It is necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the position of mathematics in the secondary schools on the Vote for Education last year I drew attention to evidence that was given before the Primary Education Conference by the Professor of the Theory and Practice of Education in the National University as to what the position should be, and what it was in the past.  He showed that the achievements of our people in the middle of the 18th century were due to the mathematical grip they had as a result of good mathematics.  I will quote <Col N="1087" /> what I said from column 2175 of the Official Debates of March 16th, 1939:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The intellectual quality of the average Irish farm labourer and the small farmer from 1775 to 1850 was ahead of the world, and in consequence they were able to take concerted action of a public character that no other people in the world at the time were even able to think of. It was largely developed by the presence in the country of a vast number of efficient mathematical teachers always called &lsquo;mathematicians&rsquo; even in print.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So if we had our Hamiltons and our McCullaghs they were the flower of people who could be described in these particular terms.  It was pointed out by Dr. Corcoran in the same evidence that from 1900 the position of mathematics here deteriorated.  While the teaching of mathematics was higher than the National Board required, the lowering of the standard injured the teaching capacity of the teachers from 1900.  We did not fall as far as we fell last year when we wiped out mathematics as a compulsory subject for the intermediate and leaving certificate in the secondary schools.  That is why I call this side of the advanced learning programme humbug.  On the side of the School of Celtic Studies the Taoiseach indicated that there is a large mass of early modern Irish stuff that has to be edited and printed, and that may have an important effect on the spoken use of the language at the present time.  Would the Taoiseach give us some information as to what exactly requires to be done?  Will he tell us what percentage of the early modern Irish stuff available has been already printed, and to what extent it is influencing in any way the situation at the present time?  I see a request here from the Government for power to set up schools of advanced Irish learning, when on some of the most vital and focal points on our own front, there is a complete disinclination to examine the situation.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly pointed out that students entering the university from <Col N="1088" /> secondary schools are a fair sample of the linguistic capacity being attained in the secondary schools by children educated either through the medium of Irish or with very good instruction in Irish.  I have repeatedly asked the Minister for Education to have a system of serious conferences between those handling the material on the Irish side of the universities and those responsible for it in the Department of Education.  He has systematically declined to have any system of conferences of that particular kind.  In fact, the work done in the secondary schools the Department almost entirely declined to examine in a systematic way.  I think excellent work is being done.  No praise could be too great for the various classes of people, both in the primary and the secondary schools, who are working to get here an Irish-speaking population, that may and can, if properly looked after, flower into deeper and higher Irish studies. The whole situation on focal points has been completely neglected.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates for the present year the situation in respect of secondary schools can be judged by this, that £8,500 less is being paid for special fees; for the publication of texts for secondary schools there is a reduction of £1,500; and for the publication of Irish texts for the Gúm there is a deduction of £4,500.  In the preparatory colleges, which were in fact the only machinery offering secondary education to the products of the Irish-speaking schools in the really Irish-speaking districts, there is a reduction of £4,313.  For children educated in Irish-speaking districts and in primary schools the only hope they had, to a large extent, of getting secondary education was by passing into the preparatory colleges.  The amount of money provided for that purpose now is £4,313 less than last year.  The Folklore Commission, which is doing valuable work, certainly within the terms of what is suggested here for the higher learning side, is being cut £600.  For children going to the Gaeltacht the grant is reduced by £500.  For the facsimile reproduction of ancient manuscripts there is a reduction of £75.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> You have this situation that reductions are being made in every grant that in my opinion is vital for saving the Irish language.  Scrutiny is definnitely neglected in spite of the fact that appeals were made to have it done much more carefully.  We are asked to do this without being given any explanation I might say, except that there is a mass of material that requires a large number of people to work on it systematically and continuously.  Either the subjects in the secondary schools are or are not of importance for the Irish language movement.  If they are then the Taoiseach ought to treat this in a more systematic way.  He is addressing both here and in the country people who are interested in holding and maintaining the Irish language. It means very little to some, but it amounts to this, whether we are to retain the fragrance either of civilisation or of learning that comes from the old manuscripts.  It means very little whether we retain that fragrance if we do not systematically and thoroughly deal with the work of preserving Irish as a living language.  The more seriously we take our responsibilities in respect of maintaining the living language that is there the better, rather than joining whatever band of advanced workers there are, even in the line of Irish learning, to extend unknown knowledge on these things.  I think both the method and the explanation given are entirely at variance with the reduction of the amount of money spent in certain focal directions at the present time, and is due to the neglect of scrutiny of important spheres of Irish language development that has been asked for and refused for some years past.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question which strikes me.  The universities are being relegated to an entirely different sphere.  The Taoiseach indicated that the universities are now going to be something that they were not in the past.  I certainly feel, with the reduction in the standard of mathematics in the secondary schools, and the likely effect of the inadequacy of the standard of mathematics in primary schools, that more and more the universities tend to be reduced to the <Col N="1090" /> secondary schools level.  Such as they are at the present time and such as they will continue to be, there are Irish faculties in the universities.  In the National University, there are at least two persons who have no responsibility for the giving of lectures.  One member of the staff of the National University is definitely a research professor. You have the Dublin College of the National University, the Cork College and the Galway College; you have Trinity College, the Royal Irish Academy, the Folklore Commission and the Historical Manuscripts Commission. Surely, when the Dáil is being asked to set up a new college which will have its governing board, its professors, visiting professors, assitants and other academic staff, we ought to be told what is going to be done there that is not being done in the five or six institutions I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has not indicated who is responsible for this idea.  We do know that the change in the mathematical programme in secondary schools was brought into operation last year without the Professor of Education in the National University being consulted about it.  Who was consulted about this proposal?  Have the principal people working on research in either the National University or Trinity College, or have the authorities of the Royal Irish Academy been consulted about it?  Is the folklore grant being reduced by £600 because the work is going to be done in this institute? The whole business seems to be a sort of detached idea which is absurdly presented here if it is supposed to be a matter of importance and if it is going to ensure the progress of Irish studies in the universities.  I cannot imagine anything that would lower the standard of higher Irish studies in the universities more than the taking of research work away from these bodies. My objection to this Bill is based on the ground that you cannot have McCullaghs and Hamiltons in a country where you have not the Pat Murphys, that you cannot have higher mathematic studies worth anything except the ground where the Irish language is being held and extended as <Col N="1091" /> a living language is thoroughly looked after, supervised and developed in every possible way.  In the present state of thought and having regard to the organisation of our universities here, you are simply reducing their status and standard by taking some of these higher studies away from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I entirely sympathise with Deputy Mulcahy when he points out that no Bills, no institutes, and no pious hopes will achieve the purposes that an institute of this kind should have in mind if the educational foundations of the people as a whole are not sound.  I gladly echo what he said here to-day, that there is no evidence that adequate thought is being given to these foundations but I am, perhaps, not as wise as he is, in that I am a little more optimistic.  I take this Bill at its face value and, on the Estimates for Secondary and Primary Education, I propose to bring this Minister to book for his gross neglect of the foundations on which this institute must ultimately rest.  I do not despair, after five years battering at his colleague, of reforming him, as the shooting of Clanricarde's bailiff was wrongly intended to reform Clanricarde.  Clanricarde was not, of course, intimidated by having his bailiff shot, but I think the Taoiseach has been considerably intimidated by the repeated assassination of his ex-Minister for Education and I hope to see reform in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have been brought up in rural Ireland must always have been struck by the reverence of our people for learning.  No sounder instinct ever inspired a people.  It is often carried to imprudent extremes and a reverence is paid to a B.A. which would be more properly offered to a prudent man who had no fictitious title upon which to depend.  But, in these times when barbarism stalks the world, glories in its resolve to quench the light of knowledge and to prohibit intelligent inquiry and claims that the loftiest duty of a liberated nation is to stamp on all knowledge and education <Col N="1092" /> that does not wear a brown shirt, it is a source of peculiar satisfaction to me that we, in this country, should be exerting ourselves to widen knowledge, to encourage inquiry and to make available to a wider and wider section of our people the benefits of a more and more liberal education.</P>
    <P>Before I get down to the work that lies ahead, I want to register this protest.  It was a mischievous and silly thing for the Taoiseach to inject into this initial proposal mathematical physics.  The time has come for plain speaking, because that mischievous folly has, in my opinion, contributed to whatever discord may arise in connection with this proposal.  The proposal is incorporated in this Bill for one, and one only, silly, childish purpose, and that is to lend verisimilitude to the myth that the Taoiseach is a great mathematician, which he never was and never will be.  He is a man who takes an interest in mathematics, but there are thousands of decent secondary teachers who were his colleagues before he entered politics, and who are as good mathematicians as he is&mdash;and there are hundreds of them far better. But the myth has to be created in the world that in Ireland we have a scholar Prime Minister and that, in pursuit of the age-old passion that has inflamed his heart for pure science and truth, he could not resist the chance of conferring the reflected glory of his learning on the rising generation of the Irish people.  That is all cod, and we in Ireland know it is cod, but there will be articles published in the <i>Melbourne Argus</i>, the <i>Irish World</i>, the <i>San Francisco Leader</i>, and they may even get into <i>Life</i> or <i>Time</i> under the heading of &ldquo;The Scholar T.D.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order to get that silly little bit of kudos, he has injected into this otherwise admirable scheme a lot of extraneous matter which, on the face of it, is ludicrous and gives colour to the argument of those who would attack the whole scheme as unjustifiable expenditure in the present state of the country.  People will say: &ldquo;What, in the name of God, do you want to be setting up an institute in Dublin for, to add up two and two?&rdquo;  I think they <Col N="1093" /> would be right in taking up that line. There is no more reason why we should embark on the fostering of higher study in mathematical physics than, for instance, in philosophy. Indeed, you could make a better case in respect of the higher study of philosophy.  You might say that our people are speculatively minded people, people who would attach more importance to the things of the spirit than they would to material things, and one might hold that there was a better future in a country like this for metaphysics and speculation, that those potentialities of our people should be canalised and that they should be given an opportunity for coming in contact with the best brains in the world, many of whom are now refugees from one country or another, flying from the German barbarians who are driving them out.  We could provide them with a refuge here and allow our people to react to their instruction.</P>
    <P>You might, again, have made a great case for establishing a school of agricultural science and agricultural statistics, similar to the Rome institute, on the ground that, being almost exclusively an agricultural country, it would be a fitting thing that we would have an institute here that would draw to it students from all parts of the world, and scholars from all parts of the world, as Rome is doing at the present time.  You might have made a case for medicine on the ground that we were greatly beholden to the world for the immense sums of money that have poured in here, earmarked for the purpose of building hospitals for our poor.  In return for that we would seek to contribute something to the pool of human knowledge by putting medical research on a peculiarly advantageous basis here and attempt the conquest of some particular disease or branch of disease as some kind of thanksgiving to our neighbours the world over who have helped us to cure our own sick and tend our afflicted.</P>
    <P>So far as mathematical physics is concerned, no one is going to deny that it is a very desirable and interesting sphere of human knowledge.  We talk about Hamilton or the Thompsons, and <Col N="1094" /> we can find names of Irishmen of perhaps greater distinction in almost every branch of learning and achievement in the history of the world. Theirs are names that we look back on with pride, and rightly so, but I do not think it is any more desirable to invoke them in the case of mathematical physics or any other course of study than to invoke the name of Sam Adams, when everyone else was thinking of John Adams.  I am sorry the Taoiseach has done it.  I asked one of his colleagues two months ago to bring a message back to him to drop this specific proposal for a school of mathematical physics and to leave the power which is in the Bill to initiate this school later on if it became desirable. But the Taoiseach would not do that, because to do it would be to admit that de Valera had made a mistake &mdash; and, of course, de Valera has never made a mistake.  To suggest to him that it would be expedient to take something out of the draft Bill, something that he put in&mdash;that was heresy; that was revolution.  Therefore, you have to ram it through; you have to get the scholars who are sitting behind him to give their support.  He will march them into the Lobby in defence of mathematical physics, and perhaps not three of them will know what mathematical physics is, much less what it is going to be.</P>
    <P>I deplore all that.  I think it is a great mistake and I think it confuses the issue which confronts us.  So far as research and higher learning in Celtic studies are concerned, I think that is appropriate.  I think the idea is good, and any money which I can reasonably foresee will be spent on a proposal of this kind will be money well spent.  Deputy Mulcahy has truly said that the primary concern at this time for most of us is the preservation of the Irish language as a living language. I entirely agree, and if there was any conflict of interest between higher learning in Celtic studies and the preservation of the language as a living language, then by all means I would choose the living language and let the higher learning await a later day.  But I do not think there is any conflict.  I do not think the living language <Col N="1095" /> can be a living language if you allow its roots to die.  I believe a language is a thing which belongs to no special day; it belongs to history and the more you can know and bring to light its history, its origin, its sources, its associations with other languages, the more firmly you protect the living body of the language itself.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Celtic research that has been done in this country to date reflects much credit on the scholars who are charged with it. It is an astonishing thing to discover that in Celtic studies there has probably been more fertile work forthcoming from Germany, France and the United States of America than has been forthcoming from this country. Now, that may have been due to the lack of endowment, and I think perhaps it was in part at least, but what we have got to open our eyes to is this fact: that in the past, in the decades gone by when other nations were building up their immense stores of learning and achievement, there was a different social order.  You had in England in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries immensely wealthy families who gloried in their ability to endow learning, and whose families acquired a certain reflected glory from the learning that emerged from the institutions with which their names were associated.  In this country we have not any great accumulations of wealth of that kind.  There are no endowments here to maintain an Oxford or a Cambridge or an institution of that kind.  There are no endowments here on which to found a <i>College de France</i> or one of the endowed institutions of the French Republic.  Are we to make up our minds that we are to forego for ever that kind of work, or are we boldly to announce that, inasmuch as the social order has changed and abolished the old sources of endowment, we will enact a new social order, and provide for the community as a whole, in which there are very few rich individuals, endowments which will endow learning in this country in the time to come?  I think that is what this Bill is doing.  I think this Bill is doing for higher learning in <Col N="1096" /> Celtic studies what the dukes and the marquises and the big landowners in England and France did for learning in another day.  In so far as the Bill proposes to do that, I think it is doing well.  I think that it holds out hope for good work in the time to come.</P>
    <P>Now, it would ill-become me to be a critic of the universities.  I do not profess to be an authority on education, but for good or ill the people have sent me here as their representative, and I suppose I know as much about the problem as most of the people who voted for me.  Speaking for them, and from their point of view, it does appear to me that inevitably the functions of great State universities such as we have in this country and such as are ubiquitous in the United States of America, must be something slightly different from the old academic schools of the older universities of Europe.  You cannot operate an institution which caters for thousands of students, the bulk of whom are looking for moneyearning professions within their walls, on the same lines as you would operate the academic institutions, the vernacular of which was Latin and no Don of which was ever to get married so long as he remained a Don of the institution. The atmosphere, the aims and the whole trend of the work in them was different.  In the one the people who were elected led a semi-monastic life, and deliberately chose a pseudo archaic mode of expression that indicated their complete detachment from the material things of the current life around them.  Their whole outlook was towards pure knowledge without any regard to the material considerations at all.  Who is going to say that that is going to be the atmosphere of such a university in this country or in any other country in the world?  Who has ever stood in the State universities of Australia or the United States and pretended for a moment that such was their atmosphere?  Of course it is not, and it cannot be.</P>
    <P>I think some effort is being made in that direction in Galway, but I do not think it is succeeding.  I think the bulk of the students in Galway make it perfectly clear that, much as they <Col N="1097" /> venerate learning, their immediate purpose in going to Galway University is to get a job when they leave it. Either the academic staffs of those establishments are going to tell the students to go elsewhere or else they are going to give the students that for which the students have come to college, and out of that dilemma I see no escape except along the lines broadly indicated in this departure. Now, let nobody doubt that the money to be expended upon this departure will be deplored by many people who will think that it is money wasted.  In so far as it is being spent on higher Celtic studies, I think it should be defended.  It can easily be attacked, particularly in these times of stringency and difficulty, but it ought to be defended in my judgment.  The difficulty of its defence is increased ten thousand fold by this grotesque annexe of metaphysical physics.  I do not believe that there is a Deputy in this House, with the exception of the Taoiseach, who has the slightest desire to preserve that annexe in the Bill.</P>
    <P>When we come to the question of research professorships we ought to ponder, because although I hope to see the institute rendered as autonomous as it is possible to make it, it is right to say that if every facility is made available, and if every difficulty is swept away, those responsible for the endowment are entitled to see some results.  I know that I will bring a deluge on my head for what I am about to say, but, nevertheless, I am going to say it.  It is this: that our limited experience in research professorships to date does not give us much ground for hope that they will produce very abundant fruits, certainly by way of published work which anybody can see, or which redounds to the credit of the institutions in which research professorships have been established.  Nobody wants to demand of scholars that they should grind out a certain quantity of published work ever so often, but I think we should consider whether some standard should not be set whereby we may judge the success of this departure.  How much published work may we reasonably expect to see?  I think it is true <Col N="1098" /> to say that in regard to certain scholars research endowments seem to induce a period of hibernation during which they engage in no activity but in the examination of other men's work in order to demonstrate that the other men are wrong.  Now, I am afraid that is true, and it is peculiarly true of Celtic scholars.  The atmosphere of hysteria that prevails after any fragment of research in Celtic studies has been published is pathetic to witness. It is not anxiety lest the work should be generally appreciated, but it is anxiety lest perhaps professor so-and-so will discover that a printer's error has crept in which has resulted in the omission of a comma, where it ought to be, or of an accent where it might have been used, or of a semi-colon where a colon might have been more properly employed.  That is true, and everybody knows it is true.  The scholars themselves know it is true.  I do not know whether that is an integral part of scholarship or not.  I am not qualified to say, but it certainly is not edifying to the ordinary rational human being who believes that scholars are pursuing knowledge and not one another for the purpose of stripping the hide off him.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this. I have read the schedule of subjects which the institute is designed to deal with in connection with Celtic studies. I wonder does the question of Irish music come within the scope of Celtic studies?  I see the difficulties here involved. It may emerge that research on those lines might be more expeditiously and effectively done by some other machinery.  Nevertheless the fact is that there is an immense mass of native music within this country which is practically unknown; to the vast majority of the people in our country, Irish music means the intolerable tedium of the slip jig, the four hand reel and the squealing fiddle which harass the ear.  These are unfortunately what the Ceilidhe band has inflicted on people.  The Minister for Post and Telegraphs is responsible for this.  During the last few months real Irish music has been discoursed from Radio Eireann and Irish airs have been delightfully produced.  I do not <Col N="1099" /> know what the size of that problem is. I do not know what measure of work can be done to recover the lost parts of that department of our national culture.  I do not know if the Institute of Higher Studies is the appropriate arena for that kind of work but I think it is a matter that might be taken into consideration.  With my very limited knowledge it seems to me to be a branch of learning in which there is ample scope for considerable development.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Mulcahy's suspicions of this scheme.  Perhaps it is because the wish is father to the thought in this matter that I am trying to believe that this institute is not going to be run on the lines of jobbery.  Any scheme can be spoiled if those responsible for its administration are concerned to spoil it.  If this institute is going to be run along the lines of jobbery, favouritism, and nepotism then it is going to be a gigantic failure.  But assuming that it is not going to be run on these lines&mdash;and that is a very considerable assumption but I am assuming it&mdash;I welcome the Bill.  I will vote for the Bill and in so far as it applies to Celtic studies I am prepared to defend it in the country.  I do not know whether the Prime Minister at this stage attaches immense importance to mathematical physics or not, but I am convinced that it would be important to the Bill to leave out the categories referring to mathematical physics&mdash;to leave these for another day should it appear desirable in the time to come.  I think that would be a reasonable kind of gesture to those who are not in actual agreement with me in the points I am making.  It is because I am anxious to see this started in an atmosphere of goodwill and pretty general cordiality that I wish to see it confined to Celtic studies.  If it is I am prepared to support it here or anywhere else where the scheme may be called in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that neither Deputy Dillon nor the Taoiseach is going to get entirely that element of cordiality for which Deputy Dillon hopes.  I oppose the whole Bill whether for Celtic Studies or mathematical physics.  To my mind the most important thing that concerns this House in any way is the amount of money likely to be spent and the amount of money this House is to be asked to provide for the carrying out of a Bill.  So far we have not heard from the Taoiseach what is likely to be the cost of the setting up in Dublin of an institute for advanced studies and for the setting up immediately under it of a constituent school for Celtic studies and theoretical physics and, in addition, giving the Government power that whenever it thinks it is in the public interest to do so, they may set up additional schools to deal with other advanced studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind even if it is felt that I am attacking Celtic studies, when I say that at the present moment and in our present position I would not vote for the spending of 1d. for any Bill for Celtic studies or the other things mentioned in this Bill.  Instead of spending money on suggestions such as these, this House would be better employed in spending money on a hundred other things that are necessary in this country in the times through which we are passing.  We are presented here with a Bill to establish a certain institute and two constituent colleges in the future.  Like everything else that happens in this country when the Government starts a scheme and gets a certain amount of money one knows that they will come back, year after year, for the additional money that will be required.  I would like to know from the Taoiseach whether he could give us any idea of what the expenditure under the Bill will be.  In Section 5 are set out the duties of the school of Celtic Studies.  In the present Estimates we are paying out money for quite a number of things set out in Section 5 of this Bill.  For instance, there is the grant annually for modern Irish literature in the University College, Dublin.  There is the grant to Trinity College for the general expenses of the school of physics; <Col N="1101" /> under the Vote for Science and Art there is the grant for publications in Irish; production of plays in Irish; for the production of Irish county histories, a grant for the Irish Folklore Commission; scholarships to Gaelic students and grants for a number of other things.  Is the position going to be now that you are to set up this school of Celtic studies under this Bill and advance to that school a lot of money for dealing with all the items in Section 5?  Are we still to go on providing money as set out in the Estimates for the various items under science and art and university education and have people under this Bill doing exactly the same jobs?  Are we to go on paying grants to the Folklore Commission and to people who deal with Irish publications?  Are we to continue the grant to the Irish Committee of Historical Sciences?  I do not see why, if we are to set up a school of Celtic studies, we are still to continue doling out money in small or large sums to the various bodies that I have mentioned.  We have been paying out all these moneys for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Actually there is only one possibility connected with this Bill that might induce me to vote for it.  Deputy Dillon referred to that when he suggested what the Taoiseach's idea was when he brought in the school of theoretical physics.  If this House would make the Taoiseach a present of a school of theoretical physics, no matter how much money we expended upon it, and if part of the bargain was that we put the Taoiseach in charge of the school for the rest of his life and out of this House, then I believe I would vote for the Bill, but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>I believe that you cannot justify the spending of money on this type of institute at present.  The Taoiseach advanced no argument as to why we should spend money on it.  When Deputy Mulcahy said that he was going to reduce it to a &ldquo;Pat Murphy&rdquo; argument, I think he hit the nail on the head.  In this country at present the children are going into the primary schools and, as Deputy Mulcahy said, <Col N="1102" /> they are coming out of them possibly with a smaller knowledge of mathematics than those who preceded them ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  The same applies to quite a number of other subjects. The position is going to be now that we are providing money for advanced Celtic studies, advanced studies in theoretical physics and anything else which the Government sees fit to provide money for and jump from the period when a child leaves the primary school or the secondary school, after a year or two there, over the intervening period.  We are doing nothing to cover the gap.  Deputy Dillon said the function of the university was to train people for professions that would enable them to get jobs.  It would be far better for the House to spend any money they are spending on education on fitting young people for jobs when they would come out of the primary schools and the secondary schools so that they would be able to take up a position in life.</P>
    <P>I think there is no justification for this Bill.  There is a lot of nonsense talked about Celtic studies in this country.  You can justify any expenditure of money in this country, you can justify anything in this country by making it Celtic, Gaelic, Irish or national.  Anybody who would attack this Bill probably would be attacked all over the country as anti-national and anti-Celtic.  You can justify anything you do in this country by tagging on to it the name of Celtic, Gaelic or national.  At the present moment, when every individual in the country will find it hard to provide money to meet his ordinary needs, and when the Government will find it hard to get money to meet their needs, there is no justification for spending money on Celtic studies and theoretical physics. If we are going to spend this money, one might ask what does the Taoiseach hope to gain either for individuals or for the country as a whole in establishing this institute and its constituent colleges?  After a while it may become famous all over the world; it may, in days to come, be felt here in Ireland that we have done something for the cause of advanced studies; and this institute may be spoken of very <Col N="1103" /> well in educational circles all over the world.  We might spend quite a lot of money and we might achieve that object; but the money we spend in achieving that effect might not be worth anything at all to this country. The mere fact that in future this country was going to get a certain amount of kudos for attempting to advance learning or, as the Taoiseach said, to advance the frontiers of known knowledge is not, I believe, sufficient to justify the spending of money upon it.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and some of the other speakers have shown how vague the supporters of the Bill are, because the Taoiseach suggested that one of the objects was to extend the frontiers of known knowledge and another speaker in supporting the Bill said the function of the Bill was to widen knowledge.  It is obvious that the Taoiseach and his supporters are very vague about what they want to do. What does the Taoiseach want the Bill for?  What is the institute going to do or the schools going to do?  Are we going to be faced next year or the year after, if the present Minister for Education is still in charge, with the possibility of being provided with nice new constituent colleges simply because the Government decide under Section 4 (2) that it appears to them in the public interest that constituent schools should be established for the advanced study of other things than those mentioned in sub-section (1)?  I think that is the whole joke in the Bill&mdash;that the Government may in the future come to this House and ask for public money to enable them to set up another constituent college for some type of advanced study because it is in the public interest.  Nothing that the Taoiseach or the other speakers who half supported the Bill said has convinced me that it is in the public interest or in the interest of any individual that we should vote money to the Government for the carrying out of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may be able to convince me that there are reasons why we should vote this money but he will want to tell us something else.  He <Col N="1104" /> will want to tell us how much money he wants.  Surely it is not suggested that this House should pass a Bill which is going to entitle the Government to demand from the House any money they want to carry out the schemes suggested in the Bill.  When the Taoiseach is replying I should like to get definite information from him as to what he believes the initial expenditure will be if this Bill is passed, what the estimated annual expenditure will be, and what is the total liability that this House will have to ask the State to foot under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I assumed too much in thinking that the purposes of this Bill did not need very much explanation.  I thought that the purposes would be understood and that there would be a greater measure of appreciation of what is intended than has been shown by those who spoke from the opposite side.  I find it very hard to understand why, in dealing with a Bill of this sort, we should be treated to what might properly be an argument or a criticism that would be brought up on the Estimates about the position of primary education.  The second last speaker spoke of a gap between the infants going to school and the people doing advanced studies in mathematics and advanced Celtic studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clear to everyone that all that is intended here is to supplement work that cannot under the pressure of modern conditions be given full attention in the universities; to supplement that by making it possible to have the work done under conditions of less stress than if it were done by the universities.  It is ridiculous to say that this is taking away from the universities.  It is not.  The universities have not been able to do this type of work in any country and, in particular, have not been able to do it here, where so many of our people have to depend for a livelihood on getting into the professions, and so on.  Research work will, I hope, continue to be done in the universities.  The amount of research that can be done by anyone who has to teach a number of classes <Col N="1106" /> with various grades of students, for a number of years is relatively small.  He cannot have time to do it.  A certain amount of research work will continue to be done.  In fact, it must be done if there is any enthusiasm at all in the professor, or if he is going to enthuse his students.</P>
    <P>Instead of doing as Deputy Mulcahy suggested this will help the universities, because it will hold out an opportunity particularly to brilliant students to continue their studies under masters who will themselves be recognised as some of the best in the world in their subjects, and it will afterwards help the universities by sending back trained staffs whenever vacancies arise.  It will also help the universities because the professors who will be in these institutes will be expected to give lectures in the colleges in Dublin on their own particular subjects.  These occasional lectures will be open to students of the colleges and to the public.  It was suggested that this Bill would get through if we had kept it to Celtic studies.  I do not want to bring it here under any form of false pretences.  This is not a Bill purely to advance the Irish language.  It will do much in that respect as a matter of fact, but that is not its immediate purpose.  Its purpose is to add a further storey to the educational edifice in this country, and to enable it to play its part in the general advancement of learning.</P>
    <P>For those who can afford to continue from the primary and secondary schools, and the universities, and for the specially-gifted students who have the character and the talent, as well as that particular devotion to learning which will indicate that scholarship is their career, there will be an opportunity in the institute.  Up to the present there was no opportunity for anything of the kind.  For example, you had the Faculty of Celtic Studies in the National University.  A number of people got travelling studentships and they have come back, but there was no equipment and no career open to them.  You would have them advancing learning and the Celtic language, but they had no opportunity of continuing. No opportunity was given them <Col N="1107" /> although there was work for them to do.  They found themselves cut away from that career in which they would naturally start.  You find them finally in business, and so on.  The country has lost considerably by that fact.  I did not want to bring it up here, as suggested by Deputy Dillon, that it is for one school alone.  That would not indicate what the purpose was.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Dillon that a number of other schools as well as theoretical physics might be added. The only question was that we had to make a beginning.  We had to choose that which is best for a beginning, that for which the best opportunity presented itself.  Medicine was mentioned. As a matter of fact some research work in medicine is being done. Medicine would be a very proper additional school at certain times in this institute, and for certain types of research work.  It was said that this was all humbug.  It can always be said of a thing that it is humbug if you do not understand it, and do not see what its value is going to be.  We have people saying that all pure science is humbug.  It must be realised that it has its application to practical life and that it has changed the whole world.  You have the pure scientist, and then practical people come on afterwards and apply it to the problems of life.  The pioneering work is done by an institute such as this, and afterwards you have those who are engaged in practical work taking up the ideas and immediately applying them and making them available for our life by providing greater facilities of various kinds.  Anyone can sneer at pure knowledge learned from scholarship.</P>

It is easy to call a thing &ldquo;humbug&rdquo; if you approach it from that point of view and if it cannot be immediately proven that there is bread and butter in it.  There is, ultimately, for the human race and for the people of every country, bread and butter in learning and knowledge and the pursuit of pure science.  I did not want to have in this scheme one school which would give the wrong impression that it was simply an additional organisation to promote Irish studies. It is intended to be something different.  It is a further stage in the general edifice of education and learning in this country and it is needed. It is intended to be a modest beginning but fairly representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked what mass of material remained to be done.  I do not pretend to be a Celtic scholar any more than I pretend to be a mathematician, but I have been assured by Irish scholars that a vast mass of material relating to early modern Irish requires to be worked over, edited and made available.  I have been told that the making of that material available by those workers who would be competent to do it would occupy a period of from ten to 20 years.  There would be no use in putting people to do work of that kind who were incompetent.  Competent <Col N="1109" /> workers have to be trained by competent directors and it will take from ten to 20 years to do the mass of material with anything like thoroughness. There is the production of grammars and dictionaries to be considered. That is as far as the school of Celtic studies is concerned.  By &ldquo;Celtic&rdquo;, I want it to be clearly understood, we mean more than merely Irish studies.  We are thinking of the related Celtic nations and we are anxious to hold our place, as I indicated at the start, as the chief centre for Celtic studies.  There was a time when the centre of Celtic studies was outside this country but, as time goes on, it is becoming more and more apparent that this country is the natural centre for Celtic studies and we have the men for the work.  In this school, the number of professors at the start would not be more than three. You are not to imagine a college like Trinity College or the Dublin College of the National University, with some thousands of students.  You are not to imagine a large edifice with dozens of classrooms.  All that is necessary is a private room for each professor and a couple of rooms for students, who may not be more than ten or 20 at a time.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of mathematical or theoretical physics, I indicated why that subject was chosen. It was chosen because there happened to be available a man who was described to me by a professor of mathematical physics in Dublin&mdash;himself a man of international reputation and standing&mdash;as being the greatest mathematical physicist in the world. Were it not for the war&mdash;this scheme was framed before that&mdash;another man of similar standing would have been available.  Three men were available who had been selected as members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in which, of all the scientists of the world, there are only 70 members.  Why should we lose such an opportunity as that when the expense was trifling and when we could have here a school to which people would come from all parts of the world if they wanted to be experts in certain branches of mathematical physics?  Relatively, the expense was trifling.  The opportunity <Col N="1110" /> was tremendous, and it was in line with our tradition as a country of great mathematical physicists.</P>

In modern times, you do want an additional stage to the edifice of education and learning in this country. You cannot do without it.  You talk about the teachers of the secondary schools.  You will not have good teachers in the secondary schools unless you have good professors in the universities.  You will not continue to have good professors in the universities unless you have institutions such as this to which they will go.  You will not have good teaching in the secondary schools or in the primary schools unless there is enthusiasm for learning on the part of the professors in the higher schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  These will be schools for advanced studies on the part of men who would be the material for professors, men such as we send out from the National University each year on travelling studentships to such institutions as this will be and to meet such masters of their subjects as these professors will be.  I am standing firm on the school of theoretical physics as one of the foundation schools.  I believe it will prove to be of great advantage to this country.  It will be the least expensive part of the scheme, and I am willing to wager that, if a dozen other schools are added, not one of them will be added with the same small expense.  With the two schools, you get a picture of the institute as it is going to be.  With one school, you get no such picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked what each of the schools would cost.  These things ought to begin modestly and be allowed to grow and develop naturally.  Taking in the whole cost of administration, the <Col N="1111" /> estimate for the early years is about £15,000.  If the scheme were working at the maximum which we can envisage at the present time, the cost would go to about £26,000.  When you think that we are already spending in this way in connection with agricultural science alone a sum of about £40,000, you begin to see how relatively small the expense of this institute, with its two schools, will be.  For the National University, we provide, I think, £160,000.  For the building for this institute, two or three houses of the type of the houses in Merrion Square would be sufficient. The work will not be that of ordinary teaching.  It will be the teaching of advanced students and the leading of them along lines of research, while enabling the professors themselves to proceed along the same lines.  For the reasons I stated, you cannot do research work in the universities at present.  When a professor is working at a class, a brilliant student may suggest something that is particularly interesting.  The professor cannot delay and pursue that interesting topic if it opens into a special subject.  If that happened with advanced students in the institute, they would immediately stop ordinary work and pursue a line of investigation of that sort.  In the university, students have to cover a definite course and suggestions of this kind could not be dealt with in the short time available.</P>
    <P>I have often had to come here and support something which was unpopular on the opposite benches.  The opposition of those Deputies is nothing new to me.  I am not by any means discouraged by finding opposition to this measure, but I am, in a sense, surprised by it.  I believe that the people will understand the work that we are doing, and that if, from time to time, in later years, there should be added in the framework which we have provided other schools, they would similarly support them because it has been the tradition of our people to have a regard for learning and for scholarship.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the goodwill of the universities will be available.  I <Col N="1112" /> have, of course, consulted with people who are experts in these subjects.  As a matter of fact, the basis of the Celtic studies proposals came from the Irish Studies Committee of the Royal Irish Academy.  There was a school of ancient Irish learning, but it was unable at a certain time to continue its work.  Some of the work was later being done by the universities. Its goodwill was passed over to the Academy, where the work is being continued.  I have been in consultation with the Committee and, very largely, the functions of the school are the result of communications which I have had with that body.  I believe we have the goodwill of the universities and the Academy and that we will have the goodwill of the people of Ireland as a whole.  I believe this institution will give results which will be altogether beyond anything in comparison with the money that will be spent on it.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides a period from 1st October, 1939, to 30th September, 1941. It is apparent to everybody that six months of that period have already gone by.  I suggest that the Minister ought to accept this amendment, which extends the period to 1944. There are two reasons for that amendment. The first is that the Minister is behind with this Bill and he was behind the last time a similar measure was brought in.  I suggest that it is a very short time for legislation of this kind, as we have now just a little more than 12 months to run.  A builder has to make extensive preparations and in that respect my proposal would steady the position and show any builder what he had to cope with over a number of years.  I suppose the Minister will tell us that by now the policy is settled and that in regard to these concessions which obtain for houses for people who can pay for them as opposed to others who cannot, it is most desirable they should continue and that this species of building work should be fostered.  I am sure the Minister will agree that a builder ought to have some reasonable period over which he can plan his work and for that reason it is desirable that this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  As Deputy Dockrell rightly points out, in this particular period it will be more difficult to get a building completed than it was pre-war. It is very difficult to get some materials delivered at the present moment, especially articles such as <Col N="1114" /> copper pipes and things of that kind. The holding up of building in consequence of the Bill going through in its present form may prevent many persons from getting grants.  I think the amendment is very reasonable and the Minister ought to accept it.  On an earlier stage I made reference to the point whether this remission referred to rates on houses built by a local authority and let on the hire purchase system.  I would like to know if the Minister has considered that point.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, those measures are purely temporary and have been regarded as such.  Last year, when a similar Bill was brought in, it extended the period for one year.  Probably when the period set out here expires, we will be coming with another measure asking for a further extension, but, of course, that will largely depend on circumstances then.  That is the only objection I have to the proposal made by Deputy Dockrell.  As it is only a temporary measure, we can again come to the House if the position has not changed and if encouragement is needed to help building.  As it is only a temporary measure, I do not think it is wise to put in a longer period.</P>

      <P>That would help considerably. I would be glad if the Minister would consider the point I raised. <Col N="1115" /> It would be an encouragement to local authorities to build houses to give to tenants on the hire purchase system. Recently, the Wexford Corporation completed a scheme of 14 houses.  They got no grant from the Government, and in consequence the rents charged had to be high.  You do find certain people who are prepared to take houses at those rents.  I suggest to the Minister that the remission of rates ought to apply to those houses in the same way as it applies to houses built by a public utility society.  The matter is an important one for local authorities, and I hope the Minister will consider it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (3), line 30, to add after the word &ldquo;year&rdquo; the words &ldquo;other than contributions levied <Col N="1116" /> under the Unemployment Assistance Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I referred to this matter on the Second Reading and I think I made the position clear.  The position under the Bill is that all the rates levied by a local authority, for whatever purposes, are remitted to the extent allowed by the Bill.  I am prepared to admit that it is for the ultimate benefit of a local authority that house building should take place and, therefore, that other people resident in a locality should bear a proportion of the rates on new houses in order to encourage building. Eventually that leads to an increase in the valuation of the area.  I cannot, at the same time, see that the same consideration applies to contributions under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, because in regard to these the local authority really only acts as a collector for the Government.  The local authority has to collect on the full value of the house.  I can see no possible justification for asking the older inhabitants of an area to pay more than the proper amount on their valuations in respect of these contributions, simply because there happen to be new buildings in the area.  I feel the Minister must see that there is commonsense in my argument, which is that new houses shall only have their rates remitted in so far as they relate to local services, but not to national contributions such as we are dealing with here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal to be said for the amendment. There was a good deal said on this arising out of the assessments made on local authorities for unemployment assistance purposes.  I do not think it would be unfair to anybody if these rates were allowed to be levied in full on every house.  This is a national charge, and I cannot see why a person living in an old house should be mulcted for this charge and the person in a new house allowed to escape, especially in view of the fact that the ratepayer in the old house, in addition to paying his own contribution, has to pay a portion of the assessment levied on the person in the new house.  I think the Minister ought seriously to consider the matter.</P>

      <P>If rates could be selected for new houses there might be some force in the arguments put forward in support of the amendment, but then it should apply to similar services to the one mentioned. As I understand it the basis for doing what is laid down in connection with the Unemployment Assistance Acts was this: that the local authorities were relieved of the payment of a certain amount of outdoor relief which they would have had to pay if the Unemployment Assistance Acts were not in operation.  The rate is raised only in towns with a population of 7,000 or over.  The county councils contribute by way of deduction from the Agricultural Grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said really makes the position worse. In Wexford, for instance, you have four urban areas&mdash;Gorey, Enniscorthy, New Ross and Wexford.  Because of the fact that Wexford town has a population of over 7,000 it has to pay, as one may put it, for all the rest. Surely that is not fair.  The same thing applies to the City of Dublin as compared with the County of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to prevent the taking away by one hand of something given by the other.  If there is a revaluation, it is important that houses which are now being given a concession should escape this provision for a few years.  The idea seems to prevail that a reduction in the valuation of houses enables somebody to <Col N="1118" /> get away with something&mdash;that he has perpetrated some fraud on the other ratepayers.  I want to repudiate that idea.  What I want to ensure is that, when a person embarks on the undertaking of buying a house, the burden for that person should be eased in the earlier years.  The whole object of the amendment is to induce people who are hesitating about closing a deal in the matter of house-buying to go ahead and do so.  The point may appear a small one, but I submit to the Minister and to the House that what I am seeking in the amendment is elementary justice.  If a house is entitled to a concession of rates for four years, it ought to get that concession whether revaluation takes place or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. The main purpose of it is to amend the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, so as to exclude from its operation the posts of nurses and midwives under local authorities. Since the Local Appointments Commissioners were established they have recommended 1,782 nurses, including 398 midwives, for appointment, a number which is equal to one-half of all the statutory recommendations made. Last year the number recommended for these offices was 138, of which 99 were recommendations of hospital nurses, four of public health nurses, 11 of matrons and head nurses and 24 of midwives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last two years there has been a falling off in the numbers of applicants for permanent nursing posts under local authorities.  Some nurses seem to prefer temporary appointments under public authorities or private practice, as the remuneration for such employment is generally higher than that offered for permanent posts.  In some institutions, such as the Dublin Fever Hospital, which are training centres for fever nursing, it is understood that it would be easier to recruit the permanent nursing staff from <Col N="1120" /> nurses with general medical and surgical training who have completed their period of fever training in the institutions than by reference to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In present conditions and with the prospect of the demand for nursing services becoming greater it will facilitate local bodies if they are able to offer nurses immediate employment in permanent posts.  There will still be cases in which reference to the Local Appointments Commissioners would be advisable. This is particularly so in regard to higher nursing posts such as matron and sister tutor, in respect of which special qualifications and experience are necessary.  It will be open to the Minister after the passing of this Bill to make a declaration applying the Act of 1926 to such posts.  It is desirable that these declarations should be reviewed from time to time and if necessary the Minister should be able to revoke any declaration made.  For this purpose Section 3 has been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A further amendment relates to the maximum period for which a person temporarily appointed under Section 5 of the Act of 1926 can hold office.  This was fixed for six months.  It has been found in practice that appointments cannot always be made within that period, sometimes owing to delay in making the application, sometimes owing to difficulty in getting a person with the requisite qualifications or other reasons.  When the permanent appointment is not made within the time fixed there is no other course open but to continue a temporary arrangement. The removal of the limit will not lead to the undue prolongation of temporary appointments.  The power given by Section 6 of the Act to the Minister to move on behalf of the local authority is sufficient to prevent permanent appointments being indefinitely held up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on his reasons for introducing this Bill, and I am not satisfied that he has made a case for its introduction.  He has not told us that the machinery for the <Col N="1121" /> working of the Act was unsatisfactory or that the local authorities were dissatisfied with what they got; he has not given us any reason for its introduction. Personally, I always felt it was most unfair to nurses to be brought up to Dublin at their own expense and to be charged a fee when they went before the Local Appointments Commission. There might be nine or ten nurses applying for one position and very often a nurse had to come to Dublin several times.  These were girls with limited means.  There was a strong case to be made on those grounds.  Representations have been made to me&mdash;I cannot vouch for their accuracy&mdash;that since the publication of this Bill, nurses who had already been making arrangements for getting further qualifications such as the C.M.B. have dropped their course of studies because of the fact that they would not now have to go before the Appointments Commissioners and that they would be able to get appointments without the further qualifications that used to be looked for by the Appointments Commissioners.  I do agree that under the existing system we were getting nurses with better qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that during the time of the Local Appointments Commissioners, 1,782 nurses had been appointed.  He did not tell us if there was any drawback in any way, or that the Local Appointments Commissioners were not satisfied.  Some people suggest that the reason for the Bill was because of the fact that there were to be county managers and that in the future there will be no more boards of health.  It seems the Minister is going to trust the county managers to make the selections.  He would not trust the members of the boards of health to do so.  The Minister has not really given the House a case for the change.  I think it is quite right that the Minister is retaining for the Appointments Commissioners a certain number of appointments. I say that because I am afraid that if local influence is going to have any say in the appointments the standard of the qualification of the nurses will not be raised.  The Appointments Commission have done it.  They <Col N="1122" /> have raised the standard of qualification.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is reasonable, and I am glad the Minister has put it in, because very often boards of health are not in a position, for one reason or another, to make a permanent appointment on a particular day, and that had to be met in that way.  I am disappointed, however, with the case the Parliamentary Secretary made for the Bill. In fact, I do not think he made a case at all.  He simply said that the work that was done in the past was going to be done in another way now.  He has not told us why.  He has not given any reason why it should not be done by the commission.  I should like that the Local Government Department would be satisfied that the standards demanded by the Appointments Commission will be maintained, and that there will be the same incentive and impetus to acquire those degrees and higher standards of efficiency in the future as there was in the past.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan complains that I did not put any reasons before the House in justification of this measure.  I stated that since the Local Appointments Commissioners were appointed they have recommended 1,782 nurses, including 398 midwives, for appointment, a number which was equal to one-half of the statutory recommendations made.  If the number of nurses recommended for appointment since the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act was passed is in fact half the total of the statutory appointments made, that must indicate quite clearly to the House that there have been frequent changes.  These frequent changes arise very largely from persons getting married.  The local authorities have not been satisfied because of the continual dislocation of their services by nurses resigning very shortly after appointment, and the Local Appointments Commissioners have not found the scheme satisfactory as far as nurses are concerned for the reason that competition has been falling off.</P>

      <P>It will not.  It is not intended that it should.  The Deputy will see that, at any rate, when a nursing vacancy occurs in a public institution it can be filled with considerably less delay than it can be filled in present circumstances.  I referred to the particular difficulty of the Dublin Fever Hospital.  The Dublin Fever Hospital take in trained nurses for fever training.  They have found by actual experience that nurses are reluctant to go in for fever training if there is not an almost certain prospect that when they get that training they will be appointed on the staff of the hospital for a time at any rate.  They have experienced more difficulty in that regard I think than any other institution.  So far as the standard of qualification is concerned, it will not be altered.  The standard of qualification will still obtain.  The qualifications for the vacancy will be laid down when the post is advertised.  I <Col N="1124" /> suppose it may be assumed that a county manager, to whom Deputy Hurley referred, will exercise a wise discretion in still continuing to select the most highly qualified candidates presenting themselves for the posts.</P>

But, whether a nurse who has a C.M.B. and fever qualification, will be accepted over a nurse who has not these qualifications is a thing I am not satisfied about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there has been a lot of talk about the great increase in the cost of the Guards I propose to deal with that in my opening statement in order to clear up some misunderstanding, because I believe it is a genuine misunderstanding of the real position.  I propose to deal at length with that in my opening statement.  There is another item to which I should like to draw attention and that is the Rule-making Committee.  In item 84, page 143, we propose to provide £300 for legal and technical assistance in connection with that.  Last year the sum was £500.  This sum is required to meet drafting fees in connection with the revision of the High Court rules.  Provision for this was first made in this Vote for the year 1938-39 when it was considered that the work of revision would take two years at a total cost of about £1,000.  A sum of £500 was provided for that purpose for that year, but very little of it was used.  Last year a little over £300 was used.  The <Col N="1126" /> pace at which the work is progressing depends on the time which the Rule-making Committee are able to devote to it.  Having regard to their other duties, it is estimated that it will take two years until, say, 1940-41, to complete the work and that a provision of £300 will be sufficient to meet the requirements in each year.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal at length with the reason for the large increase in the cost of the Guards so that the matter will be finally cleared up.  The sum is about £211,000 more than it was in 1932 when we took over from the last Government.  People would naturally infer from that that there has been a very large increase in the number of Guards.  Really that is not the position. When I became Minister for Justice at the beginning of last September, the total strength of the Guards was about the same as when the late Government went out of office.  In fact, it was one less than it was in 1932.  Of course, there was a big increase in 1933-34 and 1934-35, something like 600 men being taken into the force at a time when there was trouble and it was considered necessary to recruit.  Since then there was practically no recruiting.  The wastage and loss for different reasons averages about 80 annually.  On the 31st March, 1932, all ranks numbered 7,099 and on the 31st August, 1939, 7,098 so that the numbers were actually one less.  The peak was reached early in 1935 when the numbers were 7,447 all ranks, from the Commissioner down.  The entire cost during the financial year 1938-39 exceeded the cost in 1932-33 by £211,000. About £20,000 might be attributed to the increased numbers&mdash;100 men. Actually on the date I became Minister the numbers were less, but during 1938 there were 100 more men in the Guards than when we took over from the previous Government.</P>

      <P>As a matter of policy I am anxious to clear up what I consider to be a misunderstanding of the reason for the big increase.  When dealing with the Gárda Síochána I will deal with the present year.  Of the £211,000 extra, £20,000 is accounted for by the extra number of men. One of the main factors about the increase in cost is that this is a new force.  Most of the Guards when they joined were at the minimum pay, which was £2 10s., but they get increments until the ordinary Guard reaches a maximum of £4 3s. That item alone accounts for £54,000. A time will come, when the force is well established, when incoming men will balance those who are leaving and the position will be static.  The young men get an increment every year. Another item swelled the accounts during that year.  It may be called politics, if you like.  I am trying to answer the case that has been made, that we have unduly increased the cost, and I think I am entitled to explain the reason, so that if people refer to it again they will know what has happened and cannot do so in ignorance. An item of £36,000 arose that would not be paid normally in that year. The practice was to pay all Guards outside the Dublin metropolitan area monthly, but a petition was sent to the <Col N="1128" /> Government to make payments twice monthly.  That was done and, as a result, £36,000 was paid out in the middle of March on account of the pay for that month and fell as a charge on the account for that year, so that in that financial year we paid all the pay for March, 1938, and a large portion of the pay for March, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That fortnightly payment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Guards were not satisfied, and afterwards thought the old system better.  The change did not last very long.  It did not mean any extra cost eventually, but in that particular year it did. Another item was the partial restoration of boot allowance of £2 a year, which amounted to something like £12,000.  A new allowance was granted to Irish speaking members of the force serving in Irish speaking districts. Certain escort duties were taken over by the Gárdaí from the military and that not only affected the man-power but involved increased expenditure in transport.  The cost of uniforms increased and also materials, as well as the allowance to the men for making them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the amount of that item?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The boot allowance was £12,000, clothing and equipment, £8,000; Gaeltacht allowance, £6,000; miscellaneous items, £9,000.  Another big item was the rent allowance.  The fact is that the Guards have changed very largely from being an unmarried to a married force, and the increase in rent expenditure amounted to something like £50,000.  These are the chief items.  Rent and increments account for about £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a recent increase this year.  More men are getting the rent allowance, according as Guards get married.  What it means is that more Guards are married now than in 1932.  That item accounts for £50,000.</P>

      <P>Whether the money was spent by the provious Minister or by the present Minister does not interest me in the slightest.  If the present Minister boasts that he is chucking money away, right, left and centre, and that he got the Guards handed over to him in splendid trim from his predecessor, that is a matter for him.  Leaving out the Taca Síochána altogether, I find that, in the year 1931-32, there were 1,233 sergeants and 5,443 Guards.  In the previous year, 1930-31, there were 1,245 sergeants and 5,493 Guards.  This year I find that there are 1,243 sergeants and 5,873 men. There is, therefore, an increase of ten sergeants and of 430 men, irrespective of the new force.  How the Minister reconciles those figures with the figures he has given, I frankly confess I do not understand.  If the Minister is correct in saying that the force was reduced at one period last year by one man, then he must have taken in 400 new Guards.</P>

We were spending then about £1,500,000.  Our critics, who told us how we should economise, how the country could be run with fewer guards, have come into office and the result is that the Vote for this year has gone up almost to the £2,000,000 mark.

      <P>If my attitude was not understood, I cannot help it.  As regards the Estimate for the Gárda Síochána, it shows a net increase of almost exactly £36,000 as compared with the Estimate for last year, but the printed figures do not show the true position very clearly.  On page 147 it will be observed that the largest individual increase is a sum of £52,877 for salaries, wages and pay, and the largest individual saving is one of £30,790, under the heading of clothing and equipment.  Both figures require explanation if the actual facts are to be understood.  As regards salaries, wages and pay, the only figure with which the present Estimate can be compared for purposes of effective criticism is not the 1938-39 Estimate, either in its original form or in the revised form as reproduced in the present Estimate, but the actual 1938-39 cost.  That was what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was talking about in connection with the Estimate in 1931.  There is always a difference between the Estimate and the actual cost, and the Deputy should know that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is always an Estimate for more than are actually serving.  I admit the Estimate is very confusing this year, more so than in other years.  It would take a memorandum to explain it clearly to everybody. Perhaps I should have circulated a memorandum to show exactly how the different items were made up. As regards the 1938-39 cost, to which I have referred, this actual cost will not, of course, be officially known for some months, but I am informed that it will probably work out at about £1,564,000. The estimate for salaries, wages and pay for the present year, 1940-41, is £1,605,500, an increase of £41,500 over the approximate cost for last year. About £19,000 of this increase is due to increments.  The balance, a figure between £22,000 and £23,000, is caused by the fact that the increase in personnel due to the recruitment of 300 Taca Síochána which took place partly in September, 1939, and partly in February and March, 1940, will persist right through the present year and will therefore cost more than twice as much as it did last year, when it was effective for less than six months.  I want to clear up the point about the numbers that appear in the Estimate this year.  The figure 300 is included twice.  It is included for a half-year in both cases.  At the top of page 149 the cost of the Taca is stated at £23,400. That is for half a year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are only entitled, according to the Order under which the Taca Síochána were established, to keep them there for a year unless we get further authority.  All we are entitled to do, unless we change the Order, is to keep them for 12 <Col N="1135" /> months from the period on which the Order is made.  It would require a new Order, if they are not absorbed into the Guards.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney read out a figure of 5,873 and he added 300 to that.  The same 300 is in the first figure for another half-year. I wonder have I made that clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ask me to do even simple arithmetic of that sort when I am making a speech&mdash;it is hardly fair.  We have the 300 men here for one half-year and they are over on the other side of the paper for another half-year.  These are really accountancy matters that I should not have bothered about.  If I were wise I would have moved the Vote and not tried to explain it so fully.  I merely wanted to enlighten people as much as I could.  I do not blame the Deputy for making a mistake, but the fact is that he counted 300 men twice.  We provided them for a half-year as Taca, and if we require them in the next half-year they will have to be in as ordinary Guards or another Order will have to be made.  That is as well as I can explain that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the apparent large decrease under subhead E&mdash;Clothing &mdash; this requires some qualification.  The original Estimate for 1939-40 was about £33,000, practically the same as the present Estimate.  The actual expenditure was about £40,000.  The figure £64,170 which appears here as last year's Estimate is taken from the Supplementary Estimate passed in February of this year.  It really meant that as we had money to spare on this Vote as a whole we asked permission <Col N="1136" /> of the Dáil, by way of Supplementary Estimate, to spend some of the savings on cloth, if we could get it, by way of reserves.  We anticipated a big rise in the price of cloth and tried to get in a reserve stock.  In fact, we spent only £6,000 extra.  Similarly we got permission to spend about £6,500 on wireless equipment.  We were not able to spend it last year, but hope to be able to get the equipment this year and are making provision for it.  The only other item that I need call attention to is the very large figure for rent allowance&mdash;£125,425.  That is what it will mean for sergeants and Guards who are married.  The corresponding figure for 1932-33 was £57,500.  The increase is due largely to the fact that there are now a great many more married men in the Guards than there were at that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the practice to do it in that form because, so far as I understand, it is not possible to estimate exactly how many men will be in the Guards in a particular year.  Six thousand is the figure allowed for.  I think the Deputy raised this matter on the Supplementary Estimate, and following that I tried to get the Department to give an estimate that would be nearer to the actual strength.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I admit that this is an estimate, surely the Minister could approximate more closely to what the figure would be at the end of a year.  In the book of Estimates before us we have two figures: for 1939-40, 7,914; and for 1940-41, 7,790. Where did the Minister get these figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an estimate, and does not represent the actual strength at all.  The number on the last day of March was 7,049.  The figures in the Estimate, and the figures that reflect the actual position, are never the same.  You had the figure of 6,000 for several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for last year was 7,614.  Since then 300 have been added which, I take it, would bring the strength up to date.  I suggest to the Minister that at some period covering these two years the correct figure ought to be found.  It would be a good thing, in connection with the Guards, that we should get some figure giving the strength, at some particular date, that would be correct.  I imagine that the nearest approximate date the Minister could take would be the 31st December of the current year.  If we had that we would know where we were.  I would be glad if the Minister would consider that, and see if it was possible to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

I do not know how far it will be possible to get a more accurate figure than we have been giving, but I will have the matter examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's sheet anchor seems to be that the Estimates of the Department are all nonsense.  According to him, one would gather that the Commissioner of the Guards and the officials of the Department are capable of going hundreds wrong in their estimate of the number of men likely to be in the Guards during the year. I agree with the Minister that a small margin must always be allowed for error.  I quite understand that when you make an estimate of, let us say, 6,000, you must allow for normal wastage by death and resignations during the year.  The estimate given may be exceeded, or it may fall short by a small number.  I could understand the Minister saying that at the end of the year, apart from abnormal recruitment, you might have 25 or 30 men less than you estimated for at the beginning of the year; but that there could be anything so substantial as 400 men or thereabouts between 1931 and this year is absolutely impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened at one time to know something about this particular Estimate. I happened to know the care with which the figures were gone into; how closely the Commissioner calculated, and if there was going to be an error of 300 or 400 in the number of men who were to be employed in the course of the year there would certainly be a volcanic eruption; nothing of that kind ever happened.  Leaving out this question of these 300 men who may or may not be employed, you will find at the end of this year that that figure is within 10 or 15 an accurate figure, because the normal wastage has been allowed.  Wastage has got easier now because the number of resignations is less than formerly.  When a man has been four or five years in the Guards he is much more likely to resign than is the man who has been 15, 17 or 18 years in them.  No amount of explanation from the Minister can get away from the hard fact that he is estimating <Col N="1139" /> this year for £339,232 more than was estimated for in the year ending 1931. Every single item shows a large increase. You cannot get away from those figures.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister explain what is the cause and what is the meaning for the strange departure of enlisting temporary police.  Has this procedure been a success?  Personally I would imagine that in no force could temporary men be more unsatisfactory than in the Gárda.  I do not believe in having that number of temporary Guards at all.  The scheme is a bad one, no matter how excellently the Gárdaí may be selected, no matter with what care the Commissioner goes through the list of applicants, no matter how sternly he may turn a deaf ear to the representations as to so and so and as to why he should be taken on and why so and so might be left out. When in addition to that you get a number of men in insecure positions, how do you expect to get a proper discharge of their work from them?  They are men who might be said to have nothing to lose.  Have they had a definite undertaking that they will be taken into the Gárdaí?  If this were regarded as a probationary period something might be said for it, but it would still be unsatisfactory even with that much to say in its favour.  At the present moment I cannot understand how anything can be said in its favour. No proof has been given that these men were wanted.  But if they were wanted they were wanted to do ordinary police work.  If they were not wanted then they should not be recruited at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have a very considerable amount of dissatisfaction if he suspends this force of Taca Síochána and takes them into the regular Gárdaí.  The reason I say that is that I find here an estimate of a certain number of Gárdaí whose remuneration starts from 50/- and others from 60/-.  Will the Minister say how quickly they rise from 50/- to 60/-?  I do know that the Taca Síochána at the present moment are getting 60/-.  So if they are taken into the Guards I presume they will immediately be reduced <Col N="1140" /> to 50/-.  The regular Guards will be given 50/- instead of 60/-.  That is what they are getting at the present minute.  I think the Minister will find it is a very bad thing to reduce to such a very large extent the wages of men in the position of the Gárdaí.  I say that because the Gárdaí have a certain standard to keep up.  They are living at that certain standard. Possibly one may say they are living at too high a standard.  But these men at 50/- a week will have to live at the same standard as the men who have been years in the force and are getting very nearly twice that amount.  I do not see how that can be done.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret, but it is a matter which cannot be new to the Minister that there is a very considerable number of Guards at the present moment who have not been able to make ends meet on their present salaries and who are badly in debt. There are Guards who have been unfortunate enough to get themselves into the hands of money lenders.  That is a matter of public knowledge.  That knowledge is going to be very much worse when you have men starting off at 50/- a week and trying to live up to the standard of other men who are getting far beyond 50/- a week.  The position of such men would be very much like that of the officer who with a very small private income went into a crack cavalry regiment and who had to live in the regiment the same as the others were living or else become a semi-outcast.  That will be the position of one of these recruits.  A man of that kind will either have to be in debt or live like a semi-anchorite. Nothing could be worse than a Guard getting into debt, because he gets into the control of his creditor and very often that creditor will exert his control to prevent the Guard from doing his work.  There is one other point to which I wish to refer.  There was one statement made which filled me with despair.  So far as I understand the Minister said that we were not going to have the High Court rules or the Circuit Court rules available for two years.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>Possibly we may be able to wait for the High Court rules.  The drawing up of these rules is an enormous undertaking.  Speaking on that subject, I would suggest to the Minister that when the High Court rules are ready, if he is still in office, he would consider a grant-in-aid of the publication annotating an edition of the High Court rules.  The last annotated edition of the High Court rules was drawn up by Judge Wylie, then Mr. J.O. Wylie.  That was something like 30 years ago.  It is a big book and an expensive book.  Such a book could not very well be brought out unless there is a Government grant-in-aid. Perhaps I am digressing now from the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a special Vote about the rules of court.  It is, however, very unsatisfactory that the Circuit Court rules are not now ready.  The Circuit Court rules are not at all as voluminous as the High Court rules.  There is a crying need for the Circuit Court rules.  Above all things, there is a crying need for a revision of the scale of costs in certain items in the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I brought this matter up a couple of years ago.  I pointed out to the then Minister, who had, of course, personal knowledge of the matter, that the scale of costs in certain classes of cases, such as title cases, actions for slander, and actions for assault, were ridiculously high.  If a man wishes to litigate a thing like a right-of-way, over a £4 or £5 valuation holding in the County Mayo, he may, if he is unsuccessful, find himself faced with a loss of £60 or £70.  The costs are completely and entirely out of proportion to the value of the question at issue.  Of course, when I gave that figure, I meant his own costs and the costs he had to pay to the other side.  That is really closing the courts to a large number of persons who have not got the money to litigate. Again, a decree for a couple of pounds in an assault case will carry costs, if it goes to appeal, which may be two-thirds of the High Court scale.  A decree for a couple of pounds in an <Col N="1142" /> assault case may again carry some £50 or £60 in costs.</P>
    <P>I am not going right through the schedule of fees, but a revision of the schedule is urgently required.  In some respects they may be too low, but, in the certain things which I have put forward, they are in my judgment a great deal too high.  It is very disheartening that, at the end of two years, a comparatively easy thing like that has not been settled.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the scale of fees fixed for the High Court on circuit has been simply taken from the scale of fees for the Circuit Court.  Surely the rules for the High Court on circuit might be dealt with.  Is anybody drafting rules now for appeals from the Circuit Court to the High Court on circuit?</P>

      <P>I feel that the Minister has treated the House with scant courtesy on this particular Vote for one of the most important Departments of State.  It is customary at a time like this, when the Minister is introducing his Vote, to give a general survey of the conditions that obtain throughout the country as far as the maintenance of law and order is concerned and how he regards the conditions in the country.  A survey is made to satisfy the taxpayers as to the conditions obtaining all over the country.  The Minister in this case has failed to give any general survey of that nature, and I think that before he concludes he should give a survey of the conditions obtaining over the country.  There are rumours going around of various types and kinds.  Speaking here on the Special Powers Act and on the Public Safety Act, if it may be so described, the Minister said that he was aware, and that Deputies were aware, of organisations that existed in the country which were out for the destruction or disruption of the State.  The Department of Justice, above any other Department, is in a position to know what the conditions are, and the Minister, in my opinion, when speaking on this Vote, should give the House and the country an indication of the conditions now obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> There are several points I should like to touch upon, but for various reasons I think it is better not to do so.  The Minister could very properly say that, because of certain circumstances, it would be better not to touch upon them.  Therefore, I am only mentioning them so as to leave the House, and you, Sir, under no misapprehension, and to say that if it were possible to do so at this particular time, I would touch upon them.  I shall take some other opportunity to deal with them at a later date.  Certain circumstances which have arisen are due, I think, to the mishandling of the situation by the Minister for Justice.  I think that the sooner the Government and the Minister for Justice make a clear statement upon their intentions, the better for the country generally, for the maintenance of law and order, and for the easing off of a certain situation, of which I am sure he is perfectly well aware.</P>
    <P>As to the Gárda Síochána Vote, I do not know that the House is satisfied with the method of recruitment for the new Taca Síochána.  The Minister may very well tell us that recruitment was left solely to the Commissioner's discretion. I do not know whether that is right or not, but it is very hard to see how the selections were made.  Very fine young fellows, who were on the waiting list for long periods, and who were up to the requisite physical and educational standard, were passed over.  I heard of other young fellows, some of them perhaps as good, but a number of them very much below the standard of those to whom I refer, who were accepted though they were not examined.  The Commissioner must have taken them either on the reports of the local Guards or on a report from some other source as to their physical and educational qualifications, because I am aware no local examination was held before they were called to headquarters, and I do not know that any great number of them were rejected when they went to headquarters.  I should like the Minister to tell us the number actually called and the number actually accepted under that particular system of recruitment&mdash;how they were called, what were the numbers, and <Col N="1146" /> what guided the Commissioner in calling them.</P>
    <P>The question of transport is also a very serious matter, in my opinion. Unfavourable comments have been made all over the country as to the number of cars which are now used by the Gárda for the conveyance of Ministers and their escorts.  I think the Minister for Justice and the Government would be very well advised to see to it that there is no extravagant use made of transport.  Prior to the change of Government charges were made that Army transport was being used for certain unauthorised purposes. Now, I regret to say, the comment is made that the Gárda transport is being used for the same purposes without the checks that were formerly applied by the Department of Defence.  The Minister would be well advised to see to it that no unauthorised use of transport is made by the members of the Government or other civilian personnel.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the housing accommodation provided for Guards throughout the country.  Very difficult situations have arisen in various districts where married Guards have been transferred.  It is, of course, in the interests of the force and the interests of discipline that Guards should be transferred, but when a married Guard is transferred from station A to station B, and has to take with him his wife and family, it sometimes happens that there is no house for him at station B.  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction because there is no housing accommodation available for such Guards.  I think that, as the number of Guards required for each station is pretty well established, the Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, should take some steps to secure suitable housing accommodation so that you will not have temporary divorces between Guards and their wives in several districts.  It is not in accordance with Christian principles or with the principles enshrined in the Consitution that such a situation should arise.  When a Guard is transferred it should be possible for him to take his wife and family and all his equipage <Col N="1147" /> with him.  They should not be left separated for months looking for a house or else a new station.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Registry of Deeds, I have had several complaints in regard to deeds and maps.  It is said that it is almost impossible to get a map out of the Land Registry for months, and to get anything out of the Registry of Deeds seems to take practically a year. It is alleged that that is due to the lack of writing staff, that the staff is not large enough.  Several solicitors in the Midlands have complained to me bitterly about the delay in getting returns of deeds and maps.  In sales and transfers of land, that is a very important question and there should not be unnecessary delays.  If an addition to the staff is required the Minister should see that that addition is provided.</P>
    <P>The rent allowances for Guards, I am informed, while adequate in some cases, are inadequate in others.  I do not know how the Minister could get over that, but I suggest that boards of health and other local authorities, who undertake the building of labourers' cottages, should be authorised to build a few houses in every village or town where there is a Gárda station, for the accommodation of Guards.  If a Guard makes application for a labourers' cottage in present circumstances, there is a hubbub about it.  Complaint is made that Guards and all manner of people can get cottages while workers and others wanting houses cannot get them.  The result is that local authorities will not allot these houses to Guards.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another question, the question of clothing.  The Minister mentioned that he attempted to purchase a reserve of material and he said that he could get only £6,000 worth. That is very small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is £6,000 worth extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very small reserve.  A situation could arise which the Minister might find it very awkward to meet and he should take <Col N="1148" /> steps to put that position right. Finally, I want to ask the Minister this personal question: is he satisfied that the members of the new force are the best type of young fellows he could get in the country and is he satisfied that there were no others available who had a prior claim upon the Government of this State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeatedly, on Votes here in connection with the Gárda Síochána, members of this Party have raised the matter of the cut that was made in their salaries some years ago. It will be remembered that a cut was made in the Gárda salaries during the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Prior to this Government coming into office they themselves took occasion, when this Vote was under consideration, and throughout the country on other occasions, to draw the attention of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to the fact that it was impossible for the Gárdaí to live on the salaries they were then getting. I remember one particular time when the Fianna Fáil representatives on the public bodies&mdash;county councils and corporations &mdash;all over the country made a desperate drive in order to secure that the salary of the Gárda would be restored; but now, when an opportunity presents itself to the Fianna Fáil Government to restore that cut, we cannot see any evidence that they have any notion of restoring it.  On the contrary, they have brought in a scale now which, to my mind, is an absolute disgrace.  We note that, so far as entrance to the Gárda Síochána now is concerned, a Guard on appointment is to start at 40/- per week. Under the current rate it was 50/-. Prior to the cut referred to it was 60/- or 70/- per week.  I do not see that any Government could justify the establishing of a police force on a salary of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The police officer, the Gárda, is supposed to be an independent man, supposed to keep himself free from corruption and not to be susceptible to corruption or representation of any kind.  I want to ask the Minister if he thinks he will be able to get the type of person who will answer to that for a commencing salary of 40/- per week. <Col N="1149" /> I suggest that it is absolutely impossible. I also suggest that the Government are taking advantage of the employment position that prevails here in fixing a low rate of wages like that for new entrants into the Gárda.  We know quite well that any position that offers itself at the moment, such as the Gárda Síochána, even though wages are small, will find plenty of young men willing to enter, because of the fact that very little employment offers in the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>In 1919, in consequence of several crises and strong representations made both in Great Britain and Ireland, a commission was set up to examine the then British police wages and those of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  The result of that was that a large increase was made in the salary or pay of the then R.I.C.  So far as Great Britain and Northern Ireland are concerned, that salary still prevails, but there is a considerable difference between it and that of the Gárda Síochána.  In Britain and Northern Ireland the constable on appointment starts at 70/- per week; after one year it is 72/-; after two years, 74/-; and so on up to ten years, when he gets 90/-; in 20 years it is 92/6; and in 22 years, 95/-. In this country at the moment&mdash;not taking into consideration the new pay order&mdash;the Guard starts at 50/-; after completion of training it is 60/-; after one year's appointment, 62/- and in ten years it is only 78/-, as against 90/- in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. After 20 years he reaches 80/6, as against 20 years in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 92/6, a difference of 12/-; after 22 years in this country it is 83/- as against 95/- in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I would ask the Minister why there is such a difference between the pay of the Gárda Síochána here and that of the police in the North.</P>
    <P>I submit also that, to get a proper type of Guard, and keep him incorrupt and efficient, there must be contentment in service, and that can only be obtained by satisfying the man in the amount of money he will be paid per week.  The new scale is absolutely ridiculous.  A man starts at 40/- per week.  I presume that he is charged <Col N="1150" /> for his keep; that would be at least 25/- weekly, which would leave him about 15/- weekly.  A good number of these people would be in Dublin or other cities or towns where the cost of living is pretty high and, apart altogether from the food and lodging, his expenses otherwise would be pretty high.  To suggest that a man occupying the position of a policeman could live on that salary is absolutely ridiculous. I think the Government are making a big mistake in trying to establish a police force on conditions such as those outlined in the new pay order.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin has referred to a matter which I have also repeatedly raised in this House&mdash;the question of the housing of the Gárda.  We know quite well that the Gárdaí are being fleeced all over the country.  When a married Gárda is transferred from one town to another he finds himself unable to procure a house; he has to go into lodgings, and is sometimes charged anything from 20/- to 25/- a week for a room or two.  I have repeatedly suggested that the Minister for Justice should build a certain number of houses in each of the towns, at least in those over a certain population, and then when a married Guard would be transferred from one town to another the man coming in in his stead would be able to take up the house he vacated.  I submitted a housing scheme to the Department of Justice when Deputy Ruttledge was Minister for Justice, showing how that could be done economically and showing that it would cost the Government very little. I cannot understand why grants should not be made available to the Gárda Síochána in the same way as grants are made available to local authorities and others, to enable houses to be built in each of the towns and cities, so that the Gárdaí could be housed properly.</P>
    <P>I would ask the present Minister for Justice to go into that question again. It has led to a great deal of discontent amongst the Gárdaí.  As Deputy MacEoin has said, it has been responsible very often for separating a man from his wife and family.  That is prevailing to-day just as it did in the past: <Col N="1151" /> as a matter of fact, it is prevailing to a greater extent, as a greater proportion of the Gárda Síochána is married now compared with four or five years ago.  Ten or 12 years ago it was a young force with very few married men; now, I suggest, the majority is married, and the difficulties of housing have increased. When a man is changed from one place to another, and had a house in the place where he changed from, he finds no house available in the new town, and is separated from his wife and family.  He is discontented, and cannot do his duty properly.  It is a very serious matter for the Gárda Síochána, for the Department of Justice, and also for the Government as a whole.  There is not going to be a contented police force until some kind of housing system is established to cater for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin also referred to the question of the land registry.  I have also complaints to make in that matter. It takes a considerable time for entries to be made in the land registry.  I have here before me a letter from a solicitor in connection with a tenant on an estate in County Wexford.  The person who is seeking this piece of land was trying to get it in order to build a house for himself on it.  He was assured of a grant from the Local Government Department.  He was assured of a loan from the county councils, but he was unable to get the land vested in time to enable him to take advantage of the grant and the loan within the period stipulated by the Housing Act.  The holding was vested by an entry of the 7th July, 1939, and up to now no entry has been made in the land registry in respect of the holding. The result of that is that, unless it is done very speedily, this man will lose both the grant and the loan which would enable him to build a house for himself, which he is very anxious to do. I suggest that a holding that was vested last July should certainly be entered in the land registry by now. No reasonable case could be put forward to justify a delay of nine or ten months.  I would ask the Minister to try and get these things speeded up. In one case in my county such a delay <Col N="1152" /> has been responsible for a man losing both the grant and a loan which would enable him to build a house, because the Local Government Department will not permit of a house being built on land which is not properly vested, and held in fee simple by the person who is seeking to build the house.</P>
    <P>There is nothing else I want to say, only to again repeat that in my opinion the Government should take steps to restore the cut to the Gárdaí.  We are living in times now when food prices have advanced enormously.  The Gárda Síochána are feeling that position very seriously, especially in the cities and large towns.  The Government now ought to take advantage of the position they are in to ratify what they considered to be an injustice before they themselves came into office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney mentioned a while ago the question of the costs in the Circuit Court, and I would like to put one point to the Minister in regard to that. Everybody admits that the scale of costs in the Circuit Court, particularly as regards minor actions, is entirely too high, and, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said, it shuts the door to certain people who cannot afford to go in there.  I think the Minister will understand when I put it this way: A certain type of action which is for more than £10 must go into the Circuit Court.  An action arising out of a very minor motor accident, an action arising out of an assault case where the damages are more than £10, any action in tort where the damages claimed exceed £10, is outside the District Court jurisdiction. Whenever the claim is for more than £10 it immediately runs into the high scale of costs in the Circuit Court. The new rules of the Circuit Court are not so very long in existence, and I think it has been the experience of everybody that the scale is too high. There might be an alternative, if it were possible to consider it, altering the present position, and dealing with the matter in an entirely different way. Since the new courts were established in this country the District Court system has given universal satisfaction. The answer to the whole problem as to the expense may be that the Minister <Col N="1153" /> would consider increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court in actions in tort to the same level as the District Court has jurisdiction in actions in contract, that would be to the sum of £25. To give an example to the Minister: We will assume that the Minister is involved in a motor accident with somebody else's car.  The damage to the Minister's car is £11.  To recover that £11 he has got to go into the Circuit Court, because it exceeds the District Court jurisdiction of £10.  If the jurisdiction in tort of the District Court were extended to £25, which is the contract jurisdiction in the District Court, it would probably get over a lot of the difficulties that have arisen and would remove many of the hardships imposed on poor people by the high scale in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>Another point arises on the very same lines.  If the Minister examines the District Court rules and the District court jurisdiction as originally established he will find that the District Court has a certain amount of jurisdiction in title.  Everybody knows from experience of the legal decisions based on the interpretation of the 1924 Courts of Justice Act and the District Court rules that a District Court decision on title in anyone's favour is practically a decision without prejudice and not worth the paper it is written on.  I believe that the District Courts have been a great success in this country. Litigants, practitioners and everybody else have been satisfied that they have been a most outstanding success, and I believe that anyone in the country who has experience of District Court practice would agree that the extension of the District Court jurisdiction in tort to the same level as the jurisdiction in contract would be of benefit particularly to the poorer people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One rather peculiar thing has happened here recently&mdash;I do not know if the Minister is aware of it or not&mdash;in regard to the manner in which the Minister's probate registries are issuing original documents such as grants of letters of administration.  I do not know whether it is national economy or not, but up to quite recently the paper in a grant of administration or <Col N="1154" /> grant of probate used to be a sort of imitation parchment.  It is necessary that it should be so, because these are documents to title and documents that would have to be kept and preserved by people if they want to prove their legal rights to holdings.</P>
    <P>But during the past six months original grants of letters of administration have been issued on flimsy paper not much heavier than the ordinary scribbling paper we get here.  It is not a paper that would last against any wear and tear at all.  I would point out to the Minister that these are documents that have to be preserved in perpetuity, and I am sure he will understand the necessity for going back to the old system of using a heavy type of paper.  It is common enough, particularly in the country, where people have to preserve documents of title that unless they are very well kept they become almost impossible to handle or to decipher after a very short time.  If the Ministry continue to use this very light paper they will not last any more than a year or two.</P>
    <P>There is another item as regards the question of the land registry and their maps.  One of the causes of delay is a little bit of red tape.  If a solicitor writes up to the land registry and says he wants to get the land registry folio 123456, County Cork, the land registry knows what he wants, but instead of sending him down the map they send him a blue form on which to fill up the details of what he wants.  That wastes a certain amount of time.  That sort of red tape could very easily be dropped.</P>
    <P>A few years ago on this Vote I made reference to the practice of the Gárdaí in dealing with a certain type of prosecution under the Road Traffic Act for motor offences.  I put it to the Minister at the time that the Guards appeared to be usurping the functions of judge and jury in motor accident cases, and I am afraid the same practice still prevails.  It is entirely unfair in my opinion.  Two cars run into each other, head on, at a blind turn.  The Guards are not looking at the accident. The Guards are sent for, and we assume that the cars are left as they <Col N="1155" /> should be left.  The Guards come and they interview anybody present.  They go back and make their reports.  They generally serve notice of intention to prosecute on both drivers, but a fortnight or so elapses and it generally turns out that one party to the accident is prosecuted for dangerous driving, and the other is not.  To all outward intents and purposes the particular Guard who examined the spot and interviewed the witnesses on the spot may be perfectly justified in prosecuting one driver and not the other, because he is acting on the impression he got from what he was told and what he saw.  But he did not see the accident, and when the actual evidence is given in court it may lead to another viewpoint altogether.  I know a case where a motor accident took place where a road leading from a cemetery, which was not even a by-road, joined a main steam-rolled road. A driver was travelling along the main steam-rolled road when a car suddenly appeared out of the passage-way leading to the cemetery and struck him amidships.  The Guards were sent for. They interviewed the witnesses and drivers, and later they prosecuted the man who was on the main road, and did not prosecute the man who had suddenly come out of this by-road leading to the cemetery.  The case came before the district court, and the district justice very properly dismissed the case on the grounds that it was perfectly obvious to everybody that the man on the main road had the right of traffic, and that the fault lay with the man who had so suddenly appeared out of the by-road.</P>
    <P>The result was that the man on the main road succeeded in recovering damages against the man on the by-road. In that case, in the first instance, the Guard who had gone out and measured the place and interviewed the witnesses had taken unto himself the functions of judge and jury because, by issuing a prosecution against one man and not the other, he immediately established the idea at least that the man who was prosecuted was in the wrong.  I agree that there are cases where the Guards are definitely in a position to ascertain immediately <Col N="1156" /> who is in the wrong, but there is quite a large number in my experience &mdash;and the number is high all over the country&mdash;where the Guards come along, see what is left of the accident, interview the witnesses and then issue a prosecution against one party.  If the Minister went into the figures, or if he could get the figures, of the number of cases where Gárda prosecutions have been dismissed and where only one party in the action has been prosecuted, I think he will find that the figure was pretty high.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I should like to make, and that is in connection with motor insurance.  I wonder if the Minister would look into the provisions of the Road Traffic Act as regards compulsory insurance.  So far as it goes, the insurance which motor owners are required to have now gives a certain amount of cover and it certainly does protect the interests of the road users and third parties to a great extent, but it does not cover everybody&mdash;possibly it was not intended to cover everybody&mdash;and there is one type of accident where people may be very seriously injured and yet find it impossible to recover damages.  Let me put it this way.  If the Minister is driving in a private car owned by a friend of his and an accident takes place owing to his friend's negligence and the Minister is seriously injured, his friend may have a policy, under the Road Traffic Act, which completely fulfils all the legal requirements. The friend would be liable to the Minister in strict law if the Minister is injured owing to his friend's negligence, but under what is called a Road Traffic Act policy, which covers just the minimum requirements of the Road Traffic Act, he would not be protected, because it does not cover passengers as distinct from other third parties.  If he were walking along the road and the accident occurred, he would be all right in that case; but if he were travelling in a private car the owner of which only had one of these policies that barely cover the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, he would not be covered.  The point I am making is that there are policies you can get that would cover such cases, but that people are taking out what <Col N="1157" /> they call a Road Traffic Act policy, and it merely covers the minimum requirements of the Road Traffic Act, that you will be prosecuted in certain cases and so on.</P>
    <P>There is just one other item that I should like to refer to.  It is in connection with the District Court Vote on page 158.  There is given there the number 125 as being the number of unestablished District Court clerks. Am I to take it that these unestablished court clerks have no pension rights?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no pension rights?  Well, I wonder did the Minister even consider the position of these District Court clerks, and particularly those of them who have had long service.  Many of them are people who were taken over, owing, possibly, to their national records, which many of them had, and they are people who have given long and very valuable service to the State.  Now, some of these District Court clerks have very large districts to attend to&mdash;some of these districts are 30 miles long by 15 miles wide, as I know, and the District Court clerks in such places are practically whole-time officials.  I can think of at least two districts where the District Court clerks concerned can hardly leave home at any hour of the day without somebody looking for them to issue notices, sign declarations and so on, and I think that the Government would be doing very little more than justice if they could see their way to pension these people.  They are not paid a very high salary and their position is such as not to enable them to save money and, along with that, just as in the case of the Guards, they have to keep up a fairly good standard of living.  I think it would be only elementary justice to pension these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Gárda Síochána salaries, the one objectionable feature is this item of £2, rising to 83/-.  It looks very bad, even in the Estimate, when you see in a note down at the bottom of page 148, referring to the <Col N="1158" /> pay of the Guards being from 40/- to 83/-, that that scale is applicable to Guards recruited after the 26th January, 1940.  Does that mean that this scale would apply to the ordinary Guards, as distinct from the Taca Síochána?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that, leaving out the Taca Síochána, any Guards recruited after the 26th January, 1940, start off at £2?  That appears to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think that is entirely wrong and it certainly is a curious headline for the Minister and his Government to give us at the present time, when they have been asking employers and everybody else to keep on the good work of paying decent wages and trying to keep people employed, and when they have been fixing wages and hours of work, under various Acts of Parliament, for everybody in the country.  Is it not, then, a glorious headline that they should expect the police force of this country, the guardians of law and order, to be a disciplined, well-trained force, with a high morale, at a miserable sum of £2 a week?  It is no wonder that people say that there is no likelihood of getting high morale in the Guards, and that the Government did not expect to have it.  Certainly, they are not going out of their way to improve the morale of the Guards by such a policy as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave figures here to-day which, somehow, I think, on examination, are not satisfactory. Those were the first figures he gave us.  I am not saying that he did not endeavour to enlighten us as best he could, but, to my mind at least, the figures did not show any justification whatever for the increased expenditure which the Minister thought they did show.  I refer to the revelation in connection with the 1939 figures which he gave us.  He mentioned a sum of £20,000 as being applicable to extra men then in the force as compared with 1931-32. <Col N="1159" /> That is outstanding, but surely if there was a sum of £20,000 extra for that particular purpose, when, later, the figures became closed, there ought to be a reflection of that.  The Minister told us about the position at the time when he became Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was half way through the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was half way through the year, but we are in another year now, and we do not see any reflection of that.  There is another figure which rather amazed me.  That is the figure of £36,000 which represented the extra payment made in 1938, which was, in fact, a 1939 payment.  I think I am right in that.  That was due to what the Minister said were fortnightly payments that were introduced at a particular time, and afterwards discontinued. The Minister represented that, because of that, a payment of £36,000 was made in March, 1938, which in ordinary circumstances would have gone into March, 1939.  I mean over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To April, 1938, and the year ending 31st March, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, that must have come to hand again when that system of payment was discontinued. Is not that so?  In other words, that was not a loss at all, and it should not be added up at all as being any reason why there was increased expenditure at that time.  At least, in the following Estimate, it should have come to hand and come to account, as also should have the payment in respect of the equalising figure of the Guards; so that it appears to me that, of that £211,000, sums of at least £20,000 and £36,000 should be lopped off straight away.  In any case, if there was any abnormality calling for extra men in that period, or any abnormality due to a period payment in one year which should have gone to another, the following year ought to have shown a reduction.  But such is not the case. They have still gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Linehan has drawn attention <Col N="1160" /> to the fact that the Taca Síochána are being paid at a lower rate than the other Guards.  I am not criticising the payments as payments, but I certainly criticise the discrimination, which I think is a bad principle.  It is definitely bad for the Government to discriminate between members of the same force.  It will not make for better discipline; it will not make for a better force; and the sooner the Minister decides to discontinue the practice, the better.  If he thinks that £2 is sufficient to pay a Guard, they ought all to be paid £2; and if he thinks £3 sufficient, they ought all to be paid £3.  They ought to be all on an equal footing, so that one member of the force will not be able to look down on another member because he is not paid the same rate. It is, as I say, bad for discipline and bad for the force, and I believe the Minister will regret ever having introduced it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I am sure his attention has been drawn by other people in the constituency of Roscommon which I also represent, that is, the housing of the Guards in the town of Roscommon.  I have drawn attention to it here on a few occasions, and no responsible Government would put respectable or responsible people into the living accommodation which the Guards have in Roscommon. They were put in there in the old days, and they are there still. I drew attention to it in the days of the previous Government.  I think it is a scandalous state of affairs.  They are living in the remains of an old, disused jail.  The guardroom and the sleeping apartments are ill-lighted and ill-ventilated. They are hideous; there is neither sunlight nor air in the place; and now that the Minister for Justice is a representative of Roscommon, he ought to see that something is done about it.  You cannot expect men to give good service in conditions like that.  It is really an appalling state of affairs that the Guards who have given such a good account of themselves should be housed in such conditions.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the point raised by Deputy Corish with regard to the married men.  Time after time, I and, I am sure, many other <Col N="1161" /> Deputies have had complaints by Guards who cannot find living accommodation for their wives when they are transferred, and something ought to have been done about it.  If the Minister would take these matters up, it would make for better discipline, a more contented force and greater efficiency in the force.  These are the things which require to be attended to more than anything else.  The Guards are carrying out duties that are arduous and, on the whole, I think they are carrying them out very well, and they deserve to be treated well. At the moment, that is not so, and the Minister ought to see that, during his period of office, there is some reform in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the other Deputies who have drawn attention to the totally inadequate wage paid to the new Gárda.  I know the Minister's interest in the trade union movement and his desire to see men paid a living wage, and as these men have to be physically fit and fine types of young men, I would ask him if he can justify the wage of £2 a week which is paid to these men.  It is setting a very bad headline for employers through the country.  As several Deputies have drawn attention to the matter, I hope he will not gloss over it, but will give us some explanation as to the basis of this payment which is totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter referred to by Deputy Byrne has been raised by many other Deputies, and perhaps I had better deal with it first.  The position at present is that the Taca Gárdaí, the temporary Gárdaí, are paid £3 a week.  That is a flat rate, and there is no increment.  The order provides for this force for only a year, and they were given a flat rate of £3 a week.  A new pay order has been made providing for an entrance wage of £2 per week, and I will admit at once that, in the case of an elderly man, that would be a very inadequate sum indeed.  My own opinion is that we shall have to have a new appointments order.  Up to this, the age limit was 27, and a number of men who were <Col N="1162" /> recruited into the Taca Síochána were coming near that age.  There is a number of men on the waiting list, and I do not think it would be right to offer a man of that age £2 per week. Also, I do not think the best type of Guard can be made from a man of that age.  I think he should be taken in earlier.  When the new appointments order is made&mdash;I am not quite definite on what we will do&mdash;an age limit of 19 to 22 might be arranged for.  If that is done, with the scale of increments laid down here for a young man of that age, it will be quite satisfactory.  They rise from 40s. weekly during the period of probation to 45s. one year from appointment, unless the period of probation is extended; to 50s. after two years; to 53s. after three years; to 56s. after four years; and then up to the maximum that obtains at present.  It will take a Guard two years longer under the new scale to reach the maximum.  It takes 22 years at present, and it will take 24 years under the new pay order.  I think that if provision for younger men is made in the new appointments order which will have to be made, that wage will be all right.</P>
      <P>I think we will have to provide that recruiting for the regular Guards will take place from the Taca.  The Taca Gárda are a temporary Force.  There was no intention before the emergency arose to have such a Force.  I am sure Deputies are aware of that.  There was a definite scheme of recruiting Gárdaí.  Certain examinations had to be held, and the men were selected by the Commissioner, who would require them to qualify in accordance with the statutory regulations.  I should like to bring Deputies' minds back to last September when the emergency arose. There was a black-out, and no one knew what would happen.  There were demands from all quarters for police protection.  I heard a Deputy objecting to-day to having temporary Gárdaí.  Of course, if there was to be an enormous demand for protection we would have to get temporary Gárdaí, maybe a very large number.  We could not possibly put them into the regular Gárdaí when the emergency had passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> A few days before I came into office, and shortly after the war broke out, a rough estimate was made as to the extra Gárdaí that might be required. After going into the estimate as closely as possible, it was thought if things developed as anticipated that it might be necessary to recruit 1,000 temporary men.  The figure was revised afterwards and cut down to 500, and finally to 300.  We have actually only taken in very few more than the Minister indicated might be necessary for the regular Gárdaí last year.  We have only got authority to have a temporary force for 12 months.  If things remain as they are it may not be necessary to continue that temporary force at all. On the other hand, we do not know what the position may be.  We think it better to keep these men at a flat rate of £3 per week as temporary Gárdaí as long as we are in an uncertain position.  When the time comes for recruiting for the permanent force, if I am in charge, I will make it my business to see that proper consideration is given to the men who were in the Taca, and they will get an allowance for the period they were there. Full consideration will be given to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think we should stand over the new pay order if young men are recruited. There will be the additional advantage in making them good Gárdaí if they are taken in, rather than having men waiting for years in the hope, eventually, of becoming Gárdaí, and then be disappointed at 27 or 28 years of age.  I think there should be an end to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If not taken in, will they be provided for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That question will have to be gone into.  I will see that full allowance is made for all the circumstances. I am sure that Deputies will admit that if it was found necessary to recruit 1,000 men for the emergency situation, we could not be expected to saddle the people with that number of permanent Gárdaí.  That is all I have to say about the recent pay order.  I admit that there was a difference between <Col N="1164" /> the pay here and in Northern Ireland, but there is a difference also between the salaries of public servants here and there.  The reason perhaps is that we are not as wealthy.  I would like to see the Gárdaí here getting as much money, but, in view of all the complaints, we have to admit that the increased cost is very heavy.  As to the point Deputy Brennan raised, I think I explained satisfactorily the cause of the increases.  I am satisfied that I have done so.  I am sorry if I have not satisfied Deputy Brennan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have explained it as well as it could be done. On looking into the accounts, perhaps I was unwise not to do what was done before and let Deputies fish the particulars out for themselves.  I explained the difference, and I was trying to dispose of statements which were made, that we were wildly extravagant, and had many more men than were in the Gárdaí during the period of office of the last Government.  I admit that that was a consideration with me.  If Deputies examine the figures I think they will be satisfied that I have accounted for the extra cost reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You accounted for £36,000 in extra payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That system was dropped the following year.  Every year the increment increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other system came to an end the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It did.  I saw a statement in the newspapers several times about £211,000, and I was dealing with the particular year that occurred by explaining to the House the items that made up that £211,000, only £20,000 of which was in respect of an increased number of Gárdaí.  That was all I wished to say about that.  The Deputy got into a black knot about it between Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan that the Roscommon barrack is a disgrace. Correspondence is going on about it <Col N="1165" /> between the Commissioner and the Department of Public Works, and I can tell the Deputy that I will do anything I can about the matter.  It is the worst barrack I know.  Deputy Linehan talked on matters that would properly be for the rule-making committees. I confess that I am not very familiar with the practice of the rule-making committees.  I understand that up to 1936 the Minister dealt with these matters but since the passing of the 1936 Act it is the business of the rule-making committees. Deputy Linehan should see the Incorporated Law Society, which as well as barristers and judges is represented on the committees.  I am sure if the legal Deputies would see the Attorney-General and discuss these points with him they would be taken up by the rule-making committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one difference, that the terms of reference of the rule-making committee would not entitle them to deal with the question of jurisdiction.  That is the point I was trying to make.  It might get over the whole difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if legal Deputies saw the Attorney-General he would be ready to discuss the matter with them.  I believe more progress would be made in that way.  I remind Deputies that there were three rule-making committees set up under the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, one for the Supreme and High Court, one for the Circuit Court and one for the District Court.  In addition to their duties as regards the making and revision of rules of court, each of these committees is charged by statute with the duty of considering &ldquo;the practice, procedure and administration of the court and the law affecting or administered by such court&rdquo;.  These are very wide terms of reference.  I believe they are also charged with reporting to the Minister for Justice what amendments or alterations should, in the opinion of the committee, be made in such practice or such law, with a view to the improvement of the administration of justice.  There are representatives of the legal profession there, and I think that would be the <Col N="1166" /> better way&mdash;to report to the Minister in what respect the law should be amended.  I admit that the Deputy was entitled to raise the point here, but the other way would be a better way, and probably more progress would be made.  As to providing housing for Gárdaí, I think that would be practically impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made in that respect in the rent allowance paid to married Gárdaí, and I think it is the practice where at all possible to see that married Gárdaí are sent to places where accommodation is available. I do not see how you could provide houses for Gárdaí all over the country.  If we did that, we would have a demand from practically every public servant for the same treatment. I can imagine public officials in different parts of the country and even in Dublin making the same demand. When the Government makes an allowance for rent&mdash;that allowance has been increased recently&mdash;they are going some way to meet the position.  It is a very difficult matter and, when a fairly substantial contribution towards rent is made, it goes a fair way to remedy the position.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is great delay in the Land Registry, largely due to staff reasons.  The most experienced men have recently retired.  I shall see what can be done to get the staff increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall see what can be done to remedy that.  I have been speaking to the Registrar on the matter, and I am well aware that there is great delay.  Deputy MacEoin asked if I was satisfied with the new force. I think that they are up to a good standard and are an excellent body of men. I have got a report from the Commissioner, and he is satisfied with them and thinks they are of a very high standard.  The Deputy asked if I was satisfied with the way in which they were recruited, and he also asked how <Col N="1167" /> they were recruited, how many men were called and how many were attested.  In September 400 were called and, of those, 232 were recruited. Four left subsequently.  At the end of February, 110 were called and 72 were attested.  I dealt with how they were recruited in reply to parliamentary questions during the Autumn.  With one exception, in which there were special circumstances, every man was taken from the list of candidates registered at Gárda Síochána Headquarters, which was closed in 1938 owing to the huge number on the roll.  They were taken from this list impersonally, and in accordance with the claims they made as to their educational and physical qualifications. The applicant stated what standard he had reached in school and what his height and chest measurement were.  They were called, and if they satisfied those who examined them that they were up to the required standard, they were retained.  If not, they were rejected.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin asked me if I was satisfied that there were not persons who had a better claim on the Government of the State available.  There may have been.  He mentioned a couple of cases, but the trouble is that they were not registered.  From the record of the parents of the persons mentioned, their claims might have been considered, but they were not on the list, and we had definitely decided that the recruits were to be taken from the list prepared in 1938.  No departure was made from that practice except in the case I have mentioned.  It may have happened that some people who would have been very desirable were not recruited, but I am satisfied that those recruited were quite satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin said that I had departed from the practice of previous years in failing to make a review of the condition of the country.  I have not departed from the practice of previous years.  I have looked up the debates and I find that I said more in introducing the estimate than was usually said I think I know what the Deputy was anxious to learn.  He wanted to know <Col N="1168" /> how we were dealing with illegal organisations, and I suppose I had better say something about that.  I do not want to say too much about it.  I am satisfied that we are making progress. We are getting the situation pretty well in hand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any statement I cannot stand over, or say that we have the illegal organisations broken. We cannot say that.  There may be quietness for a time, and then&mdash;perhaps to show that the Minister was quite wrong&mdash;there may be an outburst.  The trouble is that, unfortunately, there is in the country a number of men who are prepared to defy the Government and cause trouble.  I am sorry to say that that is still the position, with the result that we have had to intern about 20 persons.  About 110 other persons have been sentenced to different terms of imprisonment for this class of offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  When some of them have served their sentences, they will be interned unless they show a change of heart.  Certain people were sentenced to short terms for, apparently, nominal offences, and we are satisfied that it would be better to have them locked up at the present time. That will happen to some of them when their term is over, and that is what is happening.  Some of these people who received short sentences for not answering questions and offences of that kind are being interned.  We have a fair idea who these people are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood my question.  I wanted to know if any men had been sentenced to imprisonment who should have been interned in the first instance and not sent to a prison or criminal institution at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1169" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In these cases, we prefer to bring the people concerned before the court if we can prove an offence against them.  We prefer to charge men with an offence where it can be done, but where we are satisfied that men are as guilty as people who have been sentenced, though we cannot prove a case against them, there is no alternative to internment.  We made some progress in collecting arms illegally held.  Unfortunately, we are not aware of what amount of this stuff is still outstanding, but there must be a fair amount.  During the past financial year, we collected four machine guns, 107 rifles, 301 revolvers, 6,341 rounds of rifle and revolver ammunition, 58 lbs. of gelignite, and two grenades.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude I would like to say that I am well satisfied with a very welcome change in the attitude of the general public on this question.  We have, particularly since the raid on the Magazine Fort, got a considerable amount of help from the general public that we had not experienced before, and it is very heartening and very encouraging, I must say, to see the members of the general public anxious to help the Government in this matter.  The result was shown in the speed with which a lot of the stolen ammunition was recovered.  Unfortunately, it was not all recovered, but what was recovered was largely due to public help, and it is one of the best features of the present situation that the public are undoubtedly co-operating to an extent that I do not think they have done for a long time.  I hope that will continue and increase.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I would like to ask a question upon an administrative matter.  In connection with the investigation of motor accident cases, the Guards take statements and take measurements; and they usually make sketches which are of great assistance in the courts.  They take statements from the various parties, some of whom may be involved in the accident, and some of whom are independent witnesses.  There is a rather absurd &mdash; I think it is absurd, anyway&mdash;rule prevailing, that the Guards in question claim privilege for those statements that they take subsequent to the accident.  I will ask the Minister to consider, when all questions of criminal proceedings have been finally determined, placing at the disposal of both the plaintiff and the defendant in these negligence actions all the statements that were made by the various parties in the course of the investigation by the Guards.  I think it would facilitate the proper investigation of these accidents and would not, in the circumstances, in any way impede justice.  Indeed, they might possibly assist in eliciting the truth of the affair and preventing people from subsequently making false statements.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter and see if the rule he has in force could not be somewhat relaxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of this Vote, the Minister's predecessor, when the Courts of Justice Act was going through the House, gave me his personal undertaking that persons engaged as court stenographers would be re-employed. On that occasion I drew his attention to one particular case, and I pointed out that there was a danger that the man might not be re-employed for reasons of economy or for some other reason, but not because of inefficiency. Since then the Minister's predecessor on various occasions gave me assurances that steps would be taken to have this man re-employed. Nothing has, however, been done in regard to him.  He is on the unemployed list.  He was a very efficient court stenographer.  He was a journalist of some repute before he became a court stenographer, and he was in receipt of a salary sufficient to maintain himself and his wife and family. He surrendered that journalistic work to become a court stenographer.  Losing the position of court stenographer, he now finds himself in the ranks of the unemployed, and the Department and the Minister have taken no steps to fulfil the promise made by the Minister's predecessor.</P>
      <P>This man was a very prominent member of the Volunteers, pre-Truce. He has given valiant service to his country, and he has been treated in the harshest manner possible by the Government which he helped to establish. In the circumstances, I think that the Minister, even at this late stage, should take such steps as may be necessary to have the man employed in a position equal to the one he has lost as court stenographer.  I appeal to the Minister to see that the injustice done to this man is redressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult question.  The best that could be done was done for these people, so far as I can gather.  A number of them had to be disemployed.  Some were kept on at full salary to the end of the year <Col N="1175" /> 1937, and at half salary in 1938.  They were not permanent officials, and it has not been found possible to absorb them.  If it were possible, I would like to do what Deputy MacEoin asks, but it is not an easy thing to do.  I scarcely think the Minister for Justice at the time definitely promised anything, because he could not do that.  If it is possible to do anything, I will be certainly glad to do it, but I cannot make any definite promise.  I will look into the matter again.  I did not expect this point would be raised, and I cannot give any definite information about this man.  If it is possible to do something, without making any definite promise, I will do it.  I do not want that to be taken as a firm promise.  I will undertake to see if I can do anything.  I know it is a great hardship on these unfortunate stenographers, but what can we do?</P>

      <P>When the Courts of Justice Act was going through, the undertaking was given.  Unfortunately, I have not the Official Report beside me, but the promise was made that this official would be given employment. This man was given half pay for some time, and he was re-employed in connection with workmen's compensation cases.  He gets an odd case now and then, but that is of little value to him.  This is certainly a case in which there is grave hardship.  I dislike advocating a case for any individual in the House, but it seems this is the only way in which I can get attention drawn to the matter.</P>
