      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that on the outbreak of war many children of Irish parents resident in England were evacuated to Ireland and placed under the care of relatives here; that little gifts and necessities in the form of clothing, etc., sent to such children are subject to customs duties which the relatives, being in most cases poor people, are unable to pay; and if he will consider making a concession in the matter of the import duties and charges on such gifts and necessities for these evacuated children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Articles of clothing, boots and shoes and other personal effects which have been in use by children prior to their departure from England are admitted into Éire without payment of duty and without formality provided that the contents of each parcel are stated on the Customs Declaration Form to be the used personal effects of a person resident temporarily in Éire owing to the outbreak of war, and that the officer of Customs and Excise at the place of importation is satisfied as to the <i>bona fides</i> of each case and that none of the articles is new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision for the duty-free importation of dutiable new articles of wearing apparel on the specific grounds that they are for use by evacuees.  There is, however, provision for the importation of such <Col N="1498" /> articles under licence without payment of duty if of United Kingdom or Canadian manufacture, and at a reduced rate of duty, if manufactured elsewhere.  Any applications for such licence should be addressed to the Department of Industry and Commerce in the first instance.  In any case in which duty has been paid the Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to consider an application for refund on receipt of an intimation that the Department of Industry and Commerce would have recommended the issue of a licence.</P>
    <P>Other goods, in respect of which the law provides a licensing provision, would be dealt with similarly.  As regards goods, such as chocolate, sugar confectionery, etc., for which no licensing provision exists, duty would have to be paid in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the high cost of transport in Dublin, he has made, or proposes to make, representations to the Dublin United Tramways Company to introduce arrangements whereby persons resident some distance from the centre of Dublin may obtain season tickets at reduced fares, and if such representations have been made, whether he will indicate how the matter now stands.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that without the fullest investigation I could not accept the implication in his question that, in present circumstances, the cost of transport in Dublin is unduly high as compared with other cities of like size where similar problems have to be faced.  I understand that the Dublin United Tramways Company issue season tickets on their omnibus services where the conditions make it economically practicable to do so.</P>

No. S78481 was <Col N="1500" /> allotted in November, 1937, to Mrs. Ellen Rourke, an aged woman, as an enlargement of a holding of which she was the tenant.  Martin Fitzpatrick, her son-in-law, was living with her with his wife and family and was working her holding.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will remember, there were submitted on the Committee Stage of this Bill at least a dozen amendments relative to persons who might be eligible for appointment to the post of county managers.  One of these amendments was to the effect that any local official with 15 years' service should be eligible.  In all there were some 15 amendments, the debate covering 23 columns of the report.  I considered that, in essence, this point had already been met and that, if there was another alternative, it should have been submitted on the Committee Stage. Because the matter had, in my estimation, been effectually discussed and because the alternative now proposed comes too late, I have ruled these two amendments out of order.</P>

      <P>In page 6, at the end of Section 6, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The county manager for a county shall not be removed by the Minister without an inquiry being held at which the council (or councils) and manager concerned shall be given an opportunity of being heard and without the reasons for removal being previously communicated to such council (or councils) and manager.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> We had a very long discussion on a similar point on the Committee Stage, and we felt that the Minister did not satisfy us.  We felt that it was possible that a situation might arise in which a council would find itself deprived of its manager without any reason being given to anybody.  The Minister said that, under a sealed order, he was not obliged to give any reason and would not give any reason.  We think there ought to be some security for the manager. A great deal was said on Second Reading and on Committee Stage about the manager being a puppet of the Department.  I did not hold that view, and I do not want to be forced to hold it.  But I think that if the manager is in the hands of the Minister to the extent that he may be dismissed by him without reason stated, he becomes, in fact, a puppet of the Minister.  That is not desirable.  While some of us supported the idea of a county manager, we did not think that the Minister would take to himself a right of this sort.  We felt that the manager ought to be responsible to the council, and that he ought to feel his responsibility, not to the Minister, but to those for whom he is administering the affairs of the county&mdash;the people. After a long discussion on Committee Stage, I understood that the Minister was going to consider the point.  We thought the Minister was going to meet us in some way which would be satisfactory and that the councils would, at least, be told why the manager was being removed.  We thought that the manager would have some security and that he would be in a sufficiently independent position to deal with the affairs of the county as he thought best, apart from the Minister.  The Minister has his rights in the case of every official but, in this case, we felt that unless the manager had that security he would be entirely in the hands of the Minister.  He would be the creature of the Minister and would be at the beck and call of the Department, no matter what the views of the council or the ratepayers might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, the Minister has not the right of removal. <Col N="1504" /> The right of removal rests with the county council and the exercise of that right is subject to sanction by the Minister.  The removal of the county manager is governed in the same way as other cases under the local authorities. It comes under the Temporary Provisions Act of 1923.  An order was made in 1924 under that Act governing these matters.  So far as this Bill is concerned, this amendment is not relevant. Whatever amendments are to be made should be made either to the 1923 Act or to the Bill which will be introduced subsequently, which will deal with officers of local bodies. When that Bill is before the House, it might be relevant for the Deputy to move an amendment of this kind.  In practice, however, apart from the question of relevancy, there is generally an inquiry and the officer concerned is notified of the charges made against him.  There are certain cases in which it would not be proper that there should be an inquiry.  We have had cases where local officers were charged with embezzlement.  No action was taken, except to suspend the officer, until the result of the criminal proceedings was known.  If this amendment were passed, the Deputy might be doing a dubious service to an officer in that position.  If he were convicted, he would not want to have the whole thing over again.  We have had cases in which the proceedings in court relating to defalcations and embezzlement lasted for a very long time. If we were not to accept the verdict of a competent criminal court without further inquiry, it would be very foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been sent from post to pillar in connection with these Bills.  We were told in regard to the Assistance Bill that certain matters which we wanted to raise should be raised on the County Management Bill. Now, when we come to the County Management Bill, we are told that they should be raised on a further Bill. I pointed out the invidious position in which the House was placed when it could not get a true picture of what it was proposed to do.  We tackled the matter in piecemeal fashion and <Col N="1505" /> got no idea as to how the ends would be dovetailed.  That had to be left for future consideration.  The Minister says that this amendment might be relevant to another Bill.  He points out that an inquiry might be held.  But an inquiry might not be held.  The Minister refers to embezzlement.  Has he any objection, as the Minister for Local Government, to informing a county council that their manager has been accused and found guilty of embezzlement and, consequently, is not fit to be a county manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be informed that he is unfit to hold the position&mdash;that is the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back on things already said in the House and I do not want to be raising anything unfairly, but the Minister and Deputies will recollect that not so very long ago a very distinguished officer in the Department of Local Government was relieved of his position without any reason being given. That is the kind of thing that we want to guard against.  We want to see that the county manager will not be the creature of the Department.  The Minister should see that certain steps are taken before a person is deprived of office.  This discussion arose largely on Section 8, and I admit it might not be quite relevant.  The proposal in the section is that the Minister may, whenever he so thinks proper, revoke an appointment&mdash;that is, with regard to managers for joint bodies.  Even though that is hedged around by a lot of difficulties, so far as the Minister is concerned, I think it would be desirable that the Minister should state why he has decided to take the management of a mental hospital, in which two counties are interested, from one man and give it to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a good case, but once having committed himself to that, there might be an injustice or he might be slighting somebody by making the change.  Perhaps there are difficulties in the way of the Minister meeting me in this case, but I think it should not be beyond his ingenuity or the ingenuity of the Department to meet the point and let the House feel that <Col N="1506" /> county managers have an independent status and that they are quite entitled to carry on their administration even to the extent of fighting the Local Government Department if necessary. But when a county manager feels that he may be asked to quit his post without saying yea or nea, I am afraid you will not have the independent administration that we desire in this country. Will the Minister give us some information as to how this position may be safeguarded in the next Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is safeguarded at the present moment by the Local Officers (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923 and the order made under that in 1924.  As the Deputy knows, that was a temporary measure which has been continued up to the present.  The intention is that in the new Local Government Bill these temporary provisions will be repealed and re-enacted with or without amendment.  I cannot say at the moment what the exact position will be.  So far as this Bill is concerned, there is no power being taken by the Minister to remove a manager.  Whatever power there is to remove a manager, it is vested in the county council with, of course, the sanction of the Minister.  Wherever the Deputy's point may be relevant, it is not relevant on this Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards revoking an appointment in the case of managers for joint bodies the position was visualised where there might be a joint body for seperate counties, and it might be found convenient to make a change and replace one county manager by the other as the manager of the joint body.  This has nothing to do with removal or anything of that kind.  It might perhaps impose extra duties on one manager.  It was a method of elasticity to meet a situation that might arise at some time.  There is nothing sinister about this Bill in so far as attempting to put managers in a peculiar or invidious position is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This office of county manager is not, generally speaking, a popular office in the sense that other offices under a local authority are regarded as popular offices.  A two-thirds <Col N="1507" /> majority is all that is required to get rid of a man.  The Minister may have that majority from county councils and he will be faced with a dilemma. Is he going to stand up against a majority on the part of the county council when that majority is, in his opinion, wrong?  As the Bill stands, the easier way for the Minister or his successor is simply to agree.  What Deputy Brennan hopes to get is some indication of the reason for dismissal of the manager other than the majority vote of the council.  Had there been such a course open in certain cases recently it is possible certain councils would have been disposed to dispense with the services of the manager.</P>
      <P>Unquestionably, there has been a fairly strong bias throughout the country on the part of members of local authorities with regard to the appointment of a manager.  There is a certain element of danger that the council may, by a majority, seek to get rid of the principle of this Bill.  So far as that is concerned, the Minister is faced with having to resist the majority decision on the part of the local authority.  The point is that the Minister will inform the council why he will not do it.  Is this the position, that reasons will be given only when it will not be done and reasons will not be given when it will be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point the Deputy raises and I might say that that matter has been considered.  Very often the Department finds itself in the position that several resolutions, trying to do certain things, are passed by big majorities.  The Department is there to stand against that.  I can see where a manager, when he does his work, may have to do unpopular things, but you must rely on the Department to stand against that kind of thing.  If councils were allowed to do certain of the things that they propose to do, perhaps sometimes by big majorities, I am afraid we would find ourselves in a difficult position.  That sort of thing has been opposed in the past, and I think the Department can be relied upon to stand against it in the future.  No <Col N="1508" /> county manager will be removed without an inquiry being held.  If the council make charges against a manager, an inquiry in the ordinary way will be held and the Department will have to be satisfied that the case they make is not only substantiated but also that it is a proper case to make.  The place where the point that has been raised can be remedied is in relation to the Local Officers (Temporary Provisions) Act and not under this Bill.  When the Local Government Bill will be going through the Dáil shortly&mdash;in this session at any rate&mdash;Deputies will have every opportunity to raise those matters, but I do not think that this is the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point at the moment that I would like to put before the House.  The Minister may find himself in difficulties in regard to the endeavour to adapt the Temporary Provisions Act as regards managers.  I question very much if a manager is an employee of the council at all.  He is not employed by the county council and he becomes manager by the fact that he is recommended.  He is not appointed by the county council and not appointed by anybody.  If the Minister goes to court he may find himself in a very difficult position in that way.  The manager is in a very different position from any other employee. His position is a new one, and it is possibly a position in which the majority of county councils do not like placing people.  It will require certain treatment and it should be so treated. If the Minister thinks he can bring in the county manager automatically under the Officers and Employees Act he may be making a mistake.  He is not an employee of the council or it is doubtful at any rate that he is though he may be an officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a danger in the point that Deputy Brennan raises.  A council may want to get rid of a manager for an unjust reason but there may be also the danger that the <Col N="1509" /> manager would be set up and hedged around with all sorts of safeguards. You could have a danger in either direction to-day.  The councils should be safeguarded as well as the managers. These men will wield very great powers and a manager could wield them very unjustly.  But when all is said and done the Department is there with the power to stand between the council and the manager.  It is quite possible that the manager who may be appointed may not treat the people or the council justly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 to 27 are interdependent. My object in putting them down is this: that experienced administrators <Col N="1514" /> feel that some of the purposes of this Bill might be defeated by the wording of Section 24 as it stands, that it is so comprehensive as to prevent the possibility of the expenditure of even £1 over the estimate for a year.  It has been the settled law for a great number of years, so far as local administration is concerned, that rates raised for one service cannot be utilised for expenditure on another service.  For instance, if there was a deficit on the service for university scholarships it could not be recouped from an excess of revenue under the Small Dwellings Act.  It appears that the construction of this section is based on the legislative procedure in central government where, within limits, certain funds can be transferred from one service to another.  That would be wholly inapplicable in the matter of administration from local rates.  In practice it is found very difficult to estimate local expenditure so closely for any one year that a county secretary or an accountant can say that he will not have to apply for an additional sum of money during the year.  Take law costs.  A solicitor's schedule of costs is presented half-yearly, some times yearly and not infrequently at longer intervals.  That schedule has to be divided up between roads and county services.  If the total under either head exceeds the estimate by even £1 the manager cannot pay the solicitor's schedule of costs.  Suppose, again, that temporary clerical assistance were needed, it is felt that even though it might be very urgent and might cost only, say, £10 per month, it could not be obtained because of the fact that it had not been provided for in the estimate.  Suppose a county manager had to take legal action which would involve an expenditure of £100 in the Circuit or High Court in the interests of the general body of the ratepayers, he would first have to get the consent of the local council, and in that event there would be the possibility that local interests might prevent legal action being taken which would be in the interests of the general body of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Take the case of imperative payments such as expenditure which is debited direct to the county fund without <Col N="1515" /> the consent of the county council. One example is the cattle disease fund.  In that case, if an extra ¼d. in the £ were required, the sanction of the council would have to be secured under Section 24, and this might or might not be withheld at their discretion, despite the fact that the law ordains that this money has to be paid. Deputies can realise the kind of situation that would create.  Take another example.  During the course of the financial year a number of laws are passed.  We have had the Fire Brigades Bill this year which requires additional expenditure.  The payment of money under that head could or could not be withheld, according to the desires of the board of health.  There is also the question of home assistance. Suppose the sum of £10,000 is estimated for, and suppose circumstances arose in the course of the financial year in which a greater amount of money were needed&mdash;as might happen in present circumstances when men are thrown out of employment or because of a strike or something of that kind&mdash; in that event the home assistance would have to be reduced or perhaps stopped altogether during a period when it was most urgently required. There is another aspect of this to be considered, and that is the extra amount of accounting work which will be entailed as a result of this section.  Separate accounts will have to be kept in respect of each power, function and duty of the county council.  The accounts will have to be recorded and tabulated, posted in a ledger and the total shown from week to week and month to month and compared with the relevant totals allowed in the estimate.  I understand another difficulty would arise in connection with contractors who very often do not present their accounts, except perhaps annually.  In that case something like this might happen: that accounts estimated for in one year would not be presented until the estimate for the next year came along.  The question would then arise, to what year should they be charged.  My reason for suggesting these amendments for the consideration of the Minister is in the <Col N="1516" /> hope that the objects of the Bill may achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be held under the Bill as it stands that the powers of the manager would be limited: that, if he were able to effect a saving under one item he would not be at liberty to apply it to another.  As Deputies know, the four main heads in county council accounts are: (1) the making and construction of roads; (2) county services; (3) poor relief, and (4) board of health charges.  As regards these it was intended to give a discretion to the manager, but, as the Bill stands, it is doubtful whether that discretion is there.  I think it is desirable that a discretion should be there, and that, as regards individual items within the main sub-heads, if there was a saving in one particular item it might be applied to another under which there was a shortage.  At the same time I think it is desirable that, if the manager exceeds his estimate under any of the four main heads, he should have to go back to the council and get its approval for the additional expenditure.  Subject to this I am prepared to accept the amendments in principle, but further amendments, which I propose to have moved in the Seanad, will be necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, before Section 25, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Each body to which this Act applies shall as soon as may be after the expiration of each half-year (but not later than four months after the close of each financial half-year) have its accounts audited by a Local Government auditor, or by a chartered accountant, appointed by the Minister for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  After the completion of the audit for each half-year there shall <Col N="1517" /> be inserted in a newspaper or newspapers, circulating in the administrative area, a statement of receipts and expenditure under the various heads; a summary of balances in favour or against each account, and the manager's or secretary's statement of assets and liabilities.</P>
    <P>(3)  As soon as may be after the completion of each half-yearly audit the complete abstract of accounts duly certified by the auditor shall be printed, and copies of such abstracts made available to ratepayers on payment of one shilling for each copy.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that, under the Local Government Act of 1898, local bodies were required to publish in the local Press an abstract of the accounts for audit.  This was discontinued later, but I think that was because of the form in which they were published; they took up a lot of space in the newspapers and perhaps were too costly. Under this Bill it is not clear whether the members of a local authority will have any opportunity of examining payments or learning anything about the expenditure unless they attend at the actual time of the audit.  Ratepayers will only have the same opportunity. I think it will be admitted by anybody who has anything to do with a local authority that the opportunity given to ratepayers is very rarely availed of.  I do not know what the reason is, but it certainly is very rarely availed of.  At present local authorities have complete control over expenditure, sanctioning the outlay in the first instance, and examining and vouching for the payment. How far local authorities will have any say in such matters under this Bill seems to be doubtful.  I, therefore, suggest that this amendment is an appropriate one.  In recent years it has been the practice to permit of audits being held off for a long time.  I have in mind a council where almost five years have elapsed since there was an audit.  So far as the ratepayers are concerned these audits are practically worthless.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that some form should be adopted whereby the accounts of certain <Col N="1518" /> councils should be published so that the people can see what the position is so far as the finances of their council is concerned.  I do not mean that there should be an elaborate abstract of accounts as was provided for under the Local Government Act of 1898; but if we could get a summary or short account of the expenditure and income of the councils, I think it would be very desirable that it should be laid down definitely in this Bill that there should be publication of these accounts, especially after an audit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that under Section 26, a member of a council is entitled to get any information he wants.  With regard to publication, I suggest that a better way of having any regulations like that would be under a Public Bodies Order, as it is not advisable to have these things too rigid.  I do not want to criticise the amendment, but it puts the onus on the local bodies to have their accounts audited by a Local Government auditor or by a chartered accountant appointed by the Minister. I agree that it is very undesirable that there should be delay in auditing the accounts, but if you want to get these accounts audited within four months it will mean that you will have to employ a number of extra auditors and that these auditors will for the remaining eight months of the year have nothing to do.  I am only a very short time in this Department, and I know that chartered accountants are a very admirable body of men, but they have not got contact with the working of public bodies.  I imagine it is through the extra time necessary, but it has worked out in practice in the few instances I have come across that their engagement has been a big charge on the councils.  I do not think it is desirable to have rigidity about things like this and I think it could be more suitably adapted to a Public Bodies Order.</P>

      <P>Last night I was moved to enter a protest against the casual and non-informative manner in which this huge Estimate was introduced. We got the figures which we could read for ourselves; we got no information with regard to the position of this country, the defence plans of the country or the danger confronting the country.  One very significant statement was made by the Minister and it was left at that.  The Minister made a statement to the effect that, some 12 months ago or earlier, orders had been placed for warlike material to the extent of nearly £3,500,000, that since that time good to the value of about £700,000 had been received and that between this and April, 1941, he hoped to get £400,000 worth more of the goods ordered.  In other words, he said that before 1941 we would not even get one-third of the warlike stores that the Taoiseach and the present Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures told us two years ago were urgently required, if the neutrality and independence of this country were to remain and if the people were to be left unmolested to carry out their ordinary avocations.  I think that is a statement which needs some further explanation.  If we have landed ourselves in such a mess that £3,500,000 worth of warlike stores were urgently required if our independence were not to go west two years ago and <Col N="1525" /> if we cannot get even one-third of those supplies by 1941, then some explanation is required.</P>
      <P>What was the Minister for Defence doing from 1932 to 1938?  Was there no sign of war?  Every boob in every country could see the signs of war from 1935 onwards, and yet we waited until war broke out before we tried to fill up our stores, before we tried to equip our country, before we ordered even the minimum, according to the Minister, necessary to safeguard the independence of this country.  And then we could not get it.  Why? Because hatred of England submerged love of Ireland; because during all those years we were deliberately placing our orders in Sweden, in Belgium, in France and in America, so that actually goods were coming through the Kiel Canal in September, 1938.  The policy of the Department was that not one pennyworth of goods was to be purchased from the only country near us and in a position to supply us.  That policy was not reversed until, through the absence of the Minister, the Department was taken over by the Taoiseach; and then the European pot was boiling over and every country wanted all the arms they had, and more if they could get them, so we were left without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for War in Great Britain, France or Germany stood up last night to tell the Deputies in his Parliament that he had thought so little of the safety of his people that a year or so before he had placed an order for an immense amount of warlike stores urgently required as the very minimum necessary for the defence of his country and the homes of his people, but that he could not get even one quarter of his demands, and presumably would not get the whole of his demands until the war was completely over in Europe, how long would he be kept in office?  How long would he enjoy the confidence of his Government or his Parliament?  How long would he be tolerated by the people outside who had to pay the price and take the risk?  But we are so unaccustomed to normal Parliamentary <Col N="1526" /> decencies that any gross negligence can take place in a Ministerial position, any major blunder can be made, any disaster can occur and, as long as there is a narrow prejudiced Party majority, the Minister will be either promoted or he will come back here smugly to ask for more and more money.  I may say that my remarks have no direct reference to the present unfortunate occupant of the post.  He is left with a legacy.  He is left with the empty cupboard.  He is left to stand the racket.</P>
    <P>I may say to the Minister that times are changing inside and outside this House, and the time has gone by when gaily we can vote away millions without grasping or understanding the requirements.  I want to make it very clear that the amount of information that any of us over here has with regard to Army policy, Army plan or national dangers is the amount we glean from the censored Press and the amount of information we have with regard to the necessity for this huge sum of money is the amount of information that was given to us by the Minister last night.  In most normal democratic parliaments there is a committee for foreign affairs, a committee for defence, some machinery in private for all parties which helps them to deal with difficulties and to understand the dangers.  Here we have such a committee to deal with the victuals that are eaten by the Deputies in the restaurant, but it is not worth while having such a committee to deal with national safety or national security.  As I said last night, we are asked to vote this money in blinkers.  We are asked to vote this money to an administration that has blatantly failed and broken down on the job.  We are asked to vote this money to an administration that could not see any signs of war in 1935, 1936 or 1937.  We are asked to vote it to an administration that would not even now have placed an order but for the accidental intervention of the Taoiseach, and that order was placed at a time when any grown up boy would know that no little country could hope to get arms even for solid gold. If we are to believe the statement <Col N="1527" /> made by the Minister for Defence in February, 1939, that £3,000,000 worth or so of warlike stores was the minimum required then for our safety, we are left now without a fraction of the minimum.  We are left defended by nothing but the bleating cry of neutrality.</P>
    <P>I believe that sooner or later we have got to grow up and face facts, even if they are politically awkward.  We can at least read the papers and see what is happening other countries.  It was the natural desire of every country and of the people in every country to keep out of war, to remain neutral, to be saved the horrors of war.  Little countries on the far side of Europe, the Scandinavian countries, all desiring to be left in peace, to have their neutrality respected, were advised, and strongly advised, to get together and to stand firmly together or fall individually asunder.  Many of them, not minding what happened their neighbour, as long as they might be saved themselves, and relying on the strength of a catch-cry or the appeal of a phrase, rather than the organisation of the people and a number of men, each one adopting a policy of isolationist neutrality, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Denmark, Norway, went under, one by one.  Standing together, with guarantees one to help the other, they might have all survived.</P>
    <P>We are asked here to rely on empty armouries, empty arsenals, the cry of neutrality and, possibly, 20,000 troops and, as far as we are told, we have asked nobody to come to our assistance if our neutrality is violated. It is no departure from neutrality to have that neutrality guaranteed by every and any possible power.  We have associations, long, sentimental, firm, historical, with the great Republic in the west.  Have we even asked that Republic to guarantee our neutrality?  The Taoiseach says naively, &ldquo;Oh, if this country is attacked, other countries will be interested.&rdquo; It is the curse of this country that we will face an army but we are afraid to face words.  What did the Taoiseach mean, when you parse it?  That if this country is attacked Great Britain will <Col N="1528" /> be interested and will come to our assistance, not for love of us but for her own safety.  That is sticking out. That is common sense.  That is obvious. That is stated from the head of the Government.  If that is so, is there anything wrong in having a prearranged plan for co-ordination, for speedy assistance, for efficient and harmonious joint co-operation in the event of this country being attacked? Politically it would be awkward but, remember, the Minister is not just responsible for the pay, equipment, food and drilling of so many soldiers, he has a responsibility for the safety of the lives and the sanctity of the homes of the people in this country.  He is not going to claim for one moment that his Army of 16,000 or 17,000, even of the best men on earth, is going alone to safeguard this country if invaded. There is nobody sufficiently ignorant and insular to think that an army of that magnitude or of three times that magnitude could successfully repel or drive out of an island country the number of troops that any modern army of a major power would utilise for the invasion of a distant country.  I have enough respect and confidence in the personnel of the Irish Army to know that they would fight with valour, they would sell their lives dearly, they would be true to the traditions of the country and, at best, they would delay any modern force for a week-end.  It is not a heroic defeat that I would look forward to, if I were in the Minister's place.  What I would look forward to would be a successful defence, even though the successful defence might not be as spectacular as a heroic defeat or a glorious failure.  There is too much of that kind of thing in the history of this country&mdash;a history of glorious failures and heroic defeats&mdash; but, as a self-governing entity, I think that we should aim at successful campaigns, and, if I were in the Minister's position, I should like to get some assurance of effective assistance, in the event of an attack being made upon this country.  I should like to get an assurance of assistance in the event of attack, even from a Hottentot country, or any other country, and I would not <Col N="1529" /> consider that I was doing my duty to this country unless I was using any weapon and every weapon to save the liberty of this country and the lives of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>We are asked to vote money, and big money&mdash;money that is hard to get&mdash;to support a policy of isolation as a defence of those shores in the event of invasion.  It is a fool who pretends to be a prophet in a time of universal war, and none of us can say what may take place in the present position of the world.  That, however, is a danger that each Minister for Defence must keep in mind, and that danger cannot be met, I suggest, by a small, paid professional Army alone, and even if invasion should take place, that danger cannot be repelled by the inside strength of this country alone.  In view of that, I should like to know if any arrangements have been made or if any queries or applications have been made to any country in the world to come to our assistance in case we should be attacked.  Have any queries been addressed to any country in the world in that regard?  Practically every country that is left amongst the neutral countries has some country, at least, at call to come to its assistance, if attacked, or some country to account for.  Have we any such country that has promised to come to our assistance, if we are attacked?  We are told by the Taoiseach that Great Britain will be interested in case we are attacked. Well, interest in such a case is no good, or very little good, if there is no understanding or no plan of co-operation beforehand.  If 'planes advance on this country to attack it, passing over England, England might be interested, but only so far as her own safety is concerned. Have any arrangements been made to give us notice of such an attack?  If, for instance, troops should land on the west coast of Ireland, England might be interested, or might simulate interest, to the extent of asking us to let her know of the landing of troops that was taking place; but when we ask for the defence plans of this country somebody bleats about neutrality.  Neutrality, of course, is a good thing, but in the present circumstances <Col N="1530" /> of the world it seems to be only a pious hope, and what is wanted really now is a plan to meet attack in case our neutrality should be violated. We never got any plan, or any beginning of a plan, or any policy, and an Army can only design a plan behind a policy, and if there is a Ministry so muddle-headed as not to have a definite plan, or to have so many divergent plans, or a Ministry so cowardly as not to be able to face up to the plans they have, then, obviously, the Army is left without a policy and, accordingly, the country is left without a military plan of defence.  That is the position.  It is well known that that is the position in the country, and neither in public nor in private has the Minister for Defence, or his side-drummer, been able to convince anybody that there is any real tackling of the possible dangers that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Sheltering behind phrases about neutrality is merely a burking of the issue.  What this money is wanted for is not in regard to our neutrality being respected, but only in view of our neutrality being violated, and if it should be so violated, we have been told by the Taoiseach already that it will only be violated by a great country that is at war with Great Britain.  Assuming, as we must assume, that there is some danger of that happening&mdash;because, if there is no such danger, there is no justification for the huge demands that are made here&mdash;do we propose to face and beat a major Power with 17,000 troops with the Volunteers thrown in?  The Minister knows that, if he has 17,000, or 30,000 troops, the most of that 30,000 that could be hurled in any one direction would be 10,000.  He knows that, with the internal dangers which, we all know, threaten our internal lines of communication, our buildings, barracks, internal lines of supply, and so on&mdash;all of which have got to be defended and safeguarded from attack &mdash;even with 30,000 troops at his disposal, he would not have 4,000 troops to be thrown around the coast for its defence.  You have one of the longest coast-lines in Europe in this country, and you have empty ports and idle <Col N="1531" /> forts beside these ports.  As far as we know, no understanding, or no scheme of co-operation with any other country has been come to.  Apparently, we are going to do what the Polish army of 2,000,000 men failed to do, and we are going to do it with an efficient and highly-trained Army of 8,000, and with a Volunteer force, 75 per cent. of whom, we are told, are reliable but not highly trained.  It must be remembered, however, that the 25 per cent. remaining is a source of weakness.</P>
    <P>Now, in this Vote we have made provision on a larger scale for the Volunteer side of the Army, and I want to know clearly from the Minister for Defence if he is satisfied that he is pursuing sound lines in this regard. Defence is becoming a serious matter in every country, and there is no use in us burking the difficulties that we are up against.  The enemy that is nearest to you is the enemy that is most dangerous.  Like most other countries, we have an enemy within our own shores&mdash;an enemy that is highly organised, working secretly, and in a position to strike in any place at any moment.  That is the danger that is nearest to us, and that is the first enemy that an Irish Army has got to meet.  An Army, living and existing under such conditions, must ensure that the soldier admitted to that Army is passed, not through one, but through a dozen sieves; must ensure that the soldier's loyalty is unquestionable, and that his affiliations are entirely with and for the State&mdash;that he has no affiliations with any bodies inimical to the State or that he has now served such affiliations, if he had any; in other words, that he has no entanglements with any anti-State bodies.  One of the first essentials of our Army is that we should be able to swear to the reliability and loyalty of any man we take in, and then, having taken him in, we keep him there so that we know his most secret thoughts.  Was it wise in those circumstances, in a country with our history, to throw the barrack gates wide open, to invite any agent of that enemy organisation to come into barracks, to supply him with a rifle and <Col N="1532" /> with equipment, to drill him, to train him, and to send him out as an information carrier to join his old pals or to keep him in as an enemy within the walls?  When we see cases in courts of men offering big money to private soldiers to tell them simply at what hour the officer comes around to inspect the sentry, what the appearance of that officer is, and what is the plan of the barracks, can we not see the danger in throwing the secrets of our barracks open to any fly-blow that comes in for 17 days per annum and carries out all the information?</P>
    <P>A still more venturesome and risky policy was embarked on some five or six years ago and I think the weakness and the flaws were visible even within 12 months.  One of these was that the fellows you trained one year never came again; or a few of them came, that although you kept the numbers uniform, it was a different set of men each year and that you were passing through the Army and familiarising with Army routine 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 men of whom you had no control.  Remember that, in the early days of this movement, these men came in echoing the cries of the Ministers: &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cut the connection&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Up the Republic and down with the Free State&rdquo;.  Mind you, no matter what Ministers were, some of these men might have been honest, an odd one of them might have been sincere, and when the hierarchy turned in their tracks, they could not count on all those men turning in their tracks, and the affiliations and sentimental attachments of these men who were enrolled in our colours were exemplified by the cry on their lips at the time.  I want to know if any reports were ever received from responsible officers with regard to the advisability or inadvisability of continuing that scheme; I want to know if any reports were ever asked for, and if all the military reports which the Minister got were to carry on.  I want to know if he got no reports warning him of the wastage, warning him of the fact that there were leakages, warning him of the dangers and suggesting alterations, <Col N="1533" /> and if he did get such reports, what action was taken about them?</P>
    <P>Everybody, the man in the street and the man living in any parish, knows that, of the nine or ten men who were enrolled one year, two turned up the following year, with an additional eight, and that, in the third year, three of those men turned up, with an additional seven.  What was the justification for squandering money on material which was never available from year to year?  What is the defence of squandering money on men who were only sufficiently blooded with the taste for soldiering to go into the British Army?  What is the justification for carrying on with that scheme in view of what happened on Christmas Eve, in view of what is happening month after month down at the Curragh, and in view of what we see in the police courts month after month?  Why, if we have enemies within this State, make it easy for them to come within the camp and within the barracks?  That scheme was a faulty scheme from the beginning. It had its political uses at the beginning.  It has its military dangers at the moment and the dangers must be as apparent to the Minister as they are to anybody else.</P>
    <P>As I said, living in our circumstances, it is unsafe to take anyone into the Army, no matter how urgently men are required, without being able absolutely to swear by his reliability. What happened at the Magazine Fort could have happened at any barracks in Dublin.  Remember that what happened at the Magazine Fort could much more easily have happened at Government Buildings, only that the material in Government Buildings was not considered as valuable as the material in the fort.  It could have happened at any barracks in the country and do you think that the Minister can come along and ask for increased millions for a weapon that might be turned against ourselves?  By reason of old association, by reason of close association and knowledge, I would be prepared to stake my life and everything I possess on the loyalty, the efficiency and the bravery of the <Col N="1534" /> youngest soldier in the regular Army. I would be prepared, not having the same amount of knowledge, to go as far as to say that 80 to 90 per cent. of the Volunteers are as reliable, but I would be prepared to stake my reputation for common-sense that, living in a country with our conditions, 10 per cent. of the new men rolling into barracks must be rolling in as the agents of the Irish Republican Army.  If I could devise a plan to get rid of the 10 per cent., without interfering with the 90 per cent., we would all cheerfully adopt it, but if I had to choose between keeping the 10 per cent. in order to keep the 90 per cent., I would let the whole lot go, and I would feel stronger, safer, and more secure, and let them back by another entrance under other conditions.</P>
    <P>We have selected this particular year to launch ourselves as a naval power. Was it the idea that as we could not get arms and equipment for the Army, and as the money was there, we might as well spend it in any case, that we might as well buy a navy, or was it the idea, rather belatedly, that the Government was convinced that the ports and forts were only of use for sheltering and harbouring of a navy, and seeing that that was the situation, they said: &ldquo;Very well, buy a navy to put into them&rdquo;?  But there is just as big a mystery, and just as much reticence about our launching out as a naval power as there is about the arrival of our first Navy.  The first six weeks were shrouded in mystery.  Was it lost or was it captured?  Was it disabled? What happened to the Navy from the date of delivery to the date of arrival in this country?  How did it happen that the Navy got a civic reception in Waterford before it got an official reception in Dublin?  Was the function of the Navy to report to the Mayor of Waterford or was its function to report to the Minister for Defence in Dublin?  How did it happen that the crew of the Navy found themselves in the water on the night of its arrival? Was there any truth in the newspaper report that its arrival was greeted by the Irish Republican Army boarding the ship, or was it that the waters in <Col N="1535" /> Dun Laoghaire Harbour were too turbulent for the legs of the crew?</P>
    <P>The thing that matters more than anything, however, is, what is the purpose of this particular Navy?  What is the justification for spending tens of thousands of pounds at the present moment?  What is the function of this Navy?  What factor, defensive or offensive, did it fulfil since it arrived at Dun Laoghaire port?  What important safety mission was it on for six weeks before it arrived there?  It may be a very interesting thing to have a Navy as well as an Army, and I suppose we must have a Navy as well as an Army when we have a Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, because he cannot coordinate an Army as Minister for Defence, but having got the ports we must get a Navy.  Having got a Minister for the Co-ordination of the Defensive Measures we must provide different defensive measures.  Is that the line of country?</P>
    <P>We come to the cost of this Marine Coast-Watching Service amounting to about £319,000 for the coming year. There is £17,000 odd for pay, £58,000 for maintenance, £50,000 for stores, and £172,000 under the heading of capital.  Are we going to purchase more naval vessels?  What are their functions?  What are they going to do? Is it the function of a craft, the size of the one lying at Dun Laoghaire, to repel invasion?  Remember the Power that comes to invade us is strong enough to cross the seas in the teeth of the mightiest navy in the world.  Is it for show?  Is it because the money is there and it might as well be spent? These particular Marine and Coast-Watching Services are to cost nearly £500,000 for the year.  I think any Deputy, no matter where he sits here, before he votes the money, is entitled to know what he is voting it for.  What is the Coast-Watching Service?  What are they watching through?  Where are they watching from?  What are they watching for?  If they see anything coming, what are they going to do? It is nonsense to have a man here and there along the coast who, if a fleet is <Col N="1536" /> arriving, will telephone or signal.  To whom?</P>

      <P>The Civic Guards, I am told.  Could not the Civic Guards telephone?  Is it necessary to spend £500,000 for men to become limpets on the rocks of our coasts?  Is it a utility service, and are we to get value for it?  If I were in the Minister's position, and had that £500,000 to play with, I would rather put it into aeroplanes if I could get them.  I would rather put it into plain soldiers so that, at least, I would have people to keep order.  It is rather symptomatic of the state of affairs, that you have an organisation anti-State, a rival army, able to order all the shopkeepers in the principal streets of our capital city to close down from a certain hour to a certain hour, and that nobody ventured to disobey the order.  You have a subterranean army that, in our capital city, can order picture houses, and any business in the city to close down any night, and no business will dare disobey.  Do you think with conditions such as that, that we can afford to flash money, and burst out as a naval Power with vessels so big that you could pass them by in the River Liffey without knowing they were there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time that the Ministers, both of them, got down to a conscientious realisation of the fact, that independent countries are going pop month by month, that they are going pop with armies, many of them ten times as big as ours, but that if other countries dissipate their strength, and their wealth, on all kinds of fancy shop window trimming, the way we are doing it here, and if Ministers in other countries burked awkward facts the way they are burked here, these countries would be going pop every day, instead of every month.  We have a demand for millions of extra money. We are told that supplies cannot be procured for the Army but that we are going to have an Army.  Presumably when we get an estimate, so many of the men were to man aeroplanes which cannot arrive, and did not arrive, <Col N="1537" /> others were to man anti-aircraft guns which cannot arrive, and did not arrive, but having committed ourselves to a scale of expenditure, on the basis that the material was going to be procured, we still adhere to that basis of expenditure, even though the material cannot be secured.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us now in 1940 that we might get a fraction of our orders in 1941.  The goods were ordered in 1939.  No provision was made from 1932 to 1938.  We are to express our confidence in that Administration by voting more money without being told the reason why, without getting any explanation as to why the goods cannot be secured, without getting any information as to whether any arrangements are made for assistance from any point of the compass if there is an invasion of this country.  More information is given to a Fianna Fáil cumann in any country parish than is given to Deputies in this Parliament.  I want to say to Deputies, irrespective of where they sit, that either in public or in private we have got to have some knowledge as to how money is to be spent and why before we are conscientiously entitled to vote away the money.  Things are not booming in this country.  We are aiming at a big Army in barracks.  There is a huge army outside&mdash;the army of the starving, the army of the destitute, the army of the unemployed.  We have got to turn a deaf ear to their demands because all the money is required for the Army in barracks.  We are not even told what the Army is in barracks for, what threat it is going to meet, what plan it has to meet any threat, what arrangements are made, if the threat is immense, for assistance or co-operation from any other country.</P>
    <P>This Army estimate would repay close examination.  Apparently, in every phase of Army life&mdash;in every department, in every office, in every barracks&mdash;there is to be increased expenditure. More money and plenty of it.  Some of these Votes in the way in which they are presented are rather confusing.  We have under sub-head E&mdash;(Officers of the Medical Service)&mdash;a <Col N="1538" /> number of commandants, captains, and other ranks with a gross figure behind their names.  If I understand things at the moment, these officers are on different rates of pay.  There is a commandant attending on a certain set of beds who is paid, say, £800 a year.  Another commandant serving these beds, with the same rank, the same duty and the same responsibility, is getting substantially less pay and placed in such a position that, no matter what promotion he ever earns, he cannot increase his income by a ½d. a year. That was one of the blunders of the previous Minister for Defence and, when that blunder was made very clear to him, he mistook mulishness for strength.  Now, we have that mulishness succeeded by weakness&mdash;a fear of interfering with what was done by the Minister's predecessor.  Even if the thing be unjust, the injustice has got to continue.  Even if the thing be foolish, the foolishness has got to continue.  Do you think that there is an army in the world which would enter upon a war situation by creating discontent and distrust in one of the important services of that army? Could the Minister, or either of the Ministers, put as much as one example to me where, when pay was considered too high in any Department of the State, the contract of serving officers or officials was violated?  Very often, pay scales are altered for those who come in after the alteration but never were the prospects and contract of serving officers or officials violated.  If that were to be taken as a precedent for commercial life in this or in any other country, we should have such a general break down in business that we would have continuous revolution. The Minister is, weakly, going to stand for that.  The Minister is going to perpetuate the blunder of his predecessor in office and is going to make the thing more offensive and more hurtful.</P>
    <P>As soon as the regulation was brought in, officers, with families, who had served 15 years and who had given loyal and conscientious service to two Governments, could not get an increase of a halfpenny a year in their income <Col N="1539" /> no matter what promotion they ever secured.  A month after the regulation was brought in, in order to make a joke of the unfortunate men and their families, 20 or 30 of them were promoted.  They were to provide increased amenities for their families by the extra bauble on the shoulder. Even that was done in a blundering, hurried kind of way.  You had a dental service in the Army, like any other military service anywhere, with one higher than the others.  You promoted all below and forgot the man on top. Would I be making an outrageous suggestion if I were to say that even now that should be rectified?  It will not cost a halfpenny.  Unfortunately, it will never cost a halfpenny.  The only difference it would mean would be, that the man would have, perhaps, two years longer of Army service if he got higher rank.  He has done his work conscientiously, efficiently, loyally and reliably.  He has had custody of thousands of pounds' worth of easily transportable goods in the form of gold.  He carried out those functions in the most difficult and turbulent days.  He had the rank of captain and held that rank for 16 years; he had that degree of seniority, having been in first.  He carried on very responsible duties.  I take it that it was an oversight.  I hope that particular oversight will be attended to.</P>
    <P>We have the extraordinary position in connection with this Vote&mdash;I do not know if anybody has experienced it before&mdash;of one Minister being carried on another Minister's back.  We have the Vote for the Minister for Defence moved and, tucked away inside it, we have the Vote for the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. We have never heard anything at any time about the functions, duties or responsibilities of that particular Nabob; we merely have the privilege of voting the money for the staffing of the office.  We know that somewhere under his supervision there is a censor's department, and we also know that that censor's department is headed by an able, an experienced ex-Minister. The title is the Minister <Col N="1540" /> for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  The cost of the office in salaries is shown here as something about £15,000 a year.  There are 200 and odd people employed, according to the book of estimates, and we get only the cost of the salaries of 15 of them.  The other 185, we are told, are shown elsewhere.  Anybody who has a week or two to spare can hunt the slipper through the book of estimates to find the total cost.</P>
    <P>What is the total cost of that particular office and what was it created for?  Where did co-ordination break down inside the Department of Defence?  If the present Minister for Co-ordination, who was Minister for Defence for seven and a half years, was a success in his post, if he had the confidence of the Taoiseach and his colleagues, was not a war situation the very time when he should be left there?  If, on the other hand, he had not the confidence of the Taoiseach or his colleagues, were there not vacant Ministries if it was necessary to retain his services?  Why create a new Ministry with a big name?  Such a Ministry was created in Great Britain when that country entered the war and such a Ministry was discontinued by Great Britain at war.  At least we knew there was a multitude of independent defence and offence services to be co-ordinated there.  The Air Force was independent of the Army and Navy; the Navy was independent of the Army; the Army was independent of both of the others.  You had three Ministries of defence and offence. Co-ordination there might have been necessary.</P>
    <P>With us, our Air Force, our Army and our Navy are all under the common management, control and supervision of the Minister for Defence.  A Minister was appointed to co-ordinate that Ministry of Defence with what, with whom and for what purpose?  What is the justification, what is the reason for it all? What are the functions of this new, costly office?  Money is wanted acutely outside the Army.  If we are to believe Ministerial statements, money is urgently wanted inside the Army.  We <Col N="1541" /> have a new office, a useless office, that, if all were totted up, is costing perhaps £250,000 a year.  It is rather an expensive pedestal on top of which to place even the worthiest object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked to vote to-day the salary of the Minister for Defence and this provides us with an opportunity of reviewing the activities of the Minister and his Department and, generally, the standing of the Army in respect to the money which we are now being asked to vote for its maintenance.  I had occasion in the Dáil some time ago to endeavour to elicit some information from the Minister as to the notorious raid which took place on the Magazine Fort last December and which profoundly shocked everybody in this country.  That raid clearly indicated that the standard of efficiency in the Army was not as high as it should be. That may not be due, and I do not believe it was due, to any negligence on the part of officers, non-commissioned officers or the other ranks.  It was probably due to the higher Army policy for which the Minister must be held responsible.  Deputies will remember that on that occasion approximately 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition belonging to the State were taken away in a manner that would have done credit to a low-class pantomime at Christmas.  The Army was put in a very false position in connection with the matter and the country had demonstrated for it the rather ironic spectacle of the chief arsenal in the State being raided by a party of armed men who felt it so unnecessary to conceal their movements that, according to Press reports, they were able to take between 30 and 40 heavy lorries, leisurely load them with State ammunition, and take them away to various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that raid a military inquiry was held.  Certain officers were required to attend the inquiry and give evidence in order to piece together the set of circumstances which led up to the raid.  The officers attended, gave their evidence and, during the period in which they gave <Col N="1542" /> the evidence, no reflection whatever was made upon their characters and no reflection was made upon their conduct, either as citizens or as soldiers.  They gave their evidence to the best of their ability.  While that inquiry was in progress over a very substantial period, nobody in the court attempted to arraign the officers on any charge and, in fact, no charge was preferred against them.  Army Defence Regulations provide that if a charge is made against an officer which in any way reflects upon his conduct he is given an opportunity of being present during the remainder of the inquiry to hear any case that may be made against him and he is finally entitled to have a definite charge preferred against him and an opportunity given to him to meet that charge.  In this case the Minister for Defence; however slothful he may be in the matter of protecting State property, showed at least that he had certain mercurial qualities when it came to the administration of justice or injustice to people who were his subordinates.  The result of that inquiry was that the Minister, without giving the officers concerned the slightest opportunity of defending themselves, without preferring any charge whatever against them, simply notified them that on the evidence which they had tendered, as witnesses and not as defendants, he had come to certain decisions which were then promulgated by him.  We had, therefore, the rather extraordinary spectacle that certain military officers who had enjoyed the confidence of their chiefs were brought into the inquiry as witnesses and they left that inquiry as convicted offenders without a single charge being preferred against them.</P>
    <P>The coldness and inhumanity of the treatment they received is quite unworthy of the Minister and unworthy of a public department.  One officer with an unblemished national record, going back for years, was notified that on the evidence he gave he was to be dismissed the service without the payment of a ¼d. gratuity.  Another officer was called upon to resign in circumstances which did not entitle him to compensation.  Another officer did resign so that he would not be dismissed <Col N="1543" /> and that he would get such compensation as his services entitled him to.  Two other officers unconcerned in any way with the matter were placed on half pay.  If there was any proven evidence against these officers they should be dealt with by a military court of discipline.  If these officers had been tried and found guilty after a fully formulated charge against them I could understand their being dealt with.  But in this instance the officers had no charge preferred against them.  They were given no opportunity of defending themselves. They went into this inquiry as witnesses and came out as convicted offenders.  That is the procedure which the Minister adopts and which has been adopted in the case of people higher up.  I want to ask the Minister why, if these officers were guilty of offences, they were not tried by court martial?  Why was not a charge or a number of charges preferred against these officers if the Army authorities felt that it was possible to sustain charges against them?  Why were they not informed of what they were deemed to be guilty, and given an opportunity of defending themselves? Instead of that obviously fair procedure the Minister adopts the most unusual and cynical procedure of finding officers guilty on the evidence they tendered at an inquiry.  With that evidence he came with cynicism <i>in excelsis</i> and said to the officers concerned: &ldquo;I have decided to ask the Government to recommend to the Uachtarán to terminate your commissions and, though I have decided to do that, please let me know if you have any reasons to urge why I, having come to that decision coldly and deliberately, should change my mind?&rdquo; I would like to ask the Minister why these officers were not given, as they had a right to expect, trial by court martial with an opportunity of meeting the charges preferred against them; why they were not given an opportunity of meeting these charges and defending themselves and given an opportunity of showing that the responsibility for the mess that resulted in the raid on the Magazine Fort was <Col N="1544" /> the responsibility of the people higher up and not the responsibility of officers of their rank?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister when replying in this debate will give us information on that point, because the punishment meted out to these officers has left a very bad flavour in the public mouth, a flavour from the taste of which the Department of Defence will not recover for a long time&mdash;if indeed it will ever recover from this unsavoury business.  I want to know if it is possible in discussing the Estimate, Votes 64 and 63 will be taken together, or whether 64 will be taken independently of 63?</P>

      <P>This is a rather peculiar situation that has arisen. May I point out that the Minister for Defence is responsible for sub-head AA in this Vote as he is responsible for every other sub-head in it, and there is no sub-head in the Vote that cannot be discussed in the Dáil.  I submit that the question of the point of order raised should be considered.  While I bow to the ruling of the Chair, I cannot accept in principle, without a protest, the ruling given.  On the general motion to refer back the Vote, I think at no time in the history of the country has a Vote been submitted to this House in such a haphazard fashion as this Vote has been by the Minister who introduced it.  It is only fitting, therefore, that it should be referred back for reconsideration. When the Estimate for the Department of Defence was moved in the Dáil last year, the Minister told us that it was essential that an increased sum should be given.  The Taoiseach also spoke, and I understood him to say that it was proposed to spend immediately substantial sums upon supplies, and in particular on munitions, but despite the time that has since elapsed no headway, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, has been made in procuring the essentials required for the defence of the country.  It appears to me that the <Col N="1549" /> Minister is in a position similar to that of a thatcher turning up to thatch a house without straw.  That is the position that has been created, and it is that situation that makes Defence, with its two Ministers, the laughing stock of the country.  We are being asked to vote this large sum of money which is so urgently required for other matters.  I suggest to the Government that, before they do that, they should agree to a reconsideration of the whole case, and take the House into their confidence in secret session, or by some other method, and then, having got a unified policy for the defence of the country, the House would be entitled to vote whatever sum was required.</P>
      <P>I want to pay a tribute to the Army in the sense that it is efficient and loyal.  Deputy O'Higgins, when speaking, put the percentage of Volunteers who are disloyal as high as 10 per cent.  I would not go so far as that, but at the same time I want to say that even a much smaller percentage would be dangerous.  I feel that the Government, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures are responsible more than anybody else for that disloyalty, if disloyalty there be, and that they should take steps at the earliest possible moment to eliminate out of the minds of those people any thoughts that are in them of disloyalty, to the State.  Mobilisation took place, troops were thrown hurriedly into barracks where no arrangements had been made for their reception, and it is something to the credit of the Army that nothing serious happened in the way of illness, indiscipline, or outbreaks of any kind. They were mobilised and came into position under very great difficulties. I must say that so far as I saw them, and I have seen them all over the country, they have done well, and I think that the Army is to be commended for the things they have done well.  The housing accommodation for the Army is very bad, and some arrangements should be made during the summer time, if they are going to be kept over the winter, for the welfare of the Army generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> I am dissatisfied with the Minister's conduct of the administration of the Army and Army matters generally. Some time ago he told us here that he would not produce the findings of a court of inquiry or give us the contents of it&mdash;that it was not customary to do so.  Yet, last night, when it suited his purpose to bolster up an injustice done to a widow and orphans, he quoted from the evidence given before a court of inquiry without the slightest compunction.  I think that that was unfair.  I might say that in raising that question last night I had no intention except to put the facts before the Minister.  He did not accept them.  I am not going to go into the matter now, but I hope that he will reconsider it and remember one point in particular&mdash;that he relies upon the evidence of an officer in the case who came up a considerable time after the incident had occurred, and therefore did not see it, although there is the evidence of two soldiers to the contrary. I just want to remind the Minister of that and, in the interests of justice, I appeal to him to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>In connection with the allowances for the wives and families of serving soldiers there has been and continues to be grave delay in their payment. Citizens of this State answered the Minister's call to join the Volunteers and when the mobilisation took place they immediately responded leaving behind their wives and families.  In scores of instances it has been brought to my notice that wives and families were left practically penniless and had to appeal to the local authorities for assistance to prevent them from starving. I could understand that happening some years ago, but under the present organised condition of the Department of Defence that is a situation that should not arise now.  A similar situation arose in regard to the emergency supplies that had to be procured in certain towns.  Even the vegetables that were provided for the troops were not paid for until weeks or months afterwards.  Again, that is a situation that should not have arisen at this stage.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is increased expenditure on Army transport.  I feel <Col N="1551" /> that the Minister should have given us more details of the use that transport was put to during the last six or seven months and what it is intended to do in the future.  There have been grave complaints of extensive driving of lorries by people who were being taught to drive; that these lorries were being driven on the public roads by learners, which is the only word you can use to describe them, and that they were a menace to the other users of the road.  Surely there are places in barracks and in the Curragh Camp where that training could have been given without endangering either the drivers or the public at a time like that.  However, it seems that nothing serious happened, except that a number of other road users got severe shocks and some of them suffered from nerves for some time afterwards as a result of meeting these lorries driven by learners on the roads, particularly in the Midlands.</P>
    <P>I feel that the expenditure of such a sum as this on an infantry force is hardly justified.  I believe, if this country is attacked, that the defence that would be most effective would be by means of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns.  The expenditure, if we must incur it, should in my opinion be utilised in that direction, but there is no indication that we are going to be in a position to get either sufficient aircraft or anti-craft guns to be effective.  The Minister will recollect that, when speaking on the Army Vote before, I said that a ground army would only be effective against another ground army that would invade our territory.  I pointed out that before a ground army of any strength could come in here the British Air Force and the British Navy would have to be defeated, and that if any Power succeeded in coming in here after doing that we would have very little use in putting up a force to oppose them.  As a matter of fact, I said, in a jocose way, that the then Lord Mayor should be sent out to shake hands with them as being the best method of defence. I said that only an air force and an anti-aircraft gunnery force would be of any use for defensive purposes and that this expenditure was a waste of public <Col N="1552" /> money.  I, therefore, suggest to the House that this Vote should be referred back for reconsideration and that a meeting of members of the different Parties should be held at which the Government would show their hand so that there would be a positive unified policy that every section of the country could support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Vote.  I have consistently opposed in this House the amount proposed to be spent on the Army and I oppose this Vote on two grounds.  First of all, I think the amount involved is too much.  Secondly, even though the amount is too much, the taxpayer has not been and will not be getting value for his money.  For years past, there has been an annual expenditure for defence purposes and, ours being a little State, the defence forces which we had and the money which was spent on their upkeep, could only be considered more or less in the nature of an insurance against some future possibility, a possibility such as the state of emergency which exists in Europe and, in fact, in the whole world at the present time. Our only justification for expending annually these large sums on the maintenance of a defence force&mdash;apart of course from whatever forces would be necessary to maintain internal order&mdash; was the danger of an emergency such as has occured during the past 12 months.  The emergency has now arisen and we find that, what was for many years past a national luxury, and should now be a useful instrument, cannot be converted into such a useful instrument without an enormous expenditure of extra money.  For that reason I think the expenditure which we are asked to approve, together with other sums which have been voted during the past 12 months, is very much too high and should not be voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is that during past years, when the defence situation was considered, it must have occurred to the people in charge of affairs to look ahead and to anticipate what the situation of the country would be and what they would do in time of emergency.  So far as I can see, no plan appears to have existed. <Col N="1553" /> I think it was the duty of the Defence Department to look forward and to find out exactly what was the correct position for a State of this kind to adopt in a general conflict such as is taking place at the present time.  They ought to have considered whether the job could be done at all and if so what it would cost to do it.  Without wishing to say anything derogatory against the country or its status, my view has been that the country is so small, that our resources are so limited, that while we would be prepared to defend our liberty and our independence to the last man against any aggressor, no matter where he came from, we would be unable successfully to do so having regard to our limited resources.  I think I put forward that view in this House before.  On the last occasion on which I did so we had not the advantage of the knowledge that we have now.  We had not illustrations of the three attitudes adopted by three different States during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I think that with the examples of, and with the results of the attacks on, these three States before us we ought to reconsider our position in so far as it affects the Defence Estimate.  The outbreak of the war in Europe was signalised by an attack on Poland by Germany.  Poland and this country cannot very well be compared with each other because Poland is a very much larger State than this country. The Polish Army put up a resistance to the invader and were overcome. Another State that was attacked was Finland.  The army there also put up a resistance, a very gallant resistance, a resistance, I suppose, that will go down in history, but in the end they gave in.  The third State invaded was the State of Denmark and it put up no resistance at all.  Of all States in Europe, in fact of all States in the world, Denmark is the one that approximates most to our own.  Is there any thinking man in this country to-day who, if he had the courage to say so, would not admit that Denmark had chosen the better part, in not spending unnecessary sums of money on defence purposes which, when the emergency arose, were <Col N="1554" /> found to be useless?  I think that is very largely our position here.</P>
    <P>I suppose I shall be attacked for having given expression to these sentiments and for having suggested that we are not capable of defending ourselves but, be that as it may, I think we ought to face realities.  If we wish to defend ourselves adequately and properly it would not be an expenditure of £3,000,000 that would be required; it would be an expenditure of £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 that would be necessary.  Why spend this money for the simple purpose of suggesting that we are capable of dealing with any challenge that may come and so make our country a battlefield in which other nations would settle their quarrels?  It may be that I am wrong in stating that the people are not getting sufficient value for this expenditure. A member of the Opposition could not possibly have the information which the Government has in matters of this kind.  It may be the opinion of the Government, having consulted their advisers, that this expenditure is necessary but I do not see how we are getting sufficient value for it.</P>
    <P>We have a magnificent little regular force, an Army well trained, which looks very well on parade and very smart in the streets, but the duties of the Defence Department do not finish with that.  I do not think there is a single individual in this country who has received any instruction from the Government, or any information from any Government Department, informing him of what he is to do in case of an invasion, in case of an attack or in case of some sudden emergency which had not been foreseen.  Whatever plans are to rule in this country in case of an invasion or an attack upon our shores, these plans are evidently locked in some safe in the offices of the Department and are not known to any single individual.  I am not now suggesting that the Government should tell the country what their general plans are, but I do think if we were to wake up to-morrow morning to find that some enemy had landed on our shores, the general public should have some information beforehand as to <Col N="1555" /> what is to be done by them as individual citizens in case of an emergency of that kind.  So far as I can see, the Department of Defence have confined themselves to ordering&mdash;or arranging to order; I do not know whether the goods have arrived yet&mdash;vast quantities of warlike material.</P>
    <P>They are also increasing the size of the Army, but they are doing nothing else whatever towards solving the problems which are bound to arise.  I think this point is material upon this Vote and upon the point which I have just stated.  The Government asked us to consider that the duties of defending this country were not confined to training and equipping military forces, but also included outside measures of defence.  So much did they consider that that a new Department was brought into existence and a Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was appointed to that position from the Department of Defence.  It was so important that we had to have a new Department and a new Minister.  I do not think we should be guided very much by comparisons with other countries; but, at all events, the British, having brought such a Minister into existence, later ended his existence.  However, I do not quarrel with the existence of the Department of the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures nor with the Minister over that Department, if the public is going to get some value from it.  I understand that his position was created to prepare the country generally for such an emergency as is envisaged and to give each individual member of the public some knowledge, some information and some guide as to what to do in a time of emergency. No such information has been given.</P>
    <P>It is in no spirit of hostility to the Army or even to the Department that I have made these remarks.  Discussing a question of this kind, discussing the Defence Vote, everyone realises that we are dealing with realities. This time last year, I do not think any individual here could have believed that within 12 months the face of <Col N="1556" /> Europe could and would have changed to present the picture which it presents at the present time.  If there had been a prophet here 12 months ago who could state that Poland, Denmark, Norway and parts of Finland would have disappeared within 12 months, I think such a prophet would have been laughed out of court.  In dealing with this Vote, we are dealing with grim realities, we are dealing with a situation that has not existed in the world since the Barbarians broke down the outer walls of the Roman Empire, and the civilisation that ruled the then known world&mdash;and which has left its imprint down to the present day&mdash;disappeared almost completely. In such a time and in such circumstances as exist at the present day, and when all modern civilisation is in jeopardy, I think it behoves us in this little outpost of Christendom to consider very carefully every step we take lest we be embroiled in the general conflagration.</P>
    <P>I can only say that, as the result of holding ourselves out as a militaristic power&mdash;even if only in a minor way&mdash; we are merely putting down the drawbridge, opening the doors and inviting the belligerents from every part of the world to settle their quarrels, not in our backyard, but in our front garden. We need only read what is happening from day to day in the strategy of the world, when all the belligerents are looking for someone else's soil to fight upon, to realise that the only way in which we can keep ourselves from invasion is by showing that we are in reality men of peace.  Instead of that, we have this increased expenditure, and the possibility of invasion is given as the excuse.  We should create the opposite attitude in the world; we should endeavour to show the neutrals and the belligerents that we are neutral indeed.  In my sincere submission the only way that we can do that is by continuing the policy of the Department of Defence as it existed in peace time, by limiting the amount of our supplies to that Department as they existed in peace time.  If we did that, we would be going a fair way to show the world that this would not be the proper place in which to carry on the war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> I should like it to be understood clearly that I am not hostile in any way to the Department of Defence or to our National Army.  I appreciate and realise the seriousness of the situation in Europe at the present time, when countries are disappearing evernight; but it is a very serious thing indeed to suggest that the situation which has arisen in Europe makes it necessary for us to order one extra rifle or one extra machine gun, or additional equipment of that kind.</P>

      <P>This is a rather enormous Vote&mdash;the biggest, I think, that Deputies will have to consider during the year, and I wish to ask a few questions regarding some items.  I understand a ruling has been given here that, notwithstanding the matter carried under sub-head AA., any discussion of the administration of the Offences Against the State Act is out of order.  If that is the case, I should like the Minister to tell us what he wants £15,000 for, under that heading. I have no wish to discuss the matter which I understand Deputy Norton wished to discuss, and I think it would be unwise to discuss it in this House, but it is going to add fuel to the fires of propaganda which people are trying to light outside if this House presents the appearance of being unwilling to have a matter of that kind brought up for public discussion.  This House as an institution will fail in the eyes of the people if it is believed that the Government and the Deputies are not capable of standing up to a discussion on that matter.</P>

It is a matter which, if it were allowed to be discussed, I would not discuss.  I have already said more about it than I would say if it were free for discussion. If we are a parliamentary institution, and if this country is still ruled by reason, and if debate and argument are not to be allowed to all Deputies to raise a matter that is concerned with administration, I think we have had a very bad day.</P>

      <P>I always thought that this House was sufficiently free to be able to say, on an occasion when a ruling has been raised, whether they would agree with it.  Will the Minister tell me what he wants £15,611 for in this connection?  We will be able after that to understand and get the framework of the ruling.  That is one thing.</P>
      <P>We are asked here to pass a Vote of £3,355,000 odd for the upkeep of an army and to provide for certain stores for that army in the coming year.  I would like to get that into another context. When we pass this Vote a certain number of Votes will have been taken by this House and we will have voted something like £10,000,000 worth of money.  About one-third of the whole bulk Estimates will have been voted when we pass this £3,355,000.  If we contrast the particular sum in question with what was on the 1931-32 Estimates for the particular group of Votes, the Estimates are up by £3,500,000.  We have been told when we began to criticise the extra expenditure that the people of this country had to face, that there are social services. In that sum of money, roughly one-third of the Estimates, which show an increase over 1931-32 of £3,500,000, I can find two big items classed as social services&mdash;the amount for widows' and orphans' pensions and the sums of money included in the Local Government Vote by way of free milk and feeding for children, which come to about £1,000,000.  Taking those out, we have an increase in the one-third of the total Votes which we will have reached to-day of £2,500,000.  That is apart altogether from social services, and yet we are told there is no saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Vote we are asked to find this enormous sum of money.  There is one item in regard to which the minds of the people have definitely been disturbed&mdash;an item on page 323&mdash;warlike stores.  The sum this year is £123,000. That is contrasted, on page 323, with a sum of money alleged to have been voted for the purpose last year which is stated to have been a sum of £381,000.  When I turn to the Estimates for last year it is not £381,000; it is £1,120,000.  Something like <Col N="1560" /> £800,000 has somewhere disappeared. We know how that happened.  The Ministry last year came in and asked for £1,120,000 for warlike stores which were represented as being urgently required. They got the people to vote the money and they taxed the people for these warlike stores which were supposed to be so urgently necessary. Then, in the autumn, they came in with a Supplementary Estimate for a Token Vote of £10, because the money required for warlike stores could not be spent.  We could not get the warlike stores.  Year after year that item &mdash;warlike stores&mdash;has appeared in every Estimate.  Year after year some sums of money, different amounts, have been voted.  Roughly, they were under £250,000.  They ran about the £200,000 or £250,000 mark.</P>
    <P>In the years of peace we have had from 1931-32&mdash;to take that period&mdash;up to the present I cannot conceive that there was £250,000 worth of warlike stores either used or rendered obsolete in any year.  What happened to these sums of money that year after year were voted for warlike stores?  Was there any accumulation of material and, if so, what happened it?  In any event, we appear to have faced the situation in the early part of last year like this, that whatever we had required year after year for the purpose of purchasing warlike stores and whatever stocks we had already in hand, we required £1,120,000 for extra purchases and we could not achieve those.  Now we see&mdash;and we are told that the proper contrast is to compare the figure with last year&mdash;that a sum of £123,000 is put down this year.  Where is the reality of this?  Last night we were told that stores to an amount of £2,400,000 had been ordered.  We had not been promised delivery by any specified date and any person would be a fool, under present circumstances, who could believe that delivery could be promised by any particular date. We have not been told anything with regard to the moneys.  Have we paid out anything or are the moneys to be paid on foot of deliveries when the stores arrive?  If so, what is the rate at which the best hopes will allege that these warlike stores will <Col N="1561" /> come into our possession?  One is tempted to take the ordinary easy course of saying, &ldquo;We may spend £400,000&mdash;another figure quoted by the Minister last night&mdash;this year, for warlike stores, which will arrive at our shores this year and therefore, at the end of six years, we will have spent the £2,400,000.&rdquo;  If the war does not last that length any number of nations will be ready to pass over to us all the obsolete and no longer required ammunition they have accumulated.  Does anybody believe that this country is going to expend over a period of about six years this sum of money and, if that is not the situation, does anybody believe that this country is going to get ammunition to the amount of the sum of money named last night by the Minister, that is, nearly £2,500,000?  What is the situation with regard to these warlike stores?  What have we in hand? What is the amount that there should be in hand from the old expenditure? What was wasted through use or deterioration in any particular year or over the eight years?  What was the situation we had here with regard to warlike stores, say, at the end of 1938 or last year when we began to realise the fact that a war situation was about to come?</P>
    <P>That is the big item on which public attention has been riveted.  We have a situation at the moment in which grants for housing have been cut down and an attempt has been made to stabilise the salaries given to certain people.  The Secretary to the Department of Finance addressed the civil servants the other day and told them as far as last year's figures are concerned that the Exchequer is short £2,000,000 on the year.  Everybody knows that business is deteriorating. The numbers of unemployed are increasing. People are certainly coming back, but not for the reasons the Ministers used to state.  In these circumstances, with everything being tightened, credit being restricted, development that was of some good being retarded, we are asked to expend these extra moneys.  We are not told when it is expected that the goods will come home and, as Deputy Esmonde and Deputy O'Higgins have said here <Col N="1562" /> to-day, we are not told for what purpose these stores, even if they could be got, are required.  The policy of the Government is summed up in a couple of phrases.  At the moment they are engaged in a certain amount of apology, making the excuse that, as a result of the outbreak of war last autumn, a certain number of people had to be mobilised, and we are now told by the Minister that a certain number of these people have been discharged. We are told that there is a decrease of 29 officers and 6,793 of all other ranks&mdash;a demobilisation of, let us call it, 7,000 people; and the impression that was left by the Minister last night was that the partial demobilisation that had taken place up to that was to continue.  Apparently, therefore, the situation is that we are now demobilising men who, apparently, were required last September, and who are now no longer required, and at the same time increasing expenditure on the supply of warlike stores of ammunition and so on for men who are no longer required.  What do we want this vast accumulation of stores for, when we are demonilising men?  If we wanted these men, what stores of ammunition, and so on, were to be at their disposal and, if the men were no longer required, what did we want the stores for?  Was it just a pretence so that the people might assume that the Army would be properly run and properly used?  If we are demobilising these men because they were useless and unnecessary, and because the expenditure on these people was useless and unnecessary&mdash;since they cannot very well go out to fight with their bare hands&mdash;and if there is to be nothing in the nature of belligerency here, why are we now increasing our efforts here to deal with other countries that are now making and producing the munitions of war and selling them at famine prices?  These are the conditions to which we have been brought by seven or eight years of Fianna Fáil watchfulness over the interests of our country.</P>
    <P>In addition to that particular matter, which has already been laid before the House, we have this, which is the most important matter of all. What are we preparing against?  Is there any speculation as to who the possible <Col N="1563" /> or probable enemy of this country may be?  If we are faced with the possibility or probability of attack&mdash;and, in any case, that is what we were told this money was so sorely needed for&mdash; have we made any contacts or associations with other people in regard to our defence?  I remember being definitely incredulous as to whether the statements made by the Minister for Finance on the Emergency Budget last autumn were correct, and being shocked also.  The Minister for Finance told us then, in set terms, that certain sacrifices were being asked for, because there was a terrorist gang in existence, because that particular terrorist gang had to be put down, because that particular terrorist gang had attempted to embroil us in war with our neighbour, Great Britain, and that, as a result of the activities of that terrorist gang, two things were in jeopardy, namely, the neutrality of this country and its independence.  The Minister for Finance, in the speech that he made on the 9th November last &mdash;it is in the Official Reports&mdash;mentioned the fact that within our own terrorities we had certain subversive elements and organisations which have not hesitated to make attacks upon the lives and properties of the citizens and which had developed a technique of terrorism which presented a most difficult problem to the forces of the law, and he went on to say that the efforts of those people might mean embroiling us in war with a country with which, apparently, we did not wish to be at war, and that, therefore, a certain partial mobilisation had to take place in order to protect ourselves against these people.</P>
    <P>I remember another occasion on which we were told that we need not have any great anxiety about the future European war because, if any attack upon us by anybody were foreshadowed it would only be regarded as an attack on Great Britain, in which case Great Britain would be more anxious to defend herself than we ourselves, possibly, would be to defend our own country.  I should like to know if that is the prevailing mood at the moment. Have we made any arrangements for <Col N="1564" /> the meeting of such a danger?  If this country had any realisation that it was in any danger of attack, then, obviously, the money to be spent on an army certainly should have been stated to us some months ago&mdash;perhaps, with a certain amount of timidity, but at any rate it would be the best policy to pursue.  If it had been put before the people in that way, and if the people were told definitely that there was a danger of attack, then the money would be voted, if not with enthusiasm, at least willingly.  That would be so if the people could be brought to see what danger there is&mdash;whether a remote possibility of danger or a probable danger&mdash;and from what quarter the attack is likely to come.  Without that assurance, there is not going to be any enthusiasm or any national endeavour for anything that is being kept in the dark, as this matter is, or for anything that is shrouded under the cloak of secrecy.</P>
    <P>We have statements from various Ministers as to the quarter from which this danger of attack on our country may be feared&mdash;probably, as varied as the places from which they speak&mdash;but in the end they all fall back on the one thing, and that is this matter of neutrality.  Neutrality is spoken of in this House and outside this House as if it were some sort of a closed compartment in which people could hide, and as if people, having opted for a policy of neutrality, could have the assurance that that neutrality would be respected by everybody else. We all see what is happening in the world generally at the moment, but, apart from that, it should be realised that neutrality is actually nothing in the way of a policy.  It means nothing more than this: that if people realise their right to fight for their own independence, and if certain countries are forbidden by law to interfere in a quarrel, then, if they are hoping to stand out of a conflict, they have got to stand well out of it.  I can quite understand that this country has opted not to fight.  I can agree with that, but to hold neutrality out as a policy behind which we might crouch is only deluding the people, to my mind.  What else have we?  For some reason or another this country, last autumn, <Col N="1565" /> thought fit to mobilise some 6,000 or 7,000 men in order, presumably, to preserve our neutrality.  At the present moment, for some reason or another, some 6,000 of these people have been demobilised, but at the same time that the man-power of the country is being decreased, the munitions and stores requisite for that man-power are being increased.  We were told that our chances of getting these stores and ammunition were very remote, and that we should therefore avail of whatever opportunity presented itself.  That may be so, but still we are faced with this thing: that we are now demobilising 6,000 or 7,000 people since last autumn and at the same time increasing the amount of stores and ammunition for the Army.  That is the sacrifice that we are asked to make, in view of the European war, and it is a sacrifice that is not lightly to be borne.</P>
    <P>There is just one last item.  This Vote contains a new sub-head, P (2)&mdash; Marine Coast Watching Service&mdash;and the details of that sub-head show that we are to have patrol vessels and torpedo boats, and certain establishments for these, together with extra sums for allowances, clothing and provisions. On vessels, we have a capital sum, represented as £172,000.  The country is aware that one of these vessels came home, but the country is under some mystification as to exactly how it came home.  I am here as a Deputy of the Dáil, and all I know about that particular boat which did come home is what I saw in the newspapers. The information I have from the newspapers is that, on one occasion, I saw a picture of that boat being blessed in England and our High Commissioner in England hoisting the flag on it.  I thought that meant that the boat was ready to sail, and I awaited its arrival in this country immediately. Many weeks passed before it came here, and one would have thought that the boat, which was really the foundation of the Irish Navy, would have come here, but the next thing that an astonished public found was that there was a public reception for the boat at Waterford.  The Mayor of Waterford had ready a number of leather jerkins to present to the crew of the boat, and, since then, although <Col N="1566" /> it took some little time to get to Dun Laoghaire, it is possible to observe this boat lying at anchor there.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us what happened that boat?  Was she ready when the ceremony which was depicted in the newspapers of the hoisting of the flag and the christening took place, and, if so, what caused the delay in getting her here, and why was it that boat put into Waterford instead of coming straight to Dun Laoghaire? When the Minister is on that, will he tell us the exact fact with regard to what was described in the newspapers as an attack on the boat while she lay in Dun Laoghaire?  There are various stories told about it.  One is that some sort of party from shore tried to get on board, and another is that it was a party of an entirely different type. Most people are disinclined to believe the second story.  It was put out too lightly and too casually, and it is regarded merely as an excuse, but, arising out of whatever incident, a certain number of people were put to the discomfort and embarrassment of having their cars stopped and searches made in the region of Dun Laoghaire.  Would the Minister tell us what happened on that occasion, and will he also tell us if this £172,000 which is being asked for in this year is the expenditure upon one boat?  I notice that the heading is in the plural: &ldquo;Vessels&mdash;capital, £172,000.&rdquo;  Have we reached the end of the expenditure upon these craft, and, if not, what is ahead of us?  Would the Minister tell us, again with regard to this particular side of his establishment, if there have been any orders placed forward for further craft, and, if so, to what extent, and when does he expect delivery?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to vote the enormous sum of £3,355,420 on this Estimate, which gives the House an opportunity of reviewing the activity of the Minister's Department and the usefulness of the Army in the service of this country.  We on this side are vigorously opposed to this expenditure because we believe that the bulk of the Vote is sheer waste of public money.  That there is no justification for it is beyond question, and the Minister has not made the <Col N="1567" /> slightest effort to justify such an unwarranted charge.  I am no authority on Army policy or defence matters, and I do not propose to dictate policy, but, as a member of this House, I am entitled to question how the taxpayers' money is being spent. Recognising the fact that we are a sovereign and autonomous State, I appreciate the necessity for maintaining our Army to preserve our status and our integrity as a nation and to preserve internal order, but, in my opinion, our national integrity is in far greater danger from economic and financial stringency within than from invasion from without.  We are suffering from a grossly excessive and unjustifiable taxation for the financing of Government services, and this Vote is an outstanding example of it.  This relatively poor country is groaning under cruel burdens of unnecessary taxation, and the worst feature of the situation is that we are getting very bad value for our money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing this Estimate, gave us details of the strength of the regular Army and the Volunteers at present, the strength a few months ago, the numbers of men demobilised and the proposed strength of the Army for the coming year.  He mentioned torpedo boats, patrol boats, coast watching services, postal censorship and A.R.P., but he made no reference whatever to Army policy.  He made no attempt to justify this expenditure or to deal with the considerations which have determined Army policy and, consequently, the justification for this huge sum of money. What is the position, and what has happened?  In an atmosphere of panic last September we had a huge mobilisation, and every available man in the regular Army, the reserve and the Volunteers was called up, many of them being called from the harvest field, where their services were urgently required.  We had tremendous Army activity all over the country, indicating the high state of panic existing&mdash;going down to a motor factory in Cork and commandeering every available motor vehicle there. We had a huge number of motor lorries on the Curragh standing, if one might <Col N="1568" /> use the term, to attention, and being started up every hour, as if war was imminent and as if the enemy was at our very throats.  We had young fellows, learners, driving lorries all over the country, with the result that people on the public highways, particularly in County Kildare, were in imminent danger of being killed.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Supplies that sufficient supplies would be available and were warned against hoarding.  The greatest offender in the way of hoarding was the Government. The Army hoarded huge quantities of coal on the Curragh in a most disgraceful manner.  Sufficient accommodation was not available in the ordinary sheds, and a huge amount of coal was dumped in green fields some time last November.  In the ordinary way that coal would be delivered from the rail head, but in this instance it was packed into hired lorries and the coal was then dumped in fields.  Naturally, at such a time of the year, when the lorries went in on the soft grass, they sank in it, and the drivers simply let down the side boards and shovelled the coal under the wheels.  In other words, the lorries actually made a road of coal into the coal dump.  That is what actually happened at the Curragh, although the public were warned against hoarding.  As the coal was out during the winter, and exposed to the weather, anyone with any experience knows that it could only become a heap of slack and dirt.  That is how the business is done.  It is just an example of how the Army stores are handled.</P>
    <P>We were told that huge orders were placed abroad for warlike stores, but that they have not arrived.  Huge sums of money were also expended on the black-out and in protection for the civil population.  Then when the atmosphere became calmer a decision was reached to reduce the personnel of the Army.  We were told that over 6,000 men were to be demobilised.  The present strength of the Army is about 14,000.  The Minister said it was the intention to reduce it during the coming year to 12,000 officers and men, and that there was likely to be a further reduction to what was considered a safe margin.  We want to <Col N="1569" /> know if there is any Army policy, or if the Minister and his Department know where they stand in that respect.  We have not been told the Minister's intentions. What does he anticipate may happen?  If he anticipate danger, where is it likely to come from?  Has any attempt been made to associate other friendly Powers with the defence of this country if it is in danger? Even at the present time, is the position being examined?</P>
    <P>If German aggression continues, when will our turn come?  If the German Army invades Holland and Belgium, is it possible that our turn might come next?  In that event, is anything being done to protect this country against the possibility of an invasion?  No assurance was given by the Minister to indicate that any measures have been taken to protect this country, even in the limited way that we could protect it.  It has been pointed out from these benches that a standing Army of 14,000 or of 20,000 men would be utterly useless in the face of a modern army of a major Power attempting to land here.  The best proof of that is to remember what happened recently in Denmark.  Denmark had a standing army of about the same strength as our Army, but scarcely a shot was fired when that country was invaded.  We may take it, more or less, that if we were unfortunate enough to be similarly circumstanced the situation would be the same.  We are not in a position to defend ourselves at the present time as we have no warlike stores.  We have an Army practically with bare hands or at best a few rifles.  What good would they be in face of a modern army?  It was pointed out previously from this side of the House that if money was to be spent to protect the country, we should develop an air arm, as money spent on aircraft would be usefully spent, as well as on anti-aircraft guns along the coast.</P>
    <P>I noticed a report in the Press recently which stated that a threat was made against this country if we continued to supply foodstuffs to Great Britain, and that certain measures might be taken to prevent us doing so. That might mean a visitation from <Col N="1570" /> bombers.  In that event, is it not obvious that the aircraft wanted here are a few fighters to meet any bombers that may come across?  They might be useful in such an eventuality.  It appears to me that no attempt whatever has been made to study that problem and to spend the taxpayers' hardearned money to any useful purpose. It is simply squandermania all the time.  Under sub-head P (2) £319,000 is to be spent as against £118,000 last year on marine and coast-watching services, or an increase of £200,000. The House has not been given any information about the purpose of such costly services.  Are they intended to protect fishing?  What are these boats going to do if we are attacked? Under sub-head P (1) £116,000 is to be provided for the protection of the civil population against air and gas attacks, as against £94,000 last year.  How is that money being spent?  Is there any danger of an air attack here?  What is the strength of our air offences?  How many anti-aircraft guns and how many fighter machines have we?</P>
    <P>There is a sum of £121,000 down for warlike stores, Last year, the sum was £375,000 and there was a Supplementary Vote of about £1,000,000, making a huge sum for warlike stores which have not arrived yet.  Are we going to wait until the war is over and then take delivery of these stores?  It appears to me that there is no intelligence whatever behind this demand, that it is sheer waste of public money at a time when the unfortunate people can ill-afford it.  What is the usefulness of this Army?  Is it merely an ornament?  Would the Minister, in replying, give us some idea of the source from which danger might be expected, the measures being taken in the event of that danger becoming imminent, and state if any representations have been made to any friendly country to come to our assistance or if we are simply sheltering behind our neutrality?  Our neutrality at present is everything. Does the present position simply mean that we know that, if the Germans attempt an invasion, the British will be interested and that we can rely on the British Navy to defend this country, not because they have any interest in us but to prevent their enemy <Col N="1571" /> using this country as a jumping-off ground?  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that, on a very important Vote, involving a huge sum, the responsible Minister should come in and simply give us a few figures as to the strength of the Army, making no reference to Army policy or to our position at the moment.  For these reasons, I support the motion by Deputy O'Higgins to refer the Estimate back. Under no circumstances would a Vote of this magnitude be justifiable.  If we are going to spend money at all, let it be spent in producing something we can sell.  The country is crying out for credit.  Credit is limited and money is difficult to get.  In these circumstances, the spending of a huge sum of money on the Army is, to my mind, a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that, in the year 1940, we still have no Army policy.  It is high time that we had a policy.  Our Army has been established for, at least, 17 years, and we should know what the policy of the Army is.  What is the policy of the Minister and of the Government in this regard?  Members of the Army are, like the rest of us, human, and unless they know the policy of the Minister or the Government I do not think you can expect really good soldiers.  Since 1923 we had a good little Army.  It was small in numbers but big in other respects, and it was loyal to any Government charged with responsibility by the people.  In order to maintain that loyalty it is but fair to the Army that they should know the policy of the Government, that it is not a shifting policy from one day to another, that it is not a policy that changes with every Minister.  If the Army knew that, I believe the defence of this country could be effected at much lesser cost.  Throughout the country I find that the members of the Army are somewhat disgruntled&mdash;I do not mean a large number of them. They are not the same men we knew some years ago.  They are one day trying to satisfy one Minister for Defence and another day trying to satisfy another Minister.  That is not right in respect of an Army.  So far <Col N="1572" /> as I can see, that is the position, and it is being intensified every day.  The men are getting more disgruntled.</P>
      <P>I think there should be greater co-operation between the Volunteer Force and the other section of the Army.  The co-operation that I should like to see is not present.  It is no harm to mention that in this House.  This is really the place to mention it, and it is the Minister's job to see that there is greater co-operation between the two forces.  These forces are paid to protect this country and, unless there is co-operation between them, where are the people?  I should like the Minister to see that, in future, there is greater co-operation between these forces.  It is all right for the Minister to say that the increase in the Army Estimate is due to the war.  What effort has he made, or what effort have his officers made, to preserve or protect this country as a result of the increase in expenditure from £1,250,000 to practically £3,250,000?  The country wants some reply to that question.  The people would be pleased to pay for defence or protection if they knew they were going to get it, but, so far as I know, the people in the west are doubtful as to the protection they are to get.</P>
      <P>One thing which is exciting the minds of the people has been mentioned by a few other Deputies.  I refer to the increase under sub-head AA&mdash;Expenses in connection with the Offences Against the State Act&mdash;from £4,000 to £15,000.  That is an indication by the Government that these crimes, or whatever you call the activities of a particular organisation, are going to increase three-fold in the next 12 months. I should like the Minister to make clear whether or not he has that organisation in hand or whether the country is to expect in the next 12 months three-fold activity by whatever organisation he has in mind.  If that be so, it does not bode well for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back on the subheads, I find that there is an increase of £22,301 in the cost of protecting the civil population against air and gas attack.  Outside of Dublin, what education or training have the people got in regard to protection against air and gas <Col N="1573" /> attacks?  So far as I can see, they have got none outside of the City of Dublin.  What is the idea of such a sub-head, which shows an increase of £22,301? The estimate for this year is £116,855 and the amount for last year was £94,554, yet the people throughout the country generally are getting no benefit from that expenditure.</P>
    <P>What would happen throughout the country&mdash;outside Dublin City&mdash;if there were a gas attack?  Has any provision been made for the proper protection of the people?  So far as I know, no provision has been made for the protection of the people in the country.  If such an attack were made, the people would be completely helpless, although you are estimating for an expenditure of £116,855 for the protection of the civil population.  The people in the country require some explanation and they are entitled to get it.  We hope that Ireland will long be spared from such attacks, that we will get along in the future as we have in the past few months and that we will be kept out of this war.  At the same time we are paying heavily for certain measures of protection and the people are entitled to know, if such an attack is made, what they are going to do.</P>
    <P>We are making great preparations as regards the number of men we are recruiting and we are supposed to be accumulating stores.  As regards warlike stores, a rather strange thing seems to have occurred.  If we are preparing to defend this country, it seems rather peculiar that under sub-head Q &mdash;Engineer Stores&mdash;we are estimating for an expenditure of £18,655 less than last year.  In 1939-40, the estimate amounted to £25,650 and in the current year it has gone down to £6,985.  Does that indicate that we are going ahead? There is an increase of £10,000 for the co-ordination of defensive measures and you are reducing a most important department to the extent of over £18,000.  If anything were to happen in this country, the most important department would be that dealing with engineer stores and yet you are reducing expenditure there.  You are increasing your general estimate by over <Col N="1574" /> £2,000,000 and that increase is spread over practically every arm of defence except this particular one, the engineer stores department, which I believe is a most important one.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is really serious when he allows an estimate like that to be put in.  Why should there be a reduction in the engineer stores? When you are increasing the expenditure in your Army you have certainly to increase the expenditure in the engineer stores department proportionately. Instead of that you are reducing the expenditure by about one-third.</P>
    <P>The House is also entitled to know how the expenditure is distributed in the Office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  The salaries, wages and other allowances have increased from £7,000 last year to £15,000 for the current year, showing an increase of something over £8,000.  The House is entitled to some information about that.  Why is it necessary to have two Ministers to look after the defence of this little country with such a small Army?  I must say that from my knowledge of the two Ministers, I do not think that this country is at all safe.  You have two men organising an Army, and they have not a weapon nor an ounce of ammunition to put into a soldier's hands.  We have two men who are drawing £1,700 each of the taxpayers' money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not get vexed.  I am quite serious.  Has it not been mentioned time and again this evening, on the subject of warlike stories, that you are not able to get arms or ammunition, that you made no preparation sufficient to meet the situation?  Ever since 1931, the Army Estimate has been increasing each year, even when there was not a war on.  The Army Estimate increased from something over £1,000,000 in 1932 to £1,700,000 in 1937. There is certainly a terrible lot of waste in the Army at the present time, and the Ministers responsible to this House are the two Ministers opposite. The Army was not in a panic, but certainly the members of the Government <Col N="1575" /> were in a panic last September.  Men were mobilised and called to the barracks and they had not a uniform to wear.  There were men at points along the railway lines for a week last September, and they did not know what they were there for.  There were blackouts in every little village in the country, and you had the Civic Guards holding up cars and making motorists shade their lights.  What was all that panic for?</P>
      <P>The Government are just the same to-day as they were a few years ago; they are panicky.  I advise them, no matter how long they keep in office, and I suppose it will not be very long, to keep cool.  There is no purpose served by getting panicky now.  Keep cool and get the Army on a right footing. Save and have no waste.  You have a good standing Army.  You had a good reserve force, but you were not satisfied with it; you had to bring in your own men in order to spy on the others, who were found to be good Irishmen and good soldiers.  Now you have not such a good Army.  I am doubtful whether you have the loyalty in the Army to-day that you had when you took over office ten years ago. The old loyalty would have continued if you had treated the men in a fair way.  That Army was prepared to remain loyal to the country, to serve it, and not to have waste.  If anything happens, the two men responsible will be the Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather surprising that such little interest is taken in a Vote totalling such a very big sum as we have been asked for here for the Department of Defence.  Last year when the Army Vote was under consideration we were honoured by the attendance of the Prime Minister and many other Ministers.  It is left now to the substitute Minister for Defence, who was appointed only last September, to shoulder the entire responsibility. One would expect in a case of this sort, having regard to the case made this time 12 months and the changes that have taken place since, that at least the House would have the <Col N="1576" /> benefit of the opinions of some Ministers as to what the policy is with regard to this matter.  There is scarcely a country in Europe at the present moment that is in a state of complacency. But with very few exceptions one thing distinguishes them all and that is their being aware of the fact that it is a time of crisis and emergency and they are seeking common ground in respect of the great big problems that are facing them.  These problems were never more troublesome, complicated or dangerous for at least 25 years than they are to-day.</P>
      <P>Now, here is a case where the Government has a comfortable majority in this House.  It is a majority of the most easy going &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; that any Government has in any part of the world.  No matter how much the policy differs from any promises made either in ancient or modern times, the Party lines up as if it were a drilled, disciplined branch of the Prussian Army, with not a discordant voice amongst them.  Surely with such loyalty the Minister should give them some excuse for following him into the Lobby on this Vote.  We had a statement last night with respect to the personnel of the non-commissioned officers and men in the Army.  That statement told us what sum of money was to be spent. I could not make out from the statement as reported in the press whether it was this year or last year and there was practically no other comment.  Is not that a manifest failure on the part of the Government to endeavour to get public confidence in the country, when every other Government in Europe is endeavouring to inspire its people with confidence in the policy they have got and in the soundness of that policy, so as to enable them to stand in support of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a change of policy here. Twelve months ago, that is, before the war, the Government's policy was to buy munitions.  Very large sums were asked for and voted for that purpose. We were told by the Prime Minister that there was £1,000,000 to be spent on guns and aeroplanes.  What has happened?  There was never before such a quick change of policy practised in any Legislature or before any <Col N="1577" /> Assembly.  No other Party but that disciplined Party opposite would stand for it and that is because there could not be collected in any other part of the world 77 or 78 &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; of that character.  Their loyalty is to be admired even if we have contempt for all the other attributes which they have got.  That is the one and only thing about them that can be admired.  If that loyalty were to one thing we would be satisfied.  If it were a policy of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; there would be something to commend it.  The only loyalty I see is that they are going to hang together instead of hanging separately, but they will hang.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to have brains and common sense than that sort of thing.  I could not stand that sort of thing.  The Scripture tells us that there is wisdom in a multitude of counsellors.  But there is none over there.  I would like to see it.  I would like to see wisdom on those benches, because, after all, this is our country. We have a party of Irishmen here, and if Deputies on the opposite side could say the same they would be in a happier frame of mind.  The Minister is bound to produce some sort of policy in this House.  There is none on this Vote.  Compared with the policy we had last year, there is a complete change.  Last year we had not got the war situation in Europe. We have a war situation now in which the Minister could have the support of all sections in the country.  There is no Party in this House that would not prefer agreement on a policy rather than the present position.  The present position makes us a laughing stock, and it is pitiable.  One almost regrets to be a member of this House, such as it is, in the circumstances with which we are faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take one particular item and see where we are.  Deputies opposite will at least have been supplied with the Book of Estimates, even if they have never looked at it.  Let us look at page 319.  Deputies will find at the top of the page there in the two columns 1939-40 and 1940-41, that there is involved in that sub-head £76,000 <Col N="1578" /> more this year than there was last year.  That is to say, the pay of the officers and men this year comes to £622,000, as against £546,000 odd last year.  Now let us look at the figures opposite those moneys in the same page, and it will be seen that there are 72 men less on the strength this year than last year.  Now, with a personnel of 72 less than last year of officers, non-commissioned officers and men, there is set down an expenditure of £76,000 more.  What public confidence can there be in these circumstances? Does it not require some explanation on the part of the Minister?  That is a fairly big sum of money.  We have not prospered so much during the past 12 months that we can afford to dispense with £76,000 additional without one word of expword of explanation.  With a smaller personnel of 72 less people than in 1939-40, it is costing us £76,000 additional. Now I will go on to another item.  The Minister, according to a report in the Press, told us last night that the ordinary stores cost £334,607, and the warlike stores £460,651.  I have not been able to find those figures.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some information as to where we could find them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, clothing, and that is not warlike stores.  I have taken out warlike stores from items I, J, L, N, O, P and F.  I have compared them with the corresponding figures in the Estimates for 1931-2.  These come to £302,000 for this year as against £169,000 in 1931-2.  If we had a war situation one of the important things is to have munitions.  We have a larger Army; we have more men if we take account of the reservists.  It is conceivable that we will have public confidence while having almost three times the number of men and less than twice the warlike stores for them? Compare the two sets, first peacetime and secondly wartime, and let us examine them further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find under sub-head L&mdash;Petrol and Oils and Mechanical Transport&mdash; £47,439.  The figure for 1939-40 was £45,000.  In 1931-32, for the corresponding <Col N="1579" /> items&mdash;petrol and oils&mdash;the figure was £7,930.  You get a more interesting figure still when you compare the sum mentioned for this year with the sum in the Book of Estimates for last year, leaving out the Supplementary Estimate.  The figure is £20,330.  The Estimate for the air services is almost twice what it was for the previous year &mdash;£10,370, as against £5,541.  That is included in that very large item of £302,000.  I cannot find the figure of £460,000.  I think I could get, by means of an elastic compilation which I do not recommend, the figure of £380,000, but I could not possibly get the £460,000 which the Minister has mentioned.  The position in which we are placed, according to this Estimate, is that we have an Army of over 14,000 men.  Again, examining Government policy, we were told in September of last year that we would not be informed as to the number we had in the Army: that it would not be advisable to give the information.  It was a secret.  Did anyone ever hear such nonsense?  Could not anyone say what the figure was to within a few thousand?  Would it matter to any commander, in respect to an enemy, whether in these days the figure was 15,000 or 20,000?&mdash;but we were told in September it was a secret: that the figure should not be known.  It should only be whispered.  That is not the way to get public confidence.</P>
    <P>This Vote ought to be referred back and the Minister ought to be glad to take it back.  Indeed, he should offer to take it back, and then bring before the House some definite policy, one which would get the support of every section of the community.  This is an important Vote, one which should agitate the mind of every citizen in the State.  It is an Estimate that nobody should begrudge voting for if satisfied on the policy that was to be pursued, on the quality of the goods on which the expenditure was to be made and particularly on the results of that policy.  I think it is unwise, in a case of this sort, that there should be public discontent and that there should be voiced from different parts of the country dissatisfaction on this matter. It is one on which no effort should be <Col N="1580" /> spared by the Government, or their supporters, to persuade other people as to the soundness of their policy, if they have one.</P>
    <P>If the Government have a policy I have not discovered it.  I have heard nothing from them but conflicting policies during the last 12 or 18 months. That is not a situation with which we should be faced.  It would not be impossible to get very generous agreement from this side of the House on a matter of this kind.  It is an important matter.  If the Minister wants to know what my view on the Army situation is, if we were faced with an invasion, it is this: that the invasion should be resisted, and that there should be, along with the Army, the support of every citizen to resist that invasion. We should not follow the example of Denmark.  I put it to the Minister that, charged as he is with responsibility for the defence of this country, he should have a machine that would be capable of meeting that situation.</P>
    <P>Some time ago his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, spoke in Cork about the way the troops in Finland had withstood the attacks that were made on them.  Did anybody ever hear such nonsense, to compare the equipment and competency that we have here with that of that country.  I have no doubt whatever but that the courage of our Army is equal to the courage of any other Army, and that what is lacking is a drive from the responsible authority that should be answerable to this House for equipping a competent machine capable, at any rate, of justifying the money that is being spent on it.  But, since the Minister and his predecessor took office, that has not been the case.</P>

      <P>It is little wonder that the people of the country are losing respect for this House when they see a Minister bringing in an estimate dealing with millions of money, and expecting us to accept it like a lot of children.  The Minister is greatly mistaken, because we on this side of the House are entitled to be taken into his confidence, especially in a time of national emergency.  But we will not be trusted.  We are entitled to know what these millions are to be spent on <Col N="1581" />&mdash;whether the money is going to be utilised to buy the armaments that are needed.  My firm belief is that the Government are playing a cowardly double game, the old game of Party politics.  They must play to the West Briton and to the so-called republican exaggerated nationalists.  I advise the Government to be Irish first.  It is time they stood on their own feet and ceased trying to stand on other people's feet, and acted honestly.  It is proposed to take those millions of money from people who are very poor and in a low state financially to-day.  We have been told that all this money is needed for the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree that the country wants a decent, well disciplined army.  But where do we stand as regards our Army to-day?  Is our country safe with the Army that we have?  I certainly say it is not.  I am not at all satisfied that the Army is the army of the Irish people, the Army that we should have. I believe that it is honey-combed with treachery, and that if an emergency arose in the morning and our Army was told to march through the gates to serve the country, you would have one company going to the left and another company going to the right, and that, instead of the Army doing its duty, you would have civil strife.  What else could one expect in a country that has hypocrisy and humbug emblazoned on its banners during the last ten years? The first thing we want to do is to clean out our Army.  What we really want is a body of about 6,000 well picked men, men of proper character and discipline, and with an Irish outlook. It would be of more service than an army of 15,000, composed of men of the kind that are being put into our Army to-day.  There is not the slightest reason in the world why a small country like this should slavishly follow the British Empire, which picks up every sort of ragamuffin it can get and puts him into a uniform.  We want none of that.  We want men with true blood and with brains and honour in our Army.  There is not the slighest reason for having such a thing as corner-boys in our Army.  God forbid that we should ever have anything in the nature of a national emergency. If we have, we will be submerged in a <Col N="1582" /> very short time, because we have no truth at the top or the bottom.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that in 1932 when the present Government took over the Army of the Irish people, it took over a small, compact, efficient loyal Army, an Army that was loyal to the previous Government and that was loyal to the present Government.  Why has the present Government done to the Army?  It has left it in this position that no officer of high rank knows where he stands.  He sees day after day juveniles brought in, politically, and placed in the senior ranks over him.  Do you expect loyalty when that is the case?  You will not get it.  The whole cry here now is that we must preserve our neutrality.  I am afraid that this so-called neutrality we have here is a cloak for cowardice.  We have all over Europe nations like ourselves &mdash;Poland, Finland, Denmark, Norway and all those little countries&mdash;being swallowed up by a horde of pagan fiends urged on by satanic hate.  Yet we here, a so-called Christian country, are afraid to open our mouths and to say to those tyrants who are crushing out Christianity to-day: &ldquo;We are not able to beat you, but, if we could, we would. You are not fit to rule in Europe. Although we are a small nation, we are not afraid to say our say.&rdquo;  But, we are neutral and we must keep to our neutrality.  I say we must put honour before neutrality and that it is our duty to state clearly and nobly where we stand.  That will not involve us in war, but it will show the world that we are Irish, as our fathers were before us, noble, and not afraid of tyrants, and that we will always stand up to tyranny whether it comes from Britain, Germany or anywhere else.  No, we must be silent.  Why should we be silent when we have in this country a faked so-called nationalism, exaggerated nationalism, and a Government playing fast and loose with the Irish people?  Let us be honest and manly and give a lead from this House to-night and let the Minister for Defence tell us where he stands and show us the policy that is to save our country.  Instead of that he got up here and told us that he wanted £3,000,000 or £4,000,000.  He did not tell <Col N="1583" /> us what he wanted it for.  But we on this side of the House will not give him that money unless he tells us what he is going to do with it, what he needs it for and where he is going to purchase the armaments that he needs for this great majestic Army, this young imperial Army.  An Army of 5,000 picked men would not be sufficient for him.  He must have 20,000 or 30,000 and he must make a poor suffering people pay for the upkeep of that Army.</P>
    <P>I have come across many sections of that Army throughout the country and I am not satisfied with it.  During the panic last September we had our roads chocked with young soldiers standing behind lorries with their rifles slung across their shoulders and shaking with the cold.  I was held up on one occasion and I had great sympathy with these unfortunate soldiers.  I had a bag of apples in the back of my car. They tore it open as they thought it was a bag of bombs.  When they found it was a bag of apples they said: &ldquo;In the name of God will you give us a few apples, we are starving.&rdquo;  Five or six of them flung their rifles down and got at the apples and eat them like wolves.  I suppose something similar happened at the Magazine Fort&mdash;young men brought in without any discipline; young innocent boys.  We want soldiers, manly soldiers who will think of duty first and their belly afterwards. It is time that the Government woke up or that those sitting in the back Government benches shook up the Government leaders and told them they were not satisfied.</P>
    <P>Is this the way to help Ireland to attain her dream of a 32-county republic? If we had a republic to-day, what would happen?  Eating each other, as usual.  God forbid that we should ever get a republic under the present régime, because we know what would happen.  They would clamour for jobs and positions and try to trample on those who did not believe in them. They tried that before, and they got their lesson, and I ask them not to try it again.  To-day we dare not speak of Britain&mdash;that terrible tyrant.  We would not even buy a round of ammunition from Britain; it would pollute our <Col N="1584" /> lovely Irish nation.  We have to go to France and Belgium or to the Congo or some other countries to get our arms and when the first stock of ammunition runs out we will not be able to replace it.  They could not be manly and go to the nearest nation&mdash;Britain&mdash;who could give them arms and replacements when they needed them.  No, it would break our neutrality and &ldquo;Lord Haw-Haw&rdquo; might shout at us.  We have a good many &ldquo;Haw-Haws&rdquo; in this country putting their hands out behind their backs for anything they can get. What we want in this country is character. We want to get rid of this exaggerated nationalism.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister where does he stand as regards the three armies in this country to-day.  He has the National Army behind him, we have an army of unemployed numbering up to 120,000, and we have the secret army, the army of de Valera as it was a few years ago, and, I am afraid, an army that he is playing fast and loose with to-day.  What we want is an army which will purge this country of blackguards and people like that who are making an absolute laughing stock of our nation.  We want to purge this country of exaggerated nationalism. We want to make these people come out into the open and have a policy, not working behind closed doors with guns in their pockets.  The first thing we want is to force people who will not respect the law to respect it.  You have been playing fast and loose for the last five or six years with this nation, and the people are fed up with you.  They have given you millions and millions and millions for the past eight years, far more than you should have received, and you have squandered it and given no return for it.  I ask you in God's name to put your house in order and let us have in this country one Army, the Army of the people, loyal to the Government and to itself and to the people from which it sprung.  We should get rid of this secret army who are not manly enough to state their policy from a platform. We should purge our country of that type of men and the horde of foreigners who are here under a certain cloak; men who are going around the country trying to get information out of the <Col N="1585" /> country to help foreigners, if not to get into this country, at least to beat your neighbour.  We want none of these.  Our country is full of thieves, rogues, and spies of all sorts out for what they can get.</P>
    <P>To-day we have those so-called Irish patriots.  If we are afraid of these patriots, then we should never claim to be a nation.  We will never be a nation until the Taoiseach and his band of cowardly men get at least a bit of backbone into them and rule this country as it should be ruled in an Irish Christian way.  They should not be afraid even if a few bullets are fired. They should stand up to them.  Kevin O'Higgins, Mick Collins and Arthur Griffith stood up to them.  They are dead and gone now but their memory is respected.  If you have to fall by the wayside, fall like men, facing your God as loyal men should. You should turn your back on your past, on the men you have led astray, the men who to-day have our country in such a sad position that we do not know where we are with our Army or our police force.  You threw open our Army and our police force to all types of men whether they had a good character or a bad character. You never looked to see what type of men they were, with the result that to-day you are not able to hold the rifles and ammunition that are in our Army magazines.  You have not the proper type of men in the Army.  You treated badly the fine old Irish soldiers who were in the Army which you took over in 1932, the old Irish Republican Army men who went into the Army, not for what they could get out of it, but for what they could give to their country.  You should put these men in the ranks and give them a lead and they will save you and save our country from the position we are fast heading for.  Of course, all these things are opposed to the playing of Party politics and Party politics means the votes of the people.  Remember you are ten years in office.  You may get a few more years or you may not, but whether you do or not, at least in your old age you should realise that there was a time when you did not play straight. Examine your consciences and you will find many black marks on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate to ask the Minister what were the reasons for removing the military from their centre in County Mayo&mdash;Castlebar. There was a military post established at Castlebar in the old days. Military barracks were maintained there by the British, when they were in occupation of this country, for a very sound reason, namely, that the centre in which the barracks were situated was very convenient and very useful for keeping a watch on the coastline from Galway down to Donegal. The Minister, at the outbreak of the present war, thought fit to send a couple of companies of soldiers there but, after some time, the Army authorities or the Minister decided to remove them with the result that, in the whole of County Mayo, there is not now a military post.  Neither is there, I think, one in Sligo and the present position is that from Galway down to the Donegal post, we have no centre wherein military are stationed.</P>
      <P>I do not hold myself out as an expert in Army matters but I do think that it is necessary, in the present state of affairs, to have a military centre in that area from which the necessary forces could be obtained if they were required to deal with any emergency. I think the centres at Athlone and Donegal are much too remote from the coastline which I have mentioned to make military action effective in the event of anything untoward arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that it is rather useless to have a coast-watching service all along the coast with that service depending solely on ringing-up stations like Athlone or Renmore Barracks.  The lines of communication are much too long.  To make that coast-watching service effective, it is necessary to have a concentration of troops much nearer in order to provide against any eventuality that may arise.  The natural centre, the centre chosen by the British in the old days, was Castlebar.  You have lines of communication from the barracks there going out to the coastline.  It is easy of approach from the whole area along the coast and, as I say, it is the natural centre.  Speaking as a layman, I think the Army authorities were unwise in vacating that post.  I would <Col N="1587" /> ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to consider whether the coastline has got sufficient protection all along that area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has a very fertile imagination, and he might suggest who they might be.  Perhaps the people of Denmark did not know, or it was never suggested to them that there might be an invasion of their country, or the people of Norway never thought there might be an invasion. It might never enter the Deputy's mind that there could be any form of invasion of this country.  It might never occur to him that we ought to put ourselves in a position in which we could protect ourselves against any threatened invasion.  The people on this side of the House, however, think that we should at least make some preparation against an attempt by any people, no matter who they might be, to invade this country. For that reason the coast-watching service was established.  For that reason our Army has been increased, and for that reason the Government are spending a considerable amount of money on national defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of enemies, but I am not concerned with who they might be.  I am concerned <Col N="1588" /> not alone with enemies, but with all peoples who might find it convenient or useful to invade this State for any purposes of their own.  Let them be who they may, I hold that we as a nation should be prepared to put up some resistance and to do our best against them.  For that reason I again ask the Minister to consider the coastline to which I have referred and to consider, if he does not revert to the old position in Castlebar, whether it would not be well to establish it as an outpost which would make it easier for the Army organisation to carry on in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made in this debate to certain sentences that were passed or certain orders that were made against some members of the Army who were held in some part responsible for what happened in the raid on the Magazine Fort.  It has been suggested that the Minister and the Army authorities were particularly severe and harsh in putting some of those officers on half pay and calling for the dismissal of others.  I think that in view of what happened, in view of the fact that the people's property was stolen, that the sentences pronounced or the orders that were made, reducing the pay of some of these men and calling for the resignation of others, were very lenient.  I think that it is essential, if we are to have any discipline in our Army, to ensure that when you have a debacle of that kind occurring, certain people should be made responsible for it and should be made to pay the penalty.  Whoever was responsible for the raid, we all agree that it was a very bad thing and a very sad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, personally, that members of the Volunteers ought not be on duty there, not because I do not believe in the integrity of the Volunteers, but because I believe that it would be more fitting to have professional soldiers or men with army training, men of that type and calibre, on duty at a point so important, where the protection of stores is concerned, than to have what I might call casual soldiers, because training in any particular line always counts.  I think that Army training would be very helpful in equipping these men for purposes of this kind. <Col N="1589" /> It has been proved throughout history that the professional soldier, owing to his training, is more suitable and more responsible than any ordinary individual whom you take in for a short time to the Army.  Such an individual may be impulsive in some ways and may lack the special qualities required.  I think one would be more entitled to rely on the man who is used to his own job, but whoever was responsible for that raid or for what transpired out of it, should be punished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that the Minister is responsible; I say that there is and there has been responsibility for the Army.  I do not make any reflection on the Volunteer Force; they are an excellent body of men, but in such a situation as might arise in a raid of this importance, the professional soldier, taking all in all, is probably more efficient.  That responsibility of the Army authorities for what transpired on that occasion met with certain consequences.  Some Army men suffered as a result.  If those people did not suffer, if the men who were responsible for what took place on that occasion did not suffer, there would be a great number of people very much dissatisfied.  I think it is a very sound thing that those men were punished and that it is a very good thing for the Army itself that they should realise&mdash;and that the command of the Army should realise&mdash;that they have a responsibility to this State and that, if they do not carry out that responsibility, they will be faced with punishment.</P>

    <P>On this Vote, personally, I would prefer to see a greater army and a greater volunteer force; and, in these days of small nations disappearing, I would be prepared even to sacrifice certain of the privileges we enjoy and certain amounts of the money spent on other services, in order to see a bigger and better army.  Our other services will avail us very little, if we as a State disappear.  The one protection against our State disappearing is to make it plain to all and sundry that we will do <Col N="1590" /> at least as well as Finland did.  We should aim at that, or at some position equivalent to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested that we are suffering, and that the public is suffering, from lack of confidence.  I doubt if that is so.  It is our duty to inspire confidence in our people in their own future and in themselves as a nation, particularly at this time.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested that we here are being led by the nose in whatever direction the Minister thinks fit to lead us.  If Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;or the Party opposite&mdash;is suffering from lack of confidence, we on this side of the House are not.  We have confidence in our own people, because we hold that our own people have proved themselves worthy of our confidence.  We have confidence in our Ministers and in our leader, because we hold that they have proved our own policy to be the right one.  Finally, we have confidence in ourselves because we hold that, with our own unity and loyalty, no matter what the position may be on the Continent, we will bring the Irish people through the present phase through which it is passing.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position, then, which you certify exists in this House: that, having introduced a Vote asking this House to grant £3,500,000, the Minister is not prepared to help the House in this discussion as to what is implied by this Vote, by intervening in the debate in any way, other than to read out the figures which were read out.  If the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for A.R.P. could give the people of this country the secret they have for self-protection, then we need not have half the money that is being spent here.  Did anybody ever see three responsible <Col N="1593" /> people finding such completely safe and obscure holes in which to hide themselves away from reasonable discussion, from reasonable criticism, from the responsibility of answering to an Irish Parliament for the duties that they undertook to the Parliament to discharge, not only in the Parliament's name, but in the name of the people?  There is nothing to equal it.  There is something of the same nature in the characteristic that attaches to the back benchers of Fianna Fáil that in what they allege is a war situation in which they are determined to be protected and organised to defend themselves against any enemy that may come along, there is not a single one of them willing to engage either in informing the House as to what they think, or in endeavouring to form public opinion in the country on the subject or to give any excuse for the passing of this money, except Deputy Moran, and, as I say, his contribution was not illuminating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He wants troops in Castlebar so that the coast watchers in Mayo and Sligo may have somebody behind them to report something to, but what that something may be he has not the slightest idea.  That is, then, the atmosphere in which we are asked to discuss Army policy in a war situation in which the Taoiseach, when he last intervened, on the last Estimate, complained that the people thought they were secure.  He and his Ministers apparently think otherwise.  He thinks it is necessary to put a large bill before the people and to extract large amounts of money out of their pockets in order to provide for defence, but neither he nor either of his two Ministers nor his Parliamentary Secretary is willing to discuss the subject of this Vote in the House.  I intervened at this stage because there was nobody else in the House, neither the Minister for Defence, who has simply read out his figures, nor the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures who has not opened his mouth, nor the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of A.R.P., who has not done anything except mutter a few <Col N="1594" /> words under his teeth to Deputy Giles. I intervened because that was the situation and because there was no member of the Fianna Fáil Party willing to follow Deputy Moran in the matter.  I would like to explain that I do not require now or invite and would not desire that this discussion should be finished, after I have spoken, by the Minister for Defence.  I would like to feel that I could stimulate the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures or some members of the Fianna Fáil Party to join with us in the discussion of the situation that exists, in the discussion of the amount of money that is being voted and the type of equipment and the type of organisation it is intended to provide in the country.  I would not like that the particular circumstances in which I rise would suggest to any members of the House that the debate would conclude.  No attempt has been made to intervene and to answer any of the important points that have been raised up to the present by the speakers from the various sides of the House except the Fianna Fáil side.  I hope that I may achieve the object of impressing upon members of the Government Front Bench that in the past&mdash;as late as last year, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out &mdash;not only did we hear the Taoiseach, the present Minister for Defence and the ex-Minister for Defence, but we heard the other members of the Front Bench on this important subject.  If it was important enough in February, 1939, for the Taoiseach and other Ministers, besides the Minister responsible for this Vote, to come here to discuss the Army Estimate and the defence policy, I submit that, judged by their action in putting this Vote before the House, it is more important that they would come and discuss it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, all my convictions in the matter are borne out by the attitude of the Minister and his colleagues in this matter.  They do not believe that there is a defence problem and all this money-voting is mere eye-wash.  They want to pretend to the people of this country that serious problems exist that engage the minds of Government Ministers, that expenditure is required for serious things, so-called, which give <Col N="1595" /> the Ministers an excuse for not making up their minds to deal with the serious economic and other problems that exist in this country and that are crying for some of the financial resources of this country to be applied to them.</P>
    <P>We want to know what are the international circumstances affecting this country that require the expenditure of this money.  We want to know that simply and plainly.  I hope that every member of the House will realise that it is not sufficient to be told by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party from Mayo that from Galway up to Donegal there is not a bayonet or a gun to protect that particular part of the country. If there is not, and if the Deputy has a complaint about it, I think it is reasonable that the Minister would say why it is unnecessary to have a gun there.  We want to know what is affecting this country that requires this expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if that is the Ministerial policy?  It was the policy of the Taoiseach.  When he was addressing the House here last year, he said he had no secrets, that he had no more information on the international situation than any Deputy could gather from the papers.  So Deputy Moran thinks his duty is done when he reads the papers.  I do not think that anybody who is a member of an Irish Parliament has done his duty if he does not bring into this House the learning, ideas and suggestions <Col N="1596" /> that he can develop in his own mind when he figures out what he thinks are the facts likely to affect this country.  If somebody does land in either Sligo or Mayo it will be very little use for Deputy Moran to say: &ldquo;I knew this would come.  I read the papers.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if the Deputy cannot be more informative by way of interruption than he was by way of speech, I would like to pass on from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I were, the Deputy obviously would not understand me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not understand that the Deputy contributed anything to the information of this House, or gave any advice or through this House gave any information to the people of Mayo as to why we were going to spend £3,355,000 on arms and soldiers to defend this country.  One would expect something of that sort from the Deputy, particularly in view of the fact that there is not a single gun within sight of the shore from Galway up to Donegal.  The Estimate before the House is for £3,355,000.  That is £2,108,000 more than the money that was spent, actually, in the year 1931-32.  The last year that we have particulars of the actual expenditure on Defence was the year 1938-39.  In that year we spent £524,367 more than we did before 1931-32.  So that, without a war situation appearing on the horizon, the cost of the Department of Defence rose, in the first six years of the present Government's administration, by £524,367.  On the basis of the rising tide then, we come to the situation of September last, and this year an Estimate <Col N="1597" /> has been presented to us that, as far as the superficial aspect of the Estimate is concerned, means that we are going to spend £2,108,000.  We are going to spend more, however.  If any Deputy looks at the various items here, under the heading of Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, and all that particular class of thing, he will see that there is a certain number of gaps where the cost of the services provided is not given, but if he looks at Page 316 of the Estimates, he will see that there is a Schedule there giving other Votes on which sums are being spent because of the operation of the Department of Defence, making a total of £4,403,276.  Some of that, I know, is due to the Army Pensions Vote, amounting to about £600,000; but, in fact, we are not discussing here expenditure on the Army of a sum of £3,355,000, but we are discussing the operation and administration of a machine, the work and carrying out of which is going to cost this country about £3,900,000.  Can we get any of the background of that expenditure? Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that he could not exactly trace, through the various items of this Estimate, what was meant or what was covered by &ldquo;warlike stores&rdquo;&mdash;not, perhaps, warlike stores, but what were called by the Minister, &ldquo;military and naval stores&rdquo;&mdash;for which some £400,000 is being provided in this Estimate.  I cannot trace it either, and I cannot find out, in the whole of this Estimate, that, earlier than the 31st March, 1941, the Minister for Defence can promise that one other single and additional aeroplane will be added to the equipment of this Army. The Minister told us that £2,600,000 worth of naval and military stores were on order, and that he expected that the outside amount that would be required to be paid out, during the present financial year, would be £400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did not expect that one-sixth of the total amount of naval or military stores would be delivered in this country earlier than the 31st March, 1941. Looking through the Estimates, however, as I say, there is not any evidence that a single additional aeroplane is going to come into this country before <Col N="1598" /> that particular date, if after.  What on earth has been ordered for that £2,600,000, unless it is some of the rubbish that, in three or four years' time, is going to be left after the war is over?</P>
    <P>The statement by the Minister of that simple fact characterises the whole policy of the Minister, and the whole policy of his Government, on this matter of Defence, as simply utter humbug, bluff and deception.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke about a sum of £1,000,000 that was going to be spent on the purchase of aeroplanes and another £1,000,000 that was going to be spent on the purchase of guns.  Well, at any rate, that did not come off.  The money was spent, but it was spent on the mobilisation of these men whom Deputy Moran characterised in this House as casual soldiers, and men who ought not to be employed in connection with important posts.  At any rate, the money went.  Of course, there was a change of policy.  I think, however, that it is not so much a change of policy that is going on at the moment, but rather&mdash;if we were to throw our minds back&mdash;I should say that it is almost a return to policy.  In April, 1934, for instance, the then Minister for Defence, who is the present Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, explaining the policy in regard to the Army, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such equipment costs money, but it is money economically spent, for if there is to be an Army at all it is, in the long view, more economical that it should be an effective instrument of defence, rather than a weapon that cannot be relied upon in an emergency.  Moreover, in carrying out this policy every effort will be made to make the Army self-reliant and as far as possible self-contained. The Army will, in fact, be made as far as possible to adapt itself to the State's economic policy of self-reliance and self-sufficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, the Army of to-day, according to the Minister's speech to the House, or according to the statistical statement that he read to the House, in the face of whatever is ahead, is to be self-reliant and self-sufficient.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> In this connection, a mixture of various kinds of stores may be got, and I think that such stores must include such things as clothes, petrol, and so on.  The Minister may get £400,000 worth of naval and military stores, but it simply gets the fragrance, the smell, of the arms that could be bought with the other £2,200,000.  It has to live on a kind of a &ldquo;potato and point&rdquo; basis.  It can use whatever turns up for the £400,000 and can point at its hopes, but, in the meantime, the hopes which are being held out in such ridiculous fashion of getting £2,200,000 worth of equipment and the commitment which the Government can say they have entered into in respect of it, is going to enable them to deny the things that are urgent from the point of view of the really effective strengthening and defence of the people, things outside the Army entirely which are very necessary for strengthening the economic fabric of the country at the present, for building it up in respect of the weaknesses brought about in the last few years, and for enabling it to face whatever opportunities lie before us in a world in which so many countries, particularly in Europe, are tearing each other to pieces.  There is the futile hope, so far as the Army is concerned, which is being held out, and the absurd statement that contracts have been entered into, and farmers and others are to be told that our sovereignty must be defended and that we will be criticised by the generations that come after us if we do not pay the necessary insurance to preserve this State, built up by the efforts of the people who have gone before us. Will the Minister tell the House something of the circumstances impinging on this country which require this expenditure, and will he do something to explain and to put some kind of a complexion on the absurd and rotten look of this Estimate?</P>
    <P>When you come to examine this Estimate you find that it is like a worm-eaten turnip&mdash;the more you look into it the more you see how useless and fruitless it is, how much waste there has been, and how much waste there is apparently going to be.  We were told by the Taoiseach during a <Col N="1600" /> debate last year that we were in the centre of a theatre of war.  I think it was when we were discussing the Emergency Budget that the Minister for Finance explained that we were in the centre of a naval theatre of war.  Earlier in the year, in February, 1939, when we were discussing the Army Estimate, we were told by the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The British Government have no idea of what we are going to do in regard to defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That appears at column 707 of the Official Debates of 16th February, 1939. At column 720, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, we have to envisage the possibility&mdash;I hope it will never become a reality&mdash;but we have to envisage the possibility of that, and we have also to envisage the possibility of Britain trying to make use of our territory for reasons which we do not want her to make use of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that the situation of this country, so far as its defence organisation, its defence outlook and plans, and its position with regard to Great Britain are concerned, was that the British Government did not know what we were going to do with regard to defence, and that, in planning our defence programme, we had &ldquo;to envisage the possibility that Great Britain may try to make use of our territory for reasons for which we do not want her to make use of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A certain amount of water has passed under the bridge since February, 1939.  We had the outbreak of war in September last.  All the explanations of the Government at that time and since excused the complete mobilisation of the Army on the plea that they had to make all the necessary and all the possible arrangements to defend the country in a situation the development of which they could not foresee.  They did not know what the attitude of Great Britain to this country was likely to be, but, as I say, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since, and we do definitely know certain things about the attitude of the British. Firstly, the British have not sought facilities of any kind in this country <Col N="1601" /> which would prejudice the attitude taken up by the Government and the Parliament, the attitude of neutrality, in the present struggle.  There has been no demand by the British.  There was no demand then, and there was no demand as long ago as January.  We have not been told by the Minister for Defence, or anybody else, that there has been any change in the attitude of Great Britain to this country.  In the light of the Taoiseach's statement that, in making our defence plans, we had to envisage the possibility of interference by Great Britain&mdash;and that, no doubt, reflecting itself in our Estimates for last year&mdash;we have to take it, in the absence of any statement from a responsible Minister that the situation has changed, that there is no necessity to have any expenditure reflected in our Estimates by reason of a changed attitude on the part of Great Britain since September or January last.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the situation, so far as our expenditure or our plans are concerned, is affected by the fact that the plans of the British Navy and the operation of those plans have apparently secured the comparatively safe transport of transatlantic traffic to Great Britain.  Any danger there seemed to be at any particular time in the early stages of the outbreak of war that transatlantic shipments to Great Britain would be seriously interfered with has apparently been removed, and there is nothing arising out of the transatlantic situation, so far as Great Britain is concerned, that would suggest to Great Britain that she requires to make any demands on this country.</P>
    <P>In my opinion a third aspect in the situation that brings us further from the theatre of war, and further from any possibility of any such attempts being made, or of any invasion here by Great Britain, is the development that has taken place recently in the Norwegian position.  That has taken us further away from any contact with the theatre of war, and we can completely put out of our minds the suggestion of the Taoiseach on the one hand, and the Minister for Finance on the other hand, that this country is the centre of any theatre of war.  But if the position is not perfectly clear, that there is going <Col N="1602" /> to be no interference with the desire of this country to be completely neutral, in respect of its territory not being invaded or occupied in any way by the British, and if there is any suggestion that there is any danger there still, then in the interests of ourselves and everyone else we ought to have it made clear.</P>
    <P>There is a fourth reason, as far as the ordinary man in the street is concerned, to dispel any fear, and that is the general policy, as stated, of the Government of Great Britain, with regard to respecting the neutrality of neutrals.  In the Estimate before us there is no deflation in cost, such as would be warranted by clearing the air, in the way the air has been cleared on the subject of our relations with Great Britain, in the matter of neutrals being in any way interfered with.  Again, in so far as there is any likelihood of our neutrality being interfered with, or any attack being made on us by any country at war, or at variance with Great Britain, using our intelligence, and what we can read in the newspapers, every month that has passed must indicate to us that there is not any country at war, or likely to be at war, with the British, that is likely to be in a position to invade or injure this country.  If there is any particular type of danger it is only the type that could be met by aircraft.  The way to ward off aeroplanes is by aircraft and anti-aircraft guns.  There is not a sign of a single additional aeroplane being got here for the next 12 or 18 months. We have no information about that, but we see signs of spades and shovels being used in a futile way, by digging up Merrion Square, rather than placing anti-aircraft guns around Dublin.  There is not any very serious addition that we can see to the anti-aircraft guns and equipment here.</P>
    <P>When, in July, 1938, we were discussing defence matters on the Vote for External Affairs, which immediately preceded the Vote for the Army, the Taoiseach, dealing with the defence situation at that time, July 13th, 1938, columns 701 and 702 of the Official Debates, explained that they had only comparatively recently got a new situation, in which they had finished all <Col N="1603" /> their disagreements with Great Britain, except such disagreement as arose out of the problem of Partition, and had taken possession of the ports, and that as far as the Twenty-Six Counties were concerned, there was no British occupation there.  The Taoiseach, in explaining that they had only got the new situation, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as the Government is concerned, we have not had before us a considered policy with regard to some of these items, because of the fact that it will, of necessity, depend very largely on the advice which we may get from the technical side....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All you can do is to try and provide for possible contingencies, and, of course, it is those that seem to be immediate and dangerous that will occupy our attention at first.  As I have said, I am speaking in general terms.  I am not giving the House at the moment&mdash;the time will come for that&mdash;the greater detail which I think the House would be entitled to expect if a longer time had intervened between the coming in of the new conditions and the present moment....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In July, 1938, the general outlook and policy had to be reviewed with the new situation brought about, according to the Taoiseach, by the evacuation of the ports by the British, and the settling of all other questions.  He could not give details then.  They could only be ready, as far as plans were concerned, for what appeared to them to be most dangerous, but the time would come, when the House would have to get details that it was entitled to.  Here we are now, nearly two years after the new situation arose, and a year and nine months since the Taoiseach spoke.  We have had serious discussions on defence and on external affairs since, and goodness knows we have tried by questions and by criticism to extract information upon which this House could come to reasonable and unified conclusions on defence, on the Army and Army organisation, and on the lines upon which it was directed in order to face these problems with unity of outlook, so that on defence we might have something like a national outlook, and <Col N="1604" /> radiating from this Parliament a national policy with national unity behind it.</P>
    <P>In so far as organisation and equipment of the Army are concerned, and in every other respect, the Army at least might be the one thing that would be outside Party politics.  A year and nine months have passed since the Taoiseach said that in present circumstances the House would be entitled to details.  More than six months of a war situation has passed in which we are spending on the Army at the rate of £3,900,000 a year.  There is no use blinking the fact that, apart from the size of the Army Vote at present, a very substantial amount of money is also scattered through other Estimates and Departments, which with the amount we are discussing here will have to come out of the pockets of the public in some way or other, because of the operations of the Minister for Defence, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, and the Parliamentary Secretary connected with defence problems.  In February, 1939, the then Minister for Defence said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However, these causes of enmity and strife between ourselves and our nearest neighbour have been ended satisfactorily in the best interests of both countries and for some time past our general staff have been drawing up plans in the light of the following facts&mdash;(1) that our sovereignty over the Twenty-Six Counties is complete and so recognised internationally; (2) that the only authority which can commit us to war is the assembly of the elected representatives of the people&mdash;the Dáil; (3) that it is not the policy of the Government to attack any nation and that we have no commitment to join or be involved in any war; (4) that it is the policy of the Government to repel any attack which might be made upon our territory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The plans were being made.  I take it that the plans bore on the equipment and organisation of the Army, the type of personnel you had and the amount of money which would be required.  The mind of the general staff on the <Col N="1605" /> military problems or on the organisation of the Army has never been reflected in any way to this House through the responsible Minister or through any member of the Government. In reply to persistent questioning by Deputy Cosgrave as to whether or not the professional heads of the Army approved of the volunteer scheme, we were told they did.  Not a single one of us here but had our doubts on the matter.  I contended long ago that what was really wrong with the Army was that its professional heads were never allowed to think professionally. That was the case until the situation was changed, according to the Taoiseach, in the beginning of 1938.  From 1932 to 1938, it would be almost worth his position in the Army for any officer to think purely professionally. They were never allowed to think on the normal defence problems of this country.  If we, here, know anything from past contact with and experience of their outlook on the organisation and equipment of the Army, there was never anybody responsible for what Deputy Moran to-night called the &ldquo;casual soldiers&rdquo; but the Ministers. The responsibility was entirely Ministerial.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told the House that he has been having plans examined, that his general headquarters have been working on plans and the Taoiseach has told us that the House is entitled, in time, to get the proper and necessary information.  In respect of the external situation impinging on this country, I personally do not see that that situation warrants the expenditure of this money, even if it were to be spent in the proper way.  From my reading of what the various items in this Estimate mean, we are, in regard to the Army, going back to a position in which it will be made, as far as possible, adapt itself to the State's economic policy of self-reliance and self-sufficiency.  I can understand circumstances in which you can depend on the Army to be self-reliant and self-sufficient but that is only in respect of the internal-danger situation which was referred to by the Minister for Finance in discussing the general resolution on the Budget on the 9th <Col N="1606" /> November, 1939.  He gave as the reason for the full mobilisation of the Army at that particular time the fact that &ldquo;there were elements and organisations within our territory of a subversive kind which had tried to defy the laws and authority of the State, organisations which in the comparatively recent past, had not hesitated to make open and murderous attacks on the rights and property of the citizens and who had developed a technique of terrorism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 9th November, 1939, the Minister said: &ldquo;Our neutrality was endangered by a secret, close-knit and active organisation which had a policy contrary to that.&rdquo;  The Army is perfectly capable of dealing with anything requiring to be dealt with in the line of internal disorder.  But what is the necessity for spending £3,500,000 or £3,800,000 or £3,900,000 to deal with the internal situation?  The very fact of spending that money on the Army and removing it from other channels, thus injuring the ordinary monetary flow of life through the pulses of the nation, is going to do more to create a danger to ordered conditions than could ever be cured by an Army upon which that amount of money was spent.</P>
    <P>If we are dealing with and thinking in terms of the internal situation, what bearing on that situation have the military and naval stores to the value of £2,600,000 that are on order and that, at the rate disclosed by the Minister's Estimate for this year, will not be delivered for the next six years?  These are points that stick out and strike the minds of Deputies who are prepared to give any kind of consideration to the condition of the country at the present time, or to its defence problems.  During a debate that began about this time, or earlier, last night and that, with a comparatively brief interlude to day, has continued, we have been discussing this subject.  Not a single scrap of light on any aspect of the situation has been thrown by any ministerial statement. The only Minister who has made any statement on the matter is the Minister for Defence, and yet no statement has been made by him that does not simply <Col N="1607" /> perplex and dismay the House and invite the type of questions that have been raised here ever since he sat down last night.  The question has been raised here whether there has been any consultation with any outside nation, with any great Power outside, that might be of any use to us in the very unlikely event of our neutrality being interfered with or the integrity of our country being violated in any way.  We have no answer to that.</P>
    <P>Last year, when we were discussing certain aspects of expenditure on the ports, the Taoiseach indicated that if any Power other than Great Britain invaded this country, or in any way entered on our territory, Great Britain, in her own selfish interest, would come to our assistance.  He said that, viewing the possibility of such a thing happening, we should keep our ports manned and fully equipped so that we might be in a position to co-operate with any naval forces that might require accommodation in our harbours for the purpose of assisting us.  He said that consultation towards that end would be most valuable in order that if co-operation in action was required, it might be most effective and most rapid.</P>
    <P>There is not any aspect of the possibilities of the situation that the Taoiseach has not put before us in one way or another, very often to try and hide what is in his mind or to try and hide where his convictions and his outlook are directed.  If, as one interjection from the Fianna Fáil Benches suggested, official German spokesmen are paying attention to this country, it might be just as well that the House would know where we stood in the matter.  I do not pay any attention to official German spokesmen.  I am still convinced that this country cannot be invaded and that this country cannot be bombed.  When I last spoke on the subject I said that this country was paying £1,700,000 for equipment, gathered, ordered and organised by professional advisers, to prevent us being injured by any potential dangers, but that we had never got a statement in regard to our problems or the <Col N="1608" /> general line of military policy that might be adopted to deal with whatever dangers might arise.  I suggested that those people had been prevented from doing that by Ministerial policy.</P>
    <P>I still think that, in the face of what I have shown may be read, superficially at any rate, in relation to the situation here, in the face of the feeling of security among the people that the Taoiseach complains of, they are right to possess that feeling, and if they were left to use their own resources, to go about their business in the ordinary way and carry on the business of the country with the full help of all the resources that they can utilise, they would be eventually better off from the point of view of national defence.  But if there are people as ignorant as I am in regard to the existing state of affairs, or as ignorant as the people the Taoiseach points to, the people who have allowed themselves to fall into a false sense of security, then I say that the professional staff of the Army who are being paid substantial sums from this Vote should have their advice properly put to us through the Ministers in this House in order to waken us out of our slumbers.</P>
    <P>I oppose the expenditure here because, in the first place, I do not believe we are in the danger the Government suggest; secondly, because I do not believe that the money is being utilised so as to give us an effective army; thirdly, because I believe the millions talked about by the Minister are being introduced by him as an excuse for failing to deal with other problems in the country and, generally, because the presentation of this matter to the House by the Government is one of the most disgraceful things that I have ever experienced here.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that I challenged him to intervene in this debate so as to help us in bringing about a fruitful discussion; that I challenged the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures to do the same thing; that I challenged the Parliamentary Secretary or any Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches to do the same thing, and we had to sit for several minutes until the Leas-Cheann <Col N="1609" /> Comhairle intervened and stated there was nothing to do but to call on the Minister for Defence to conclude.  The Minister for Defence is, to my mind, making scandalous use of this money; he is making a scandalous pretence that, during the next year or two, he will have to spend large sums of money.  I say he is degrading the House as the Parliament of the people. If he seriously believes that there are dangers from outside or inside this country, dangers of a disorderly kind, and if he is serious in considering the financial position of the country, then it is really difficult for me to characterise his attitude and his presence here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The request made by Deputy Mulcahy in the course of his speech, namely, that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures should have participated in this debate, seems to me to be most reasonable, and I am very surprised and disappointed that that request was not immediately acceded to.  But perhaps there is an explanation.  A great many people believe that there is no need for this Minister, that there is nothing for the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures to do.  I am one of those unsophisticated people who hold that point of view.  It is well worth while bearing in mind that within the past week or two it has been found possible in Britain, after seven or eight months of war, to abolish that office.  In these circumstances, how on earth are we to justify it here?  It seems to be nothing more than a sinecure, and to continue the Minister in his present office seems to many people to be a very unnecessary procedure.  Seeing that he is not prepared to participate in the debate, and that he is actually absent from the House, the only explanation seems to be that if he is removed from office there is no other berth in which to place him, and, therefore, he must stay put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, with an expenditure of approximately 10 per cent. of the national income on the Army, this House is entitled to the very fullest information as to the manner in which it is proposed to expend that money.  We <Col N="1610" /> ought to have the very fullest details. I, for one, cannot understand this veil of secrecy.  At the outbreak of the war it was an understandable position that the Government were reluctant to give information.  But why are they holding on with such persistency to that policy of secrecy now?  What is the need for secrecy?  Some months ago a Minister on the Front Bench refused to answer a question as to what the numerical strength of the Army was.  He did so on the grounds that it was not in the public interest to disclose it.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no attempt to withhold any such information.  What are the changing circumstances?  Surely we are entitled to know.  Not very long ago an issue of a very innocent periodical was suppressed.  Why?  For no other reason than because it was mentioned in that paper that our torpedo boats were here at the suggestion of Mr. Winston Churchill.  A paper widely read in this country, a perfectly innocent paper was suppressed for no other reason than that.  Why on earth are these things being done? Are the Government afraid that they will lose any prestige, because it was suggested, rightly or wrongly, that they were acting in a manner such as that, on the suggestion of Mr. Winston Churchill?  It seems to me that there could be nobody more competent, having regard to all the circumstances, to advise on that matter than Mr. Churchill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran devoted a good deal of his speech to drawing the attention of the House to the fact that a considerable portion of the West Coast of Ireland was left unprotected inasmuch as the troops were situated at a very remote point, and that because of that they could not readily be looked for in the event of a certain thing having happened.  The Deputy did not venture a personal opinion as to the source from which the danger was to arise.  He stubbornly withheld that information. That is a peculiar characteristic of the Government.  Why?  It is perfectly obvious to any person with an ounce of common sense or reason that the sympathies of the public in this country are predominantly on the side of the Allies.  Why on earth with <Col N="1611" /> that fact firmly established are they so reluctant to venture an opinion on these matters?  It is surely obvious that there is no possible source of danger to this country from any invader other than Germany, nor is there the possibility in the future of any other invader except Germany.  It is also obvious that in the event of that invasion, judging by a broadcast statement in recent weeks in relation to other European countries, that in such an eventuality, help would readily come from Great Britain.  At the same time while that is so I would like to see our Army here kept at a very high standard, kept up to a good standard numerically and from the point of view of efficiency a good standard also.</P>
    <P>At the outbreak of the war the policy of the Government seemed to be to have the biggest possible army here commensurate with the resources of the country.  Their policy was to have the biggest army, the best-equipped army that the country could afford.  In my view it would be a great pity if the Government were to depart very far from that policy.  Recent events ought to be a sufficient warning.  Who in this House would a month ago have thought that Norway would have been one of the countries to be invaded? What is Norway's position to-day may be this country's position to-morrow. It is quite on the cards.  The element of surprise is always there and we ought to be prepared to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I would like to vote for this Estimate but, in the circumstances, I find it difficult to do so, because I consider that we in this House are not taken sufficiently into the confidence of the Government.  I am sure if more information were given and if a more clearly defined policy were announced that there would be very ready co-operation from all sides and from all sections.  I am sorry from time to time to hear the Volunteer force adversely criticised.  I happen to have contact with hundreds of the new Volunteers, and I say without hesitation that they are men who came along not for the small allowance they were getting, but in response to what they considered a <Col N="1612" /> call to duty.  Whilst incidents have occurred which did seem to cause a reflection on them, I think it a great pity that they have been made the subject of undeserved criticism.  I sincerely hope that there will be no slackening off in so far as the Army is concerned. I would like to see as many men as possible in this country trained and ready for any eventuality that may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This £3,252,000 is a staggering sum of money for the people of this country to be called upon to pay.  Now, if that sum of money were the purchase price of our independence I do not think anyone would demur to the raising of it.  If ten times that sum were required, and if it would be effective to preserve our independence at any time, I think 99.9 per cent. of our people would invite the Government to mortgage our property and requisition our goods and wealth in order to raise the necessary money to protect the independence and sovereignty of this State.  But when an expenditure is proposed and it is perfectly manifest that it is not going to be effective to protect our sovereignty or that it is going to be effective to do anything else except to promote waste, then it seems to me to be the clear duty of Parliament to tell the Government that they will not allow them to spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of the Army in this country?  I do not know if Deputies recently read the events that have been passing in Denmark.  The Minister for Defence in Denmark was doing a lot of talk about the vigorous measures that would be taken if the sovereignty of that State were threatened by an outside power.  The day dawned when the sovereignty of that State was threatened by an outside power and no dog barked, with the result that the Danish people, instead of orienting their resentment against the invader, started hooting and boohing the soldiers of the army to such a degree that broadcasts had to be made by the Prime Minister of Denmark begging the people not to demonstrate against their own army, because it was not their fault.  Why <Col N="1613" /> did it become necessary for the Prime Minister of Denmark to make that broadcast?  Because for years preceding the invasion he had been saying to the Danish people the self-same silly things that the Minister for Defence in Éire has been saying to our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That we were to make immense economic sacrifices in order to equip an army which would give a good account of itself in the hour of invasion and act as a deterrent to any potential invader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not quoted the silly statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the silly statement. What resistance could our Army offer to a modern war machine? Where is the invasion going to come from?  It is either going to come from Germany or it is going to come from Great Britain.  Let us, in order to solace the wounded hearts of Fianna Fáil, assume that the base, bloody and brutal British Saxon is the invader. What is the Army going to do then? All its guns come from England, all its ammunition comes from England, most of its equipment comes from England now, according to the Minister.  Are we going to call a truce like the Maoris, buy fresh supplies from England and then start the war again, or are we going to fight machine-guns, artillery and tanks with pikes and clubs?  Will the Minister answer that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose we had a war with Great Britain in the morning, how is our Army going to prosecute that war on our behalf when it is excluded absolutely from any outside source of supplies of arms or ammunition? Everybody knows perfectly well that a war with Great Britain cannot and will not be fought along those lines. If Great Britain reoccupies this country we have got to start the same kind of war that we fought against them before, guerilla warfare which may go on for our lives and the lives of our children and of their children's grandchildren, and so far as the Army, <Col N="1614" /> as we know it, is concerned, organised along the lines that the Minister for Defence recommends to the House, it will be perfectly useless.</P>
    <P>Now, suppose the invasion is from Germany, is our Army going to make a more stubborn resistance than the army of Poland did?  Does any Deputy in this House seriously imagine that our Army, with the equipment that it has got or with the equipment that it is proposed to get for it, could make a resistance greater than that made by the Polish Army?  Remember, if you contemplate the invasion of this country by Germany you must presuppose the destruction of the British fleet, and presupposing the destruction of the British fleet and that our country is invaded by the German Army, is it seriously suggested by any sensible man in this House that our Army is going to confront the German Army and defeat it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not seriously suggested that they will defeat it, but it has been seriously suggested by Deputy Cosgrave that we should fight the invader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, but we fought the invader before.  We are not going to fight him by spending £3,250,000 in this year in ordering ammunition that may be delivered at the end of the world war, or in spending £3,250,000 in a series of activities the exact nature of which no one knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on common ground so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on common ground in this: that whoever invades this country will ultimately be driven out of it.  It may take a long time, but we will get them out as we got them out before, but that is exactly where the Government and we join issue.  Instead, why not say to any potential invader of this country: &ldquo;We are making no bluff, we are not in a position to conquer any military war machine, because we have not got the <Col N="1615" /> resources to do it, but we warn all and sundry that any nation which invades Ireland embarks on a 700 years' war. It is a war that is going to be carried on not only by any and every means at our disposal, but is going to be carried on by all the instruments of propaganda and by any and every instrument available to the Irish people at home and abroad, on the seven seas, and in the four corners of the world: wherever our people are, and they are everywhere, they will be fighting with us with the weapons available to them against the invader of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is no bluff.  That can be proved to anybody who wants proof of it: that we brought the greatest Empire in the world to negotiation by means of those weapons.  Does anyone believe that the flying columns that were operating in this country alone could have conquered the British Empire? The bravest soldiers in them knew that such a thing was quite impossible. They knew that their activities were linked up with the activities of those who had gone before them, with the activities of their fellow-countrymen scattered all over the world, and it was the combined operation of those forces, extending over a long period, that forced the British Empire to enter into negotiation with this country, which ended up in the disappearance of the British Empire and the emergence of the Commonwealth of Nations.  Any nation contemplating that successful defence of Ireland which is told quite plainly by our Government to-day that it is on them we rely, and that it is to them we should turn for the defence of our sovereignty, will think twice before it takes on the empire of the Irish at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to put himself this question: suppose a message is sent to-morrow from Berlin to the German Minister in this city to report to the Government of the Reich whether the Irish Army presents any serious obstacle to the invasion of this country, and to advise at the same time whether the Irish people could be reconciled to a German occupation of this country, what advice does the Minister think he would give?  Would he not answer the <Col N="1616" /> first question by saying that the Irish Army could be cleaned up in 24 hours? Would he not answer the second question: &ldquo;It does not matter whether you oppress them or whether you conciliate them: it does not matter on what basis you approach them, they will keep after you until they get you out.  You will never take root in Ireland so long as the Irish race survives.&rdquo;  Which then is the greater safeguard of our independence and our sovereignty?  Surely the preservation of the Irish race in all its vitality and vigour, rather than playing at defence operations which we know could never be successfully practised if they were once put to the proof.</P>
    <P>Let no one imagine that the view I submit to the House in regard to this matter means that we take the view that the Army is a useless and expensive appendage, because we do not.  It was colleagues of mine established the Army in this country; it was colleagues of mine built up the Army; it was colleagues of mine who handed over to the present Minister's predecessor an Army of which this country was proud, and which the Minister's predecessor was obliged to confess far exceeded his most optimistic anticipations.  But what is the purpose of that Army?  It seems to me that the rational conclusion to be arrived at is that the Army is, first, the ultimate bastion of the right of the majority of the Irish people to rule in this country and the ultimate sanction which the Parliament of the majority of the people is entitled to invoke against any person, native or foreign, who challenges that right by force of arms. In so far as that is true, they are the foundation upon which the State securely stands.  But they have another function.  No independent nation has the right to claim the privileges of sovereignty without accepting the responsibilities, and we are obliged, if we claim sovereignty over this territory, to accept responsibility for its defence. We are entitled to determine the line on which that defence is to be conducted. No enemy and no friend has the right to lay down for us the tactics which we deem expedient to employ.</P>
    <P>I have always hoped that the Army would be organised upon lines designed <Col N="1617" /> to produce a small army, but the most highly efficient army in Europe.  Not an army boasting the heaviest armaments, not an army boasting the greatest striking power, but an army having a personnel second to none in Europe in technical training and skill, so that it might be used as the basis for an expansion along existing lines, if the situation demanded that, or, alternatively, as the material wherewith to organise the entire manhood of the nation in effective guerilla resistance to any Power which sought to establish itself permanently in Ireland. But the idea of aping continental armies by the promiscuous purchase of elaborate armaments and ammunition here, there and everywhere, as is at present being done, is to dissipate public money, to create an entirely false sense of security in the minds of our people, and to invite a resentment on the part of our people when, if the unhappy event should ever arise, it becomes perfectly manifest that the Army is incapable of delivering the goods which the Minister leads the people to believe they are there to deliver.  It will be a resentment which is not fair or right in regard to the Army, but it will be a resentment that will be evoked by the silly vanity of the Minister for Defence, who wants to pretend to a certain section of our own community that he is creating in this country an armed force comparable with such armies as are operating on the continent of Europe at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy has complained bitterly of the failure of the Minister for Defence to give us information.  I believe the reason the Minister for Defence does not give us information is because he does not know.  To be perfectly frank, I do not believe the present Minister for Defence knows &ldquo;B from a bull's foot&rdquo; about the Army or the problems of the Army, and I do not know where the deuce he will find out about it.  He has only been about four months Minister for Defence, and he was pitch-forked into that position when his predecessor was pitch-forked out.  I solemnly believe that he was put in because there was nobody else.  The first proposal was that he would come in in the capacity of a dummy and let the Taoiseach run <Col N="1618" /> the Department.  The Taoiseach then found that he was unable to run the Department of Education, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of External Affairs, the Army, and the Department of Finance, and so we had the present unfortunate Minister storming round the country, visiting military barracks, in order to create a kind of general impression that he is coversant with the affairs of the Army.  I do not believe he knows a ha'porth about them.</P>
    <P>He is at present in the position that he has been asked to render an account of the stewardship of another man.  The previous Minister for Defence, Deputy Aiken, must have known something about the Army after having been seven years in office.  He is not in the House now; he has not been in the House for the last three hours; he has not uttered a word.  I do not think it is really reasonable for us to demand of his successor an account of his predecessor's stewardship, because we all know how utterly reckless and foolish that stewardship was.  Everybody in politics in this country knows that the previous Minister for Defence was dismissed for gross incompetence and shoved into a nominal office simply to save his face.  Does anybody deny that?  I do not think so. I never heard it challenged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hannigan says he deplores unjust criticism of the Volunteers.  I never heard unjust criticism of the Volunteers in this House.  I have heard people go out of their way to say that in any strictures passed upon individual Volunteers or groups of Volunteers it must be constantly borne in mind that there are amongst the Volunteers who joined the Sluaighte disinterested, loyal men who joined up for no other reason than to discharge what appeared to them to be a public duty and who have reflected great credit on the force they joined.  But that does not alter the fact that deplorable events happened, events so deplorable that a Fianna Fáil Deputy considers that it is appropriate to describe the Volunteers as casual soldiers.  He is obviously thinking of them in the context of casual labourers.  I do not think it is a term that anybody would care to employ <Col N="1619" /> of them as a body but the individuals who were guilty of gross insubordination to officers of the regular Army, who were then locked up in the guardroom for that insubordination and released by order of the Minister for Defence&mdash;these may well be described as casual soldiers and neither they nor the Minister who ordered their release had any notion of what decent military discipline meant or what morale in the Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister had better ask his predecessor in office.  I am now alleging that certain individuals committed to the guard-room or a place of detention for acts of insubordination were released by orders directly or indirectly emanating from the then Minister for Defence. I say that that is the kind of interference with the normal military discipline of the Army that is calculated to produce casual soldiers.  If it is a question of calling them casual soldiers, let the blame not rest upon their shoulders, but upon the man who debauched them and taught them the methods and practices of casual soldiers.  Until such instruction was vouchsafed, the Irish Army comprised in its ranks no casual soldiers. There might have been good soldiers and bad soldiers, but they all knew what discipline meant.  They were all proud of the standard of discipline equitably maintained for all members of the forces, high and low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is wicked to spend £3,250,000 for the purposes outlined by the Minister here to-day.  I think the Minister believes it wicked too, but he thinks it is desirable political codology to pretend that he is building up a great army to defend this nation against a potential invader.  It is three years now since I directed the attention of the Minister for Defence to the fact that if any development were to be undertaken in the Army it should be along the lines of development of the air force, because I think it is becoming more and more abundantly <Col N="1620" /> clear that strength in aerial warfare depends quite as much on the numbers of pilots whom you have trained as it does on the number of planes you have available.  You cannot fly aeroplanes if you have no pilots to fly them.  If we, for the last three years, had devoted our attention to training good pilots in ever increasing numbers for our air force, we would be in a position to-day put in the air a fairly respectable defensive army. As it is, I imagine that the dimensions of our air force are microscopic.  I suppose the Minister for Defence did not undertake that development, fearing that, if he did train pilots, they might go away to join the British Army.  I do not know that that difficulty might not have been avoided, but I am quite satisfied that if we had to-day 2,000 highly competent pilots for fighter machines, and bombers too, because they tell me that, in the technique of military operations an indispensable part of defence is counter attack, we would have an Army which would be more effective, if it became requisite to use it in collaboration with some other army.</P>
    <P>Suppose we were required to take the field in defence of our own country with a powerful ally, which is conceivable, such contribution as we are in a position to make with equipped infantry at the present time would be a drop in the bucket, but 1,000 trained pilots of whom a substantial proportion were equipped with modern aeroplanes and the balance were prepared to man modern aeroplanes provided by our ally, would be no contemptible force. Admittedly, if we had to fight our corner alone they might avail us little but they might be the means of persuading any potential enemy to abstain from converting us into the ally of a nation with whom they were already at war.  This additional 1,000 personnel would in fact represent an effective increase of 3,000 aeroplanes to the forces they joined, assuming that one pilot would survive the destruction of two or three planes under his pilotage. I was told two or three years ago when I mentioned this matter that the then Minister for Defence had neither the time nor the inclination to discuss a layman's views about the Army.  I <Col N="1621" /> think that since that time having been relegated to a layman's position himself, he has learned that the layman's ideas were more far-seeing than those of the would-be soldier.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the Department of the ex-Minister for Defence.  I see his Parliamentary Secretary is here.  I assume the Parliamentary Secretary includes amongst his functions duties relating to censorship, unemployment and air raid precautions. He will excuse me if I say that he has managed to gather under both his wings those volunteers in the A.R.P. he originally intended should inhabit only his A.R.P. wing.  They now find themselves under his employment wing as well.  I would suggest that he should take some steps to get them out from under one wing and allow them to function under the other.  However as I believe that A.R.P. schemes are not very likely to be operated in this country, I am not unduly solicitous about the Parliamentary Secretary lying down on his job.</P>
    <P>As to the censorship, the censorship, as Deputies will remember, was put over on this House on the excuse that it was necessary to prevent the publication of any news which might threaten our neutrality.  Observe the qualification&mdash;threaten our neutrality. The latest regulation that has been made by the censor is that you may publish no fact relating to the birth, marriage or death of a person serving in the forces of a foreign State.  Well now, how the neutrality of this country could conceivably be jeopardised by the announcement that Lieutenant Pat Murphy had become engaged to Mary Scully, I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>It is now treason to publish that information.  Notice to that effect has been sent to the Press of this country. That is not all.  The protection of our neutrality has been interpreted to mean that any definite disagreement with Fianna Fáil policy is to be excluded from the news, the reason being, if you please, that if anyone differs in one direction with Fianna Fáil, this will evoke difference in the other direction, and it is so necessary to avoid the danger of a clash succeeding upon that <Col N="1622" /> difference that everybody must be silenced except the Taoiseach.  As the rest of the Party grow silent, the Taoiseach becomes more vocal; he is to be heard on the radio one night talking to America about Cathleen Ní Houlihan and the palm and the shamrock, and the following week he is to be heard telling us all about theology and the divine right of government.  It used to be the divine right of kings, but, seeing that we are not a kingdom, republic or dominion, we have got down to the divine right of government. That divine right, Deputies will understand, subsists only so long as Deputy de Valera is Taoiseach.  When he ceases to be Taoiseach I have no doubt that he will give us a lesson in theology to explain that the divine right of government passes with the present occupant of the office.  Nobody else is to be heard upon public affairs but this golden voiced scholar-Taoiseach whom we have got now.</P>
    <P>Gradually we are discovering that the very instrument which we devised to protect our independence and our liberty from infringement by the foreigner is to be used by our own Minister to filch from us our own liberty and independence behind our backs.  Although we took every precaution against such an infringement, we find that our own Taoiseach and our own Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures are taking away any rights we ever had, most of which we acquired in spite of them.  Having failed to take away that liberty by violence, they are now calmly taking it by subterfuge under cover of the law.</P>
    <P>I think that censorship is fair enough, within certain limits, but another strange anachronism which censorship <i>á la</i> the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures has created in this country is that you may describe the Russians by any expletive you care to apply to them&mdash; rogues, robbers, highwaymen or anything else&mdash;but breathe the name of Hitler and, unless you describe him as a haloed angel with a pair of wings just ready to take off for heaven, every line of what you say is cut out.  I know one man who said actually that Russia was a menace to civilisation and <Col N="1623" /> decency and everything that was desirable in the world, and that Hitler was, too&mdash;which was perfectly true for him &mdash;and the words &ldquo;and Hitler is too&rdquo; were cut out, and poor Stalin got the rub, while delicate Hitler was protected by the solicitous arm of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  God knows, if we gave him that elaborate title, it was not to defend Hitler that we put him there, but to defend this country.</P>
    <P>Is it not ludicrous?  All of us know how poisonous Communism is, but Hitlerism is ten times worse.  One is efficient and the other is inefficient; one is diabolical villainy, drunk and incompetent, corrupting the world; the other is the devil himself&mdash;Nazism is the devil himself, with twentieth century efficiency.  It is a real danger to the world: it is a challenge to the world&mdash;something against which every sane man should be warned and cautioned.  It is something which should be explained and elaborated to our own people.  Those silly boys who go on the street and paint swastikas on the ground should be told that they might just as well erect an altar to the devil and celebrate the Black Mass. But we dare not tell them that, for fear Herr Hitler would be vexed. There is no solicitude for Herr Stalin: why is that?  I do not know; I never did know.  We have about just as many Stalinites in this country as we have Hitlerites&mdash;thanks be to God, there are not many of either&mdash;the difference being that one is an incompetent, floundering lot&mdash;the poor Communists, who would not hurt a cat, not for want of the will, but for want of the intelligence and competence; while the others&mdash;the Hitlerites&mdash;are equally poisonous, equally devilish, but unfortunately more efficient.  Nobody but a semi-imbecile in this country is in danger of Communist corruption, but a great many simple fellows&mdash;such as those sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches&mdash;stand in constant danger of being seduced by the wiles of the Nazi.  I am allowed to warn them about the dangers of Communism, but if I address them on the subject of Nazism, not a word will be published.  Just watch.  If this speech <Col N="1624" /> is published in the papers to-morrow, every reference to Stalin will be put in, but there will not be a word about Hitler.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had better restrain his eloquence, as I do not wish to be drawn.  I object to the censor taking it upon himself to determine which ideologies the people in this country may criticise and which ideologies they may not.  It would be logical, if tyrannical, of the censor to say that no Irishman living in Ireland may refer ever to anybody living outside. That would be a fair deal for all.  But it is neither logical nor just, nor typical of freedom, that one uniquely ill-informed man in this country&mdash;the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures&mdash;should arrogate to himself the right to determine what his superiors in this country shall speak of and what they shall not. I claim that I have just as much right to speak the truth of Nazism as those who are flaunting Nazi swastikas have to speak what they state to be the truth of democracy.  I claim that I have a much heavier duty upon me to speak the truth now of Nazism than rests upon any other person to speak the truth of Communism because I do not believe&mdash;and only because I do not believe&mdash;that Communism is a <Col N="1625" /> serious danger to our people, whereas I believe Nazism is.  I believe that the first essential of persuading our people to reconcile themselves to a proper defence policy is to explain to them the bestial nature of the Nazi <i>régime</i> in Germany and the threat it constitutes to this and every other civilised country in the world.</P>
      <P>I say that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence is not only unjustly abrogating the liberties of our people by improper use of the censor, but he is also threatening and destroying the capacity of our people to prepare themselves for what may be necessary in order to preserve the sovereignty and independence of this State by preventing those whose duty it is from explaining to the people the nature, the poisonous nature, of the threat that at present confronts them.</P>
      <P>Nothing matters very much if we lose our liberty in this country.  If we have only put out the British in order to surrender to our own fellow-countrymen the liberties we fought so long to win, then we were ill-employed in putting out the British.  I would rather have a foreign oppressor than be trampled on by my own neighbours.  I put it to the House that the strongest possible representation should be made to the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence to lay down some general rule of censorship which will be equitable between all parties and which will be applied equally and reasonably to all parties, and that when that rule is laid down it shall be relaxed, neither for the Prime Minister nor for anybody else, but that once it is laid down no improper twisting of it will be employed to prevent people with whom the Minister disagrees from speaking their mind as freely and as honestly as he claims the right to do himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention at this late hour of entering into the innumerable details of this Vote, but I would like to echo the tributes that have been paid to that old Army, so well trained and so well officered, which did such champion service for this country when they were last in it. I am entitled to ask the Minister what amount of this sum he intends spending <Col N="1626" /> on the defences of that portion of my constituency at Cork Harbour, Carlisle Fort, Camden Fort and Spike Island, these forts that were taken over by the Taoiseach with such a flourish of trumpets and with much eclat.  What use is being made of them?  During the British occupation they were, at any rate, maintained with a reasonable degree of efficiency and could at least accommodate the troops that were stationed there, the skeleton guard that probably was there more for ornament than anything else.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Minister means to make use of these forts in the defence of this country, although they have been described by those who are competent to speak as being obsolete. One would assume that in a preparation for any war they would have been made fit to carry on the defences of so important a portion of the South Irish coast which they were originally intended to defend, and one might ask what sum has been spent on them and what equipment has been placed in these particular forts.  Whatever their efficiency may be, we assume that the Minister for Defence is confident that they would be of use in the defence of this country, and therefore it is particularly urgent that he would give information to those people who are concerned in the South as to what sum of money he is going to spend to put them into a proper state of defence, and also give them some idea of the equipment and the number of troops that he is likely to keep there.  That is a matter that vitally concerns the people who are interested in the defence of this country.</P>
      <P>Another Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches mentioned a military post in his constituency, but I think I may venture to say, having regard to the amount of advertising and the amount of discussion that took place about these forts when they were taken over, that they are outposts of considerable importance to this country.  I therefore reiterate my demand that the fullest possible information should be given by the Minister as to what his intentions are.  It is quite possible that they may be of more use in defence than is anticipated by some people.</P>

      <Col N="1627" /> It is not long ago since a ship of one of the present belligerents entered Cork Harbour and stayed there for something like a week, and was welcomed by the Chairman of the Urban Council.  All the sailors of that ship paraded the town, but I may tell you they spent very little in the town, nothing compared with what the sailors of a single guard ship used to spend when they were stationed in Cork Harbour.  I will be attending a meeting to-morrow night at Cobh, called by the local authority there to discuss the best means of relieving the extreme distress that exists in the town.  I think I will be told when I go down there that a visit of the British Fleet to Cork Harbour would be the most satisfactory way of relieving the present depression that exists in that particular case, and I have no doubt that that might be an immediate solution of the difficulty.  The possibilities are that in spite of anything that has been said by speakers in the House, they too would probably echo that feeling on the part of the people of Cobh.</P>

      <P>Possibly you do not, but will you provide a remedy for the people who are in such distress that immediate relief is necessary for them? I simply say that it is quite possible that it might be a solution of the difficulty. I have been urging, even during the time of the British occupation, that the roads leading to the forts should be put into a state of repair.  Unfortunately, a deaf ear was turned, but when this State took over the occupation <Col N="1628" /> of these forts it raised my hopes. I asked the Minister to spend some money in repairing these roads which are such an eyesore to the people and such an inconvenience to travel over, or at least to contribute some money to help the local authority to put in repair the roads that lead to the Minister's own property.  He turned a deaf ear, too.  Surely it is not efficient management of those forts to leave the roads in the condition of a switchback railway. The Minister's own lorries would have to travel over those roads if it were contemplated to put the forts into anything like an efficient state.  After all, if he is asking for a large sum of money in this House we are justified in asking that at least some show will be made for it, that some use will be made of such a large sum, and that it will be expended in bringing back to something like efficiency property that he is under a moral obligation to safeguard and maintain.  I would ask him to give this matter his earnest consideration. If he is not prepared to do something to maintain property that was originally well maintained, then we have no other alternative but to vote against the sum of money that is being asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to this Vote, Sir, in the present state of the finances of the country.  I think that the Minister's demands are a crushing burden on the taxpayers of the country as a whole.  Listening here yesterday to a Bill for Advanced Studies, and listening to the discussions on this Bill, one would think that the people of this country are wallowing in wealth, and I think that if the Minister or his Government can find this money to spend upon armaments it would be much better spent upon the provision of tractors and ploughs for the use of our farmers.  I think that that money would be much better spent in encouraging tillage and on the provision of seeds and manures and implements, so as to increase tillage and enable our farmers to take advantage of the present European situation, instead of spending it in a way that will bring no return to the country.  Listening to the discussion here, one would think that this country was in a most prosperous <Col N="1629" /> condition instead of being, as many of my Dublin colleagues know, in anything but a prosperous condition. My Dublin colleagues must be aware that there is nothing but the greatest dissatisfaction in the City of Dublin as a result of unemployment and as a result of unemployed people being asked to bear hardships that no national Government should ask them to bear.  We have people here bearing all these hardships and depriving themselves and their families of practically the necessities of life in order to pay high rents, living on inadequate means and on what one might call bare subsistence, which is also paid for by the Dublin ratepayer who himself is only managing to struggle along.</P>
      <P>I think it is shameful that this money should be asked for, to be spent in the way suggested by the Minister.  There are many other more useful ways to spend this money.  I have mentioned one already, such as the provision of tractors, ploughs, seeds and manures, which would enable our farmers to avail of the present European situation. If the money were spent in that way, there would be a return for it&mdash; whether that return would be this year or next year, I know not, but there certainly would be some return for money spent in that way.  Our town and city workers&mdash;or, at least, those who were workers in the days gone by&mdash;are looking with the gravest anxiety to this Parliament to see what is going to be done for them and, God knows, you ought not to exhaust their patience, because their patience, in Dublin at any rate, is on the verge of being exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have thousands of men from 20 to 30 years of age out of work, and thousands upon thousands of young boys from 15 to 18 years of age who have never had any opportunity of getting work in this city and who are in danger of becoming unemployable. The Government should wake up to the situation.  One would think that several emergency committees should be sitting here in the city with a view to bringing about peaceful conditions among people who are dissatisfied with the present conditions.  The parents of these boys and girls are <Col N="1630" /> heartbroken because they do not know what is going to be done for their children.  Industry, generally, is suffering as a result of the conditions now obtaining in Europe, and I appeal to the Minister, to the Government, and to members of all Parties to wake up to the situation before it is too late.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a reference to Communism and Nazism and said that one is as dangerous as the other.  He asked whether there was any evidence of Communism or Nazism in this country.  I should like to be able to join with Deputy Dillon, and to hope that we are as free from Communism as he seems to think we are, but I put it to the Government that they should wake up to the position as it exists in Dublin at the present moment and as I know it to exist.  There are thousands and thousands in Dublin to-day who are not able to pay their rents, and the day will come when the Government will have to adopt some emergency powers in order to assist these people.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say.  I had not intended speaking here this evening and only intended to listen to the debate on the Vote, but somebody&mdash;I think it was a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;left a copy of the <i>Trade Journal</i> here, and I was reading therein a report of the numbers of unemployed.  It is as a result of what I read there that I made the few remarks I have made. They are not my own words.  They are based on the particulars given in this <i>Trade Journal</i>, and there is no exaggeration. This is an official journal published by the Government themselves, and I therefore appeal to the Government to wake up to the situation before it is too late.</P>

      <P>The members of this Party are not prepared to vote for the demand made by the Minister for the provision of a sum of £3,400,000, approximately, for Army services in the current year; especially in view of the fact that the Minister himself, up to the present moment, has not given any indication of the Army policy of the Government.  In the Estimates for the present year the Government have taken the responsibility of carrying out an economy drive, but their effort to <Col N="1631" /> reduce the cost of Government services during the coming year has been confined, so far as I can see, to cutting the services that provide housing for our people.  For instance, the sum in the Estimate this year for the erection of houses is being cut by no less than £255,000 compared with last year's Estimate, whereas between this year and last year a sum of approximately the same amount is provided for the farcical air-raid precautions scheme.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister deny that, between last year and this year, a sum of £250,000 has already been spent on, or is provided for, that farcical air-raid precautions scheme within the Estimate now before the House for consideration? Shortly after the outbreak of the war&mdash;as a matter of fact within a few days after the outbreak of war&mdash; the then Minister for Defence sent a telegram to the secretary of every local authority in this country calling for a complete black-out.  That call was responded to by all law-abiding citizens.  It was so loyally abided by in my own constituency that the secretary of one local body, on receipt of the telegram, went round to the Gárda Síochána and asked the Chief Superintendent to send the Gárdaí around to tell publicans and householders to put out their lights, and every public house and private house in that town was in complete darkness that night.  That farce was carried out for quite a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Taoiseach say here in this House that an assurance had been given to a certain Government that this country would remain strictly neutral during the period of the war, and, in response to that assurance, the particular country, Germany, said that they would respect the neutrality of this country.  Certain people questioned whether or not the black-out itself was a breach of our neutrality. Afterwards, it was admitted by the Government that a complete black-out was unnecessary, but how much money had been squandered between September, when that telegram to which I have referred was sent out, and mid-November <Col N="1632" /> when it was admitted that the black-out was unnecessary?  How many private citizens, who responded to that call in a sense of loyalty to the Government, and thinking the call to be necessary, since the Government made it, spent money in black-out arrangements which they could ill afford? I know of many citizens who spent sums of money which they could ill afford, in responding to a call of the Government to provide what they thought were necessary requirements, only to find out later that, in the opinion of the Government, these requirements were not necessary.  Can the Minister give any indication as to the extent to which private citizens spent their money on that unnecessary service?  If he cannot give us that figure, I know that he can give the figure of the amount already expended by local authorities in endeavouring to give effect to the Government's requirements. Will he state the actual sums spent to date in carrying out the instructions with regard to air-raid precautions issued to local authorities by his Department?  What is the amount of the claims submitted by the local authorities under that heading to the Department of Defence and what is the amount already paid, or authorised for payment by his Department?</P>
    <P>At that period, or shortly after the outbreak of war, the Department of Defence authorised somebody&mdash;presumably some commission agent, and if that is not so, I should like to know whether purchases of this kind were made by officials of the Department&mdash; to purchase 500,000 respirators.  They called upon every public utility corporation and every business concern, as well as local authorities and State departments, to select the most suitable persons willing to undertake the work of educating themselves in the requirements of the air raid precautions scheme.  A number of persons were selected, and these people were lectured, on an average, for three weeks on the subject.  The intention, I believe, was to enable these persons to convey the information they got to the people working with them, and, presumably, to the civilian population. The loss of time incurred by public <Col N="1633" /> utility corporations in sending certain of their employees to these lectures must have been considerable, if one takes the whole State into consideration. But what has been the result? Have there been any lectures at all to the civilian population since the lecturers became qualified in the work? What was the purpose of purchasing 500,000 respirators and storing them in Griffith Barracks, or some other barracks, and digging air raid shelters, which is still going on, for the protection of the civilian population, when they have not so far received any education with regard to air raid precautions? If there were an air raid to-morrow, not one person would be in possession of a respirator or would know how to use it, if he had one.</P>
    <P>If Deputies make application to various Government Departments for small sums of money in order to enable useful works to be carried out by local authorities, they are told that the money is not available, that the country is too poor to bear the cost, but there is no cost too great for carrying on the farce of air raid precautions in a country which, we are told by the Government, is in no danger of being attacked.  If there is no fear of attack during this war, what is the necessity for the expenditure of the people's money on the purchase of warlike stores and the purchase of other stores associated with air raid precautions?</P>
    <P>We have it from the Minister that some of the warlike stores already purchased&mdash;I presume contracts have been entered into&mdash;cannot be delivered for another year and a half.  I hope to God the war will be over by that time, and who is going to make use of these stores then?  We are not making use of the stores already purchased for the protection of the civilian population, and, from what I know, I am convinced that there is no intention on the part of the Government to proceed seriously with the education of the civilian population with regard to air raid precautions.  I see trenches being built outside the Custom House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They will not be used for tillage purposes.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, who, I understand, is responsible for the administration of this service, will give a little more information to the people who are paying for it as to whether it is intended seriously to proceed any further with the air raid precautions scheme.  I know that public utility corporations and other people have been asked to submit plans for the reconstruction of their premises in order to protect the workers in them in case of air raids. Somebody said here that, quite probably, we will be advised by some enemy country whenever we are to be attacked.  It looks as if we are waiting for that advice before taking all the precautions which should be taken by the Government of the country sincerely anxious to protect the people from such a possibility.  I believe the possibility is remote, but the fact is that a sum of £250,000 has already been spent, or provided for in this year's Estimate, for carrying on this particular service.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question I addressed to the Minister some time ago, I was informed that the cost of carrying on this scheme for clerical staff alone within the Department of Defence is something around £8,000 per year. There is no doubt that the men selected by the Department to deliver the lectures to the representatives of public utility corporations and others are experts at their job, and some of the finest lecturers one could listen to, but what is the use of these people having wasted their time and having wasted, so far, the time of the people to whom they lectured and who took out first class certificates, when you carry the scheme no further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been completely dumb in this respect, but the Parliamentary Secretary probably knows a good deal more about it, and I should be obliged if he would enlighten everybody <Col N="1635" /> concerned as to what is the intention in the matter.  Is it the intention to hand out 500,000 respirators to the civilian population and, if so, when? The Minister must admit that these 500,000 respirators which, according to the figure supplied to me, cost about £100,000, are useless if they are to be left in store in Griffith Barracks, or some other barracks, until an air raid takes place, and it is then found that the civilian population have not got what is required to protect them and, in any case, would not know how to use them, if they had them.</P>
    <P>Is it a fact that circulars have been sent to public utility corporations and other people asking them to submit plans for the reconstruction of their premises for the protection of workers employed there in case of an air raid, and, if so, what is the intention of the Department with regard to the cost? Is it intended to compensate local authorities for the cost involved in carrying out such reconstruction schemes, or is it a fact, as was the case in one place that I am aware of, that these plans were only asked for for what was described as &ldquo;paper purposes&rdquo;? One man who paid a visit to a certain institution in this city some time ago pressed for the plans, but apparently they were not forthcoming. He was asked who was going to bear the cost and was told that they were only for paper purposes.  He was told to submit plans and that if he was anxious to get any further information about them, he could send a communication to the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Finance.  Before people are asked to spend money uselessly, as was the case previously in connection with this particular service, it might be a good idea to let it be known what percentage, if any, of the total cost likely to be incurred, would be borne by the Government.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the civilian population spent thousands of pounds between the first week in September and the middle of November endeavouring to comply with the requirements of the Minister for Defence. In one place in my constituency, following the famous wire that was sent <Col N="1636" /> out by the Department, the secretary of a local authority was so concerned to give effect to the Minister's requirements, that he sent out a circular to every householder.  In order to make sure that the circular reached every tenant he selected a road ganger to deal with it.  Circulars found their way into the homes of poor people who could not afford to spend money buying the type of blinds that would prevent the Germans, if they ever came here, seeing any lights in the mountainy portions of the country.  It was a terrible farce&mdash;an admitted farce.</P>
    <P>In the middle of November one Minister, in the course of a speech that lasted a few minutes, admitted that the scheme was suspended indefinitely. When he was asked what that meant, he said it was suspended &ldquo;indefinitely for the present.&rdquo;  That statement is on the records of the House.  I am not sure what &ldquo;indefinitely for the present means&rdquo;, but I could give a good guess.  The Parliamentary Secretary would know the meaning better than I do.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary standing up and defending the expenditure already incurred on air raid precautions, and defending the policy of his Department, and that of the previous Minister, in persuading thousands of the civilian population to spend money foolishly in buying window blinds and other things so as to comply with the terms of the famous telegram sent out in September.</P>
    <P>Let him figure out the amount of the ratepayers' money that has been already squandered in that way by local authorities, portion of which will have to be refunded by the taxpayers through the Department of Defence. Let him get up and defend that portion of the Estimate which provides £116,000 in the current year for that purpose.  If he is prepared to say that he believed there was a remote possibility of this country being involved in the war, then he had some case for educating the people and making them pay for that education.</P>
    <P>If it is true&mdash;and I believe it to be true&mdash;that there is no possibility of this country being involved in the war, why <Col N="1637" /> in the name of common sense are we asked to justify the expenditure of £250,000 under the heading of A.R.P., while, at the same time, that amount is to be saved by reducing grants that were hitherto given for the housing of the civilian population?  If the House votes for this Estimate to provide £250,000 for A.R.P., that amount is to be found by cutting down housing grants.  There is a reduction of £255,000 this year, compared with last year, for the provision of housing for the civilian population, and £170,000 is cut off the Land Commission Improvement Vote.</P>

      <P>It is not fair that the Government should come along and ask for £3,400,000, without explaining the purpose for which the money is intended, while, at the same time, the House is to be asked in the Estimates that will shortly be before it to reduce expenditure on social services like housing, Land Commission improvement work, the erection of new buildings and other valuable services of that kind.  The saving is to be effected at the expense of those who hitherto found useful work in building houses, in carrying out improvements on the land, in draining land, and many other services that are going to suffer during the coming year, simply because the Government wants £3,400,000 for the maintenance of an army that, in my opinion, is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Vote we have to pay the cost of calling up thousands of men for the Army.  I do not know the exact number, because we have been refused the figures, but thousands of young men were called up at the beginning of the war, and the cost has to be borne by the taxpayers.  Some months after these men were called to the Army they were demobilised, <Col N="1638" /> showing that they were unnecessary, but when some of them went back to the places in which they were previously employed, they found that their jobs had been taken by others.  Are we to vote for a policy which will cost the taxpayers £250,000 for the A.R.P. farce, which no one on the front benches has, so far, made any attempt to justify?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the inquest held yesterday into the death of Anthony D'Arcy, I think it necessary to correct any misapprehension which may be caused by some of the evidence given by Father O'Hare.  It will be understood that I am speaking of the evidence as reported in the daily papers&mdash; the only version which reaches the ordinary citizen.  As so reported, there seems to be a clear suggestion that if Father O'Hare had been allowed to visit the prisoners in Mountjoy, whose treatment was put forward as the reason for the hunger-strike, and to report the facts as regards their treatment to the men on hunger-strike, the hunger-strike would have been abandoned. The ordinary reader will infer from this that the men on hunger-strike had a wrong idea about the treatment of the men in Mountjoy and that the authorities deliberately refused to enlighten them on the matter.  I want to say that that is not so.  The men on hunger-strike had no real right to be informed as to the treatment of other prisoners and if they had in fact gone on strike without knowing the facts then they would have behaved with great folly, but in point of fact they had opportunity after opportunity of knowing what treatment these men were getting in Mountjoy.  I am perfectly sure that they did know it and that nothing that Father O'Hare could have seen or reported would have made <Col N="1639" /> the slightest difference.  I propose to show this in some detail.</P>
      <P>In the first place, the strike was commenced at a time when both groups of men were actually in Mountjoy and the document served on the Governor, dated 24th February, formally declaring the starting of the strike, demanded expressly the removal of the convicted men to military custody.  In other words, the essential point was not the precise treatment in prison but the fact that the men were in a civil prison at all.</P>
      <P>At a comparatively early stage of the strike, on or about the 17th March, the acting Lord Mayor (Deputy Tom Kelly) was approached on this matter by relatives of the men on hunger-strike and he, in turn, approached me with a series of written questions as to the treatment in Mountjoy and I gave him a written reply to these questions so that he might communicate them to the relatives as they had requested, in order, it is understood, to communicate them to the men on strike.</P>
      <P>A few days after that I was again approached on the same subject by Deputy Norton and I consented to his proposal that Senator Seán Campbell of the Labour Party, who was a member of the Visiting Committee at Mountjoy and was familiar with the facts, should visit the men on hunger-strike and give them the information which the relatives wished conveyed to them, although I knew that they already had it.  Senator Campbell did so on the 22nd March.  He duly saw the hunger-strikers and conveyed the facts to them.  He took down their reply in writing.  It was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless all the Republican prisoners tried and convicted by the Military Tribunal are kept in custody by the military authorities the hunger-strike will be carried on.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage, the Acting Lord Mayor again approached me and permission <Col N="1640" /> was given to Miss Fiona Plunkett and another lady to see the prisoners on hunger-strike and tell them of the conditions in Mountjoy. It had no effect.</P>
    <P>Finally, ten days ago, Mr. Peadar O'Donnell called on me and suggested that if an official statement in writing as to the conditions in Mountjoy were given to him it might have the desired effect.  An official statement outlining the conditions, signed by the secretary of the Department, was accordingly given to him.</P>
    <P>On these facts it can hardly be questioned that every reasonable thing was done and every consideration given to ensure that the men knew what the conditions in Mountjoy were.  There is, in fact, no doubt that they did know perfectly well, but the position taken up by them was as stated in their letter of the 11th April, handed to Father O'Hare:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The men on hunger-strike will continue their fast until the following conditions are granted: that in future all soldiers of the Irish Republican Army who are tried and sentenced by the Military Tribunal, serve their sentence in military custody, and get the same treatment as is being meted out to the men in Arbour Hill Military Prison at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may well be that Father O'Hare believes he would have succeeded where all others had failed, but there do not seem to be any reasonable grounds for such a belief.  It is quite clear that the demand of the hunger-strikers is that all prisoners belonging to their organisation, no matter what offence they commit, should be held in military custody and recognised as members of a military force entitled to be treated as men engaged in legitimate warfare.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until Wednesday, 24th April, at 3 p.m.</P>
