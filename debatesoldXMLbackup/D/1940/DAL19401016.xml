      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in view of the substantial increase in the cost of building materials, and to encourage local authorities to initiate new building schemes, he is prepared to consider an increase in the subsidy granted to local authorities towards the cost of housing schemes, proportionate with the increase in construction costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to vary the present basis of financing housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it fair, or that it will encourage local authorities, that the present costs, over and above the amount eligible for the grant that local authorities receive&mdash;the sum is £300&mdash; should be borne by the ratepayers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the great increase in building costs?  Is he not aware that timber has gone up from £30 to £80 per stack, and that metals, corrugated iron, etc., have also gone up?  If he intends to carry on building in this country, is he not prepared even to go part of the way by increasing the grant in order to relieve unemployment and provide better houses for these people? If the Minister is not prepared to do <Col N="146" /> that, he can take it that building will be at a standstill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Building is not at a standstill, certainly so far as the urban areas or the county boroughs are concerned. It is going on in the City of Dublin practically as well as last year and better in some respects.  As to the grants given by the Department of 66? and 33?, the reduction will only show a very small percentage compared with last year, which would not justify at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say that, while it was quite possible to build within the limit of £300, which ranked for subsidy in the past, there is any possibility of rural authorities doing that in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that there is, but the increase over the £300 will not be very much.  At the present time it does not show very much increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is an increase of at least £60 over the £300 limit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot charge that in the form of rent, because you cannot charge an agricultural worker more than 2/- or 2/6 a week for a house, and that increase therefore must be borne by the ratepayers.  Does the Minister agree with that?  If that is the case, is it any encouragement to a board of health to initiate new housing schemes?</P>

      <P>I propose to answer questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The provision of additional benefits would depend on the availability of moneys to finance the scheme.

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Dillon) Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Dillon)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he intends to establish an ophthalmic <Col N="149" /> school for children suffering from trachoma, blepharitis and other chronic eye diseases which require prolonged treatment under competent supervision, inasmuch as these diseases untreated are a common cause of ultimate blindness, which by proper treatment is preventable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The incidence of trachoma amongst school children has been investigated by the county and county borough medical officers of health.  An analysis of their reports for the year 1938 shows that cases are very rare throughout the counties.  The following extracts from reports are illustrative of the evidence received in the Department:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No evidence available.&rdquo;&ldquo;Only one known case in county&rdquo; (Carlow). &ldquo;No evidence of trachoma exists amongst school-going children&rdquo; (County Cork).  &ldquo;There is no evidence that trachoma is increasing in this county, and it is probably decreasing&rdquo; (County Kerry).  &ldquo;I beg to report that trachoma is decreasing in this county&rdquo; (County Kilkenny).  &ldquo;No case detected since the school medical service scheme was initiated&rdquo; (County Louth). &ldquo;I do not so far notice any increase of trachoma...&rdquo; (County Monaghan). &ldquo;It would appear that trachoma is in the main a disease dying out in this county&rdquo; (Tipperary S.R.).  &ldquo;Only two cases have come under notice of the county oculist for several years&rdquo; (County Westmeath).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of ophthalmic schools for trachomatous children is not regarded as practical, but in any event the evidence as to the extent of the disease does not seem to justify such provision.  The provision of a special boarding school for trachomatous children would be justified if the number of cases requiring treatment was large and there was any assurance that children could be induced to enter such schools.  The information before the Department is that it would be difficult to make them remain in an institution of this kind.  In Dublin where the bulk of the cases exists efforts have been made to insure that they attend <Col N="150" /> for institutional treatment.  They are also visited by nurses in their homes.</P>

Subsequently the same applicant made a more complete presentation of the circumstances of his case, and an export licence was granted to him on 11th instant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if representations have been made to him concerning the importation into Éire of foreign <Col N="152" /> shirts, and what action, if any, has been taken in the matter; if he will state the quantity of shirts of foreign origin imported into Éire for quarters ended 31st March, 30th June, and 30th September, 1940; whether the Minister has considered the depression caused in the shirt-making industry in Éire, and the consequent unemployment of workers engaged in the industry by virtually prohibiting, under Control of Imports (Quota No. 39) Order of 1940, the importation of foreign cloth used for the manufacture of shirts, and permitting the importation into Éire of foreign made shirts made up from materials similar to those prohibited under the said quota, and if the Minister is prepared to prevent the dumping of such shirts into Éire by a quota order similar to that applied to material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been made to me by the interested parties in regard to the importation of shirts, and the matter has been the subject of careful examination in my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, have observed that in the Monthly Returns of Trade Statistics issued subsequent to August, 1939, a summary only of imports and exports has been given.  It has been decided, on grounds of public policy, not to publish for the present more details than are given in the Monthly Summary.  For that reason I find myself unable to give the import figures asked for by the Deputy.  I may say, however, that the imports of shirts during the present year show an increase compared with preceding years.  Nevertheless, the imports during the current year are small in relation to the total output of the shirt industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quota order mentioned by the Deputy covers the importation of plain shirtings.  This order was brought into operation for the purpose of assisting the mills engaged in the weaving of cotton piece goods, including shirtings.  Prior to its being made the shirt manufacturers obtained a substantial proportion of their requirements of the shirtings in question from <Col N="153" /> the home mills.  The quotas under the two other quota orders permit the importation of printed and woven patterned shirtings, which, in fact, constitute the bulk of the materials used in the industry.  One of these quota orders does not impose a severe restriction of imports and the other, in effect, imposes no restriction at all.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied, on present information, that there is necessity for affording further protection to the shirt-making industry.  I am, however, having the position kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the scheme be confirmed.  This amending scheme, as Deputies will note in paragraph 5, is promoted to give pension rights to a small number of national school teachers, probably not exceeding three in number, in respect of periods of not less than seven years during which they served as teachers in Irish-speaking schools or in special secondary schools for fostering the Irish language.  It also allows of the inclusion of periods of service as Gaelic League organiser and approved service as secondary school teachers for pension purposes in the case of those teachers.  Such service under this amended scheme may, however, be reckoned for pension only if the teacher pays the amount of contributions he would have paid had he served in a national school for the period in question.</P>
      <P>The secondary teachers' pension scheme of 1929 permits of previous service given as a national school teacher being counted for pension purposes in the case of secondary teachers, and that scheme, in conjunction with the incremental salary rules, permits of periods of service of not less than five years as Gaelic League organiser being similarly included. There is, however, no provision in the national teachers' scheme for a reciprocal arrangement in respect of secondary school service, nor is it proposed to adopt any such general arrangemeent.  The cases of the small number of teachers to whom this amending scheme will apply are deserving of special consideration in view of the essentially national character of their work in fostering the Irish language and culture under difficult circumstances and at considerable personal financial loss.  The other amendments in the scheme are largely of a technical character, and some of them are introduced to clarify certain provisions of the original scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> Paragraph 6 is introduced to preclude a period of service being reckoned both, for a teacher's pension and a military pension.  A similar provision was made in the Gárda Síochána Pensions (No. 2) Order, 1938. Paragraph 7 meets a technical difficulty which has arisen in certain cases of ex-national teachers who died after retirement and before making application for the pension to which they would have been entitled had such application been made.  Paragraph 8 is to delete the word &ldquo;efficiently&rdquo; which found its way into paragraph 11 (b) (ii) of the 1934 scheme owing to an oversight. This amendment is necessary because, without it, there is a possibility that a teacher who might be on the point of being dismissed without pension for non-efficiency could claim a pension on the ground that his non-efficiency was due to some physical defect such as would not ordinarily be regarded as sufficiently serious to warrant the award of a disability pension.  It was never intended that the word &ldquo;efficiently&rdquo; should have appeared in the original 1934 scheme but, owing to our desire at the time to get that scheme through then&mdash;if we had not got it through before a certain date we would have had serious administrative difficulties&mdash;the word crept in, and we have now to eliminate it.  The amendment in paragraph 9 qualifies the phrase &ldquo;claimant for a pension&rdquo;, in order to limit the benefit to cases in which there would have been entitlement to pension but for the failure to give notice of the claim within the prescribed period.</P>
    <P>If a teacher has failed to claim his pension within the prescribed period the Minister, I think, has discretion to permit him to make his application. If, however, he has been granted a gratuity he will not be entitled to a pension.  Pensions are only granted where the teacher has had at least ten years' service.  If he has had less than ten years he may be granted a gratuity but, in that case, he would not be entitled to a pension, and this amendment limits the concession which was given under the original rules to enable persons to make application subsequent to the date laid <Col N="166" /> down.  It limits their right to make such application except in cases where they are definitely entitled to a pension. Paragraph 10: It happens occasionally that, after a teacher has gone on pension, it is discovered that there has been an overpayment of salary or other grants to him.  Similar provision was made in paragraph 31 (2) of the Secondary Teachers' Scheme, 1929. Paragraph 11: The provision in paragraph 31 of the 1934 scheme led to the embarrassing position that a teacher who either through inadvertence or wilfully stays on in school without the permission of the Minister, has either to be paid salary for the excess period or to suffer the drastic penalty of loss of pension.  A certain date was fixed and the teacher had either to go on that date and draw his pension or else, according to the legal advice I had received, he was in danger of not being legally entitled to get his or her pension at all.  The amendment gives discretion to the Minister either to pay the salary if the teacher remains on in the school&mdash;which I do not propose to do&mdash;or to see that the pension is paid from the proper date.  Paragraph 12: The 1934 scheme, paragraph 7, dealt with the case of a national teacher who resigned from the service and was subsequently reappointed. If such teacher had been repaid his premiums, it was necessary for him to refund the amount, with interest, in order to have his previous period of service reckoned for pension. The Secondary Teachers' Scheme of 1929 provided for previous service as a national teacher being reckoned for pension as secondary teacher on the transfer of his premiums from the National Teachers' Fund to the Secondary Teachers' Fund.  No provision was made, however, for the case of a teacher who first served as a national teacher, then as a secondary teacher, and later reverted to the status of a national teacher.  This new paragraph provides for the payment to the Minister of the premiums in respect of the earlier period of national teacher service, as a condition for the inclusion of that period in the teacher's pensionable service and indicates the procedure to be adopted by the teacher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really because there was so much discussion on the measure that we think the consideration of the Estimate should be left over so that Deputies may have an opportunity of asking questions and of getting further information.  The consideration of this Estimate affords them the only opportunity they have of doing that.  To defer its consideration will not make the slightest difficulty so far as the progress of the institute is concerned. If it did, what on earth have the people responsible for the presentation of the Estimate been doing since this particular measure was passed by the Oireachtas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>A good deal of attention has been given to the matter.  The head of the Government himself has been closely interested in it, and has been giving a great deal of attention to the details.  It was a new scheme and legislation had to be drafted.  Since the passing of the legislation, a number of orders have had to be drafted, so that, apart from the technical questions which have arisen in order to determine what line these orders were to take, there was the question of the actual drafting of the orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept it that there are reasons why there would be delay in the presentation <Col N="169" /> of the Estimate.  The very fact that there were reasons for delay in the presentation of the Estimate, since the legislation was passed, really emphasises the point that we are making: that consideration of the Estimate should be deferred so that Deputies will have the opportunity of asking such questions as may seem proper to them.  I think the Minister ought to agree to our suggestion not to take the Estimate until the next day the House meets.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister for Education has already pointed out that the reason for this Estimate is that, until the money is voted by the House, we cannot make even tentative arrangements with regard to buildings, and so on.  We cannot proceed to appoint professors.  In fact, we can do nothing until there is authority from the House to spend money Everything of a preliminary character that could be done has, I think, been done. The academic year is now beginning, and if there is a question of appointing professors, every week that passes means an inconvenience.  For example, if a professor of University College, Dublin, were to be appointed, it would mean that students would have been receiving lectures from him for some weeks and that a new professor would then have to be appointed.  I had hoped that we would have been able to complete the preliminary work so as to bring in this Estimate at the beginning of October.  I do ask, the House to be indulgent and, if the Opposition so desire, I should be prepared to have consideration of the Estimate postponed to a later hour this evening, but to delay its passing for three weeks would be a considerable disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appreciate the difficulty as to getting ahead with the work before the money is provided, because I think the Taoiseach has satisfied himself that the money will be provided.  If the Taoiseach presses for <Col N="170" /> the passage of this Estimate and says that it is necessary to have it now, I shall withdraw any objection I personally have to consideration of it being proceeded with, but I suggest that as there has been admitted delay in the presentation of the Estimate&mdash;it is an astonishing thing to be given an Estimate to-day and asked to pass it on the spot without a more formal statement on its introduction&mdash;if between now and the 6th November representations are made by persons interested in the matter that there are points they would like to raise and discuss, the Taoiseach should be prepared, on request made on reasonable grounds, to introduce a Token Estimate on the 6th November so that these points should be cleared up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not desirable that details in regard to the working of the schools which would involve the mentioning of the names of persons should be discussed in the Dáil or Seanad. The intention is that, ultimately, these Votes should be dealt with more or less as the University Vote is dealt with, but that cannot be done for a year or two&mdash;during the experimental stage.  I think it is right that the House should have an opportunity of considering the Estimate much more fully than it would be possible to do in the time available to-day.  There would, I think, be no difficulty as regards the proposal to introduce a Token Vote of £10.  If it is regarded as the usual parliamentary practice in such cases to bring in a Token Vote, even though it may not be required, then I shall do so.  It would be much more regular to have the Estimate passed and to have the authority of the Dáil before incurring any expense than to proceed before the Estimate is passed.  An opportunity will be given to the Dáil, if not by way of Token Vote, then by some other means, to discuss the finances to be provided for the Institute.  The only question is one of procedure.</P>

      <P>Apparently, that was not considered in time to afford an opportunity of examining this Estimate. It would have been possible to vote moneys from the Contingency Fund.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue as to the weakness of the case because it is quite obvious that the moment we employ anybody or make contracts of any kind we are, in effect, spending money.  Objection can be raised that sufficient notice has not been given, but there are three bodies concerned, and if you enter into commitments before the Dáil authorises the expenditure of money, you are taking a certain amount of risk and, perhaps, not treating the Dáil properly. Complaint could be made that we had not treated the Dáil properly if we entered into commitments before receiving the authority of the Dáil to do so.  If the Dáil were meeting next week we could, of course, take the Estimate then.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 and 45 Vict., c. 49, c. 46, and c. 71, s. 4; 48 and 49 Vict., c. 73, ss. 17, 18 and 20; 54 and 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38, and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; and No. 26 of 1939).</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises ia very exceptional circumstances.  Unforeseen charges have been incurred by the Land Commission under three categories which are not included in the sub-heads of the Vote for Lands, and it becomes necessary, therefore, to ask Dáil Eireann to approve of the supplementary provision of the amount required, In fact, the full £305 needed to offset the charges could be made good out of savings on other sub-heads of the Vote for Lands, but in order to preserve the proprieties of law and accountancy it is necessary to introduce a token Estimate for the nominal sum of £10: that is to say, £295 of the £305 will be found out of savings on other sub-heads and the remaining £10 forms the subject of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The three matters on which these charges, technically described as losses, have been incurred are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) In the acquisition by the Land Commission of lands on the estate of <Col N="174" /> Eastwood and others, County Louth, for the relief of congestion under the Land Acts 1923-39, the lands were taken over by the Land Commission at a provisional price (in 4 per cent. Land Bonds) which was subsequently increased by the Appeal Tribunal.  The lands on the Estate comprise an area held in fee simple and an area held subject to an ordinary land purchase annuity together with an annuity in redemption of a superior rent.  The Land Commission apportioned the price for each of these areas, and their price for the second area would have been sufficient to cover the redemption of both the annuities charged on it. However, the Appeal Tribunal, on hearing an appeal on price by the owners, increased the total price for the whole estate, but altered the apportionment of this price between the two component areas in such a way that the price put on lands subject to the two annuities was reduced to a sum insufficient to discharge the amount utilised to redeem the annuities. The question then arose of how the discrepancy between the redemption money and the purchase price was to be met, and the sanction of the Minister for Finance has been obtained to the recoupment of the Land Bond Fund to the amount of £120 cash, comprising capital and dividends.</P>
    <P>This is the first time such a contingency has arisen and, a case of the kind is not likely to recur.</P>
    <P>(2) The second matter concerns an accident which occurred in the making of improvement works in Offaly for which the Land Commission was held by the court liable to provide compensation. A foal fell into a drain pit and was killed, and the owner obtained a decree against the Land Commission for the sum of £21 4s. 6d. covering compensation and costs.  The Minister for Finance has directed that this amount be charged against a Losses sub-head of the Vote.</P>
    <P>(3) The third matter offers a good illustration of the difficulties of detail with which the Land Commission have to contend in the acquisition and division of lands.  On the acquisition (by consent) of certain lands in County <Col N="175" /> Wicklow from the owner, it was arranged that the tree-lined avenue leading to his residence should be excluded from the sale, but owing to the difficulty of delineating precise boundaries on a small-scale map, portion of the avenue which the Land Commission had not, in fact, acquired was incorrectly vested in the allottee of the adjoining land.  Dispute consequently arose between the owner and the allottee, involving the added question of a right of way over the avenue, and it became necessary to bring the whole matter before the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission.  Under his ruling the boundary was rectified by amending order, subject to the payment by the Land Commission of due compensation to the allottee and of the costs incurred.  Such payment (which has been sanctioned by the Minister for Finance) amounts to approximately £163 for compensation, interest thereon, and costs.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,300 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for Grants to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (No. 13 of 1940).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote is required in order to provide the expenses to be incurred before the end of the present financial year in connection with the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies which was established by the Act passed by the Oireachtas in June last.  That Act provided that the functions of the Institute would be discharged through Constituent Schools, and that a School of <Col N="176" /> Celtic Studies and a School of Theoretical Physics should be established as soon as conveniently might be after the passing of the Act.  The necessary steps are being taken for the establishment of these schools, and the establishment orders for the purpose will be laid before the Oireachtas at an early date.</P>
    <P>In order to understand better the arrangement of the Estimate, it may be well to explain briefly the system of organisation of the Institute.  In the first place, there is the council of the Institute, which is the booy corporate, and is entrusted with the general government and administration of the Institute.  The first council has already been constituted, its members being Reverend Dr. P. Browne, chairman; Dr. Best, Professors Binchy, Schroedinger and Hackett as appointed members; and the three ex-officio members&mdash;Dr. Eoin MacNeill, President of the Royal Irish Academy; Dr. Conway, President of University College, Dublin, and Professor Thrift, Provost of Trinity College.</P>
    <P>Each Constituent School will have its own governing board, which will be in charge of the academic affairs of the school.  The governing boards for the School of Celtic Studies and the School of Theoretical Physics will be appointed as soon as these schools are established.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Estimate which has been circulated to Deputies, the expenses of the Institute and its schools come under two main headings &mdash;(a) annual grants, and (b) expenditure of a capital nature.  The former is subdivided into three sections, the first of which makes provision for the administrative expenses of the council.  The largest and most important of these expenses is the cost of accommodation. This is one of the matters for which responsibility is entrusted to the council by the Act, and it is not possible to say definitely at this stage what the views of that body may be on the subject, but a tentative arrangement is being made to provide accommodation for the Institute in two adjacent houses in Merrion Square, and this section of the Estimate includes provision for the rent and rates for these houses, the <Col N="177" /> cost of furniture and other equipment, and the expenses of light, heating, and maintenance.  It also includes provision for the salary of the registrar and a clerk-typist.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Estimate makes provision for the academic staff and educational expenses of the School of Celtic Studies.  It is proposed that three senior professors should be appointed to the staff of this school, and provision is also included for the appointment of assistants and for the purchase of works of reference and other books for the school library. Section 3 of the Estimate makes similar provision for the School of Theoretical Physics.  While it is intended that the staff of this school will normally include three senior professors, it is proposed to appoint only one senior professor in the school at present.  The amount (£500) provided in sub-head B of the Estimate is intended to defray the cost of any structural alterations or similar improvements that may be necessary in the buildings in which the Institute is housed, in order to make them fully suitable for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand from the explanation I have given that this Estimate is, to a large extent, of a provisional or experimental nature.  It is possible that expenditure may be necessary for other purposes which I have not mentioned, such as the provision of scholarships, or the payment of fees or expenses of visiting professors. It may be assumed that expenditure under these headings will arise when the Institute and its Constituent Schools are in normal working condition, but it is not possible to say now whether the need for such expenditure will arise before 31st March next. These are matters that come within the province of the governing boards of the schools, and until these boards have been appointed and have prepared their plans and programmes of work, it is not possible to make an exact calculation of the expenses to be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather important that we have not got a figure of any sort to go on.  On the occasion of the Second Reading, I mentioned that one of the items likely to enter very largely into the cost incurred in connection with these relief schemes was cement, and it has been conveyed to me by some people interested in the cement company that my remarks were unfair. They were, briefly, that the company had paid 10 per cent., that the directors were well paid, that there was ample provision made for depreciation, and that there was a hidden fund amounting&mdash;I was reported as having <Col N="180" /> said, and I believe I did say&mdash;to about 1/- per cwt. on cement.  It is obvious, on consideration, that it was 1/- a ton I had in mind, assuming that there was any such thing, because 1/- per cwt. would represent a very large sum&mdash;£1 per ton.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say of the company that it did not pay dividends for the first year&mdash;it could not because it was not working&mdash;but in respect of its first five months' working, it paid 4 per cent., with a very large sum to depreciation and a considerable sum off the preliminary expenses.  In the second year, it paid 10 per cent., made a fairly large allocation to depreciation, and paid a sum practically equivalent to more than 50 per cent. of the dividend off the preliminary expenses.  If the Government's policy in respect of profits is to be interpreted in the light of the report of the Prices Commission into the Pigs and Bacon business, the standard should be 7 per cent.  Here we have 10 per cent. being paid, on a monopoly. I think it is unreasonable.  It is held by some people that the profits would not allow of any material reduction in the price.  So far as the hidden sum is concerned, there was a sum, because it is mentioned by the directors themselves, in some statements, that foreign cement is now to be charged for at a higher rate, by reason of the fact that funds over which they had some control were not now available in respect of that.  Those funds must have come from some source; they must have come from the profits of the firm. There is scarcely any Minister in the State who should be more concerned with the cost of cement than the Minister for Local Government.  According to the information which I have received, the Minister for Industry and Commerce exercises some sort of supervisory&mdash;if not control&mdash;observation over this firm, and it is a strange thing that one set of business men are limited to 7 per cent. while others can have 10 per cent. and over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that, under this Bill, the Minister for Local Government is charged with providing employment. Normally, it is not his business; it does not enter into the scope of the scheme of local government that if should be. <Col N="181" /> I take it that, if he is going to enter into anything of that sort, it should be his desire and his duty to see that the kind of work which is going to be undertaken will be of a constructive character as far as possible.  On looking through the Bill, one comes to the conclusion that there is nothing else in mind but roads and road making. There are opportunities for spending money in a very constructive manner in this country.  The very Department in question has such work within its scope, sewerage, waterworks, housing, and so on.</P>
    <P>The desirability and the necessity in these times of getting value for money should be paramount to the mind of the Minister, perhaps more than any other Minister in the State, because in the last seven or eight years the rates of practically every local authority in the country have advanced, and advanced considerably.  It may be urged that the people are getting extra services.  The question of our ability to pay for the extra services depends very largely on what our production is, and it appears from any and every examination that can be made of the economy of this country, in the last eight or ten years particularly, that if we are to expect any real improvement in our economic position it is to the agricultural industry we must turn our attention.</P>
    <P>Practically the only term that is employed in connection with this particular Bill, other than roads, is &ldquo;works of public utility&rdquo;.  It does appear to me that there are opportunities which might be availed of in the course of the operation of this Bill, to improve the productive capacity of the country in respect of the agricultural industry, mainly as regards drainage, and I should say also in respect of the extension of the electricity undertaking to farmers in quite a number of districts throughout the country.  In one of the provinces of Canada, the province of Ontario, something like 50,000 fanners are at present being supplied with electricity.  There the scheme has been extended on the basis of the provinces paying 50 per cent. of the costs. Quite a number of publications have been issued in connection with it.  It <Col N="182" /> is hoped that an additional 30,000 or 40,000 farmers will be enabled to get their farms connected with the supply of electricity during the next couple of years.  Generally speaking, in no other country than America, North and South, has there been such an extension of the use of electricity for farming purposes, with corresponding advantages.</P>
    <P>Taking this particular measure, which is a costly one&mdash;according to the accounts which the Minister gave us on the last day the sum of money which is being expended is in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000&mdash;it is very desirable that we should get some value out of the expenditure of such a huge sum of money.  Merely having additional roads, better footpaths and so on is no advantage; the straightening of corners and all that sort of thing may have its advantages, but it does not add in any way to the wealth and productivity of the country.  It is held in quite a number of these publications which I have mentioned that there are many advantages in connection with the use of electricity for farming purposes; that those various rays have a vitamin or stimulative character; that egg production is increased; that they have utilised the power for chopping food stuffs; that they have utilised it for packing silos; that they have utilised it for making the agricultural life of the country more attractive, and for endeavouring to stop the trek from the land into the city.</P>
    <P>That is one of the problems with which the Minister and the Government have been faced during the last eight or ten years.  The fact that people are leaving the land and coming into the city makes the problem of dealing with unemployment a very much more serious, a very much more difficult, and a very much more expensive one.  If it were possible to have a plan for making the land more attractive for those who are on it, if we could only do that by improving their living conditions and improving their conditions of prosperity, it is possible that very much more useful work would be accomplished than can be measured in terms of £ s. d.  It is unfortunate that the Minister or the Government cannot <Col N="183" /> tell us what sum of money is in mind in connection with this particular measure.  From all accounts, it is in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000, and it would be most unfortunate if, after this measure had been operating for a year, we had nothing of a really constructive character to show for the expenditure of such a huge sum of money.  It may be that I have taxed your patience somewhat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say whether the terms of this resolution are designed to cover the grant of any money from the national Exchequer to the local authorities for the carrying out of the works which he may order them to do?</P>
      <P>In his reply on the Second Reading, in column 136 of the Dáil Debates, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is assumed, for the purpose purely of criticism and for the purpose purely of attacking the Bill itself, that all this money is going to be a further burden on the already overburdened ratepayers.  I did not give any indication, when I was moving the Bill that that was the the position.</P>
      <P>The latter statement is perfectly correct, but it would be equally correct to say that he gave no indication of any source from which the money was to come, and as far as my reading of the Bill goes, there is nothing in the Bill which indicates that it is to come from anywhere but out of the ratepayer's pocket.  I would like to know from the Minister whether this resolution covers an allocation from the Exchequer to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Benson has pointed out, the Minister gave some kind of vague reply as to where the <Col N="184" /> money was to come from to finance schemes which he visualised.  I think that before this Bill is passed we ought to be told by the Minister whether grants are to be given and, if so, if they are to be given in the same proportion as they have been given in recent years for the relief of unemployment. I think we also ought to be told if this three days or four days system is to be continued, because I suggest to the Minister that money is being lost to local authorities and to the central Government by the continuation of the rotational system of working. One cannot expect to get the best out of a man who only works for three days each week over a period of a month.  Certainly it is not the best way to get work done.  The men do not like it.  They have to do it, of course; they have no option in the matter.  Most of them&mdash;not all of them&mdash;prefer to be working rather than drawing the dole, but I think at this stage, when legislation of this kind is being enacted, we ought to be told definitely by the Minister what proportion of money is going to be provided by the Government so that this work can be carried out, and also if it is the intention of the Government to continue the rotational system of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the resolution before us is for the purpose of giving authority for the spending of money in the administration of the measure that has just been introduced. As I understand the presentation of the case that has been made by the Minister, he is not proposing a plan for the relief of unemployment, he is not outlining even the possible amount of money which is likely to be spent under this measure during the present year but, in anticipation that there will be an increase in unemployment in the country and perhaps a scarcity of money, he feels it necessary to direct public works along the most useful lines and to carry them out in the most economic way.  For that purpose, he is taking a better Ministerial grip over suggestions that might be made as to the lines on which work would be carried out and a better Ministerial grip over the direction of that particular <Col N="185" /> work.  On this resolution, I should like to ask whether the Minister has given any consideration to the steps that should he taken in order better to administer unemployment grants and to get results from them and whether in giving consideration to that he has not come to the conclusion that the key to getting the best work selected, to getting the best work done and saving the greatest amount of money in carrying out the work is to have the work directed and supervised by properly qualified technical persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that housing is going on splendidly at the present time.  The Minister cannot but be aware that very poor housing work has been done in the past, that a very large amount of money has been spent, a very substantial portion of which might have been saved if there had been greater technical supervision of that work than he was able to provide with the staff and the use of the staff that he had at his disposal.  For many years we had a housing board.  There was one technical member on that board, but the technical member went. The result was that we were paying a housing board over a considerable number of years that gave no guidance as to the direction in which we might look to get good housing for the money we were spending or as to how money that was being spent on housing could be saved.  When that Housing Board went, a Housing Commission was set up to consider the position.  At a time when a large amount of money was being spent through local government on road-making, sewerage schemes, water schemes, housing, etc., a very serious inroad had to be made on the professional engineering staff of the Department to look after that Housing Commission. After what I thought was the fiasco of the housing board, when it was proposed to set up a housing commission, I, personally, refrained from criticising the Way in which that commission was being set up.  I thought a quick, thorough job was going to be done and that we would have the result of that commission's considerations and reflections quickly.  I felt that in an important matter we might be charged with queering the ground and prejudicing <Col N="186" /> the work of that commission by saying some of the things that we had in our mind.  A very long time has passed without any report from that Housing Commission, and we are in the position that anybody looking at the administration can see that the head of the engineering branch of the Department of Local Government has his attention distracted from the direction of his staff and the supervision of work in the country by the work that is quite unnecessarily thrown on that branch to review the housing position. The result is that the Housing Commission has not carried out its work properly in any reasonable amount of time.  It has not reported in any kind of satisfactory or reasonable way.  We do not know when we are going to get the report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing the Minister's attention to the reaction on the Housing Commission of not having technical staff to look after the housing side.  I am drawing his attention to the fact that neglect on the housing side has eaten further into the professional resources of the engineering staff and that, at a time when a terribly large number of public works are being carried out, he has not had the necessary amount of technical staff to look after it.  I ask him to consider now, when he is looking for a better machine, a better Ministerial grip over the, carrying out of public works, if he is going to increase the administrative costs of looking after this work, whether it is not to be on the lines of getting greater technical assistance to look after a technical job?  There is not a single department of State at the present time where the technical man's work is not interfered with, is not interrupted, is not held up, is not prejudiced by people who have purely the administrative, file-keeping, safety point of view in mind.  Nothing will solve some of the problems that we have at the present time in the <Col N="187" /> country, or will make good use of the money we are spending, but proper technical men whose judgment is accepted and whose work is not interfered with by what I call the routine, delaying, safety-seeking clerical machine.</P>
      <P>I think this is a suitable occasion for saying to the Minister that in his Department and other departments of State where technical work is being carried out now is the time for seeing that there is the necessary amount of technical supervision and the necessary amount of professional advice first before any other consideration is gone into, that where you get technical experience and professional advice it should be accepted, and in a situation which requires decision and effective work the judgment of our technical and professional people should be relied on, as they are the best people that we can get to guide us in some of the matters that have to be attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is in order on a Money Resolution to review the main features of this Bill.  As I can grasp it, this is an alleged cure which will spread the disease that it is supposed to cure.  I was glad to hear Deputy Mulcahy dealing with that abortion that should never have taken place, the Housing Commission.  That emanated from a motion carried by the Dublin Corporation over a year and a half ago, when those of us who were concerned with employment and housing, and who understood the problem, knew that there was only one thing that stood in the way, and that was finance. We did not want anything investigated. At the best, it was only a delaying commission, and how admirably it has done its work!  In this Bill the expression &ldquo;work of public utility&rdquo; means a work consisting of the construction or improvement of a road, a sewer or waterworks, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy desires to deal with the sections, opportunity will arise later; for the present, we are dealing with a Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="188" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to deal with the sections in detail, but I would like to point out that the whole Bill is founded on works of public utility&mdash; the construction of sewers, waterworks or other works which tend to improve or protect the public health. Our trouble in Dublin is that we have too much land developed and the proposal in this Bill is that we spend more money in putting down sewers, making roads and drains&mdash;burying it in the ground, where we have perhaps hundreds of thousands buried already, producing nothing.  I challenge contradiction on that, and the Minister knows I am right.  Now we are proposing to bury more money in the ground instead of raising houses on the land we have already developed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been told on several occasions that there is only one thing required to keep building going while we have the raw materials, and that is, to finance the purchasers of houses.  If you give them money to purchase houses, building will be automatic. I am a builder in a small way, but I could produce sites for a thousand houses without laying a single sewer. Why are not facilities given to do work instead of taxing work?  That is what is being done, taxing the people who are trying to do work.</P>
      <P>It has been asked, where will this money come from?  It is sticking out where it will come from.  If the local authority do not discover works, do not make roads to nowhere, the Minister will certify that a road must be made to nowhere, or he will certify as to the putting down of more sewers, and if the local authorities do not do that work he sacks them.  The local authority that will be subservient to the Minister, or the creature he will put in its place, will find the money. How does the local authority find the money?  By striking a rate.  There is no use in burying our heads in the sand.  The little industry, agriculture, that we have in this country able to employ people is going to be taxed further in order to create the type of employment that the exigencies of the situation do not yet require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the repercussions?  For <Col N="189" /> one thing, it will curtail the employing capacity of the employers; it will increase overhead charges instead of diminishing them.  Such a monstrous proposal I could scarcely conceive coming from any sane body of men.  I wonder why the representatives of Dublin City are silent on this matter? In this city large establishments are on the point of closing down because of overhead charges, shortage of business due to shortage of money which, in turn, is due to shortage of employment. Is it not a terrible indictment of the whole administration?  I have not in mind any particular Government, but I have in mind our 18 years of self-government when I make that statement.  We are now proposing to build a State laundry, as it were, where we will exchange one another's washing.</P>
    <P>Let there be no illusion about it.  I can speak for the employers of my constituency in County Dublin, employers in the industrial and agricultural spheres.  With one voice they say: &ldquo;Our overhead charges are too high.  We want a Government that will reduce overhead charges, so as to enable us to increase our business and give more employment.  In that way only can we absorb the unemployed of the country&mdash;there is no other way of doing it.&rdquo;  That is the unanimous verdict. If this Bill is passed, it will need no prophet, but an ordinary man of business, a man who has to square his accounts, weekly, monthly, or quarterly as the case may be, to foresee that in 12 months we will have reached a stage ten times worse than now.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not consider that, my criticism is directed against him or his Government.  I appreciate that he has a very difficult job on hands.  I am sure he has given it considerable thought and that he has done his best. But it is only a palliative, a putting off of the evil day.  What you should do, in order to set the wheels of industry going, is pump capital into industry and agriculture.  If you cannot do that, you cannot relieve unemployment; any other way would be merely tinkering with the problem.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading a certain suggestion was made, but it is not a <Col N="190" /> suggestion that I could agree with 100 per cent.  It is time we considered such a suggestion.  As a business man, one with some knowledge of business and agriculture, I say without fear of contradiction that until we as a nation act as the ordinary business concern acts, we will not succeed in solving the unemployment problem.  If you start a company to undertake the manufacture of any article, what is the principal concern of that company? Its paid-up capital, its banking balance. If that company gives control of the banking balance to any other persons, do you think it will be administered in the best interests of the company? Of course not.  We as a nation are trying to run the country and give employment to the workers without at the same time controlling our banking balance.</P>

      <P>Your disorderly interruption. You will not get away with it from me.  I have nothing further to say except that this Bill is being taken very seriously by business people who have to work for their living.  It does not matter, of course, for people who can get their cheques every month, but we who are bearing the burden of industry and agriculture, who have to meet our wages bill, keep our men paid, get a return and keep the wheels of industry and agriculture going, view with alarm the inevitably increased burden that is being put on our shoulders.  In conclusion, I would appeal to the House to consider very carefully applying this remedy unless Deputies are quite sure that it is a remedy that will effect a cure and not further spread the disease.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the resolution is to enable the national Exchequer to provide money for the administration of the Bill, but the whole principle of the Bill, so far as I can see, is to relieve the central Exchequer of the obligation of making any provision towards the relief of <Col N="192" /> unemployment and to throw the entire burden upon the shoulders of councils and, through them, on to the ratepayers. I am satisfied, from discussions I have had with ratepayers and fanners throughout the country, that the provisions of this Bill if carried into effect, will cause something in the nature of a revolution throughout the various counties.  If the Minister wishes to prevent that state of affairs, I think at least he should give an assurance that whenever his Department take action to compel a local authority to undertake certain works, they will see that at least 50 per cent. of the cost of the work is borne by the central Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that on the last day on which we discussed this Bill I had made it sufficiently clear where the money required to operate the Bill was to come from.  In replying to statements by a number of Deputies, who suggested that this was an attempt to throw the whole burden of these schemes on the ratepayers, I said that the same system that has obtained in the past with regard to improvement Votes, maintenance Votes and unemployment Votes, is going to obtain with regard to works started under this Bill.  There is no change whatever in the system, and I do not know how anybody on the last day could have been so foolish as to imagine that a change was intended. The allegation was made for some ulterior purpose, as some little thing that one could stick on to, to support the suggestion that the Bill was a bad Bill.  Deputy Cosgrave on the last day referred to the Bill as a machinery Bill, and that is all the Bill claims to be. You may call it, if you wish, a planning Bill, a Bill the object of which is to see that the ratepayers will get something that may be of greater use to them in future than they have been able to get through the haphazard schemes operated in the past.  We have the position from time to time that we get reports from county surveyors, technical persons and other people competent to deal with these matters, saying that when they have to deal with proposed schemes on the basis of the unemployment content in an area, they cannot <Col N="193" /> get suitable works in that area. Deputies and other people going through the country will frequently see a number of minor works being carried out that do not seem to be very essential or to be of very great utility. Our aim in this measure is to get the assistance of technical experts so that we shall be able to plan in such a way that we can afford the greatest possible employment in an emergency and, at the same time, leave something tangible as a result of that planning that will be of value to the local authority afterwards.  As I say, it is a planning Bill.  It gives an opportunity to local bodies to plan ahead.  Deputy Belton to-day referred to burying pipes.  One of the schemes put before the Dublin Corporation was the Kilbarrack-Artane-Howth, sewerage scheme.  Does Deputy Belton suggest that that is a scheme for burying pipes?  Will he say that in Kilbarrack, Howth or Artane? It is easy to indulge in that sort of talk in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sort of scheme that could be planned out ahead.  After the Town Planning Bill was passed, a body was set up by the Dublin Corporation and, those panning experts having devised what they called ring roads in Dublin, I understand that the corporation has been proceeding with the work, and has outlined certain plans and schemes.  I wish that other bodies would take the initiative in the same way as the Dublin Corporation.  We have been told that we are trying to dictate to them.  What we have in mind is that, if the Dublin Corporation, when carrying out a big scheme of that sort, were confronted with opposition from the county council when it has to go into the country area, then the Minister, if they cannot agree between themselves, <Col N="194" /> has the right to come in and, if necessary, remove the body obstructing the corporation in carrying out these schemes that extended into the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the dictation there.  Is it not absolutely necessary? Do not the people who are charged with these matters in the corporation know that it is absolutely necessary that these powers should be there?  Are not the Dublin Corporation officials themselves waiting for these powers to be given to them?  Yet we hear talk about dictation under the Bill.  I saw a report of a meeting of the Dublin Corporation at which there was talk about dictatorship.  Where one public body may have to enter on the area of another public body to carry out certain works, such as sewerage, waterworks, link roads, etc., it is necessary that the executing authority, as it is called in the Bill, should have power to compel the other people to allow them to do that work. When I first thought of this Bill it was in connection with such schemes as these ring roads in Dublin.  We all know that in Dublin unemployment is greater than elsewhere.  It was such schemes as that we had in mind.  But, as it has developed since, we believe it will be of general utility in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been criticised in connection with this rotational scheme and that matter has been debated in this House several times.  The aim of this Bill, so far as planning is necessary, is the aim of all unemployment schemes, namely, to try and give the greatest amount of employment; and to give the employment to the greatest number you have to have a rotational scheme.  I would agree straight away that perhaps it is not the best scheme; that it is not perhaps the most economic scheme; but I am not going to argue that with anybody.  When you are up against the problem of trying, as far as yon can, to alleviate the distress that may exist among the unemployed and trying to deal with that problem as best you can, you must try and spead the employment, over the <Col N="195" /> greatest number.  Again I say that perhaps it is not the most economic way, but it is the best we can do in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that being out of work for a considerable time has a very deleterious effect on people.  It has been pointed out to me by the Board of Works and others that very often, when men are a good while unemployed they are not so able for a time to do a whole week's work.  The aim is to try and give employment by that system to the people who are in receipt of the largest amount of unemployment assistance; that is, the people who have the largest number of dependants to support.  In every case where employment is given to these people the amount paid to them is never lower than 30 per cent. over and above what they would receive in unemployment benefit.  It goes very much higher in most cases, but in no case can it go lower than 30 per cent. over and above what they would receive as unemployment benefit in the ordinary way.</P>

The Board of Works have more experience of them than I have, and I am sure that, if they found the system they have devised in any way faulty, they would be quite prepared to change it, if it <Col N="196" /> is going to help in any way.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the price of cement.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department and myself are concerned with the question of prices and the question of supplies, and that we are in daily communication with the Departments concerned in these matters.  My problem would be very much easier if the prices were very much lower and if supplies were available. We are in communication with the Department of Supplies on various aspects of that matter, and with the Department of Industry and Commerce on the question of costs.  It is perhaps, primarily, their problem, but it certainly affects our Department in a very acute way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that wages did go up; I do not know exactly what the amount was, but I think it was 6/- a week or something like that.  Deputy Mulcahy mentioned that all this work should be planned and looked after by technical experts.  I fully agree with him in that.  In every case, I think, where works have been carried out by local authorities they have the assistance of experts and, at the top, of course, we must have the experts. If we want assistance, we have to make representations to try and get the extra assistance needed.  The Deputy can be assured that when we get that assistance, if we do get it, the <Col N="197" /> Department is always guided and influenced by the advice, direction and assistance given in these matters.  We are only anxious in this Bill to see that they are planning ahead so that useful works and works that will give the most employment will be carried out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to drainage works.  The Deputy knows that in 1928 a Drainage Act was passed to assist in the carrying out of small schemes of drainage.  That Act was to be renewed after five years, but it was allowed to lapse because very few counties availed of it.  I think only Offaly and some other counties in the Midlands availed of it to any extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>When that period was up there was no demand for the continuance of the Act.  Apart from that, drainage is a matter upon which a commission has reported.  I do not know what that report is, but it is a matter that should be dealt with in that way.  It certainly is outside the province of local authorities primarily, just as I contend that the repair of harbours, ports and docks would also be outside the scope of local authorities. There was a Grand Jury Act which, I think, enabled local authorities to repair piers or make roads to piers and do other things like that for which they could give something like £1,500 of a grant, or two-thirds of the cost, whichever was the lower.  The present position in regard to the repair of docks or piers is that, if anything has to be done, it is primarily under the control of the Harbour Commissioners who are confined to the dues they collect in the port.  They can only proceed with improvement or construction works by getting a private Bill passed here or by a Provisional Order.  I feel that harbour works are outside the scope of this Bill, which is directly concerned with the local authorities through the country.  I feel that ample works of public utility, useful works, works that would be of lasting benefit to these <Col N="198" /> local authorities, can he devised by good technical experts who are in their employment, assisted and aided by experts at the top if it is considered necessary, and also that considerable employment can be given by such works of public utility.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 19, after the word &ldquo;amenities&rdquo;, to insert the words &ldquo;or a work consisting of the construction or improvement of a port, harbour, dock, quay, or pier, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the widening, deepening, or dredging of the channels, approaches, or other waters leading or adjacent thereto or forming part thereof, or the reclamation or protection from the sea, river, or other waters, of land or sites within or adjacent thereto&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which seeks to enlarge to some extent the scope of the Bill.  During the last 12 months, it is obvious to anyone who has followed the receipts of harbour boards throughout the country, that they have been very hard hit by reason of the war.  Up to the time of the war, that is, up to the commencement <Col N="199" /> of the war, harbour boards in this country&mdash;at least, speaking of the two principal harbour boards-were very progressive, and in fact we might say the same of nearly all the harbour boards.  In the case of the two principal harbour boards there have been extensive schemes of reclamation of land put forward, and it is fairly clear that, by reason of the very big reduction that has taken place in their receipts owing to the ravages of war, they will not be able to undertake these schemes now.  This amendment is not put down for the purpose of helping these bodies, but for the purpose of helping on work that has been interrupted by the war.  The Minister, in the concluding portion of his speech, said that they had some sort of planning in regard to this matter.  I hope that they have, because there is no evidence of any planning, up to this, on the question of really good work that could be done. Very good work has been done in connection with harbour improvements during the last two or three decades, and it is for the purpose of getting some work done, which would be of permanent and lasting benefit, that I put down this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I indicated, in my concluding remarks, that harbour work, or work of this nature, was not work that we could contemplate in a Bill of this sort.  It seems to me that it is work that would come, primarily, under the Department of Industry and Commerce, and I do not know that we could do anything under this Bill with regard to such a matter, or ask local authorities, who come under this Bill, to do these things.  Certainly, it might be very useful work, but it seems to me that it would be a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce, who should know the position, to get something done along those lines.  I do not know very much about the position of harbour authorities throughout the country.  I know that some of them were fairly well off, and that some of them were not so well off, but I also know that some of these authorities, <Col N="200" /> that were fairly well off at one time, arc not so well off now.  I am perfectly aware of that.  However, there are certain works done in connection with harbours that do not give a lot of employment. Take such work as dredging and so on.  That costs a great deal of money&mdash;an enormous amount of money, in fact&mdash;but there is not a great deal of labour content in works of that nature.  However, my main objection to this amendment is that it really does not concern local authorities, and that it is the primary concern of the harbour authorities and of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and I do not want to involve them in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked, a few moments ago, about planning, experts, and so on, and then proceeded to show us, by his speech, that there will be no planning whatever. Now, this Bill is described as the Unemployment (Relief Works) Bill. The principal object of the Bill is to provide employment.  We have been told in this House, over and over again, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, that the Government's trouble is not to find the money to finance schemes, but to find schemes of work which it can finance.  Surely, the Minister does not believe for a moment that he is going to convince this House or the country that the Government, even now is prepared to tackle in a serious way this grave question of unemployment when he gets up here and says, in reply to such an amendment as this, that he does not know about that, that it is not a matter for this Bill, that it may be a matter for some other Department, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that that does not show that there has been any deep consideration of this matter, or that it has been treated as a national matter; but rather that it is going to be treated in a piecemeal way.  In other words, it means that for one scheme we must go to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, for another scheme to the Department of Industry and Commerce, for another scheme to the Department of Finance or the Board <Col N="201" /> of Works, and for something else to some other Department.  I suggest to the Minister seriously that, again, he is only tinkering with this whole problem of unemployment and that, if that problem is going to be approached in that particular manner and in that way, then this Bill is going to have just about as much effect on the problem of unemployment as all the other Bills we have had in this House from time to time.  The Minister talked about the very small amount of employment to be given in works connected with harbours, piers, and so on.  He mentioned the large amount of money to be spent and the small labour content in connection with such schemes.  In that connection he mentioned dredging, but the amendment we are now discussing is not concerned with dredging. Dredging is a thing that is done as an ordinary matter of form, and we know that it does not give much employment, but it is work that has to be done. There is nothing, however, about that in the amendment that is now before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that we have a case in Cork where the Harbour Commissioners have to get permission in order to undertake certain work, and at the moment we have a reclamation scheme that is held up mainly because we have not the money to go on with it.  I should like to ask the Minister this question.  Is there any reason why the grants in relief of unemployment should not be used for such a purpose as that?  At the moment, the harbour authorities there are engaged in building quay walls, and they had to get sanction from the corporation to build these walls and to make arrangements for sewerage, and so on.  Is there any reason why these unemployment relief grants could not be expended by the Harbour Board in the manner suggested by Deputy Cosgrave?  I do not see any reason why they should not, if these works are to be of any lasting benefit to the country or to the local authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In reading this Bill, it seems to me that the Minister is interpreting this in the narrowest form, <Col N="202" /> as laid down by the Bill: namely, that a work of public utility means a work consisting of the construction or improvement of a road, sewer, or waterworks, or a work which tends to improve or protect the public health. Apparently the Government fear that there may be some considerable increase in unemployment, and they want to be ready to provide for it.</P>
      <P>The way the Minister has received Deputy Cosgrave's amendment shows that it is to be interpreted in its narrowest sense, and according to the very letter of this Bill.  If there is anything people complain of at present, it is that everything that seems to be nn improvement and to give employment has to be paid for out of the rates.  That, in its turn, reduces employment and the making of improvements by private individuals or local authorities.  There is one thing I notice particularly, and that is, that apparently there is no provision of plots that the working population could cultivate.  If we are going to have any large increase in unemployment, or have to face a position in which people will be left without work, surely one of the most important tests that could be applied is this: &ldquo;Have they done their best for themselves? Are they growing vegetables for their wives and families?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is trade union labour or non-trade union labour, if they try to feed their wives and families, I suggest that would be a very important test of their capacity and honesty.  For a man who can say: &ldquo;I am honestly trying to get work, and cannot get it, but I grow some food for my family and I cannot do anything more,&rdquo; I would certainh have the greatest sympathy.  It seems to me that in a Bill such as this there should be some provision so that such plots could he provided, and even places taken over that could afterwards become public parks.  The principal point I wish to make is that the greatest need now is to get for the minimum expenditure an increase in the real value of the subsistence <Col N="203" /> allowance given to the unemployed. How far that allowance can be increased by their own labour remains to be seen; but it they are cultivating plots, such work would be a kind of half-way bridge between the position of agricultural labourers, who can grow potatoes and vegetables, and city dwellers.  I put it to the Minister that it is a mistake such a provision should be left out of this Bill.  It forms the acid test of the honesty of people who are unemployed and would provide a real contribution to the wages they get.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with the amendment moved by Deputy Cosgrave, but, at the same time, I realise the Minister's point of view.  I suppose the Deputy knows that harbour commissioners come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that the Minister for Local Government has nothing to say to them.  That is the position with regard to the large harbour boards, but there are certain harbours and piers under the control of county councils, which the Minister might consider suitable for work to be done on the lines suggested.  If the amendment were accepted I wonder who is going to pay the local contributions.  As Deputy Cosgrave knows, many of the harbour boards are not paying their way at present.  If the Government is going to pay the whole amount, that is all to the good.  I think many corporations and urban councils would be very reluctant to pay a contribution for the dredging of harbours or work of that kind, because it entails the expenditure of a large amount of money. There are some scheduled harbours in the maritime counties directly under the Board of Works that require a good deal of attention from time to time, but the Board of Works is very reluctant to spend money on them.  If the attention of the Board of Works was directed to the improvement of these harbours a good deal of the money visualised in the Bill could be spent on them.  Before this amendment is disposed of, I suggest that we should deal with amendment No. 5, because the <Col N="204" /> position is that the Minister is right in saying that he has no power to accept an amendment of this kind where harbour commissioners are dealt with by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

We have been repeatedly informed, even recently, by the Minister that the report of the Piers and Harbours Tribunal was being emplemented, and that the Bill was ready for introduction.  Can he say whether, under the terms of that Bill, the ports will come more than they do now under the control of local authorities, and that he has considered the amendment in the light of the passage of such legislation?  There are certain harbours in this State under the direct control of the Board of Works and, as far as I know, it would be quite in order to accept the amendment for the <Col N="205" /> purpose of carrying out the works suggested in the case of these harbours. Is there any difficulty about accepting the terms of the amendment and making them applicable to the relief of unemployment, by carrying out work in harbours under the control of the Board of Works?</P>

I emphasise that this is a machinery Bill.  To do as suggested would mean recasting the whole Bill and bringing that question under the Department of Industry and Commerce.

      <P>I am not in favour of the amendment, for this reason. Many of the harbour boards&mdash;the one that I am concerned with, at all events &mdash;are run quite independently of the public body which will be called upon to put up their proportion of the money necessary to carry out whatever schemes may be propounded by technical experts employed for that purpose.  The board I am concerned with, at all events, is in the happy position of not owing one penny to anybody.  There are few harbour boards in this country&mdash;in these islands, in fact&mdash;which could make that statement.  I do not think it would be right to saddle our ratepayers with an <Col N="206" /> additional burden in order to carry out a scheme of improvements, even in the harbour, where&mdash;as anybody with any connection with harbour work is well aware&mdash;you get a minimum return for the amount expended.  As I take it, the intention of the Bill is to provide maximum work with minimum expenditure. Certainly, if the harbour boards of the country are to be included in this, it will mean that there will be a great deal of expenditure and very little return for it.  All of this work is done by tidal arrangements, as anyone connected with a harbour is aware.  You have got to knock men off when they may not have done more than four or five hours' work and, for this reason, I think it is my duty here to oppose the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very much on the lines of the policy that was in amendment No. 1, that is, with the hope of seeing some result after this money is expended. The Drainage Act of 1928 which the Minister referred to, was worked in <Col N="207" /> certain parts of the country.  This particular amendment would, on the basis of the contribution that the Minister stated on the last day he had given to local authorities, make drainage much more attractive than it is at the moment.  In the same way, had amendment No. 1 been adopted, it would have made reclamation and that sort of work more attractive to harbour boards and they would have been able to do the work without putting any extra tax in the £ on the valuation&mdash;it could have been done out of funds or dues.  In this particular case there were quite a number of drainage schemes in different parts of the country which could not be undertaken by reason of the fact that they were uneconomic.  Taking the estimate of the contribution that is being given by the Minister towards certain works in this country, it would be possible now to do this sort of work and it would be of lasting benefit, it would give considerable employment, it would improve the productivity of the land, it would help to improve the public health of the people, and, generally speaking, it would be very beneficial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment proposed by Deputy Cosgrave, even though I lack any sort of enthusiasm for the Bill. Nevertheless, I would like to see it emerge from this House in its best possible form.  This amendment has very many attractions.  In the first place, it would give to those people&mdash; as far as it applies to local bodies outside Dublin&mdash;who pay the biggest share of the rates, some participation in the benefits that accrue when schemes of this sort are initiated.  Hitherto, most relief schemes have been devoted to sewerage and waterworks, which give very little benefit to the agriculturalist. This would offer an opportunity to give work and initiate schemes directly beneficial to him.  There is a further attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have experience in many counties &mdash;particularly in mine&mdash;of schemes put through the county council under the 1928 Act&mdash;the minor drainage <Col N="208" /> schemes&mdash;and they were in the main very successful.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to works which in other ways would have been uneconomic in the ordinary drainage scheme under the Board of Works.  I have a couple in mind: I quoted one to the Parliamentary Secretary here when the minor drainage scheme lapsed and when we asked that it be renewed.  I know of cases where schemes were initiated and eventually abandoned because, after consideration, they were said to be uneconomic.  Afterwards, they were undertaken by the local county surveyor and completed at less than 50 per cent. of the original estimate, and completed to the satisfaction of everybody concerned.  To my mind it was tragic that that Act should have been allowed to lapse: nothing has been brought in since to supplant it and this would give an opportunity to local bodies to initiate some schemes of the kind.</P>
    <P>There is another attraction in it. Drainage schemes of this kind would be, from the point of view of the intent of the Bill&mdash;unemployment&mdash;probably the most attractive form of all. There is no other kind of scheme which could be initiated&mdash;and I defy any Deputy to prove that&mdash;of any sort or description, be it sewerage, house-building or water works, where the ratio of employment to materials is greater, than in drainage.  Practically the whole of the money spent in drainage goes directly to labour and, purely from the unemployment point of view there is a greater attraction in drain age schemes than in any other form of work.  I think that it would be wise that the amendment be accepted.  I heartily support it.  The Minister rather insinuated, when speaking on the Money Resolution, that it is outside the scope of the Bill, being harbour works and drainage.  If that might be said of the harbour works, we know that it was the definite practice of county councils and other local bodies to undertake schemes of this sort under the Act that has now lapsed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister a while ago, when speaking on the Money Resolution, made a very good case&mdash;<Col N="209" /> accidentally, of course&mdash;for the inclusion of this amendment, when he said there had been undertaken in the country works of very doubtful utility. That is true.  Roads of very doubtful utility have been constructed, and time and again, when the case came before the House here, complaint was made that where the amount of unemployment was greatest there was not work to be done.  The reason was that you were confining yourself to certain types of work on roads and matters of that kind.  Here is a chance for a local authority to step in and do very useful work.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in regard to this amendment, cannot urge the objection which he had to the Port and Docks Board, because here he has the Minor Arterial Drainage Act to go on, an Act which the local authorities have worked in the past.  In this case, therefore, you have tradition and usage.  I do not think we are going to get very far if we are to be circumscribed by the limitations and expressions in those Bills, by the extent to which we may employ people and the type of work that we may employ them on.  The Minister said he understood that the 1928 Minor Arterial Drainage Act was not operated to any great extent.  I imagine the Minister would be greatly surprised if he were to read the evidence that was given before the Drainage Commission by the representatives of the Roscommon County Council.  In their evidence he will find that, in the County Roscommon, we completed between 30 and 40 schemes under that Act.  Every one of them proved to be satisfactory. There were some that we could not put through because they were not, in themselves, economic.  I am not able to say whether, at the moment, the unemployment figures in those localities would warrant the local authority undertaking some of those schemes.  I think, at all events, it ought to be given the chance of undertaking them, and, therefore, I do not see any reason why the Minister should not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appear to be greatly tied down by tradition and usage or, to put it bluntly, by red tape.  As I said on a <Col N="210" /> former occasion, this red tape has been the cause of the downfall of democracy in the world.  If there is some work to be done, let us undertake it and not be tied down by usage or tradition.  I sympathise with the point of view of Deputy Davin, when he asked if it were the Minister's opinion that every Department should bring in a separate Bill to deal with its own unemployment problem.  Of course, it would be ridiculous to do such a thing.  In the Local Government Bill, which is still before the House, it is proposed that at least three Ministers will have authority under it.  If the purpose of this Bill is to provide work for unemployed people, then we should not allow anything to stand in the way of doing that.  If the Minister wants to have something done that will be of benefit to the country, then I submit to him that he ought to permit local authorities to undertake drainage work under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think if the Minister is really serious in his assertions as to the object of this Bill&mdash;that its purpose is to relieve unemployment&mdash; he should not only welcome but accept this amendment.  The local authorities have had experience in the carrying out of drainage work.  As a matter of fact, at the present time the officials of local authorities are carrying out drainage work under minor relief schemes.  They are familiar with all aspects of minor drainage.  Therefore, I think there should be no objection, on the part of the Minister, to the amendment.  Its acceptance will confer a benefit not only on the country generally, but on the local ratepayers who will have to bear a large portion of the expenditure under this measure.</P>

      <P>This is a very important amendment, and I hope the Minister will accept it.  Drainage is badly needed all over the country, and it is a very useful type of work to have unemployed people engaged on.  We are all aware that the drainage of land has been badly neglected, especially arterial drainage, involving a number of people.  Individuals are not in a position to carry out that work.  Therefore, I think the local authorities should be given the power asked for. <Col N="211" /> The expenditure of money on work of this kind will give some return to the country, and hence I hope the Minister will not hesitate to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is genuinely determined to do something really big under this Bill with the object of solving the unemployment problem, then I would urge on him to accept the amendment.  It is patent to everybody who knows the country districts that there is a vast amount of drainage work to be done.  That applies not to one county but to the country generally.  As the Minister is taking power to impose certain duties on local authorities&mdash;I refer to the power to oblige two or three neighbouring local authorities to contribute towards some particular scheme&mdash;I suggest to him that the most suitable form of unemployment schemes that could be undertaken are drainage schemes which would benefit not only the area of one local authority but the areas of several local authorities.  In addition, they would be of permanent value to those localities long after the employment created under the Bill had ceased.  I am not very much in favour of this Bill as a method of dealing with the unemployment problem, because I think it should be dealt with by the central authority rather than by a local authority.  At the same time, I think this amendment, so far as it goes, would, if accepted, do something towards making the Bill a real contribution to the solution of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that this amendment would confer statutory powers on local authorities.  But that is another matter.  It may be, as Deputy Brennan says, that in the County Roscommon the 1928 Minor Drainage Act was availed of to a considerable extent.  The evidence in the Department, however, goes to show that in very many other counties it was not very much availed of, and, as a matter of fact, it was allowed to lapse at the end of five years.  So far as I know, there was no demand from <Col N="212" /> Deputies or others to have the Act revived.  It is felt that the carrying out of drainage work in county areas is not a proper function for a local authority, except, of course, in urban areas where drainage, as a public health matter, has to be attended to. The main objection to the amendment is that a comparatively short time ago a drainage commission sat and took a considerable body of evidence.  I believe that commission has submitted a report which is under consideration. I do not want at this stage to anticipate its findings, even if I desired to accept the amendment.  I think that sufficient useful schemes will be found without introducing drainage schemes at this stage to use up whatever funds we have available to deal with the unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will admit that, while it is not the ordinary function of a local authority to carry out drainage schemes, they have done this work successfully. Neither is it the ordinary function of the local authority to provide for unemployment, but they are being asked to do that.  That is really the purpose of the Bill.  As the Minister has mentioned, we, in County Roscommon, have been carrying out schemes which are of very doubtful utility and suggestions have actually been made regarding the transport of unemployed from one area to another where more useful schemes could be carried out. It seems to me that the Minister and his Department are afraid that these schemes will confer benefit on somebody. I would not be afraid of that. If you can describe a work as a public utility work, it seems to me that, so far as the Minister is concerned, it is all right, but if the proposed work will confer benefit on anybody, then the local authority is not to be allowed to do it.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 15.&mdash;To delete sub-section (1), page 3, and to substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Whenever the Minister is of opinion that, for the purpose of providing employment for unemployed persons, it is expedient that a particular work of public utility consisting of the construction of a new road or the improvement of an existing road or partly of such construction and partly of such improvement should be undertaken and executed by a local authority which is not charged by virtue of Section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), with the construction and maintenance of such road (whether new or existing or partly new and partly existing) or is <Col N="217" /> charged by virtue of the said section with the construction of a portion or portions only of such road, the Minister may, subject to the limitation imposed by this section and after consultation with such local authority and with the council charged by virtue of the said Section 24 with the construction and maintenance of such road or of the portion or portions thereof with the construction and maintenance of which such local authority is not charged as aforesaid (as ths case may he), by order transfer to such local authority from the said council all the powers and duties of the said council under the said Section 24 or any other enactment in relation to the construction and maintenance of such road or the said portion or portions thereof, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7 and I suggest that that amendment and amendments Nos. 8, 10 and 15 be taken together.  On reconsideration, it was thought desirable to transfer the provisions of Section 3 (1) to Section 2 and to provide that whenever the Minister is of opinion that a particular work should be undertaken, he should have power to certify that such work should be undertaken for the purpose of providing employment for unemployed persons in a particular area.  The provisions of Section 3 (1) are included in the first amendment. Section 3 (2) sets out that it shall be the duty of a local authority which is the executing authority in respect of a certified work to execute and complete such work with all reasonable speed. When the Minister certifies a work, it is not necessary to retain the power to require a local authority to undertake the work, and that is being dropped, because the following sub-section says that when work is certified, a local authority shall carry it out with all reasonable speed.  These are really drafting amendments.</P>

So far we have heard nothing as to the financing of the proposals lie has in mind.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest an immediate increase in the rates or can a council borrow the money and spread it over a longer period?  Is it his idea that the scheme he would have in mind would have to be done immediately and the rates in the area increased?  Because if any big scheme were forced on the City of Dublin, it would mean an increase in the rates.  We have a large number of housing schemes at present on which the people are not able to pay the rents now demanded, and the City Manager has informed us that for every 6d. increase in rates, the cottage dwellers and flat dwellers would have to pay a penny extra in rent, although not one of them would get any benefit out of this Bill.  I should like to know if it is the Minister's idea that the rates should go up in order to provide the necessary finances.  The people of the city are not all road workers.  There is a very large proportion of warehousemen, painters, carpenters, and men in other trades unemployed, whose rents would go up as a result of the Bill, and who woldd get no benefit from it.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from that that if a local authority is about to start on a work which may have a high labour content but cannot definitely be said to be started for the purpose of relieving unemployment, it does not come within the operation of the Bill?  It is just a question of what is going to be the definition of the phrase &ldquo;for the purpose of providing employment&rdquo; and whether, in fact, those words should be there at all.  Who is to certify that it is being started for that purpose? A local authority might be starting to work and then this Bill comes along, and they say: &ldquo;We will say that it is for the purpose of providing employment&rdquo; although it may not have been started originally for that purpose. Who is to say that it was, in fact, so started?  There seems to be a danger of complications in that phrase.</P>

      <P>(1)  Whenever the Minister is of opinion that, for the purpose of providing employment for unemployed persons in a particular area, it is expedient that a particular work of public utility which a particular local authority has power by law (including this Act) to execute should be undertaken and executed by that local authority, the Minister may, by order made after consultation with such local authority, require such local authority to undertake and execute the said work, and thereupon it shall be the duty of such local authority to undertake; execute, and complete the said work with all reasonable speed.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 11 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1), page 3, line 18, to add the words &ldquo;Provided always that no such order shall be made by the Minister earlier in any financial year than two months before the date fixed by law for the consideration by the local authority of their estimates for the ensuing financial year and that the local authority shall be deemed to carry out the work with all reasonable speed if the work is carried out within the ensuing financial year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment, which obviously cannot function in its present form, the sub-section to which it is an amendment having gone, is twofold: firstly, that a local authority may have advance knowledge of what it is expected to do.  At present, a local authority very often receives word in November that a certain amount of money will be available before the end of the year for expenditure on relief works, and they submit a list without delay, and so forth.</P>
      <P>That does not give the local authority time to have a proper scheme thought out, and the Minister has told us that this is a planning Bill.  If it is, then the local authority should be given the best possible opportunity of planning a long way ahead what works it is going to do.  That is one object of it, that there should be more time given to the local authority to have its plans ready.  The second object is that the local authority may be able to know in what position it is from a rating point of view.  As the Bill stands at the moment, there is nothing whatever to prevent the Minister, on the day after the rate has been struck, telling the local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), after line 24 and before line 25 to insert the following:&mdash;&ldquo;direct a consulting engineer of not less than five years' standing as a consulting engineer to report to him generally on the merits of the proposed work and on the objections of the local authority, and for that purpose the said consulting engineer may in his discretion hold a public sitting of an inquiry on not more than two days.</P>
      <P>(4) On receiving such report the Minister may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add two new sub-sections as foliows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) On the first occasion where a local authority refuses or in the opinion of the Minister objects to do anything which is declared by this section to be the duty of such local authority, and the said refusal or objection arises out of the opposition of the local authority to the terms and conditions of employment imposed by the Government or any Department of State, the Minister shall cause an inquiry to be held to ascertain the merits of the objection, the estimated costs of the works under the terms and conditions imposed, and the estimated costs under the normal terms and conditions of employment by such local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) One such inquiry into a refusal or objection on the part of a local authority in respect of terms or conditions <Col N="225" /> of employment shall determine such objection or refusal for 12 months.</P>
    <P>Amendment, No. 13 deals almost entirely with that question which has been under consideration for so long&mdash; what is called the rotational scheme. My opinion is that the rotational scheme is immoral; that it is unjust; that it has in it evils the fruits of which we are likely to be reaping for many years to come.  If one desires to give certain moneys out to a large number of people, give them out, but do not interrupt or interfere with either a man's normal economy and the chance of keeping himself in a decent position in society, or with the normal manner in which business is done.  Within the last five years one employer here in this House made the statement that in any place in this country he would know whether the work which was going on was a relief work or whether it was an ordinary normal activity either of a local authority or an individual.  Those are very considerable sums of money, and as far as one can judge it is quite possible that local authorities may, by reason of this measure, undertake certain works which, if it had not been for this emergency, if it had not been for this Bill, and if it had not been for the situation which had been created if not fostered by the Government, they would have got done by men drawing normal wages and giving a normal output for those normal wages. One of the dangers that may quite possibly arise out of this whole business is that the low output which may, be anticipated&mdash;which is almost certain to arise out of this rotational scheme&mdash;may become the standard of work in this country in future, and that would be a deplorable state of affairs for the men involved, for the economy of the State, tor its future prosperity and for the peace, happiness and contentment of the ordinary working people themselves, as well as for everybody else.</P>
    <P>What I am asking in this case is that, in the event of a dispute arising between the Minister and the local authority, a dispute having its roots in an objection to this particular form of <Col N="226" /> employment, a consulting engineer will be called in.  I am not committing myself at all to that particular individual; if a better or a more suitable person can be found I am perfectly satisfied, as long as the principle of the thing is maintained, but it appears to me that a consulting engineer would probably be the best person; an ordinary practising engineer would do.  Let him be called in to give his opinion for the Minister's information and for the information of other Ministers in the State who have unfortunately wedded themselves to this particular form of providing employment.  I should like them to learn from a person qualified to give an opinion what his view is regarding the value of the output in those particular cases.  In my opinion&mdash;I may he wrong, but my opinion is fortified by that of a number of people to whom I have spoken&mdash; you are simply getting value for the money you are spending, and no more; you are not even getting value for it in the sense that if yon were to spend that money on normal wages you would get far better results from the amount involved.</P>
    <P>The other print is a much more important one.  It is a matter which has been the subject of public controversy not of to-day or yesterday.  It is something like 40 years since a man called. I think, Jack London, wrote about this subject.  He made a study of what he called the submersed tenth.  He was particularly anxious, in all the long time during which he gave attention to the subject, to bring before the public the danger that there was to society in keeping a man down beneath the normal standard of living which he should enjoy.  He pointed out, on more than one occasion, that unemployment of itself was an evil, but that when unemployment resulted in a man having to part with the furniture of his house, and so on, he himself deteriorated in health and in character, until a time came when it was not possible to restore that man to an economic position or make him a useful member of society.  It is for those reasons I have put down this amendment, and I should be glad of the Minister's very serious consideration of it.  If he wishes, I <Col N="227" /> am prepared to leave it over until the next stage, but I do think that he ought to examine this matter personally; that he ought to go around and see the result of it, interview people who have had experience of it, and make up his own mind on the subject, because I think, if he does that, some really useful purpose will have been served by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Cosgrave in this matter. When we opposed this scheme, I want the Minister and every member of this House to know that we did not do so in the hope of any personal advantage. We know a good deal about the mentality of the unemployed when they are treated as such.  They feel they are being treated as a class apart in the community, because they are unemployed, when they can get only three or four days a week on a job of that kind.  In order to get some kind of agreement, we are prepared to modify our demand and ask that at least when he is employed he should get a full week or a number of weeks rather, than three days in so many weeks.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that if the Minister and those responsible for it would examine the position they would find there is a good case to be made for it because very often weather is broken and the men on four days a week relief work have to do the four days' work in two weeks.  There is another aspect of the case the Minister should look into.  When men are on four days work a week they have to contribute to the National Health Insurance Fund, Widows' and Orphans' Fund and Unemployment Insurance Fund just the same as the man who is guaranteed 52 weeks' work in the year. That is a hardship.  I would support Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;and I am glad he has come to that viewpoint&mdash;in asking ths Minister to consider that aspect of rotational work.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to intervene now, if he is going to give his views on this question, and tell us what will be the policy of the Department in relation to schemes started under this Bill.  Is it <Col N="228" /> the intention, when this Bill comes into operation, to extend the so-called rotational schemes?  Is it to be extended to all schemes for which grants are given?  If the Minister were to indicate that now, and if he were to make a clear statement to the House in regard to that particular point it might help to shorten the discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this is called a Relief Works Bill, and I assume the conditions attached to other unemployment grants may attach to this.  As I mentioned on the discussion on the Money Resolution, I have not any very definite views one way or the other because I have not had experience of this particular position, but those who have experience of it&mdash; and the Board of Works have had experience of it over a considerable time in the administration of unemployment relief grants&mdash;have given it very full examination, I understand, and their views on this matter are certainly of considerable importance.  The difficulty, of course, with all unemployment relief grants is that you cannot get sufficient money to go round.  It would be a very desirable thing if you could provide every unemployed person with work.  The position is you are not able to do that and, as Deputies know, rotational work is related to the amount of unemployment assistance that is being paid, but, as I pointed out earlier on the Money Resolution, in no case is it under 30 per cent.  I believe that similar conditions will attach to relief grants.</P>

    <P>In regard to the other amendment in Deputy Cosgrave's name, I understand what he means is that where a board are refusing to carry out the work on account of conditions imposed on them in regard to this rotational labour, some outside engineer should hold an inquiry.  That is not possible, because if you want to bring in an outside engineer, and to vest him with the statutory powers that he would require in order to send for papers and witnesses and to hold an inquiry, you would have to send him before the Civil Service Commission and have him appointed as an inspector.  That is a matter that could he got over in some other way if it was desirable, but I do <Col N="229" /> not think it is.  However, as I said, my experience in regard to rotational schemes is very short, but I can rely on the experience of the Board of Works and other Departments concerned in these relief grants and of my own Department, too, that it is the best we can do in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I fail to see in either of the amendments before the House any direct reference to rotational schemes.  The matter was discussed during the Second Stage of this Bill.  It arose again on the Money Resolution.  Deputy Cosgrave did, I understand, raise the matter subsequently, and Deputy Hickey referred to it briefly.  It seems to be irrelevant. However, as it has been raised, I shall hear the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave explained that, to his mind, and, I think, to the mind of those members of the House who are members of local authorities, one of the principal bones of contention between local authorities and the Department is very likely to be this question of the conditions of employment under these various schemes, particularly schemes which may be imposed by the Department on local authorities.  I was inclined to be a strong supporter of this Bill.  That is the reason I wanted to get a clear statement.  The Minister certainly has given me a shock.  The Minister quite rightly said that in his present Ministerial position he has not had much time in which to get to understand this question of rotational work and its effect upon the unemployed, but he was quite satisfied that it was all right because it satisfied the officials of the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should acquaint himself with this problem and with the position that arises from the enforcement of rotational work.  I want to suggest to him that he is not only Minister for Local Government but also Minister for Public Health.  On the discussion on <Col N="230" /> the Money Resolution the Minister mentioned&mdash;I do not know whether he intended it to be taken seriously or not &mdash;that one of the reasons why men could not or would not be given a full week's work was because, having been unemployed for a certain time, they were weakened and would not be able to complete a week's work.  That is the first time I have heard that excuse in defence of this rotational work either inside or outside this House.  I am sure the Minister did not mean that seriously.  I hope he did not, but, if he did mean it seriously, and if the Minister is satisfied that the health of the unemployed has been so reduced and their physique so undermined that they would not be capable of completing a full week's work, does the Minister suggest seriously that that health and physique are likely to be built up by the wages which they will get under the rotational scheme?  The Minister talks about 30 per cent., and so on.  Let us take an actual case.  Take two men in any part of the country you like, living side by side, both of them unemployed, both in receipt of unemployment assistance, both of them getting the maximum amount, 14/- a week. One man gets a card from the employment exchange and he is sent out to do, let us say, four days' hard work in a quarry.  At the end of the week&mdash;or maybe, as it happens with certain local authorities&mdash;at the end of three weeks, he gets £1, less 1/5, in other words, he gets 18/7; and the man who does not do any work because he cannot get any work, gets 14/-.  That is the sort of scheme that the Government seem to be satisfied is the best that can be provided.</P>
    <P>The rotational system is to be applied to the schemes which will be set going under this Bill.  There will be huge schemes put into operation, waterworks schemes and other schemes of public utility.  Deputy Cosgrave very properly pointed to the return which is likely to be got for the money expended with that system in vogue. Apart from the question of the men employed, is it desirable, in the interest of the work itself, that the men should be changed every three or four days?  Just at the time when the <Col N="231" /> men are getting to know the work, getting an idea how it should be done, when they have got their hands in, so to speak, and are able to give the best return, they are summarily dismissed and a new batch of recruits brought in. In these circumstances the Minister expects to get a good return.  He may be satisfied with the views of the Board of Works in regard to rotational work, but has he got the views of any employer or body of employers in this country, has he got the views of any local authority, of the unemployed, or any trades union?  Will the Minister point to one body representing the employers, the trade unions, or one organisation of the unemployed that has ever given its blessing to the rotational scheme?</P>
    <P>I will even go further.  I think the system, has been condemned in the most wholesale way by every person concerned with it, by every organisation in this country connected with employment, private or public.  Nobody, either, inside or outside the House, so far as I know, has been found to say a good word for it, except the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I know the Minister is a busy man and he has a big Department to deal with, but I suggest it would be worth his while to make inquiries among those who have practical expetience of this scheme, people who will be in a position to give first-hand information and he will be able to satisfy himself, I am sure, that there is nothing to be said for it.  It would seem that you can give a man only four days in two weeks, or eight days in a month.  I would prefer if you gave him six days, one full week, in that month, and I believe the man himself and everybody else concerned would prefer that.  It is no use saying that it is a help to those who are unemployed to be given the privilege of working on this rotational system or any scheme. It is not a help to them, and it is not looked upon as a help by the unemployed. I think any employer or any representative body of employers, any trades union or group of workers, will be prepared to tell the Minister what I have told him.</P>

      <P>I desire to support this amendment, but I do so without any great enthusiasm.  I support it for the reason that it appears to limit the powers of the Minister, to some extent, in relation to the suppression of local authorities.  It seeks to set, up some sort of inquiry before which the local authority may appear and state their objections to carrying out the work required. I believe that while the rotational system is one very strong objection which the local authority may raise, there is another objection which they might wish to put before the inquiry, and that is that the cost of the work would be too heavy on the ratepayers of the particular area.  For that reason, some sort of inquiry, would bo welcome, although I am afraid, constituted in the manner outlined in this amendment, it would hardly be satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are being discussed together.  Amendment No. 14 seeks to give the local authority the right to offer an objection if it is being asked to carry out any scheme of work on terms or under conditions which appear to that local authority to be onerous or unfair.  Unless we are going to get away entirely from local government and disarm local authorities in respect of any powers which they have, I cannot see on what grounds the Minister can refuse to accept amendment No. 14.  While we go very near banishing local authorities generally by the introduction of the county management system, and depriving popularly-elected local authorities of the functions which, up to- now, they have exercised, and which similar bodies exercise extensively in Britain without any serious dislocation of municipal and other local administration there, I think by the enactment of this measure we are going further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 3 the Minister has power to decide the work to be carried out and, no matter how crazy may he the Minister's notions, no matter how ill-advised, he still has power to compel the local authorities to proceed <Col N="234" /> with the work.  Amendment No. 13 endeavours to enable the local authority to present its point of view to an independent engineer.  I cannot see any legitimate reason why the Minister will not accept it.  It ensures that a local authority will have a voice in directing public attention to its position undar any scheme of work that may be proposed.  If there is no substance in the objection, it can be overruled by an intelligent engineer.  If there is a valid objection to a scheme, a local authority is entitled to direct public attention to that, fact, possibly in such a way as to induce the Minister to abandon the scheme.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 seeks to ensure that the local authority will have some say in regard to the terms and conditions undar which the work will be carried out.  The Minister may avail of this measure to compel local authorities to apply generally the notorious rotational schemes which are causing so much dissatisfaction up and down the country.  The people in the Board of Works, who occasionally, and only occasionally, go through the country, do not hear very much about the views of local authorities and citizens generally on these schemes of rotational employment.</P>
    <P>Everybody who is living with his ears open knows perfectly well that up and down the country, as has been stated in the House already, there is strong complaint and there has been complaint for the last two years, in regard to the unsatisfactory scheme of rotational employment&mdash;a scheme under which a man is employed for a sufficient period each week just to give him a wage slightly better, and only slightly better, than he would get if he were signing for unemployment assistance benefit at the employment exchange.  The Minister's attempt to defend the scheme on the ground that you cannot expect these men to have sufficient strength to work a whole week is an appalling commentary on the promises made to the unemployed in other years.  We have now allowed them to reach such a state of deterioration that we dare not ask them to work <Col N="235" /> a whole week lest we put too much of a strain upon them.  Before putting forward a contention of that sort, the Minister might well have recourse to some introspection by which he might arrive at some appreciation of the condition into which the unemployed have been allowed to degenerate.  Whilst I want to see that a local authority is compelled to carry out progressive work and to see that important schemes are not held up through any caprice on the part of a local authority, at the same time, if we are to preserve the elements of local government in this country, I think we should at least give local authorities an opportunity of saying at a public inquiry why they object to the terms and conditions under which a scheme is being carried out.  In that way they will be enabled to focus public attention on the matter and the public will be able to judge whether they are asked to do something which they consider unfair.  I think the Minister ought to accept these amendments.  They cannot be regarded as imposing an unreasonably onerous obligation on his Department or one that would make administration difficult.  The Minister's refusal to accept the amendments can only be interpreted as an indication that he and his Department wish to compel local authorities to carry out schemes of work no matter how unsatisfactory or unfavourable the conditions are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>When I referred, in the course of my observations, to the merits of these two amendments, I did not advert at all to sub-section (3) of Section 3, in which reference is made to Section 72 of the Act of 1925.  Under that section, the Minister may hold an inquiry into the affairs of any local authority which he considers has not been doing its duty and, if on investigation the local authority cannot establish a convincing case, the Minister is at liberty to dissolve it.  I presume that in practically all cases the percentage of moneys involved, in relation to the expenditure of public authorities, is very much the same, but the Minister mentioned two bodies here the other night&mdash;the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Corporation.  I presume <Col N="236" /> that one might take either of these bodies as being fairly representative of the country as a whole.  The Minister told us that in the case of Dublin, the Department gave a sum of £60,000 for works and that he expected the municipal council to contribute £20,000, which they did.  The entire sum involved, therefore, was £80,000.  Let us assume that it is double that sum, £160,000, that the Minister wants the council to do that work and the council either refuses, or in the opinion of the Minister fails to do anything that is declared by the section to be the duty of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Normally the municipal council receives and expends something like ten times that amount of money.  Its expenditure is in the neighbourhood of £2,000,000.  That was their responsibility before the introduction of this Bill; that was what they were elected for, and if the Minister were not satisfied that they were doing their duty, he could inquire into the matter and decide on the merits of the case whether the council should be dissolved. Now, for something which the council were never elected, and in which a very much smaller sum is involved, the Minister may, without any inquiry, dissolve the local authority. There does not appear to be anything on the face of it to justify that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in the hope that we might get some middle course which in essence would not restrict the Minister's power and which would not interfere with him in getting work done, that we put down these two amendments.  It is the desire of everybody that the relations between the Minister's Department and local authorities should be cordial and helpful, that there should be a spirit of co-operation between them and that they should share the general desire to improve conditions all over the country.  Certainly, as far as the local authorities are concerned, as far as one can see, that is their desire.  It cannot be said, of course, that they have all the virtues and none of the vices, but nobody who knows anything about the Minister's Department for the last ten years would <Col N="237" /> accuse it of possessing all the virtues and none of the vices.  The Department are responsible for shaping the enactments that are going to be the law of the land, and it is our duty to see, as far as in us lies, that such laws are just towards everybody so that they will have general acceptance by the people of the country.</P>
    <P>The section as it stands does not appear to be justified by the circumstances. I remember when the original section was introduced here, and indeed long after it passed into law, all the criticism it encountered&mdash;talk about bureaucracy and autocracy, about unfairness and about the sufferings of the dissolved bodies.  At any rate, they were tried on their merits, and were given a fair chance of making their case before being dissolved. Here no such opportunity is afforded them.  Not only that, but they are going to be wiped out now, not for any failure to discharge the duties which they were elected to perform, but because they will not fall in with the present scheme.  As I have said, a scheme to extend the rotational system could not commend itself to anybody outside the institution which has been mentioned here.  It would not even commend itself to anybody in that institution, except so far as official pronouncements are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendments as I think they are very reasonable amendments.  They do not interfere with the Minister's powers to such an extent that he need be afraid to accept them.  It is worthy of note that almost every Bill introduced by the Local Government Department since the last general election has had for its object the taking away of authority from local councils.  I think that is quite apparent to everybody.  We have had the County Management Bill, which is now an Act.  Under that Bill considerable powers have been taken from local authorities and transferred to managers.  That Bill was debated for a considerable time in this House and, during the discussions on the Bill, it <Col N="238" /> was pointed out on various occasions that the local authorities, even after the County Management Bill would become law, would have complete control over all finances.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the present Bill takes away that control from local authorities, because any reluctance that a local authority will have to carry out a scheme outlined and directed by the Ministry will be dictated by their financial commitments.  Therefore, I say that this Bill removes what the Minister contended was retained by the local authorities under the County Management Act.  Surely a local authority, elected by the people in the same manner as we were elected, are entitled to have some point of view in so far as schemes visualised by the Minister are concerned.  If they think that it is not wise in the interests of the people whom they represent in a particular area that a certain scheme should be put into operation, that it would cost the local ratepayers too much, surely they are entitled to have an inquiry held and let the people whom they represent know, through the medium of a public inquiry, why they did not put into operation a scheme which they were directed to put into operation by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rotational employment, that matter has been debated here repeatedly.  The Minister put forward to-day a very novel reason for the continuance of rotational employment when he stated that it is because of the fact that men who have been idle for a long time would not be equal to the strain which would be placed upon them if they were given a week's work instead of three days' work.  I suggest that the reason very definitely is that the Ministry are able to get two stamps for a week's work under rotational employment, instead of one stamp if men were given a full week's work.  The Minister stated that under the three days' scheme the greatest good was done to the greatest number. Again, I contest that, because for every new scheme, of rotational work which starts, even though there are two or three schemes inside a period of six months, the men are taken from the <Col N="239" /> top of the list, and the list is very seldom exhausted in any area in any part of the country.  Therefore, it is nonsense to say that the greatest good is done to the greatest number under the rotational scheme.  It is a scheme, as various Deputies pointed out, which has been condemned by employers, workers and local authorities, indeed by everybody.  It would he interesting if a Government inquiry was set up to get the views of the people interested in that matter, the people who have to pay the piper, and the workers who are employed.  It would be very interesting if an inquiry were held into the workings of the rotational system.  I am sure the Minister's eyes would be opened and that he would have to find some other excuse for keeping it in operation any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the question of the rotational scheme, as you, Sir, have ruled that it is not relevant.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave about the power to abolish local authorities without any inquiry, this is an emergency measure.  It is a measure proposed to this House to deal with an emergency situation, and it will only remain in existence for two years after that emergency has passed, that is, in order to complete any schemes that may have been undertaken before that. Under this Bill certain statutory duties are being cast on local authorities. This is an emergency measure and the Act of 1925 was of a permanent character and not arising out of an emergency. I do not expect that under this Bill there will be any abolition of local authorities&mdash;I hope there will not, and I do not see any necessity for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I expect under this Bill is that schemes will come up from the <Col N="240" /> local authorities themselves and that it is on their recommendation the Minister and the Department will act; that they will be the initiators of schemes and put them forward.  The Department will not go down to Kerry or even to Kildare or other places except to get information when there is something very necessary that is not being undertaken by the local authority; in other words, that the local authority are not doing the job they were elected to do.  I do not think you will have any intermeddling by the Local Government Department. Incidentally I may say that I always regret when suspicion is cast on local government officials.  I think they are doing their best in a difficult situation and doing their job very well.  Also, I do not like to see people attacked who cannot defend themselves.  That is how I hope this Bill will work&mdash;that the initiation of the schemes will come almost entirely from local bodies who are anxious to put up good, constructive and planned schemes, and that when the schemes are put before the Department they will be sanctioned and the necessary grant allocated.  I do not see that there is anything to be alarmed about, that there will be wholesale wiping out of councils.  It is not true to say that the managerial system was started since the last election.  The managerial system was started a good many years ago in a small way and developed from various county boroughs.  It was only to bring the managerial system into line with the county boroughs that the County Management Act was passed.</P>

Everywhere in this section that a local authority is referred to, it is referred to as if the local authority concerned were going to carry out this work, and I take it that, in the main, that will be so; but is there anything to prevent a private contractor, where he has specialised plant or some peculiar advantage, from carrying out work of the kind that is carried out by a private contractor?  In other words, can it be done by a private contractor?</P>

      <P>I understand that the main object of this section is to enable the Minister to suppress any local authority which fails to carry out any works that he may think desirable.  The Minister expressed the hope that works will be initiated by local authorities, but in the Bill there is a definite provision that the Minister may initiate such works, and a previous sub-section gives him power to certify works which, in his opinion, will relieve unemployment.  That power is altogether too far reaching, because, it means, in effect, that if he thinks it necessary, the Minister can compel a local authority to undertake work which may have the effect of increasing the rates in a county by 50 per cent. The Minister could certify that the improvement of county roads is work for the relief of unemployment and might order that they should be widened or resurfaced.  That is possible under the section, and, if it happened, a crushing burden might be imposed upon a local authority.  In amendments it was sought to give local authorities an opportunity of stating their case against having certain works certified, and of being suppressed if they failed to carry them out.  As the amendments were defeated the Minister has thereby deprived local authorities of all power of stating their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lowest criminal in this State has the right to appear before a tribunal if he is accused of any offence, but under this Bill local authorities are being treated worse than the lowest criminal.  There is no appeal to any tribunal.  They are simply going to be wiped out if they fail to carry out works which may result in injustice to the ratepayers.  I believe the effect of this section will be to put an end for all time to local government, because no body of decent citizens will be prepared to act upon local bodies under the conditions imposed upon them by the Bill.  In the present state of the country I think this section a criminal <Col N="244" /> one in as much as it inflicts an injustice on local authorities and the people they represent.  At a later stage the Minister should devise some means of improving or amending the section.  It may be stated, and probably will be stated by the Minister, that the State is making a contribution to certain works, which may be denned under the Bill as works of utility, but the fact remains that the State will not be contributing to all the works that local authorities may be compelled to undertake.</P>
    <P>As the law stands the State contributes very little towards the maintenance and improvement of county roads, and the improvement of these roads will undoubtedly suggest itself to the Department as a means of relieving unemployment. The Minister cannot be described as being impartial when it is a question of choosing between works towards which the State will contribute part of the cost and works where local authorities will have to bear the entire amount.  We can rest assured that the Minister will select a type of work of which local ratepayers will have to bear the entire cost.  For that reason I am against this section, as I believe it is inflicting a grave injustice upon local authorities.</P>

      <P>In moving the Second Reading of the Bill the Minister gave me the impression that it was brought forward for the purpose of making some attempt to find a solution of the unemployment problem, as well as carrying out useful and necessary works.  He certainly gave me the impression that plans for carrying out euch works were being prepared, if they were not already prepared, by his Department, but when he spoke prior to the recent Division he surprised me by his suggestion that the schemes to be carried out under this measure would have to be initiated by local authorities.  I wonder what is the position?  A rising out of that statement, and on the assumption that it will be the duty of local authorities to initiate schemes, may I ask if, in the preparation and presentation of schemes to the Department, the local authorities express the opinion that it should be part and parcel of these <Col N="245" /> schemes to provide six days' work for the men employed, will the Department sanction such a proposal?</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the Local Government Department refuse to sanction that proposal and the local authority still maintains the right&mdash;as I believe they have a right, seeing that they will have the responsibility of paying portion of the cost&mdash;and insist on making it a condition of the carrying out of this scheme that the workers will be paid a full week's work, will that be a good cause for the Minister for Local Government to abolish the local authority concerned?  I want an answer to that question.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1), page 3, and to substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Whenever the Minister is of opinion that, for the purpose of providing employment for unemployed persons, it is expedient that a particular work of public utility consisting of the construction of a new road or the improvement of an existing road or partly of such construction and partly of such improvement should be undertaken and executed by a local authority which is not charged by virtue of Section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), with the construction and maintenance of such road (whether new or existing or partly new and partly existing) or is <Col N="247" /> charged by virtue of the said section with the construction of a portion or portions only of such road, the Minister may, subject to the limitation imposed by this section and after consultation with snch local authority and with the council charged by virtue of the said Section 24 with the construction and maintenance of such road or of the portion or portions thereof with the construction and maintenance of which such local authority is not charged as aforesaid (as the case may be), by order transfer to such local authority from the said council all the powers and duties of the said council under the said Section 24 or any other enactment in relation to the construction and maintenance of such road or the said portion or portions thereof, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to recast the provisions of Section 4, sub-section (1). The only difference between this and the section as it stands in the Bill is that it provides for previous consultation between the two bodies concerned. That is, where one local authority wants to do a work in an adjacent local authority's area, the Minister shall provide for consultation with the two local authorities before determining who is to be the executing authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I put before the Minister the point of view of the construction of the amendment.  I take it that the object of the amendment is to transfer to a local authority who is not at the present time in charge of the maintenance of a particular road, the maintenance of that particular road and to do that by giving him the powers and duties under Section 24 of the Local Government Act of 1925.  As the Minister is aware, the maintenance of the roads of this country is dealt with in a separate part&mdash;Part III&mdash;of <Col N="248" /> the Local Government Act of 1925. Section 24 is more concerned with the duties than with the powers of the local authority in relation to roads, and the powers are only to a limited extent dealt with in Section 24.  I will give the Minister an instance of what I mean.  Take the power to acquire road material and to enter on land for that purpose.  That is dealt with in Section 32 of the 1925 Act&mdash;also in Part III.  Is the Minister of the opinion now, on the construction of that section, that the local authority to whom the charge of these roads is transferred would have power to enter on land and take materials under Section 32 of the 1925 Act?  The Minister will see that the particular sentence in question is, &ldquo;all the powers and duties of the said council under the said Section 24 or any other enactment,&rdquo; which may be interpreted as meaning that the new authority taking over the new right to look after roads could be confined to any statute powers or duties, so far as the Act of 1925 is concerned, referred to in Section 24.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some clarification of this matter.  Sub-section (3) of Section 4 stands unamended. It makes provision for the transferring of certain works from, say, X to Y.  Sub-section (4) says that any expenses incurred in relation to any road so transferred will be raised and charged as if such roads were situate in such county or other borough.  Suppose the work is situate in X and is transferred by the Minister to Y for the purposes of execution, is Y&mdash;the executing authority&mdash;to raise the money, if there is money to be raised for the execution of the money in X? It does not confer any benefit on Y as it is situate in X.  Nevertheless, Y, as the executing authority, is the only authority that can raise the money, according to the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Y surely would not undertake the work unless it would suit work in its own area.  It is like the Dublin Corporation in the County of Dublin.  The Dublin Corporation may wish to carry out schemes of their own, part of which may be outside the corporation boundary, in the county, and may carry out that work by borrowing or grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  Suppose the Dublin Corporation raise the money by borrowing for this work, situate partly in the County of Dublin, the county conucil apparently cannot raise any money for it under that sub-section, to defray any cost, or make any grant towards it.  There is no provision for doing so.  The section means that, if the Dublin Corporation is the executive authority, the Dublin Corporation and it alone can raise the money for the purpose of meeting the expenses. That is the way sub-section (4) reads, to my mind.</P>

      <P>On behalf of <Col N="254" /> Deputy Cosgrave I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) The maximum additional annual rate charged on an area by virtue of this section shall not exceed fourpence in the pound and the additional rate shall not be struck for a longer period than three separate years.</P>
      <P>The amendment more or less speaks for itself.  I do not know what view the Minister takes of it.  It limits the rate that can be struck to 4d. in the pound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept an amendment that would put a limit of 4d. in the pound, although I think it is unusual that a rate should amount to that.  If a very big expenditure has to be incurred and a loan raised, the usual practice with local authorities is to borrow.  I do not think we should limit ourselves to 4d. in the pound.</P>

      <P>In the case of certain local authorities, if they had to raise not a very big amount by way of loan, it would mean more than 4d. in the pound on the rates in their areas.  I take it that the object of the amendment is to try and clip the Minister's wings so far as the schemes which he may impose on local authorities are concerned.  I have in mind one local authority that has a scheme in contemplation.  They hope to get it accelerated when this Bill becomes law.  If that local authority were to borrow the money necessary to finance the scheme, it would mean an addition to the rates, not of 4d. in the pound, but 1/4.</P>

      <P>I think it is clear from the wording of paragraph (d) of sub-section (2) that the rate may be struck on a very small area.  As I read it, an additional rate may be struck on a particular townland, if only the townland is benefiting&mdash;that it may be charged on such area as the Minister shall direct.  Suppose a county council is carrying out a scheme under the jurisdiction of another county council, it is only the area of the second county council, the non-executive county council, that benefits that is to be charged.  What this amendment provides is that nothing higher than 4d. in the pound shall ever be imposed in respect of such charges.</P>

Allowing for the grants which they will receive, the scheme will involve a charge of about 1/4 in the £ for 30 years for repayment of the loan.  The local authority are anxious to take advantage of another section of this Bill for the acquisition of a site for the outfall works of their proposed sewerage scheme.  I should <Col N="256" /> like to know, if this amendment be carried, if that local authority or any other local authority similarly situate will be precluded from the benefit of the other section of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that if a person does not accept the sum offered which the arbitrator holds is sufficient, he should not get interest on it.  It is very hard for a person to know what is the value of his land, or what the arbitrator will decide, and the suggestion in this amendment is that the arbitrator should have discretion.  If he thinks a person was altogether unreasonable, he may make an order withholding interest, but if he thinks that, in all the circumstances of the case, the opposition was not unreasonable, <Col N="267" /> he should be entitled to give the man interest, because interest should go with the principal, and it is really penalising a person because of a mere error of judgment.

      <P>I think amendment No. 39 covers this, but I just want to see if they are quite the same.  I think the difference between the two is that the Minister's amendment seems to apply only to interest on the amount of compensation, whereas Deputy Cosgrave's amendment No. 40, which I have moved on his behalf, deals with a compensation award including interest, and provides that both the principal and interest may be recovered as a simple contract debt.  Amendment No. 30 admits only of interest being recovered in that way.  What is the reason for differentiating between principal and interest in the method of recovery? Will the Minister not accept amendment No. 40?</P>

      <P>This deals with the question of betterment.  It is taken from the Town and Regional Planning Act.  Deputy Cosgrave raised it here on the Second Reading, and said that where the executing authority got more than the work actually cost, the money should go to the person from whom the land was acquired.  The position is that the person from whom the land was acquired retains up to 25 per cent. of the betterment.  Deputy Cosgrave wanted to argue that he should get any additional over that if there is a surplus for the executing authority. That seems unreasonable.  He does pretty well, in any case, when he gets up to 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>As far as my examination of the Town Planning Act is concerned, I think the person whose property underwent a scheme of betterment was chargeable only with three-fourths of the cost.  As this sub-section is drawn, a person may be called upon to be liable for a sum in excess of the cost of improving the place, and it was anticipated that there may be a surplus.  It seems difficult in understand how there ran be a surplus when the person is chargeable with only three-fourths of whatever improvement has taken place.  To that extent, I think it will complicate the <Col N="270" /> administration of this particular section if that is allowed to remain in.</P>

I presume that the Minister does think it is a practicable scheme, or he would not have incorporated it in this Bill.  I just want to know whether there is any practical experience in the matter?</P>

      <P>(1)  Where the whole or any part of any land acquired for any purpose under this Act is at any time not required for such purpose by the local authority by whom it was acquired, such local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, either use such land for any other purpose connected with their powers and duties, or, sell or let by public auction or private treaty in one or more lots, such whole or part (as the case may be).</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 30, after the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; where it first occurs to insert the words:&mdash;&ldquo;offer same to the former owner at the same rateable or acreable price paid to him or, if he is unwilling to repurchase such whole or part, as the case may be,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, any land which has been acquired by the local authority for a particular purpose, and which is not required, has to be sold by public auction or otherwise with the consent of the Minister.  I am proposing that in all cases where land which has been acquired is not required, the person from whom it was acquired should have the option of repurchasing it at the price paid by the local authority.  That appears to be quite reasonable.  We will assume that six acres are taken from somebody, and the local authority finds that it requires only three.  It has paid, let us say, six times £x for the land. Under the amendment, the person who formerly owned the land would be entitled to get his three acres back for three times £x.  While it is an unwritten rule that a local authority having property to dispose of puts it up for sale and receives tenders for it, it does seem that, in a case where land is taken from an individual for a particular purpose, and then the local authority finds it does not require all <Col N="272" /> the land, it is no great concession to the former owner to offer it to him at the price paid by the local authority.</P>

      <P>I could see that in the case where land is taken from a farmer for labourers' cottages, and where there is a surplus, the ground is given back to the farmer, but in connection with cases of the sort which were mentioned by Deputy Benson and others, such as ring roads, if the local authority acquire land in a particular area they are going to add to the amenities of the place and give it a much greater value, and if the local authority, by the works they carry out, increase the value of land, it is very unfair that they should hand it back to the person for what they paid for it. It is for the local authority to let it at the best price they can because it is they who have enhanced and increased the value of the land.  It is very different from the case of the farmer and the labourers' cottages.</P>

There is no use in telling me that a man who has property which is acquired gets a fair price from the local authority.  He does not.  We will assume it was part of a business premises and that a particular site is not needed.  It would be, I suppose, an exaggeration to say that the local authority went in under false pretences to get something that they did not require, and cannot use.  Are we to take it then that a local authority, in order to make money, will take more than it requires, will improve the place and then put it up for sale and get a far higher price than they paid for it?  It does not appear to be just.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, <Col N="275" /> 1940, be now read a Second Time.  The principal provisions of this Bill are contained in Sections 2, 3 and 4.  These sections, respectively, provide additional advances to the Electricity Supply Board to cover its estimated capital requirements to the 31st March, 1942, confirm that the board has power to erect electric generating stations, using peat as fuel, and make provision for the investment of the board's reserves.</P>
      <P>Section 2 amends Section 5 (1) of the Liffey Reservoir Act of 1936, so as to raise the limit of advances to the board, as authorised by Section 3 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act of 1931, from £6,259,000 to £10,259,000.  The purposes for which the additional £4,000,000 are required have been detailed in the memorandum which I have circulated.  It will be noted that among these is the erection of a peat-fuelled generating station near Portarlington and adjacent to the Clonsast Bog, against which a sum of £800,000 is provided. Some doubts have been expressed as to the board's powers under existing statutes to erect such a station.  Section 3 of the Bill clarifies the position in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting again to Section 2, the additional advances proposed include a sum of £280,000 in respect of the estimated increased cost of the Liffey hydro-electric scheme, making the cost of that scheme £784,690, as against £503,350 originally intended.  This increase is due mainly to the enlargement of the generating plant, which is now to be 34 M.W. instead of 23 M.W. as originally budgeted for.  Owing to the accelerating rate of increase in the load development as compared with the assumptions upon which the experts' report of 1935 was based, it was decided to instal two sets of 15 M.W. each at Poulaphouca Falls in addition to the 4 M.W. set at Golden Falls. This increase in the size of the generating plant, it is expected, will eventually result in some saving in the total steam plant capacity requirements.  It is understood also that it renders the Liffey installation more valuable as a peak load station.  Apart from the increase <Col N="276" /> in the capacity of the plant, however, the cost of materials and other electrical equipment has risen, and there has also been a rise in labour costs.  According to the information supplied by the Board, the increases are applicable, broadly, to the following sections of work.  First of all, the cost of the dam at Poulaphouca, for which the original estimate was £232,050, has gone up to £320,450, an increase of £88,400.  The cost of the bridges, which are to replace those which have been submerged or otherwise destroyed, has gone up from £79,600 to £110,190, an increase of £30,590.  The mechanical equipment on Poulaphouca Dam, which was to cost £19,650, is, in fact, expected to cost £38,190, or £18,540 more than was originally provided for.  The cost of roads in the reservoir area has increased from £12,300 to £18,360, and the provision for the mechanical and electrical equipment of stations and for transmission lines and other plant has had to be increased from £159,750 to £297,500, an increase of £137,750, making a total increase of £281,000, which has been rounded off to £280,000.</P>
    <P>The remaining capital items of importance included in the financial provision which the Bill proposes include an additional 20 M.W. set at the Pigeon House, an increase in transformer capacity at Ardnacrusha, new 110 K.V. lines between Dublin and Cork, via Waterford, and Carrick-on-Shannon to Dundalk, together with new 110 K.V. stations at Waterford and Dundalk. The bulk of this work has already been completed.  Expenditure has also been incurred on the 38 K.V. and the 10 K.V. system, strengthening mains and extending stations to handle the increase in load and on new high tension substations and mains.  Owing to the continued growth in the number of consumers, provision is also being made for a substantial sum for extensions to consumers and for the development of new areas.  The sum of £4,000,000 includes, in addition, provision for the increased actual cost of works which were provided for in previous legislation, in those cases in which, owing to rises in cost of materials and labour, the original estimates have been exceeded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> In justification of the considerable increase in capital expenditure by the board, I may point out that the number of units sold has risen from 187,015,590 in 1935-36 to 318,551,656 in 1939-40, and the revenue from the sales of energy has likewise risen from £1,429,888 in 1935-36 to £1,946,310 in 1939-40.  Over this period the board has been able to make adequate provision for depreciation, and last year commenced to repay to the Minister for Finance the advances which it secured from the Exchequer.  The expansion in the number of consumers and their demands are being well maintained, even in the present difficult period.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill, as I have already mentioned, is designed to give the board power to invest its reserve funds in such securities as the Minister for Finance may approve from time to time.  As matters stand, the board has no powers in this regard, and it is desirable that permanent statutory provision should be made for the reserve investment.</P>
    <P>Section 5 proposes to amend sub-section (1) of Section 98 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.  The sub-section in question empowers the board to lop or cut trees, as may be necessary for the proper maintenance of a supply line already erected.  The board has made representations that it should have the power to lop or cut trees during the survey, erection or laying of lines.  The proposed amendment will give this power, accordingly, and, it is hoped, will enable the board to carry out its overhead transmission and distribution programme more efficiently.</P>
    <P>We may now turn to Section 3 of the Bill.  This section provides for the erection of electric generating stations designed for using peat as fuel.  The idea of using peat fuel to generate electrical energy is not by any means a new one.  The late Sir John Griffith planned to use his bog at Turraun as a source of electric power for distribution in the Offaly district.  The coming of the Shannon scheme ended this project; but, nevertheless, a small power station was erected in Turraun about 20 years ago, and to-day it is <Col N="278" /> still giving efficient service and supplying sufficient power to operate the machinery and plant at the Turraun bog.</P>
    <P>In 1918 the Irish Peat Inquiry Committee, set up by the British Government under the auspices of the Fuel Research Board, carried out very extensive investigations into the turf resources of this country.  The committee came to the conclusion &ldquo;that peat may be won in Ireland on a scale which would warrant the establishment of electrical power stations at one or more of the most favourably situated bogs.&rdquo;  They recommended <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>(1)  &ldquo;That the State purchase a large bog so that full control may be obtained over the whole area for drainage, transport and transmission purposes, the aim being to allow of the winning of at least 100,000 tons of air-dried peat per season.</P>
    <P>(2)  That an authority, endowed with necessary powers, be set up to take charge of and administer the scheme, together with the experimental investigations involved.</P>
    <P>(3)  That systematic drainage of the bog be carried out, so as to render it fit for peat winning and agriculture.</P>
    <P>(4)  That different types of electrically driven peat-winning machines and labour-aiding appliances, for loading and conveying, be obtained and employed under working conditions to determine which is the best for work on a large scale in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To-day these recommendations are being put into effect.  In 1919 a Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland was established by Dáil Éireann.  This commission set up a committee under the chairmanship of the late Professor Hugh Ryan, to inquire into the power resources of Ireland.  The committee confirmed the recommendation of the earlier British committee, and proposed that at least one station of about 20,000 k.w. fired with turf should be erected in a suitable locality.  The powers now sought in this Bill will enable the Electricity Supply Board to give practical effect to that proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> It might be well to refer to some further recommendations of the 1918 committee.  The committee was satisfied that the economic winning of peat for the purposes of large scale electrical power development is dependent on the use of machinery.  The committee recommended that such a scheme for peat-winning should be associated with the reclamation of the bog for agricultural purposes.  The aim of the development scheme at Clonsast and in other places is to leave the bog fit for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that hamlets or small villages of labourers houses be erected on suitable sites in the vicinity of the bogs under development.  This recommendation has been carried into effect at Clonsast.  The proposal to erect a peat-fuelling generating station is attractive from many points of view. Turf is one of the few basic industrial raw materials we have in large quantities in this country.  It has the great disadvantage, however, in common with all low grade industrial materials, that in its production the costs of handling and transport are very high in proportion to its value.  How to reduce these costs is a major problem in the development of our bogs.  Even on the bog itself, it costs nearly twice as much to take a ton of dry turf from a rick to the loading yard as it does to cut the raw material for it.  The enormous advantage, therefore, of burning the turf on the bog instead of burdening it with the further cost of carrying it ten, twenty or thirty miles is apparent.</P>
    <P>As regards the actual combustion of the turf in power-house boilers, there is, of course, no problem.  In other countries turf is used extensively in power stations.  In north west Germany there are two such stations, each using 100,000 tons of turf per annum.  At one station alone in Russia there are more than 2,000,000 tons of peat produced and burned each year in a power station.  In fact, the industrial regions of Moscow and Leningrad are, in a large measure, dependent on turf for their industrial power requirements. There is no reason why in this country where, for generations, <Col N="280" /> 3,500,000 tons of turf have been produced and used annually even in the area under our jurisdiction, an attempt should not be made to supply our expanding power requirements from turf.</P>
    <P>The economy of large scale winning of turf by machinery depends on getting two crops of turf each year on the bog.  Ability to secure two crops depends on (a), weather and length of season, and (b), machines.  It has been contended that the weather conditions here are not as favourable as the weather conditions in Russia or Germany for the economic winning of turf by machinery.  As regards Russia, the climatic conditions are really not comparable, and while there may be a closer resemblance between conditions here and those in north west Germany, where the power stations are situated, it is difficult, nevertheless, to make real comparisons because conditions are not sufficiently similar to make such comparisons of more than merely, academic interest.  The length of the season is as important a, factor as the weather in getting output, and here we would seem to have a definite advantage over Germany.  In Germany the maximum length of the season for cutting is from April to the end of July, whereas we can cut here from late February until the end of July.</P>
    <P>The real significance of both weather and season in relation to the economics of peat production must, however, be learned from experience.  This much we do know, however: Since the Turf Board started winning turf commercially in 1935 it has always been able to win two crops on its bogs each year. I think the weather from 1935 to 1940 may be taken as fairly representative of the Irish climate.  For instance, in the year 1939 the season was below average&mdash;indeed because of the high rainfall in 1938-39 the Electricity Supply Board was able to secure the record-breaking output of no less than 284,000,000 units from its Ardnacrusha station&mdash;but the fact that that was a very wet year did not prevent turf cut at the end of July being saved at Clonsast. In contrast with 1938, 1939 was good, possibly indeed better than average and the turf was actually saved at Clonsast by the middle of August, which is unusually early.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> As far as expert advice and reasonable anticipation, coupled with a degree of experience, can estimate, turf of a suitable moisture content for a generating station will be available at Clonsast to the full extent required. In a very bad year admittedly it is possible that difficulty will be experienced in saving the second crop of turf, but it is most improbable that a situation will arise when a serious shortage of turf will occur.  In any event, to provide against such a contingency or against the more likely contingency of a temporary interruption in deliveries from the bog, due to bad weather or other causes outside the board's control, it is intended that a stock pile of suitable size will be provided at the power station site.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that the second factor, which affects output is the efficiency of the turf-winning plant. On the whole the machines in use at Clonsast bog have proved themselves satisfactory.  They were first tried out on an experimental routine last year. In the present year three of them, the maximum combined capacity of which is 60,000 tons a year, have given an output estimated at between 45,000 and 50,000 tons of turf.  When it is considered that they were operating under most unfavourable conditions, inasmuch as the bog was largely being cut for the first time, that staffs were being trained, and that many of the more prolonged stoppages on the machines were due to delays in getting deliveries of spares because of war conditions, I think that this output must be considered as highly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A further factor which might here be mentioned, in connection with the economy of turf development, and the use of peat as a fuel in electricity works, is the life of a bog.  It is estimated that the Clonsast Bog has a production life of at least 25 years.  As latter-day progress in design has tended to render modern steam-driven generating plant economically obsolete within the first 15 years of its useful life, it is reasonable to assume that the bog, as a source of fuel, will outlive by a considerable margin the first generating plant put down in the new generating station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will bear with me, I was going to draw attention to the fact that there are adjacent bogs which, when required, can be brought, into operation, and which should extend the life of the power station by at least another 25 years.  In this connection, however, progressive technical developments either in the design of generating plant or in turf-winning methods should not be lost sight of.  Another aspect of the proposed new development is that the bog at Clonsast affords both steady and seasonal employment in a rural area.  It is anticipated that when fully developed for the purposes of the new generating station the bog will give employment to some 400 workers all the year round, and seasonal employment to an additional 200 workers.  During the season just passed there were as many as 500 workers employed on the bog.  This, I think, it will be agreed, is precisely the type of rural employment which the country needs, and it is to be regretted that more of it is not immediately available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The magnitude, of the task undertaken by the Turf Development Board at Clonsast is not, I think, generally appreciated.  Because its success there is a vital condition for the realisation of the prospect for a peat-burning generating station I should perhaps say something about it.  The Clonsast bog is 4,000 acres in extent; that is to say, it is two and a half times greater <Col N="283" /> than the size of the Phoenix Park. Needless to say, the drainage of such an area of bog had not before been undertaken in this country, and naturally, before the Turf Board embarked on such a large-scale development they looked for and secured the best available technical advice, whether at home or abroad.  On this basis, in the development of Clonsast and Lyracrompane, they have accumulated a large amount of experience which previously was not available in this country.  In the course of the work no less than 350 miles of drains had to be made by hand labour.  Twelve miles of narrow-gauge light railway were laid, and 27 miles of electrical power lines erected.  The organisation and execution of this work in unique circumstances was in itself a considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>It has been established that the Optimum period of the drainage of a bog of the magnitude of Clonsast is considerably in excess of the originally anticipated three years, and it would be wise in future development of deep midland bogs to allow a period of five years for draining a bog of this size. The drainage of a bog cannot be rushed, and this fact caused difficulty in the distribution and the supervision of labour.</P>
    <P>A problem which presented itself and which has now been largely overcome was the training of machine drivers and mechanical staff generally.  Unlike the position in an ordinary industrial undertaking, machine drivers, in addition to attending their machines, must also have regard to variables created by conditions on the bog, the quality of the turf and the weather.  It has taken considerable effort to impress on staffs the absolute necessity of doing the various operations at the critical moment and to impress on supervisory staffs the necessity for planning in advance the organisation of their labour.  On account of the varying conditions of both the bog and the weather, it has not been always easy to dispose of labour, so that it would be available exactly when required.</P>
    <P>It is not pretended that all the problems of large-scale bog development <Col N="284" /> have been solved by the progress made so far at Clonsast.  For instance, one of the most crucial problems, and one which I have mentioned before, is the question of transport on the bog. The cost and difficulty of this operation has been found to be much greater than was anticipated.  When, however, the turf is being delivered to the power station, this difficulty, it is hoped, will be largely diminished and the cost of the operation reduced to its proper proportion.</P>
    <P>The fact must not be lost sight of, however, that the ultimate value of the investment of £800,000, which it is proposed to make in the Portarlington station, depends upon the measure of success which attends the endeavours of the Turf Development Board to solve the very difficult engineering and other problems involved in the winning and harvesting of at least 120,000 tons of suitable peat fuel from the Clonsast bog every year.  The converse is likewise true, that the Clonsast bog cannot be made an economic proposition unless the electricity generating station is erected to utilise the 120,000 tons of fuel so won.  The Portarlington station is therefore an essential component of the turf development programme. The capital expenditure already incurred in the Clonsast experiment amounts to £190,000, and it is anticipated that it will ultimately reach £215,000.  To this we must add the £800,000 which is the present estimate of the sum required for the electricity station, and we find that for the development of this one bog alone we are committed to an expenditure of over £1,000,000 as a minimum.  I trust that the significance of this figure will be grasped by those who speak of the development of our peat resources as though it were a comparatively simple matter, only held up by lack of courage, or vision, or good will on the part of the Government or, as is more generally alleged, on the part of Finance officials.</P>
    <P>As a proposition of interwoven engineering and economic complexities, the rational development of our bogs constitutes one of the most difficult problems ever given to any group of Irishmen to solve, and those who have <Col N="285" /> been charged with that task, and who have the courage of pioneers in undertaking it, should be given every encouragement and consideration.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have just said, I may, perhaps, say something about the progress made at Clonsast this year. Having regard to the fact that this is a pioneer job, that we have had much to learn and have still much to learn about the peculiarities of our own bogs, and that many fortuitous difficulties were encountered, the results, to date, may be considered satisfactory. The operation costs are not yet as low as they should be, and as they must be, if this investment of £1,000,000 in the bog and this generating station is to justify itself.  Nevertheless, the Turf Board feel that when a power station is erected, they will be able to sell turf to the Electricity Supply Board at a price comparable to the price of coal, having regard to the respective calorific value of the two fuels.</P>
    <P>I am not to be taken as contending that the burning of 100,000 or 120,000 tons of turf is going to have a noticeable effect on our trade balance.  Of itself, it will save only 50,000 or 60,000 tons of coal per annum, but if the Clonsast and Portarlington experiment succeeds, it will lead to the more assured development of other bogs as sources of electrical energy; and this development will proceed step by step with the development of our remaining water-power resources&mdash;and the experience, indeed, of the Electricity Supply Board has shown that, in order to deal with the large variations which nature may impose on the generating capacity of installed water-power plant, as between one year and another and as between one season and another, it is essential to instal steam-driven stations to make good the deficiencies which thus arise.</P>
    <P>One of the special difficulties which the Turf Board encountered this year, and with which, but for the war, it would not have been beset, was in securing the turf-winning plant required for its programme.  Six machines of special design were on order, and it was anticipated&mdash;and the results obtained this year show the anticipation to have been well founded <Col N="286" /> that these six machines would give an output of at least 120,000 tons of suitable fuel per annum.  The Board, unfortunately, was prevented by the outbreak of hostilities from getting the delivery of more than three of the machines, and it is now trying to have three others constructed here at home.</P>
    <P>If the problem of obtaining the necessary materials is overcome there is every reason to believe that with the co-operation of the engineering shops in this country they will succeed in getting their full complement of plant. On the other hand, should this expectation not be realised, and should there be unavoidable delay in procuring further machines, the project, so far as the Clonsast and Portarlington undertakings are concerned, will not collapse in the interim, for, in the circumstances which render it impossible to get the machines, it is reasonable to assume that there will be some difficulty in getting coal, and that accordingly by the production and sale of 60,000 tons of turf the board will be enabled to pay its way, except perhaps as regards the provision which ought to be made for depreciation.</P>
    <P>I think we must assume also that, in the circumstances to which I have referred, if the Turf Development Board cannot get these machines it is unfortunately and regrettably likely the E.S.B. will be in a similar dilemma in regard to the plants required at the Portarlington station.  Indeed there is some reason to fear that it may find itself in this position in regard to the plant required and so long on order for the Liffey station.  Should, however, the improbable happen and the E.S.B. be able to complete the generating station, while the Turf Board remains unable to obtain additional machines, the Portarlington station should be in a position to supply about half its normal output, or 45 million units of electricity per annum to the Electricity Supply Board network.  Naturally the fact that the station would be operating at half capacity would considerably increase the operating cost per unit generating, and would in fact increase them by about 50 per cent., but in the circumstances which we have been considering that would not be of such <Col N="287" /> serious import as it otherwise would be.</P>
    <P>We may now give some consideration to the more purely electro-economic aspects of the proposed turf fuel generating station.  Hitherto, the function of the Electricity Supply Board's steam plant has been mostly to provide for low water periods in the Shannon.  It is of interest to note in this connection that the past ten years have been, on the whole, abnormally dry.  The records indeed show that while during this period only one year has been wetter than the average year, and only one year has been about equal to the average year, the other eight years have all been much drier than the average year.  In fact, the discharge of the Shannon during the financial year 1933-34 was only a little more than 40 per cent. of the average discharge during the preceding 40 years.</P>
    <P>The effect of a variation in rainfall upon the operating conditions of the Electricity Supply Board generating stations is well brought out by the figures for the number of units delivered to the Electricity Supply Board network from.  Ardnacrusha and Pigeon House generating plants, respectively, in the years 1938-39 and 1939-40.  In 1938-39, out of a total delivery to the network, of 367,000,000 units, Ardnacrusha supplied, in round figures, 284,000,000 or 77.4 per cent. of the whole, while the Pigeon House only delivered 81,000,000 units or 22 per cent.  In 1939, which was a much drier year, Ardnacrusha delivered only 208,000,000 units or 51 per cent. of a total delivery of 388,000,000 units, while the Pigeon House was responsible for 179,000,000 or 46.1 per cent. The effect of these variations in output from the two stations was reflected in the average cost per unit delivered from them.  For the Pigeon House units this was .6994d. in 1938-39, but fell to .4457d. in 1939-40.  For the Ardnacrusha units, on the other hand, while the average cost per unit delivered was only .2725d. in 1938-39, the figure rose to .3723d. in 1939-40.</P>
    <P>The problem involved in the economic <Col N="288" /> utilisation of our water-power resources in conjunction with steam-driven plant has been altered somewhat by the fact that the demand on the Electricity Supply Board network has now increased to such an extent that what is known as the base load on the system is not likely ever to be less than 20 M.W. the, whole year through.  With this fact in view, the size of the Portarlington plant has been fixed likewise at 20 M.W., so that it may be considered available to take the base load of the whole system.  On that hypothesis it is estimated that normally its annual output will be of the order of 90,000,000 units per year, and its capital cost is taken, as already stated, at £800,000, though this, I should say, in present circumstances naturally is by no means a firm figure.</P>
    <P>On this basis it is estimated that the works cost per unit generated at Portarlingfcon will be approximately .426d., of which fuel will represent .169d.; labour and other works costs, .057d., and capital charges .236d.</P>
    <P>We may compare these figures with those for the Liffey development, where for an anticipated output of 30,000,000 units per annum from plant having a capacity of 34 M.W. the capital cost in round figures is expected to be £785,000, and the costs per unit generated .568d., of which .1d. will be in respect of labour and other works costs, while .468d. will be in respect of capital charges.</P>
    <P>In regard to these and other comparisons which I may make, I must emphasise that each element of plant, whether at the Pigeon House, Ardnacrusha, Poulaphouca or Portarlington, is designed for its own particular form of service, and if employed upon another and different type of service would probably not give the same economic results.  Thus, the figures which I have given for Portarlington will apply to it only when it is working as a base load station, for which special service it is designed, while those for the Liffey plant relate to its working as a peak load and general regulating plant for which in like manner it has been designed.  It is almost certain that if the Portarlington <Col N="289" /> station were to be used to perform the special functions of the Poulaphouca station its costs per unit generated would be very much higher.</P>
    <P>This caution must likewise be borne in mind, when I say that the cost per unit generated in 1938-39 at the Pigeon House was .6201d., of which .2258d. was in respect of capital charges, .2437d. for fuel, and .1506d. for labour and other costs.  In 1939-40, on the other hand, the total cost was only .4085d., of which .1246d. was for capital charges, .2107d. for fuel, and .0732d. for labour, etc.  For Ardnacrusha in 1938-39 the figures were:&mdash;capital charges, .2162d.; labour and other costs, .0355d., making a total of .2517d. per unit generated, and for 1939-40 were:&mdash;capital charges, .3230d.; labour and other costs, .0454d., making .3684d. per unit generated.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out how these figures were influenced by the weather conditions prevailing during the critical months of the year which I have cited. In fact in this respect our huge electricity undertaking is no more independent than the least fortunate of our farmers.  These figures, while they are not strictly comparable, have this advantage.  They do place the Portarlington station in its proper economic perspective.  For the special service which it has been designed to fulfil, the Portarlington station, in my view, is as economic&mdash;taking every factor into consideration, including the amount of employment given in winning the fuel&mdash;an electrical project as any other which the country can produce. Therefore, I hope that the Dáil, having regard to what is involved in the undertaking, to the fact that it is a pioneer and experimental undertaking, and bearing in mind the beneficial results for the community which would attend its success, will give us every encouragement in proceeding with it.</P>
    <P>Though our progress from an output of 61,000,000 units from our stations in 1929-30, and from 48,000 consumers in the same year, to 409,000,000 units, with 172,000 consumers, in 1939-40&mdash;ten years later&mdash;may seem remarkable enough, we have still much leeway to make up in the utilisation of electricity. <Col N="290" /> We are, in fact, with a, consumption of only 127 units per head, amongst the least users of electricity in the world, ranking lower than Mexico, and a good deal lower than Japan.  But our demands are growing and I think that, in normal times, they would grow at an ever-accelerating rate.  In any event, we are now at the stage when, apart altogether from Portarlington and the Liffey, we must consider new projects.</P>
    <P>It is usually necessary to allow three or four years for the provision of new generating plant.  In view of this fact, preliminary investigations have been carried out by the Electricity Supply Board, and from these investigations it is clear that the most important river, from the hydro-electric point of view, in this country, after the Shannon is the Erne.  It is estimated that an average output of from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 units can be obtained from that river.  The catchment of the Erne is about 1,600 square miles, and somewhat more than half of this is in the territory under our jurisdiction, as is practically the total fall of 150 feet from Lower Lough Erne to the sea.</P>
    <P>It is possible to carry out the development of this river concomitant with the regulation of the lakes, not only for the production of power but for the improvement of drainage.  If this dual purpose project were to be undertaken, however, co-operation of the authorities in Northern Ireland would be essential and, indeed, would be warmly welcomed.  If, which I trust would not be the case, co-operation would not be forthcoming, it would still be possible for us to carry out the project without any interference with the present regulation of the lakes, in which case, of course, no improvement in drainage would be obtained. Plans and estimates for the works show that the cost of development, whether full or partial, would be very economic.  It would, accordingly, be a most desirable proposition from every point of view.</P>
    <P>I hope that, even in the present circumstances, it may be found possible to initiate it and that in due course it will be the happy lot, either of myself or of some successor of mine, to ask the Dáil to provide the moneys required <Col N="291" /> to give effect to a practical instance of co-operation between Irishmen, North and South, for the good of our common country.  There is nothing more I have to say about this measure. I have, perhaps, taken up the time of the House unduly, but I was anxious, in view of the fact that the Bill includes provisions designed to clarify the doubts which have been expressed in regard to the powers, of the Electricity Supply Board to erect an electric generating plant for the utilisation of peat fuel, I was anxious to put that proposition to the House in all its details, so that the Dáil might be fully aware of what was being attempted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has favoured the House with an explanation of the various sums which go to make up the total amount which is involved in connection with this measure.  May I suggest to him that, if it falls to him again to bring in any further extension of this, he should get some more expeditious method of doing it than that which is set out in Section 2, sub-sections (1) and (2), in the very elaborate method of dealing with a mere extension of the capital sum involved?</P>
      <P>We are much indebted to the Minister for the figures he has set out on this table and which, so far as the general run of members of the House is concerned, can be really resolved into one particular figure, that is the figure of item No. 4.  It would be very desirable that, in connection with a matter of this kind, we would be in a position to give impartial consideration to what the Minister has said to us.  We find a little difficulty in doing that for some reasons.  The first is perhaps an explanation of the Electricity Supply Board itself.  In dealing in its report with the utilisation of peat fuel it says, on page 13:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The board has had under consideration the construction of a peat-fired generating station, and the technical and economic aspects of the utilisation of this fuel have been investigated. The availability of adequate supplies of peat will be an important factor in the economic <Col N="292" /> operation of the station.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has assured the board that the production of the Clonsast bog will be increased to meet the large demands of a generating station, and on the basis of these assurances a suitable site has been selected, and steps are being taken to empower the board to proceed with this project.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One would imagine, in connection with a matter of this kind, that if the board were really whole-heartedly in favour of this, and taking into account the very large sum of money that is involved&mdash;£800,000&mdash;we would get some of the information which the Minister has given us in tabloid form.</P>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of some of the older members of this House that, in the beginning of this Ardnacrusha undertaking, this great development for the generation of electricity through the country, there was not a political humbug in the country who did not criticise it.  Humbugs in various chambers of commerce spoke on it as if they possessed the inspired genius of an engineer.  There was not a journalist that was not nervously holding up his hand in holy horror, and so down along the whole line of political madcaps in the country. But we have lived all that down. We have seen now that we could, and did, make a success of this great electricity undertaking.  Its expansion has been remarkable.  It has still a good distance to go.  It was rather disappointing to gather, from what the Minister said here to-night, that there is no great desire on his part, nor is there even any indication of it on the part of the Electricity Supply Board itself, to regard the Electricity Supply Board undertaking as a great public service&mdash;as something that could be made of great use to the country.</P>
    <P>It is within the bounds of possibility that the Electricity Supply Board itself feels constrained to keep within the narrow limits of its balance.  But it has a balance this year of £54,000. That balance might be very suitably employed if, after consultation with the Minister or the Ministry, some steps were taken to utilise it, and so bring the current to various parts of <Col N="293" /> the country where at the moment it is not perhaps considered an economic proposition to do so.  There is scarcely a farmer in the country who would not derive benefit from it.  I referred to this when discussing another Bill with the Minister for Local Government, this evening.  Unfortunately, the position we are in at the moment is that every single Department of State is a government in itself.  Not one of them will do anything in the way of co-operation with anybody else.  We were told this evening that we could not use the harbour boards for reclamation work and the giving of employment because that was the responsibility of another Ministry.  We were told the same thing in connection with the expenditure of public money for the relief of unemployment.  Surely, an extension of the system throughout the country, the employment that would arise from that as well as the ultimate benefit that would accrue to the farmer and to the appearance and general improvement of the country, would be an advantage.</P>
    <P>Now this Bill may be said to resolve itself into two main points.  The first is this Clonsast development.  If this Clonsast development is a development on its own merits&mdash;I mean of a peat-fuel generating system&mdash;if it can stand on its own and has not been instituted in order to bolster up and keep in existence the Peat Development Board, and we can scarcely be blamed for perhaps having an evil thought in that direction having regard to our experience of turf development throughout the country: but, as I say, if that development is to be on its own merits and can stand the test of examination, we are entitled to get some figures.  Those figures and those explanations were given in connection with the original proposal.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of spending an extra £800,000 at a time when there is scarcely a single item in connection with the big expenditure of £4,000,000 that has escaped extra costs by reason of the outbreak of hostilities.  Since, therefore, we are faced with extra costs in connection with the generation of electricity, it is obviously our duty <Col N="294" /> to ensure that we are not going to indulge in any new experiments.  It is all the more necessary in view of the Minister's concluding statement.  In connection with the harnessing of other water power resources, the Electricity Supply Board says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subsequent to the completion of the hydrometric investigations for the River Liffey development, work was commenced on an examination of the potentialities of various rivers in the country for hydro-electric development. Certain possible power sites have been selected and arrangements have been made for the keeping of flow records in collaboration, where mutually convenient, with the Drainage Department of the Office of Public Works.  In this connection special automatic water level recorders have been installed on the Erne, the Boyne and the Lee.  The number of such observation stations may be increased from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are going to invest this £800,000 in something which on its face is giving the greatest possible latitude to the Minister, something that has an element of speculation in it, and that we are leaving there something which has in it great potentialities, a lower cost and the possibility of creating and improving new and cordial relations between ourselves and some of our neighbours up North, then the latter would appear to be the more economic and the sounder proposition of the two. However, these matters ought not to be the subject of political canvassing. They should be decided by experts, and I would be prepared to accept the opinion of experts.  I have done it before.  We took some risks in connection with the initiation of the Ardnacrusha undertaking, and we are not going to be appalled if we have to give consideration to the recommendations of other experts.</P>
    <P>Leaving entirely out of account the expenses and considerations which have obtruded themselves occasionally on the public mind, it would be a rather serious thing, to my mind, to exhaust the bogs in the different parts of the country while we have water running from day to day, water that is not <Col N="295" /> going to be exhausted by reason of its being harnessed to these schemes. There is one satisfaction for anybody who has observed this turf development during the last few years, and that is that after all the money that has been expended on it, with all the advertising, canvassing, and all the rest of it, the Government have not succeeded in taking as much turf out of the bogs as had been taken before all this work was undertaken.  There is some satisfaction in that for this reason: that from some parts of the Minister's speech this evening one could infer that a capital asset, such as bogs, was there to be exhausted, and that we, in our generation, were exhausting it and leaving nothing for those who will come after us.  The House is entitled to a report by experts on the merits of this proposal to put up a power station at Portarlington.  It would give generous consideration to a proposal of that sort if it were recommended as an economic proposition.  It may be that the Minister was looking at different figures from those which I have before me, but my information is that, at Ardnacrusha in 1939, 286,000,000 units were, generated.</P>

In the year ended the 31st of March, 1940, 210¼ million units were generated at Ardnacrusha, 195? million units at the Pigeon House, and almost 1,000,000 units at Cork.

      <P>We have not got those particulars.  Similarly, with regard to the comparisons which he gave us.  I have a horror of comparisons <Col N="296" /> and averages since Fianna Fáil came into office because of the way they are employed.  Some of the figures the Minister gave were not comparable. He was honest enough to tell us that but we ought to get them as nearly comparable as possible.  I do not care for this £800,000 proposition without the recommendation of experts.  I do not care for this proposal to give the board power to invest sums set aside under sub-section (2) of Section 21 of the Principal Act or accumulated by the board as reserves.  If they have any money, it should be used to pay off, after providing for depreciation. But this business of continually handing over and borrowing and making up reserves does not appeal to me.  There can scarcely be any difference in money value in paying off and dealing with the money in this way.  They borrow at particular times almost every other year.  If they pay off, it will save them the trouble of making arrangements for investing and it will lessen their troubles generally.  It may possibly keep them out of another difficulty, if not under this Ministry then under some other Ministry.  My information, for what it is worth, is that this board does not pay income tax. If they commence to make investments and engage in enterprises of that sort, it may be that some enterprising Government, if not this Government, will bring about a change in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's statement.  I had hoped that our entire efforts would be devoted to improving country life and making the countryside more attractive.  I had hoped that we would have been able to extend to the people living in the country some of the advantages of city life and, in that way, make the countryside less unpopular than it has been growing in recent years.  I had thought that some portion of the Minister's speech would have been devoted to showing that they were, at least, examining that side of the picture and that, in the near future, with the progress now being made, it would be possible for the Electricity Supply Board to devote some portion of their money annually to that work.  It would appear as if, during the last two <Col N="297" /> years, that could have been done without any great strain.  It is only fair that people living in towns and villages which are not yet connected with the electricity system should share the advantages which their more fortunate brethren in other parts of the country are enjoying.  It is rather interesting to notice that these lines have been laid in squares in the country.  In very rare cases do they go away from the square.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have got so lazy here that we would be terribly disappointed if we had to strike a match to light a candle instead of turning on a switch should have some consideration for those people in the country who have not the advantage of the switch, and who might be better off if they were able to use the power available.  The power, according to the Minister's statement, merely awaits harnessing to make electricity available at a very moderate rate.  In North-West Cork and portions of Kerry and Donegal they have not got any advantage at all from this great electricity undertaking. It would be better if we considered that aspect of the matter than this proposition, unless the experts can recommend it.  The Minister ought to be perfectly satisfied as to this experiment and ought to take the House into his confidence.  He should get reports from experts and circulate them to members of the House.  Now that we have outlived the period of lack of confidence in the State and State institutions, it would be unfortunate if anything were done which would retard the progress, which has been very-marked and remarkable, of so great an undertaking.</P>

      <P>Some of us have not had an opportunity of looking into this matter in the way we should like. Reviewing the schemes up to the present, we have the Shannon scheme, which is a hydro scheme.  That was the major work and, like most pioneer undertakings, it experienced a good deal of criticism and difficulty.  The Poulaphouca scheme is the next, and it is a hydro scheme.  Before the Poulaphouca scheme is finished, the Electricity Supply Board have found that generation is insufficient for the requirements of the country.  So far as one can understand, the Pigeon House has been occupied.  The Minister said it had been used to supplement supply in the years in which there was a low rainfall, but I seem to remember a time when the Pigeon House had to be brought on on the peak load.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong. In any event, the Pigeon House is a steam plant, using coal.  I tried to follow the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to units of electricity and in other cases to megawatts and kilowatts, and he did not exactly reduce these to a common denominator, but so far as we can understand, especially from the apologetic tone in which the Minister introduced the question of Clonsast, it seems to me that it is an experiment in a steamer station run by turf.  I do not know what the capacity of the Pigeon House is, but I think the Minister spoke of the capacity of Clonsast as about a hundred million units per year.  I see in the explanatory memorandum that there is a sum of £800,000 for the construction of a new peat burning generating station at Portarlington.  The Minister referred to boilers, and I suppose the peat will be put into the boilers and steam generated.  The capacity of the plant, however, is not given.</P>

      <P>It is not stated in the White Paper.  I said 100,000,000 units and the Minister says 90,000,000 units. If one takes that as a stand-by to assist the Pigeon House, I suppose it is some sort of contribution, but if one regards it in the light of the way the Poulaphouca scheme appears to have been shown to have been inadequate before it was erected, I am not sure that the Minister's ideas are big enough.  I do not think anybody would like to see the Shannon, Poulaphouca, Pigeon House and Olonsast schemes, and before the Clonsast scheme was finished, a start made on the foundations of the Erne scheme or the next most favourable hydro, scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says I was not listening to him, but I listened to him with the greatest attention.  Perhaps it is not possible to pick up all the points from his speech, but I rather inferred that in some of these cases the expenditure had already been made and, presumably then, the equipment has been provided.  If that is so, having regard to the fact that the Electricity Supply Board probably know their own requirements best, I have not got a word to say, but if one can gather anything with regard to the present international situation, it is that it is very doubtful and obscure, and that while we have already embarked on rising <Col N="300" /> costs and find it difficult to obtain deliveries of machinery, it may be even more difficult before the scheme is finished to get delivery of machinery.</P>
    <P>There is another point, and if the Minister mentioned it I certainly did not catch it.  This is, apparently, more or less to cover the Electricity Supply Board's requirements up to 1942.  Are they at the peak of their load, taking Poulaphouca into account, because it seems that we thought that the Electricity Supply Board would have gauged their requirements very carefully, and I think it would be very foolish for them to look at present for any machinery or equipment that was not absolutely necessary.  I do not know how far it would be more economical to go on with a bigger hydro scheme such as the Erne, which the Minister mentioned, and which is the next best according to the experts, but the point I wish to call attention to is that before we know where we are, we shall have five schemes&mdash;two steamers, two hydro schemes, and a third under construction.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some idea as to the extent to which the use of electricity is estimated to increase.  This, apparently, is designed to cover the period up to 1942. That being so, is there a considerable reserve in that?  The Minister has spoken about Clonsast and about winning the turf there, but if the requirements for some time to come could be covered, or at least postponed, I should like to see another hydro scheme gone on with, or the possibility of it explored.  Apparently, the requirements of electricity in this country have been tremendously under-estimated and I would not be at all surprised if we found they had been again under-estimated.  It would be most unfortunate if a steamer had been put up&mdash;I call Clonsast a steamer &mdash;which would only last for the life of the bog, and we were to find that perhaps the machinery to generate the plant could not be obtained before 1942, and by that time we could have had the concrete foundations and a whole lot of the works of a hydro scheme gone on with, nearly all the <Col N="301" /> materials for which are available.  It seems to me to be a question to which very careful consideration should be given as to whether our ideas are big enough.  Certainly the water flows through the plant, whereas the peat has to be won.  During next winter, and possibly the winter after, we might come to a position in which we would find that the peat won from Clonsast would be very useful for the inhabitants of this country for their ordinary requirements.  I should like the Minister to tell us as much about that as possible when he is replying.</P>

      <P>The Minister will admit that legislation is necessary to remedy the difficulty.  Under Section 8 of the Act of 1927, that is the parent Act, provision was made whereby the board was entitled to recruit staff and pay them certain remuneration and allowances. It was then assumed by the board, and has since been assumed by, the board, that that enabled them to provide a pension scheme for their employees.  While the board holds that view, I understand that the Minister's Department, and perhaps the Attorney-General, holds the view that the section in question does not in fact enable the board to provide a pension scheme for its employees.  As the House will realise, the staff of the Electricity Supply Board is now considerable in number, and in the case of a public undertaking of that kind it is not unreasonable to ask that some provision should be made for pensions to employees who have served the board for a long number of years, and <Col N="302" /> who may ultimately pass out of its service without any pension whatever, unless some legislative steps are taken to enable the board to introduce a pension scheme.  I understand the position of the board to be that it is perfectly anxious to provide such a scheme, but, owing to the dispute as to the meaning of Section 8 of the Act of 1927, the board does not feel itself empowered, in view of the advice it has got from the Department, to proceed with the matter.</P>
      <P>Discussions between the staff and the board have dragged on for a very long time.  Just a summary of those discussions may be interesting, as showing that so far as the staff are concerned they have displayed extraordinary patience in the face of difficulties which are, I submit, readily surmountable. In November, 1934, the board said to the employees: &ldquo;While the board is in fact broadly examining the question of providing such a pension scheme, it is necessary to state that, in the board's view, it is as yet premature to employ a scheme of that kind until the board is satisfied that a normal position has been reached in regard to expenditure and staff requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February, 1935, the staff was informed: &ldquo;The hoard has now decided to inaugurate such a scheme, and is making the necessary investigations in this connection.  It will be appreciated of course that investigations of this kind may take some little time.&rdquo;  Then we come to August, 1935, when the board said that they had not yet completed their investigations.  Then we are carried on to January, 1936, when the staff were informed: &ldquo;The board has carried out its investigations up to a point, but regrets that it is not possible at this stage to state in what year the board may be in a position to consider application of the scheme.&rdquo;  In February, 1939, after a lapse of three years, the staff were informed that legislation which the board was advised was necessary had not yet been implemented. At that stage the board had sought, apparently, authority from the Department to proceed by legislation to introduce the scheme.  In March, 1939, the staff were informed: <Col N="303" />&ldquo;Before the board can introduce arrangements for superannuation, sanction must be obtained, and application for such sanction has been made to the Minister.&rdquo;  In May, 1940, the staff were informed: &ldquo;The board has sought legislative authority for such a scheme, as enabling legislation was necessary.  The time at which legislation will be introduced is a matter outside the control of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will admit that so far as the enabling legislation is concerned he is the only person in a position to introduce the necessary legislation to enable the board to proceed with its scheme of superannuation. I am sure the Minister will recognise that in the case of a public undertaking of this kind, employing a large staff, it is very desirable from every standpoint that a superannuation scheme should be introduced, and I strongly urge the Minister to avail of this Bill to include an enabling section which would give power to the board to introduce a superannuation scheme, the details afterwards being worked out between the board, perhaps the Minister, and the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>If legislative authority is necessary, I presume that there should not be any difficulty in making provision in this Bill to give that authority, thus enabling this dispute, which has dragged on for a number of years, to be satisfactorily settled in the interests of the board and the staff.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate that he can make that provision in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I will not occupy the House for very long in connection with this Bill.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that the introduction of such a measure as this, containing the proposals which the Minister has outlined in his speech, must be received by us on this side of the House with every sympathy, and given sympathetic consideration.  Any criticisms that we make, if they can be regarded as criticisms, are made in a construct, tive spirit, realising that really the introduction of a measure of this kind is a striking testimonial by the present Minister to the courage, vision and foresight of his predecessor who initiated this great electricity scheme, of the Shannon works.  There are two aspects of this matter to which I wish to refer, and I should also like to make one or two observations on the remarks that were made by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outstanding disappointment to me in connection with this measure is the fact that it contains not merely no provision for rural electrification but no hint&mdash;either in the Bill itself or in the Minister's statement&mdash;that that matter of rural electrification is within the contemplation of the Government, or that the Government has any intention of facilitating the Electricity Supply Board in any measures for the rural electrification of this country. Like the Minister, I represent a city constituency, but it has been brought to my attention from various quarters that there is an ever growing demand, an insistence, on the part of dwellers in towns and villages, and even in the most rural parts of the country, for facilities in connection with the electricity supply.  It used to be rather a joke that farmers were unable to understand why it was that when the cables carrying the electricity from Ardnacrusha to Dublin passed through their fields they were not able to put up a wire to tap the source of supply and bring it direct to the farmers, but, while that is a matter for ridicule, perhaps it does contain some serious element, because the rural community and the dwellers in towns and small villages who are not receiving the <Col N="305" /> benefits of the electricity scheme are getting extremely restive.  I will not go into the point, in case it might be even remotely suggested that I was indulging in political consideration, who is responsible for the outlook of the farming community in connection with this scheme, but undoubtedly there is a feeling in the country that fanners are paying for this scheme and are getting no benefit.  Of course, everybody knows by now that it is really the electricity consumers who are paying for this entire scheme and that the taxpayers are paying not one penny piece towards it.  Nevertheless, the farmers and the dwellers in towns and villages are making insistent demands in all sources to have the facilities afforded to them that are being afforded to their more fortunate neighbours.</P>
    <P>They are also unable to understand the denial of the facilities to a particular town, village or group of villages when, a comparatively short distance away, another group of villages is served by the electricity supply.  Although up to this, so far as I know, the taxpayer has not been called upon to pay one penny piece in connection with this development scheme, I think it might be worth the Minister's while and the Government's while to consider whether it would not be a national matter that some money should be given from the Exchequer to enable rural electrification to be carried out as soon as possible.  I do not know what it would cost.  I confess my ignorance in this matter, but I do think it is easy to understand the outlook of the country people.  They will find it very much, more difficult to understand when they realise that, as a result of the introduction of this Bill and the measures forecast by the Minister in his speech, the position is that the Shannon has been harnessed for the purpose of getting electricity, that the Pigeon House is working at full capacity, that a scheme is being brought to fruition in connection with the development of the Liffey, that it is proposed to set up a new generating station in Portarlington, ind that the Minister envisages in a very short time that the waters of the Erne will also be harnessed for the purposes <Col N="306" /> of supplying electricity.  To whom?  Dwellers in the city.  Apparently, notwithstanding the fact that the Liffey and the Shannon are giving their natural resources to the country, that the Pigeon House is working at full capacity, that turf is going to be pressed into the service and that the River Erne is also within the ambit of the Minister's hopes, at all events, the villages will not have their cottages, their chapels, their schools, or the farmers will not have their farmhouses, farm-sheds and buildings lit or worked by electricity.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to understand, from the point of view of these people, why up to this point some effort has not been made to deal with the question of lighting these remote towns and villages and to solve the general problem of rural electrification in this country.  I know that the attitude of the Electricity Supply Board to problems of that kind is one based purely upon an economic outlook.  It is a complete answer to these people and a logical reply to their demands that a certain village should be supplied with light that it would cost more than the revenue that is likely to be got out of it.  While it is a logical reply, while, possibly, a complete reply from an economic point of view yet, from a national point of view, I think it is no reply.  I do suggest in all seriousness to the Minister that he should seriously consider this question and endeavour to bring in some provisions, if not in this particular Bill, at least in some measure early to be introduced into this House, to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has spoken of the sum of money, £800,000, that is to be spent at the power station at Portarlington. I rather fancy that that will only exasperate the people in the country who are not receiving the benefits of this scheme and who, apparently, are not going to get the benefit of any development of the scheme.  It will be no source of comfort to the people in the country to know that turf is being used instead of coal because, so far as they are concerned, that is all the £800,000 expenditure on <Col N="307" /> the Portarlington scheme is going to mean&mdash;that turf is going to be used.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister anticipated me.  I was coming to that.  It will be no comfort to the people in towns and villages in districts far away from Portarlington to know that a certain number of people in the immediate vicinity of Portarlington are going to get jobs, even permanent jobs.  It will be no comfort to them to know that the Government's scheme in reference to peat development is going to get another chance.  In fact, I think that not merely the people in the rural parts of the country but the general consumers of electricity throughout the country will see in this proposal to spend £800,000 on the Portarlington scheme merely another effort to bolster, up the turf development scheme at the expense of the electricity consumers. I take it that this £800,000 eventually is going to be paid off by the people who buy electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that no part of that £800,000 will come from the taxpayer, that it is going to be found first by the Government and given to the Electricity Supply Board for immediate expenditure but that it will be repaid with interest, probably at a very high percentage, at the expense of the people who buy electricity from the Electricity Supply Board.  In other words, the people in Dublin and Cork will be paying for the expense of this experiment at Portarlington. As a person who uses a fair amount of electricity, I do not view with any enthusiasm whatever this experiment at Portarlington.  I do not know what the necessity is for setting up this power station at Portarlington except that it is put up for the purpose of endeavouring to see if there is still another use for the turf at Clonsast, which was to be used in all sorts of ways.  We were nearly smoked out of the Four Courts by tho use of turf, and even that has been given up.  I <Col N="308" /> think the use of it in Government offices generally has been given up.  Now it is going to be put into n power station at Portarlington for the purpose of producing electricity for Dublin, Cork and Galway, presumably, and various other cities and towns, but, as I understand it at the moment, there is ample electricity being won from the waters of the Shannon and about to be won from the waters of the Liffey and being produced from the power station in Dublin to meet immediate requirements.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to know from the Minister that we are one of the worst countries in the world from the point of view of consuming electricity.  We are worse than Mexico, and I judged by the tone in which the Minister said that that that was saying the worst thing possible about us.  Apparently we are the worst in the world, but we must have the Liffey and the Shannon and the Erne, and we must have the power station on the quay, and now we must have another station that will be operated by turf or we will not have enough electricity generated to supply the demands of the city populations and the populations of the bigger towns.</P>
    <P>That does not seem to be logical, and I think that the only possible conclusion, a coercive conclusion, to come to from the facts is that this Portarlington scheme is not made for the benefit of electricity consumers, or the general scope or scheme of the Electricity Supply Board's activities, but is merely an effort to bolster up the turf development scheme, which was in danger of complete collapse. That is going to be done, not at the expense of the general taxpayer, but at the expense of the general consumer of electricity.  The person in Dublin who is consuming electricity has to pay for the digging of turf out of the Portarlington bogs.</P>
    <P>It may be to me, and perhaps to others who consume a considerable amount of electricity and pay for it, some consolation to know that we are helping to give employment, even <Col N="309" /> though it is a long way from our constituents in Dublin, who are looking for employment anil not getting it; but if the Minister did attack the problem of rural electrification and give a supply of electricity to the towns and villages crying out for it at the moment, spread over all the country, far more employment would be given in installing and maintaining electricity, and in the various services connected with it, than if the entire bog at Clonsast were utilised for the purpose of generating electricity <i>in sæcula sæculorum.</i></P>
    <P>The argument in favour of the Portarlington scheme, that it would give employment to a certain number of men in Portarlington, has no validity. if this £800,000 were utilised in another direction, more employment would be given throughout the country as a whole.  The Minister said that in order to see the real value of tha Portarlington scheme it had to be put in its proper economic perspective.  We all krow the Minister is a great weaver of phrases.  I thought that was a very fine phrase, but I confess I do not know what it means.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have an inkling of what it might mean, but I have also a sort of suspicion that it was merely a type of nice gaudy scheme made out of the framework of the Minister's word-weaving in order to conceal the fact that the really proper perspective of this project is nothing other than an effort to make electricity consumers pay for an experiment in the Portarlington bogs&mdash;putting it quite crudely. The only possible result from that will be that there mav or mav not be electricity generated from that that is required. I do not think it is required.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has stated categorically, having regard to the present consumers or the consumers of electricity who may reasonably be anticipated in the immediate future, that it is essential to set up this experiment in Portarlington. Deputy Cosgrave has pleaded with the Minister that this scheme should be subjected to scrutiny by experts.  I do not wish to repeat what he has said, but I will direct the Minister's attention to a doubt that has been sown in <Col N="310" /> my mind by the phraseology used by the framers of the report of the Electricity Supply Board for 1939-40, dealing with this scheme.  Deputy Cosgrave has read it, and I will merely repeat the first two lines: &ldquo;The board has had under consideration the construction of a peat-fired generating station and the technical and economic aspects of the utilisation of this fuel have been investigated.&rdquo;  We are told there that the technical and economic aspects of the utilisation of this fuel have been investigated.  We are not told in this report, nor has the Minister told the House, what the results of that investigation are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that if the supply of turf can be obtained&mdash;and I do not think there is any doubt about that now&mdash;that the Portarlington station will generate current at an average cost of .426d. per unit, and I may tell the Deputy that that is lower than the average at which the Pigeon House station has been able to generate current during the last ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the Minister's statement about the figures, but they make no impression on my mind, because I do not believe in figures.  I want to direct the Minister's attention to this fact, that, when the Electricity Supply Board were making this report, they stopped short at saying it had been investigated.  The Minister may have given figures, but so far as they are concerned they deal with the economic aspect of it.  As to the technical aspect, what is the result of these technical considerations and by whom have these considerations been taken into account?  What was the capacity of the persons who made them and the prospects that this thing may not be, from a technical point of view, a complete failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated to the Minister that the phraseology of that report raised a doubt in my mind.  I do not want to raise a doubt in any other person's mind, but, having regard to the plea made to the Minister by Deputy Cosgrave, that the way to deal with this <Col N="311" /> problem, which involves the expenditure of £800,000, is the way the original problem was dealt with, namely, after a full report by independent experts of high standing, whose judgment and capacity to judge will be accepted, and whose final verdict on the matter will be taken as conclusive before this £800,000 is spent.  Apart from that, I think that before this scheme in connection with turf development is taken up, involving as it does £800,000, the question of rural electrification should first be taken up.  I do not think that a scheme in connection with rural electrification would cost anything like £800,000, but I have no data on which to base a real opinion, and I would like the Minister to give some idea of what it would cost to accommodate the towns and villages in rural areas that are now crying out for a supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Norton said with reference to the staff.  I think it was intended that the staff should have proper rules and regulations in regard to their superannuation.  As Deputy Norton has pointed out, the original Act, enabling the board to grant remuneration, was conceived to comprise the power to grant a superannuation scheme.  I say it is extraordinary, in such a Bill as this, which sets out to amend various Acts, that a power of that kind, which has been promised and which is wanted by the staff and by the board, should have been omitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to an extension of the electricity supply to rural Ireland, before it can be extended to the rest of the country the power has first to be generated.  We are told that the generating plant already in existence is working to its peak capacity.  I was rather disappointed by the Minister's statement in reference to the total output of the various plants.  No reference has been made to the benefit that the country is likely to get from these power stations as a whole.  There is one aspect of rural life that needs particular <Col N="312" /> consideration.  As other Deputies have indicated, there are those towns and villages that are still unserved by the Electricity Supply Board.  They have to be considered, but it is the requirements of the agricultural community that I want particularly to refer to.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Electricity Supply Board might consider the possibility of making available to the agricultural community in this country not only light, but power on their farms as well.  It is important not only to illuminate the farmer's dwelling house, his cattle sheds and out-offices, but also to provide him with cheap power to operate,and rotate machinery on the farm for the pulping of roots, the grinding of surplus grain and work of that description, which is done by electricity in other countries.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I move: That this Bill be now read a Second Time.  It has been prepared in consequence of representations made to the Government regarding the difficult position that would occur in the colleges of the National University if a grave emergency should develop which would interfere with the elections of new governing bodies in these colleges.  The period of office of these bodies is limited by Charter to three years, and this triennial period terminates on January 31st next.  Arrangements for the election of new governing bodies should be made, in the normal course, at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for these elections, which is laid down in the statutes of the different colleges, includes the giving of notice to the graduate electors and the holding of elections within certain prescribed dates by the various appointing bodies&mdash;the graduates of the college, the local authorities, the <Col N="313" /> college staff, etc.  Furthermore, there is the question of postal voting to be considered.  It has been represented that many graduates who live abroad might find it very difficult, if not impossible, to take part in the election owing to the present abnormal postal delays.  There is the further point that it is considered undesirable to have contested elections in the University Colleges during the emergency. The Bill simply gives power to enable the period of office of the present governing bodies to be extended until the present emergency has passed.  It is provided that the extension of the period of office of the governing body of a college will be made only at the request of that body, and the time for which the period of office may be extended by an Order of the Government is limited to one year. Provision is included, however, for the making of a further Order before the termination of that extended period if the emergency should not have ended before then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister's explanation falls considerably short of what should be required by this House to justify a measure of this kind.  Apart from the difficulty which the Minister has mentioned about postal voting, I fail to see what particular harm could be done to the country by contested elections for the governing bodies of the University Colleges, and I think that the principle underlying this Bill of continuing for a further period the present governing bodies is undesirable and should not be resorted to without considerably stronger reasons than the Minister has given.  If it is proposed to take all stages of the measure to-night, I must indicate my dissent from that proposal and my opposition to it.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made by the President of University College, Dublin, on behalf of the governing body of that college, and communications have also been received from the University Colleges of Galway and Cork in regard to the difficulty of holding elections.  It has <Col N="314" /> been represented that it circumstances arose which would prevent the due carrying out of the usual statutory arrangements&mdash;they are all laid down in statutes governing the University&mdash; in the case of the colleges, the new governing bodies might not be legally constituted, and a difficult situation would arise.  Furthermore, notice has to be given to the graduate electors within a curtain period.  It is not possible to deal with the matter otherwise than by legislation.  Not less than three months before the end of the period of office of the governing bodies, notice of the fact must be given in writing to the appointing bodies and to each registered graduate of the college.</P>

Some of these graduates may reside at present in countries which are very far away, and there is no way of ascertaining whether the communications would reach them or, in any case, whether they could forward their votes.  Therefore it might happen that the election might be challenged.  Even if we had all the graduates in this country, we have no assurance that the present normal conditions may continue.  The main point, however, is that a considerable part of the electors are odtside the jurisdiction, and we do not know whether it is possible to get in touch with them.
