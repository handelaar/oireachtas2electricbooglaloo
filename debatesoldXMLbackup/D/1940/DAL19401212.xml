    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether it is proposed by his Department to exclude 350 children under the age of six years who are at present attending school in the Crumlin area from further attendance, in order to make room for another 350 children over six years of age who are at present without school facilities in the area, and, further, if he has received representations from the School Meals Committee in respect of the proposed exclusion of these children; also, whether he will state the estimated cost of providing free bus transport to and from the city schools for the children at present excluded or proposed to be excluded from attending school in the said area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to exclude from school any children in the Crumlin area who are at present attending school and no direction to exclude from school children under six years has been issued by my Department.  A copy of a resolution passed by the Dublin County Borough Meals Committee on the matter referred to by the Deputy has been received.  From information at the disposal of my Department, there is no necessity for the provision of a special transport service, and hence I have not made any inquiry as to the cost of such service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he has received any recommendations from parish managers of other schools in the city which these pupils formerly attended to the effect that they have facilities for them if the Minister will provide the transport to bring them in?  Take, for instance, Whitefriars Street School and another school in Inchicore.  There is room in these schools for 300 or 400 children and why should the children be left running around just because the transport is not available?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that is a separate question, but I may say, for the information of the Deputy, that provision has already been made for the accommodation of children of all parents living in corporation houses in the Crumlin South area.  In the Crumlin North area, provision is being made for the attendance of all children who come within the ages covered by the School Attendance Act.  I am not aware that the position which the Deputy apprehends obtains there and, as I have already told the House, I am informed that, under arrangements made by my Department, provision is being, or very shortly will be, made for all school-going children in both areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the new schools for which arrangements are being made will not be ready for two years?  In the meantime, it is stated by parish managers and local bodies that there are 800 children left without school accommodation and the free bus, which the Minister kindly provided up to recently to bring these children into the city, has been discontinued.  If it is not exceptionally costly, would the Minister consider renewing that service with a view to providing school facilities for these children?</P>

      <P>As I have explained, although there may be 800 children, only 300 of them are over six years of age.  It is hoped to make arrangements very shortly, if the arrangements have not already been made, to deal with these children.  I cannot hold out any hope whatever of re-establishing the bus service for the convenience of children in the Crumlin area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these lands were purchased by the present owner comparatively recently&mdash;ten years ago&mdash;at a cost of about £1,100, that the sum now being paid is approximately £740 and, further, is the Minister aware that before this man entered into purchase proceedings for the holding, he made every possible inquiry as to whether it was probable the Land Commission would acquire these lands and, through his solicitor, was informed by the Land Commission there was no such intention; that he then purchased the holding and that three or four years afterwards <Col N="1165" /> he was served with a notice to resume.  He contested that and won his case.  He was awarded £7 expenses but his expenses were much nearer £70 than £7.  Is the Minister aware that these lands are being acquired at £3 11s. per acre or, allowing for redemption, £2 15s.?  Does the Minister consider that land worth only £3 an acre is the sort of land which the Government should spend considerable sums in acquiring and distributing, apart from the damage it will do to the present owner who is in possession of somewhat similar land?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as I have stated.  The letter from the Land Commission stating they did intend to acquire the land is in my possession. The case went through two courts.

      <P>An effort was made&mdash; I do not know on whose representation&mdash;to facilitate the discussion of the motion in the Deputy's name relating to compulsory tillage. That motion was taken out of its order.  If the Deputy is not prepared to accept that special arrangement, we can put the motion back in its numerical order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some reason for doing that.  When the Act was passed which provided for similar orders, it was not visualised that 21 sitting days might run over a year.  It would be a very peculiar situation to find ourselves discussing a tillage order for 1941 in 12 months' time&mdash;when 1941 would be run out.  There will be no use in starting to discuss the revocation of this order next February, when it will have become operative.  If farmers have not shown reasonable preparation for breaking up fresh land, they can be prosecuted, while the question of revoking the order is still in suspense in this House.  I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Smith, has put himself to a lot of trouble to try to please everybody. If the question I am urging would dislocate the arrangement come to by Deputy Smith, I shall withdraw my objection.  If he could fit in the rest of the work to-day and grant us say another hour, I should be glad.  If he cannot do that, well, then, seeing the trouble that he went to yesterday and to-day to try to facilitate everybody I will withdraw my objection.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £12,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for Bounties on sugar made from home-grown beet on which drawback is paid, tobacco manufactured from home-grown leaf on which drawback is paid, tobacco grown in Éire after 1st January, 1934, allocated to a manufacturer and subsequently destroyed as unfit for manufacture, and unmanufactured tobacco grown in Éire and exported.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide for increased expenditure under sub-head A&mdash; bounties on exports of manufactured goods containing as an ingredient sugar made from home-grown beet.  The total amount required for the purpose is £12,000.  No saving is anticipated under the other sub-head of thé Vote &mdash;sub-head B&mdash;bounties on home-grown tobacco.  The original provision of £50,000 under sub-head A was based on the expectation that not more than 3,300 tons of &ldquo;home-grown sugar&rdquo; would be exported in manufactured goods during the year 1940-41.  These figures represented an increase of about 20 per cent. over the revised provision made in the preceding year. Such an increase was considered to be adequate, because although it was reasonable to expect that, in present circumstances, the demand from certain other countries for sugar composite goods would increase, account had also to be taken of the probability of a shortage of raw materials for the manufacture of such goods, and the need to conserve supplies for home consumption.</P>
    <P>The exports of home-grown sugar for the eight months ended 30th November, 1940, in the present financial year totalled 3,172 tons as against 2,576 tons exported in the whole of the financial year 1939-40.  So great an increase in exports resulting in payments of bounty totalling £48,105 for the first eight months of the current financial year, that is 96 per cent. of the provision made for the full year, was wholly unexpected.  However, for the <Col N="1169" /> remainder of the present financial year, having regard to the reduced amount of milk available in winter time for export in condensed milk and the restrictions on the export, save under licence, of other sugar composite goods &mdash;biscuits, chocolates, sugar confectionery, etc.&mdash;it is expected that the rate of export will show a reduction as compared with the first eight months of the year, and that in consequence the expenditure on bounties on such goods will not exceed £13,895 during the period 1st December, 1940, to 31st March, 1941.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose for which this additional sum is required are set out in the Estimates under the respective sub-heads. In connection with sub-head HH, I should perhaps explain to the House that, of the sum of £8,080 which is asked for there, the sum of £1,880 is in connection with the liquidation of displays in the trade promotion pavilion.  The House will remember that Ireland was represented at the New York World Fair in 1939, in two <Col N="1170" /> pavilions.  It was represented this year in only one pavilion, the historical and cultural pavilion.  In respect of the dismantling and liquidation of the displays in the trade pavilion, commitments to the order of £1,880 were incurred and were provided for in last year's Vote, but the accounts had not been vouched in time for payment last year, and accordingly it is necessary for us to re-vote that sum this year.  The balance of the Estimate is required for the maintenance, renovation and redecoration of the historical and cultural pavilion exhibit which was retained at the fair this year.</P>
    <P>The item under sub-head J is a re-Vote also.  The bulk of the moneys were not vouched in time, and the accounts were not presented for payment prior to the close of the last financial year.  In addition, since then a number of additional bore holes have been sunk, and it is necessary for us accordingly in this year to make provision for a grant in respect of the work which was done last year, and for the additional work which has been done since.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head L (2) a sum of £600 is asked as a Grant-in-Aid of the Turf Development Board, Limited, for general peat fuel development.  This amount is to be used for advertising with a view to increasing the sales of turf.  Considerable stocks of machine-won and hand-won turf remain in the hands of the producers and it is essential to find a market for such of this turf as is of good quality and is offered at an economic price.  It is desired as soon as possible to direct the attention of possible users to the fact that these stocks are available.  An additional sum of £20,000 is required towards the completion of the work at the Clonsast Bog.  The expenditure in connection with the bog to the 31st October last amounted to £193,000.  It is anticipated that the total amount which will be required for the full development and working of the bog is of the order of £263,000, of which £68,000 will be required for working capital.  At the moment, as the House is already aware, the bog is just getting into production.</P>

      <P>Production.  This year about 50,000 tons of machine-won turf have been produced and we are hopeful of finding a market for it.  This output has been secured, as I indicated to the House already, under somewhat unfavourable conditions in so far as the number of machines was just one-half of the total complement of machines required and the crews of those machines had to be trained to their working.  A sum of £13,685 is required under sub-head L (5) as a grant to the Turf Development Board for the development of Lullymore Bog, County Kildare.  As I indicated last night, this bog which was formerly the property of the Peat Fuel Company, has been taken over by the Turf Development Board, which has been asked to report at the end of 1941 upon the economic possibilities of producing briquettes at Lullymore, upon the basis of a limited capital expenditure approximating to £60,000, of which £25,000 is in respect of the purchase of the assets of the Peat Fuel Company itself and which ultimately found its way back into the Exchequer as a result of the partial repayment of the Government debentures. Of the remaining £35,000, £10,000 is required for the renovation and improvement of plant on the bog which formerly belonged to the company and £25,000 will be required for working capital.  Of this £25,000, a sum of about £3,685 has already been expended in building up a stock heap of granulated peat which will enable the company to get into production for the making of briquettes, it is hoped, early next year.</P>

      <P>A grant was made to Messrs. Fleming's Fireclays Ltd., who hold a lease of mining rights in South Laoghis, towards the cost of sinking three bore holes to determine the thickness of coal seams which were thought to exist there.  The grant which was not to exceed £2,000 was agreed upon on the basis that portion of the expense for each bore hole would be borne by the company.  The company was to bear 10 per cent. of the cost of the first bore-hole, 15 per cent. of the cost of the second bore-hole and 50 per cent. of the cost of the third.  Some small amounts have been paid out since 1938-39, and there remains £1,660 of the original amount.  Certain claims against this sum have been received but were not received in time to be paid during the last accounting year.  Some have since been received and some others are expected.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to let us know what will be the total amount paid when this additional £1,660 is paid over and I would like to have a little more explicit information as to the results of the expenditure of that money.  The Minister tells us that £1,600 is going to be paid to the Turf Development Board under the heading of general development as a Grant-in-Aid to carry on an advertising campaign. I understood the Minister to say that that whole amount was for advertising but even if it is only the £600 that is for advertising it emphasises <Col N="1173" /> that the Minister thinks that advertising is an important matter.  I think the Minister ought to take the occasion of the presentation of this Estimate to do a little rather prominent advertising and to do a little cheap advertising.  He has quite a length of time here this evening to tell us something about what the general position with regard to turf development now is.  Yesterday evening we had the Minister tossing overboard everything that was ever done about turf as an experiment, unfortunately not too successful, and he suggested that we ought not to allow our minds to be prejudiced with regard to his proposals now from the 12th December, 1940, onwards by any unsuccessful results in the past.  But it is particularly necessary, in view of the suggestion of the Minister and in view of what we all know in regard to some of the experiments in the past, particularly when the Minister is asking for £72,285 as the total Estimate for turf development during the current year, that we will have our minds put at ease, as far as the Minister is able to do so, by letting us know what exactly the position now is after the ground has been cleared by wiping out the past to some extent.</P>
      <P>There is one remarkable change in the presentation of this Estimate.  We are asked to devote a total amount of £57,000 in respect of Clonsast Bog as a Grant-in-Aid and a total amount of £13,685 for the development of Lullymore Bog as a Grant-in-Aid.  If the Estimates presented to the House in the years 1937-38, and 1938-39, are referred to, it will be seen that there is a note with regard to Clonsast:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Issues will be made for the purposes of this Grant-in-Aid with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and the amount issued will be repayable at such times and on such terms and conditions as the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may determine at the date of issue or subsequently.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is at page 271 of the Estimates for 1938-39, Estimate No. 57.  In an answer <Col N="1174" /> given a week ago, probably 28th November, 1940, the Minister stated the repayable advances paid in connection with peat fuel development up to the 31st March, 1940, in respect of Clonsast had been £158,600.  Repayable advances were paid to Clonsast to the extent of £158,600 up to the 31st March, 1940.  I would like to know from the Minister if any part of that amount has been repaid from Clonsast.  I understand from the Minister it has not and, therefore, the change in the presentation of the Estimate to the House as far as Clonsast is concerned seems to suggest that we have now departed from a Grant-in-Aid, which is a repayable advance, and that the £57,000 which it is anticipated will be paid to Clonsast during the current year is a payment out that is not going to be repayable in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand our difficulty.  A sum of money to the extent of £158,600 having been paid out over the last three years to Clonsast as a repayable advance, and no money having come back, the Minister now changes the presentation of his Estimate so that, in respect of the £57,000 that is anticipated will be paid out of Clonsast this year, he may tell the House: &ldquo;You can see the form in which this Estimate is presented; we expect no return of this money.&rdquo;  As regards Clonsast, I should like the Minister to tell the House what is being done there, either as a plain business proposition or as a plain experiment. I should like him to give us, in respect of Clonsast, an objective picture.  We would like to know what is going to be done there with this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any advertisement is worth while paying for to get the people to change their domestic arrangements so as to make use of turf it ought to be clearly indicated that if there is to be a change it will be on a long-term basis, not like the change that took place in Government offices at the beginning of the turf scheme, when 258,000 sacks were distributed through the country and special flat rates were made with the railways <Col N="1175" /> in order to bring turf to Dublin at a particular price and great bones were made about the distributing organisation that would have to be set up in Dublin in order to distribute the turf. You do not want anything on that basis.  That ran for a year or so and then the popularity of turf, even in Government offices, seemed to wane very much.</P>
    <P>If the Minister really wants to clear his present proposals from the uneasy feeling that we have with regard to the past, and if he wishes to give his present proposals a chance of being looked at objectively and helped in every possible way, then he ought to re-state the Clonsast position, he ought to tell us something of the finances of the scheme, the nature of the work that is going to be done there and what are the hopes for the future.  Is this the last grant that is going to be sunk in Clonsast?  Is it going to stand on its feet after this year, either as an experiment or as a commercial proposition?</P>
    <P>We would also like the Minister to tell us what arrangement will be necessary to reclaim this land.  When the peat is taken from the Clonsast area, is that going to be left a wet, bleak stretch or a dry, bleak stretch?  What arrangements are being made to see that a certain amount of reclamation will be carried out there, and can we have some idea of what the cost of that reclamation will be?  The Minister is aware that each new holding established in Meath for persons coming from the Gaeltacht involved an expenditure of £900, which was irrecoverable because of the cost of the land and the assistance that had to be given to the people from the Gaeltacht.  If there is going to be a re-settlement on any reclaimed land in Clonsast, I am quite sure that the cost of re-settlement and reclamation would certainly be not less, as a matter of total irrecoverable expenditure, than was the settlement in Meath.  So much for Clonsast, which we ought to have properly pictured for the House.</P>
    <P>Then there is a proposal for the expenditure of £13,685 at Lullymore. <Col N="1176" /> In that case also repayable advances to the extent of £44,000 have been issued up to 31st March, 1940.  Has any of that money been returned?  Is it anticipated any of it will be returned, and when?  Why is it, in the Estimate now being presented, that the whole of the £13,685 is mentioned without any reference to the possibility of sums being repaid under such terms as the Minister for Finance, after consulting the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may determine?  That also suggests that this is in the nature of an unplumbed experiment and the money we are now putting into Lullymore, as well as the money that has gone into it already, is not expected to be returned.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to understand that, in view of what we have seen in the past, and after four or five years' experience of this kind of experiment and an expenditure of a lot of money, we may be inclined to feel certain doubts with regard to the proposals put before us.  Up to the 31st March last there had been expended, over a period of six years, something like £627,188.  Of that sum £423,138 had been expended from State sources alone&mdash;moneys voted explicitly for turf and turf development&mdash;and £204,050 had been expended out of relief grants.  After an experience of that kind, we may very well feel that the proposals put before us now represent the same kind of unpromising proposals as came before us in the past.</P>
    <P>If Ministers were assured of anything in the past it was that turf might be the saving of this country, that turf could be built up to be the second most important industry in the country. Nothing was left undone in the line of advertisement.  After all that, we may very well have our qualms now with regard to the future.  We cannot but say to ourselves: &ldquo;Hang it all, Ministers must have seen all that and they must have learned something and they cannot, with the financial stringency so great on the country as it is, be going blindly ahead with an experiment of this kind.  In the light of past experience surely they must review the position to-day and be in a position to realise what the prospects are?&rdquo;  I <Col N="1177" /> would like the Minister to indicate clearly to us what the position is, so that we may know if there is any justification for the type of feeling that some of us have in regard to these proposals. The only way to give us such information is, as I say, by forgetting the past if you like, and by stating in objective terms to-day what the Minister expects from Clonsast and Lullymore. He should state as far as possible the financial commitments in which the State may be involved for the future on this type of development and the type of profits he expects to be made in these places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to second very strongly what Deputy Mulcahy has said here to-day.  Whether we like it or not, we are trustees of public money. You have the right, if you want to, and if you are a wealthy man, to expend large sums out of your own private purse in the pursuit of some foible in which you happen to take a peculiar interest, but we have no right to tax the people of the country, who are already heavily taxed for essential services, to pour their money down the drain.  I get the feeling on every occasion when we return to the discussion of expenses on these turf proposals that we are in a sort of fog. Nobody knows their beginning, nobody knows their end.  Nobody can feel that there will come a time when the Minister can say: &ldquo;We are now making a profit on Clonsast&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;We are making a profit on the entire operations of the Turf Board and it is now in a position when it can progressively liquidate the debts which have accrued and we can consider how we shall dispose of the profits.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is now leaving the House, knows that he has spent very large sums of money on turf development. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has spent very large sums on turf development.  Nobody sees that more than a person who occupies the position which I have the honour to occupy at the moment as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  When you come to examine the Accounting Officer for the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to the expenditure <Col N="1178" /> on turf development, you find that a very large part of the money spent is not his responsibility at all. It is astonishing the amount of money that is being laid out in connection with these enterprises, for the expenditure of which the sole justification was that they facilitated in one way or another the operations of the Turf Development Board.</P>
      <P>We have all got to recognise that there are such things as political prestige and that once extravagant speeches have been made describing the rosy prospects of any particular enterprise, there is a great temptation on the Government to pour more and more money into it in order to avoid the appearance of a fiasco.  But when we are asking the people to make such substantial sacrifices as they are being asked for at present and as they may be asked for in the future, and when we are constrained to refuse benefits to certain sections of the community that we feel we ought to give but simply cannot afford to give at present, it does seem to me something approximating to reckless imprudence to appropriate hundreds of thousands of pounds for an enterprise in which, as far as I can find out, nobody has any confidence.  The best the Minister can say is that it is an experiment and that he hopes something will come out of it. He will not commit himself to say: &ldquo;I stake my reputation after having heard the experts that these schemes will ultimately justify the expenditure of the money we are at present spending on them&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself has been Minister for Finance and he has known how often he has felt acute distress on having to veto some admirable proposal on the ground that there was no money to pay for it.  I ask him now to cast his mind back to the day when he was Minister for Finance and to ask himself the question: &ldquo;If the same case were made to me in my office as I have been making on this Vote, could I, in conscience, have recommended to the Executive Council that in order to finance this mad plan, we ought to put aside family allowances, to put aside the claims of teachers in industrial <Col N="1179" /> schools and to postpone a variety of other valid requests that have been made to us on the ground that we have no money?&rdquo;  I do not wish to drag a whole lot of irrelevancies into this debate but the House will recollect that yesterday I asked certain concessions for a small group of people which would cost only a few thousand pounds.  In making that request I felt strongly the force of the reply given by the Minister for Finance which had been made on a previous occasion to a similar representation: &ldquo;We have every sympathy with your case; we think there is a great deal to be said for it but the difficulty is that we cannot put our hands on the money because Army expenditure and every other expenditure has gone up and this very necessary act of justice must be postponed.&rdquo; I have seen the people for whom that act of justice was asked dying off.  At the same time I am asked to vote a sum for Lullymore Bog far in excess of what would abate that injustice for all time.  Surely the Minister for Industry and Commerce has often asked himself the question as to whether he is justified in committing the country to an expenditure of this kind at such a time?</P>
    <P>There is a new atmosphere abroad in the country at present.  You could understand two or three years ago, when things were pretty hot and political acrimony was active, that Ministers felt a sort of justification in spending public money to preserve the Government from the scandal that might be created by the failure of any considerable Government scheme.  It was justifiable perhaps to expend public money to avert such a failure in order that greater good might come. Everyone is now prepared, however, without regard to political considerations to review proposals on their merits with a view to helping the country in any way we can.  I do not believe that, in that atmosphere, schemes such as these should be brought before the House.  As Deputy Mulcahy has stated we are prepared, with profound reluctance, to abstain from a positive refusal of these moneys <Col N="1180" /> if the Minister is prepared to say to us that at some given date he is going to call a halt to this business and that he is going to say to these people: &ldquo;There is no use saying to us that if we give you million after million after million, some day you will produce something.  You have got to carry conviction to my mind that at some reasonably ascertainable future date, I can go before the House and say: &lsquo;We have passed the paying out stage; now we are going to get something back.&rsquo; If you cannot say that we had better jettison the whole thing and admit its failure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should be long sorry to see this Vote passed through the Dáil without its being recorded in the records of the House that as far as I am concerned, and I think as far as most of my colleagues are concerned, we have no confidence in this experiment at all.  Nothing further than an assurance from the Minister, after consultation with the experts of his Department, that he is satisfied that these experiments will ultimately yield a return on the money expended on them, would justify us in consenting to these Estimates being voted without a division.  I could draw up a long indictment in connection with the bags and the hand-won turf to which I referred yesterday and I could make a good deal of political capital out of them at the expense of the present Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence and the Minister for Supplies. I am prepared to waive all that. All we want is that these matters should be cleared up, that we should know, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, where we are going and what the limit of our contingent liability is going to be.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I want to raise in connection with the Estimate and that relates to sub-head J.  I understood that the governing principle of mineral exploration was that if a citizen of this State went in to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and said: &ldquo;I think there are minerals in a certain area and if I get a lease and a licence to explore that area and an undertaking from you that I will get the right to extract the minerals if I <Col N="1181" /> find them, I am prepared to go ahead,&rdquo; and that, in consideration of these representations, the Minister was prepared to say: &ldquo;If you are going to spend your money looking for the minerals, I am prepared to say to you that, in the event of your finding them, you will get a lease to exploit them.&rdquo; That is fair enough.  If the lease is probably going to be of a valuable character the Minister says: &ldquo;I am going to lay the terms of the agreement on the Table of the Dáil and I will recommend it to Dáil Eireann for confirmation.&rdquo;  On confirmation, the individual went forward with the exploration either with his own or with friends' money, and if he found something he reaped a rich harvest, and if he found nothing he lost his money. That is a fair rough and ready way of getting the mineral deposits of the country exploited to their full potentiality.</P>
    <P>But, what justification can there be for a citizen coming in and saying: &ldquo;I think there are minerals in Laoighis-Offaly and I not only want the right to explore them and the right ultimately to exploit them, but I want to be paid for going to look for them.&rdquo;?  That does not seem to me fair at all.  If the Government think it worth while to pour public money down bore holes in Laoighis-Offaly, they ought to do the exploration themselves.  If the minerals are there and are exploitable, let the profit accrue to the public purse.  If the public purse is going to take a financial risk, why should an individual reap the profit?  Is there any precedent for making contributions of this kind to individuals for the purpose of mineral exploration?  If there is, I never heard of it.  It seems to me to upset the whole basis upon which the system of prospecting for minerals has been established.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when he comes to deal with that to tell us quite definitely what the policy of the Government is in that regard.  I suggest to him that the proper policy is that, if an apparently solvent person or corporation approaches him whom he believes to be <i>bona fide</i>, he ought to give the lease and licence sought, submit <Col N="1182" /> it to Dáil Eireann in the usual way for approval, and then tell them to take all or lose all.  If, on the other hand a person approaches him in respect of mineral development and says, &ldquo;I could not go on with this unless you are prepared to put up money&rdquo;, and the Minister feels that the proposition is of a character that would justify a contribution from the Government, he ought, instead of making a contribution, to take over the prospecting functions himself on behalf of the people and, if a mineral deposit materialises, exploit it as a State property.  I can imagine Deputy Hickey intervening and charging me with having become a socialist. I do not think that is socialism at all; I think it is commonsense.</P>

      <P>The outstanding difficulty in all this matter regarding peat and turf is that it seems to be impossible to get any definite information. We have to look back over the last five or six years.  We have a Turf Development Board which was set up about six years ago.  But that was not the start of it.  Before the Turf Board was set up, a great deal of expert information on this whole question of development of peat fuel had been collected and was available to the Government and to the Turf Board.  It is not easy, of course, to get anything like accurate figures as to the consumption of turf, but so far as we know there is no more turf consumed in this country to-day than there was six years ago.  There may be an increase this year, but that will be due, I suggest, not so much to any activity on the part of either the Government or the Turf Board, as to the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> But, having established a Turf Board, the Government started on a publicity campaign.  Now that the Minister is asking for a further £600 for publicity, it is interesting to note that since the establishment of the Turf Board publicity has cost £6,500 odd.  It is more interesting to note that more than two-thirds of the £6,500 was spent in the first two years that the board was operating.  It must be remembered that the Government at the end of that two or three years changed their mind and came to the conclusion that there was not much use appealing to the public through the Press to burn turf, and then we had a Bill introduced to make the burning of turf compulsory. The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, notwithstanding the opposition that was put up to the Bill, insisted on putting it on the Statute Book and then leaving it there.  That was the second period or compulsory period.  That having failed, we have now gone back again to try to move the public at a cost of a further £600.</P>
    <P>What I should like to know from the Minister is this: are we now in the position that we are producing more turf than we have any possible chance of selling?  Can the Minister tell us how much of the turf produced for sale this year has been sold, or is likely to be sold during the present season?  Or, are we in this position: that we have produced considerably more turf than we are likely to sell and that, notwithstanding that, the House is being asked to vote many more thousands of pounds to produce still more turf? Now, as I say, it is difficult to discuss this matter because we cannot get definite information.  Speaking from my own local knowledge, and assuming that what is happening within the area I am aware of is typical, in so far as the Turf Development Board have been successful in selling turf they have been largely successful in selling it to people who were formerly supplied by private turf sellers&mdash;the man who cut his own turf on his own bog, almost always with the help of his family, and sold it to the local consumers.  The position is to some extent&mdash;I do not know to what extent, but to some extent at any rate <Col N="1184" />&mdash;that this House is being asked to subsidise the Turf Development Board against that particular type of man. Now, £600,000 is a big sum of money. It is a great sum of money for a country like this, and we cannot get from the Minister or from anybody else a picture of what the country has got in return from the expenditure of that very large sum.  We cannot get from the Minister or from the Turf Development Board information as to how far, if at all, they have been successful: whether they hope to make progress and, if so, how far that progress is going to go.  We are asked here to vote for Lullymore, and might I ask the Minister in this connection if that bog was before us in this House on any former occasion under any other name, because I must confess that this is the first time I have heard of it here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was up to the 31st March, 1940.  What I want to know is this: whether those two sums were given to two separate companies: <Col N="1185" /> were they operating independently of each other: whether the £65,000 and the £44,000 were given to the same company, and were they producing similar types of briquettes on the two bogs?  In any case, however, what I am coming to is this: we&mdash;this House&mdash; have poured, in something under three years, a sum of over £100,000 into bogs in Kildare in order to see if we could produce briquettes at an economic price, and the end of that experiment was that notwithstanding the £100,000 or £109,000 that were paid out, the company went under and went out of production completely in less than three years.  So far as I can follow the Minister&mdash;I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;I understand that he is asking for £25,000&mdash;I think he mentioned the figure £25,000&mdash;to ascertain again whether briquettes can be now produced economically.  Am I quoting the Minister correctly?  I do not wish to misquote him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the experience that we have had at Carbury and Lullymore already, with our £65,000, as I say, gone down the bog-hole, and the £44,000?  It seems to me that, if that is so, this thing has become so serious that it would be almost a scandal to proceed further with it.  I had one experience with the briquettes produced at Carbury. Briquettes produced at Carbury sold, wholesale, at 15/- per ton&mdash;that is, briquettes wired, not loose in sacks&mdash; loaded on the canal, delivered off the canal boat on the canal, and the freight on the ton of briquettes was 2d. more than the cost of the briquettes themselves. Now, are we being asked to vote another £13,000 or £25,000, or whatever the sum is, to carry on that, and if it were undertaken as an experiment, surely to goodness, for one or <Col N="1186" /> two bogs in one county £109,000 is enough to pay for any experiment, and to a company that was unable to last, even with that amount of money placed at their disposal, for more than three years?</P>
      <P>I have a feeling&mdash;probably a great many people will not agree with me&mdash; that if there is demand for turf in this country it can be produced, will be produced, and will be sold by the people who always produced it and sold it, on practically as advantageous terms, anyway, as the Turf Development Board can do it.  That brings us up to another point.  To what extent has the turf which is being sold by the Turf Development Board been sold to new customers?  To what extent are they merely replacing the people who, as I said, always cut turf with their own help and the help of their families on their own bogs and who sold it to the consumers?  I doubt if this Turf Development Board has justified its existence in any way.  I understand that there are four members of that board.  Mind you, we are asked not only to place all this money at their disposal, but there is also a footnote to it, that they are not to be responsible in any way to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for that money or as to how it is to be expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Deputy may be under a misapprehension, that does not imply that the accounts are not going to be audited.  They are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now a moment.  So far as this House is concerned, once it votes money, the only check that this House has on the expenditure of that money, and the only way in which the House can ensure that the money is spent on the purpose for which it was voted and for no other purpose, is by having the check and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It may be said that because this is largely experimental it would not be easy to have it subjected to the ordinary test applied by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but if Deputies will look at sub-head J, where we are voting £1,600 for work which is also <Col N="1187" /> to a certain extent experimental, there is no qualification there&mdash;there is no restriction, and it is not more or less reserved as the other item is.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as being against any effort that is made to develop turf.  I know something about the industry, and I tried for a few years, in a small way, to push the development of turf and to sell it in the newest and most economical form.  Unfortunately, I did not find it a success. I suggest that this House should not be asked at a time like this to vote thousands of pounds for the further development of bogs, unless the Minister can prove that what we are able to produce with our present equipment and organisation is insufficient to meet demands.  I would be very pleased, indeed, if the Minister could satisfy us on that point, but I doubt it very much. He is now going to spend a further £600 on publicity.  When the scheme was started £1,000, and then £2,000 yearly, was spent on publicity and we had something like 158 turf societies. That was four years ago.  The enthusiasm has so far gone out of the turf development scheme that, I understand, there are now only 32 societies in existence.  That does not show very much sign of development, and my information is that most of the turf societies in existence are in the two counties getting these huge sums for development, Leix and Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will find it hard to justify this Estimate.  Unless he is in a position to give a good deal more definite information than he gave when introducing it, I doubt if the House would be justified in passing it.  I should like to know, arising out of the Estimate, and for no personal reason, whether the members of the Turf Board, of whom there are four, are part-time or full-time; what exactly are their duties; and if one of them is there fulltime, or what amount of time they give to a project that is costing an enormous sum of money?  Finally, as a matter of information, I should like to know how they are paid or what fees they receive.  I put it to the Minister again that the expenditure of this huge <Col N="1188" /> amount of money by the State cannot be justified, if the final effect is that, to a very large extent, the activities of this board are merely to replace work that was formerly carried out by private individual living in the vicinity of bogs who, with paid help, were able to produce turf at a fairly low cost and sell it to those who required it.</P>
    <P>I know that it is difficult to give reliable figures about the consumption of turf, and to say whether or not there is an upward tendency as a result of all the money spent on development and publicity.  While a sum of about £6,500 has been spent on publicity the strange thing about that is that two-thirds of the amount was spent in the first four years of the existence of the Turf Board.</P>

As the Fair is over it seems to me that the House should have been presented with that bill before now.  However, let that pass.  It does seem to be an eloquent commentary on the present situation that presumably industries which were then advertised are now shut down, and we do not know what prospect there is of starting them again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

I would like to ask the Minister if he could give information definitely to the House when he is replying, and say what the total loss to the State was by the operation of the Peat Fuel Company at Ticknevin? Would he tell us what the figure was in connection with the development carried out by the Peat Fuel Company at Lullymore and what is the difference between Kilberry and Lullymore? Were they always coupled?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that development operations were carried out by <Col N="1191" /> the Peat Fuel Company at Lullymore. Is no credit taken for these developments? I would like the Minister to tell the House about that.  He may not appreciate that it is a highly controversial matter and it is his responsibility to satisfy the House that some economic advantage will accrue in the expenditure of these considerable sums of money.  Will he tell us what change in the system of winning turf the Turf Development Board intends to effect to secure economic production?  Has he examined that aspect of the case himself, or has he consulted experts?  Can he tell the House where the Peat Fuel Company failed in economic production and where he hopes that the Turf Development Board is now going to succeed in the same type of production, or similar production, in machine-won turf?  Is there a difference in the design of the machine?  Was the management wrong in the first instance, or will he make the position clear as to where the original Peat Fuel Company failed?  What are the hopes of success and is he satisfied that there are reasonable hopes of success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not against the expenditure of money for the production of turf, if the Minister can satisfy me that there is reasonable hope of producing turf at an economic price, that turf can be produced at a price to compete with the price of coal in a normal period. I think that is the real snag&mdash;that we can get our coal at such a low price that it is not possible to produce turf in competition with it.  In other words, is the market there?  I know that people on the bogs this year have been encouraged to produce large quantities of hand-won turf.  I see all over the country tremendous stock of turf and, so far as I can see, there is no market there at the moment.  Does the Minister now propose to try to encourage the burning of peat fuel and expend £600 for advertising, to secure any sort of decent price for those unfortunate people who have been encouraged to win turf on the bogs, in a particularly good year?  We had a very dry year, and I am sure that there has been very good turf as a result.  There are large stocks of turf over the bogs <Col N="1192" /> in Kildare and neighbouring counties and, so far as I can see, it is not being sold in any great quantities.  For that reason, it does appear&mdash;and in this I agree with Deputy Morrissey&mdash;that it is doubtful if we have a market at all or can hope to compete with coal in a normal period.  At the moment, perhaps, we may be able to do so, in this emergency situation, but in the normal period, can we hope to produce turf at an economic price compared with the price of coal?</P>
    <P>There is one other question I should like to ask the Minister, and that is in regard to Clonsast.  Will he tell us if the price proposed to be contracted for by the Turf Development Board, of a sum of 10/6 per ton, or one-third the cost of coal at the Pigeon House to the Electricity Supply Board, is contingent on the spending of a sum of approximately £190,000&mdash;as well as I can make out the figure given by the Minister?  Will the State be recouped at any time for this amount of money? In other words, is the taxpayer being asked to spend a sum of approximately £200,000 in order to provide cheap fuel for the Electricity Supply Board, to supply cheap electricity to some consumers and at the same time deny other taxpayers, the agricultural community, an opportunity to buy electricity? If we are spending a sum of approximately £200,000 on the development of Clonsast Bog in order to provide turf at 10/6, or one-third the price of coal at the Pigeon House, at least the State ought to be able to look forward to a time when it will be recouped for that outlay.  I would like the Minister to tell us if there is any hope of that money coming back to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of this Party, both privately and publicly, during the past five or six years, have given every encouragement to this Government to go ahead with the peat development policy.  Therefore, I am not to be taken as opposed to the policy now pursued by the Government on this matter.  Whether turf is being produced at an economic price, when compared to the price of coal under present-day conditions, is a matter <Col N="1193" /> that I am not competent to discuss. That cannot be discussed and decided in a debate of this kind, and cannot be decided, in any case, without more figures and more information from the Minister, or from those who are behind him on the Turf Development Board and who are the only persons capable of giving such information and advice.</P>
      <P>The only thing that surprises me, as an individual Deputy and as a citizen, is that we seem to be getting, and anxious to get, a good deal more coal brought into the country at a time when we are supposed to be at the peak of this turf development policy. We are prepared, apparently, to take unlimited quantities of coal from Britain at whatever price British coal owners fix, at a time when they have no alternative market.  That is why I should like more information than has been given to the House, up to the present, as to the increase in the production of turf and the sale of turf by the Turf Development Board since it was constituted.  It is quite correct&mdash; as Deputy Morrissey says&mdash;that a very large amount is being spent on publicity. What is the purpose of this costly publicity campaign?  Is it for the purpose of persuading the different Departments of the Government to buy more turf when it is available?  Can we have from the Minister figures to show the quantity of turf purchased by all Government Departments over a period of three or four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From observation, it appears to me that there is less turf being consumed in Government offices and buildings than heretofore.  I have no figures to support my statement on that, but I invite the Minister to give them.  He is the only person in a position to give them.  As I have said, it appears to me from observation that less turf is being consumed in Government offices as the years go by.  When this peat development policy was first initiated, every office in Government Buildings that one visited was burning turf, and the same applied to other Departments outside Government Buildings.  I would like to know if there has been a falling off in the consumption of turf in the different Government Departments, <Col N="1194" /> and if we can have figures produced to show whether there has been an increase or decrease.  In any case, there is no necessity, in my opinion, to spend any money on advertising the sale of turf by the Development Board so far as the Government itself is concerned. What is the value, if any, of spending money on a publicity campaign to encourage people living in flats in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and such centres to buy more turf when, in most cases, those people have no storage accommodation for any reasonable quantity of turf?  I would like to know whether there has been an increase in the quantity of turf sold to people living in cities, and where has the increased consumption, if any, been during the past year or two.  I should be glad if the Minister would give us figures to show the percentage of turf sold direct, if it is being sold direct by the Turf Development Board, to Government Departments, or am I to understand that the turf consumed in the different Government Departments is bought indirectly from the Turf Development Board through agents?  I should also like to have figures showing the percentage of the turf produced that is sold direct to retailers, wholesalers and Government Departments.  These would be very interesting figures if we could get a hold of them.</P>
    <P>I know that turf is being sold by the Turf Development Board, through agents, to some of our new industrial concerns.  I am glad to recognise that there are some, even though they only represent a limited number, of such concerns helping to increase the sale of turf, and thereby encourage the Government to go ahead with their turf development policy. Why is it that the Turf Development Board are in such cases selling the turf through agents, and not selling it direct to the concerns making use of it?</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is the procedure adopted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, naturally has a good deal of control over the spending of the money voted by this House to the Turf Development Board, so far as contracts for the publicity <Col N="1195" /> campaign are concerned.  Am I to understand that all the publicity agents are invited to send in estimates periodically for this particular work, or is it to be understood that some particular firm has got a monopoly for the publicity side of this work?  A sum of £6,500 has been spent during the past few years.  Can we have it from the Minister whether all the money already paid out for publicity has been voted and paid to one concern?</P>

      <P>A certain amount of money is asked for under the Supplementary Estimate.  In this case, the Supplementary Estimate covers many items.  So far, the debate has been very relevant as to the purposes for which this money is required and the policy behind peat development schemes.  The expenditure of £6,500 over past years, and accounting for the items thereof, does not arise on a Supplementary Estimate which asks for £600 for advertising.</P>

      <P>There is a certain sum contained in this Supplementary Estimate for publicity.  I assume it has not been paid out before being voted by the House.  Is that so, Sir?  At any rate, if that is not a fair question, will the Minister give the House an idea of the procedure which will be adopted in this case by the Turf Development Board in spending money on further publicity?  I am mainly concerned <Col N="1196" /> to find out whether all these publicity agents are being given a fair chance to tender for this particular type of work.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to encourage the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go further ahead and speed up the peat development policy.  I would be very glad to see him take over a few more of the very large bogs that are situate in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, and work them on the same lines as Clonsast is being worked at the present time.  I paid a hurried visit to Clonsast on two occasions within the last few years, and I gladly recognise the fact that an increasing number of people are being employed there, and that, as far as I can judge, very valuable work is being carried out there. Unlike Deputy Hughes and other people, I do not profess to be competent to go into the question of the economic price of turf versus coal.</P>

We are passing through very critical times and it is recognised, I think, by Deputies on all sides of the House that it is desirable, during these difficult days, to encourage everybody to produce more of the things which are essential for the carrying on of the country.  We are all prepared to say that there should be more food produced. I am prepared to go further and say that we should encourage those in a position to do so to produce more turf for the same reason.</P>

      <P>The Minister is unfortunate in having to try to justify and to put across an Estimate of this sort.  Unlike Deputy Davin, who said he had been a supporter of this type of adventure for the last five or six years, I always thought it a type of mild lunacy, and I said so.  As a matter of fact, in 1938, when the previous Minister asked for a grant of £35,000, after we had already put £90,000 and £65,000 into Lullymore or some one of the bogs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I objected and asked for particulars from the then Minister as to the benefits that would accrue to the country and the taxpayers from the investment of the money in that enterprise.  We were then told by this Minister's predecessor that, at least, we had this assurance, that the company had gone a certain distance&mdash;they were on the brink of success&mdash;and all they wanted was another sum of £35,000 to ensure success.  I asked further what would happen if they did not succeed, and he then said that we would at least have the valuable machinery of that company.  What appears to me to be a point which is missed is that if the briquettes manufactured by that company were not a success at that time, there was some reason for their not being a success, and surely if, in the emergency which has lately arisen, they are not able to maintain an economic place in the market against coal, they will never be able to do so and there is no use in thinking that they will.  If the Minister were able to say to the House: &ldquo;We are changing the machinery there and we are going to change the type of output, and we hope to make it a success now,&rdquo; I might be inclined to give him another chance, but what does he tell us?  He tells us that £10,000 of this money is to repair machinery which has been a failure. That is what we are asked to vote now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  This machinery has been a failure so far as producing an economic article is concerned and the company has failed. Notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayers have put practically £200,000 into it, it has failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and now, on the basis of the same machinery&mdash;repaired, renovated and brought up to date, but still the same machinery&mdash;we are asked to make a further contribution.  If it was a form of mild lunacy at one time, I think it has gone much beyond that now.  As Deputy Davin and others have pointed out, at this hour of the day, after six years' hard working between the Fianna Fáil Party and, as Deputy Davin said, the Labour Party, to advertise this turf campaign and after all the money spent on it, we are now asked, in this emergency, when, if turf was ever able to compete with coal, it should be able to do so now, to spend another £600 on advertising that fuel.  I do not think any case at all has been made for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person in the House without exception is anxious for successful development.  One is as anxious as the other for that success, but this matter of the development of bogs all over Europe, as I pointed out two years ago &mdash;and I did not get any satisfactory answer from the Minister&mdash;is an open book.  Other countries with much greater resources than we have have tried it and their efforts so far have not been crowned with success.  All the details regarding their efforts are there to be seen, but apparently we are to be pioneers.  I do not agree with that and I do not think we can afford it. When the Minister was introducing an Estimate of this sort, I think he should at least have equipped himself with the figures necessary to convince the House that a different effort was now to be made which would have some hope of success.  That does not appear to be the case.  It appears that we intend <Col N="1200" /> to proceed along the very same lines as those on which we lost money previously.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Davin wants to see more bogs in Kildare developed, I do not want to see such development, unless it is successful development.  I do not want to see another penny of the taxpayers' money spent on bogs until we have some assurance of success and until the reason for the previous failure is pointed out and until we are able to lay our fingers on it and say: &ldquo;There is where we failed and we will avoid that next time.&rdquo;  The Minister has not given us any indication that that will be done.  I did not intend to speak on this Estimate but I felt that I would not be justified as a public representative if I did not protest against the expenditure of public money on a matter like this which has proved itself a failure so far, and in respect to which neither the Minister, nor any other person on his behalf, has tried to enlighten the House with regard to any method which will make it a success, with the investment of this money as well as the previous money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps before I touch on the question of turf I had better deal with the other matter which was raised by Deputy Dillon. He referred to subhead J and wanted to know the principles upon which grants-in-aid of mineral exploration were made.  He suggested that the principle upon which we had hitherto worked was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would give to a person who he thought was a fit and proper person, equipped with the necessary finances and technical knowledge, a prospecting lease, on the understanding that if the person in question made the necessary explorations and was successful in finding valuable mineral deposits, in due course the Minister would grant him a mining lease of the deposit in question. He suggested that it would be quite contrary to good practice to assist a person who had secured a prospecting lease from the Minister to carry out necessary borings and other operations required to ascertain whether or not a mineral deposit of value was actually to be found within <Col N="1201" /> the area covered by the prospecting lease.  That is not the principle upon which we have hitherto operated and I should, in that connection, like to direct the particular attention of the House to the fact that this is a re-vote of a grant which was made in the Estimates for 1938-39, when, presumably, the advisability or otherwise of making such a grant was discussed at length and the grant was approved by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, however, to point out why we have not been able to follow the course which, Deputy Dillon suggests, is the proper course, in the exploitation and development of such mineral resources as we have.  Unfortunately, there are comparatively few people with the enthusiasm and financial resources to take an optimistic view of our mineral deposits.  Almost invariably, we are up against a proposition of this sort: a person comes along to us and says: &ldquo;I think there is a mineral to be found in such a district; I am prepared to take a chance and sink some of my own money in proving whether or not my opinion is a correct one, but I am not able to finance the necessary operations to their full extent.  I understand that the Government and the community at large would like to see such mineral resources as we have proved and developed.  Accordingly, I am prepared to risk a certain amount of my own money, if the Government will give me a grant which will enable me to complete the operation.&rdquo;  The choice we are up against is whether we shall turn down that proposal completely and leave whatever prospect of mineral development there may be in that district unexplored and unexploited, or whether we shall, for the sake of the national good which will result from the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit, make a small contribution towards the cost.  That was precisely what happened here.  A gentleman came to us, said he was prepared to undertake the necessary operations and to finance them, in part, if we would assist him by contributing the balance of the cost. As I have indicated, a grant was made to him on the following basis&mdash;that we should contribute up to 90 per cent. of the cost of the first bore-hole, 85 per <Col N="1202" /> cent. of the cost of the second bore-hole, and 50 per cent. of the cost of the third bore-hole.  Upon that basis, the area covered by this gentleman's lease was explored.</P>
    <P>Three bore-holes have been sunk on the area in question&mdash;the first to a depth of 450 feet, the second to a depth of 293 feet and the third to a depth of 426 feet.  No coal was found in the first bore-hole so that, if we lost 90 per cent. of the cost of that bore-hole, the prospector lost all the money he had invested in it to the extent of 10 per cent. of the cost.  In the second bore-hole, a seam 13½ inches thick was traversed and in the third bore-hole a seam six inches thick was got. One of these seams was obviously unworkable and the other seams, judged by normal standards, would be deemed unworkable.  We may take it, therefore, that we had no success in that particular area.  But it is an area in regard to which representations have been made to me very frequently that coal is to be found.  The question is whether or not we should spend more money in trying to find coal in that area, and whether, if another person, or the same gentleman, should come forward and say he was anxious to make another attempt, we should endeavour to help him to such an extent as would appear in the public interests to be justifiable.  That is the principle on which these grants in aid of mining operations are made.</P>
    <P>As I have touched upon that, I should like to make reference to a point made by Deputy Morrissey in which he drew attention to the fact that the grant under sub-head (J) was not qualified with the same condition and footnote as the grants made to the Turf Development Board are qualified. That is to say, that in the case of the grants made to the Turf Development Board, it is stated that they will not be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and unexpended portions of the sums issued from the grants will not be surrendered at the close of the financial year, but any portions not so issued will be surrendered.  That is the usual practice in relation to Grants-in-Aid.  In fact, the grant made under sub-head (J) is technically not a Grant-in-Aid.  It <Col N="1203" /> remains under the control of the accounting officer during the whole of the period until the accounting officer is satisfied, by production of the proper vouchers, that the conditions upon which the grant was made have been fulfilled.  The accounting officer has, in due course, to produce the vouchers to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to show that the conditions on which the grant was made have been fulfilled. The Estimates are full of Grants-in-Aid, and almost invariably&mdash;I use that phrase although I am almost confident that I might say &ldquo;invariably&rdquo;&mdash;these Grants-in-Aid have not to be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the reason being that as a rule they are granted to commercial concerns to carry on a particular form of business, such as the grant made to the Abbey Theatre, or the grant made in this case of the Turf Development Board.  It is presumed, and I think correctly presumed, that the auditors of the concern to which they are made make every investigation and examination in regard to the accounts of the company which it would be proper for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to make in regard to Government accounts.</P>

      <P>I think the fundamental suggestion was that the fact that the accounts came under the survey of the Comptroller and Auditor-General would enable Deputies to keep a closer eye on the affairs of this concern, and that they would be in a better position to criticise its activities here in the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked me to explain what is being done at Clonsast, and wanted to know whether we wished the undertaking there to stand on its own feet as a business, or whether we intended to try to carry it on, I think, as a sort of eleemosynary undertaking to be financed by Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>We want to see all the activities of the Turf Development Board carried on as an economic and business proposition, and upon no other basis than that.  It might help the House better to appreciate what has been done by the Turf Development Board if I remind the House that the Clonsast project is only one of four undertakings in which the Turf Development Board is interested, and for which the Turf Development Board is responsible.  All of those undertakings were not acquired simultaneously by the Turf Development Board, and not all of them are yet in production.  One of them, in fact, was only acquired by it at the beginning of this year, the Lullymore undertaking, or the Lullymore, Ticknevin, or Carbury bog, as it has been variously referred to here in the House.  I should like in that connection to emphasise that the names Carbury, Ticknevin and Lullymore are names which are applied to the same bog, according to the various districts which the bog adjoins. It is all the one bog, and if moneys have been ascribed to Carbury they can with equal correctness be ascribed to Lullymore or Ticknevin.</P>

Another bog, the Clonsast bog is coming into production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Lullymore, was any development work done there by the former company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was development work done by the former company. If I may leave that for the moment, I was about to say that, of the other three bogs, one of those, that is the Clonsast bog, is coming into production. It has not yet reached its full production, and I think will not reach its full production until the full complement of machines is on the bog. It is for the Clonsast bog that the additional sum of £20,000 is asked for under sub-head L (3).  The position in relation to that bog is that, in the year 1938-39, 17,000 tons were taken off the top of the bog, and, as the Deputy knows better than I do, the top turf <Col N="1206" /> is generally poor in quality.  Some part of it has been disposed of; a great part of it, I assume, has not been disposed of.  It will be available for disposal at the generating station for whatever it might be worth to the generating company.</P>
      <P>In the year 1939-40, with the three machines, and with the comparatively untrained staff, 50,000 tons of turf have been produced on the bog.  If we were to assess the value of the turf in an inverse proportion to its moisture content we should say that turf of very high combustible value had been produced. We were talking here last night in terms of turf with a moisture content of 30 per cent., but a large part of the turf which has been produced on the Clonsast bog this year has had a moisture content of only 20 per cent., so that the amount of combustible matter in a ton of that turf is much higher than it otherwise would be. From the point of view of sale to the ordinary consumer that has some advantages as well as disadvantages.</P>

      <P>Precisely, but that would not be a disadvantage if the turf were to be handled in an ordinary boiler house plant because its combustion could be controlled and the amount of storage space required would be very much less. However, let me not digress too much. I was saying that 50,000 tons of turf had been produced this year.  It is important to remember in that connection that as production increases, as more machines are put on the bog and as more turf is cut away, the problems of drainage will become much easier and the working of the bog, provided that a suitable technique be adopted, will become much easier also.  Even this year under these unfavourable conditions, when they had only three machines, when they were working on a new bog, a bog which is not yet fully ripe for development, if I can put it that way, because the normal drainage period has not yet elapsed, they were able to produce 50,000 tons of turf.  Admittedly, the cutting season and the drying season were favourable, but even taking that into consideration I think we can <Col N="1207" /> have a reasonable assurance that when they get the full complement of machines, when the staff becomes more expert&mdash;as there is every reason to anticipate it will&mdash;the production from the Clonsast bog will reach a figure of 120,000 tons of turf per annum.  So far as the costs to date have shown, if 120,000 tons of turf per annum can be produced on the Clonsast bog the undertaking will be an economic one.</P>

      <P>Supposing I were asked what was the life of, say, the Ardnacrusha power house I might say 30 years, or 40 years.  I might say less. It would all depend on what view one took of the contingencies which might sometimes adversely affect an undertaking of that sort.  Would it be a fair comment to say: &ldquo;Are you going to live that long?&rdquo;  I do not think the length of Deputy Davin's life has any relevance whatsoever to the question of whether it is economic or otherwise to develop the Clonsast bog, but I am saying that if we can produce 120,000 tons of turf from the bog that will make the development of the bog an economic proposition so long as the turf can be produced at 10/6, or, as costs may rise, at one-third of the price of coal, whichever be the higher. On that basis the Clonsast bog will be, as I have said, an economic proposition, that is to say, it will provide for full interest on the capital, for full repair, maintenance, depreciation costs and for the redemption of the capital.  As I said, it is not possible for me at this stage to say that we have reached the production of 120,000 tons of turf, but I think it is reasonable to assume that on the experience not only of this year but of 1938-39, when merely the preliminary drainage cuts were made and the top cuts taken off the bog, on the basis of the <Col N="1208" /> experience of the two years which the bog has been worked at all, there is no reason to anticipate that the production of 120,000 tons of turf from Clonsast will not be secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give those right off.  Perhaps I can give the Deputy some figures, but I have not got the detailed costings in my hand. The drainage of the bog is estimated to cost £48,481.  As Deputies may know, that is practically all hand labour.  The drainage overheads were £7,821.  A large part of that also goes either in wages or in salaries, either in remuneration to foremen, skilled men of one sort and another and of engineers. We have already got three machines and there are three others on order.  It is estimated that the machines will cost £61,556; buildings cost £19,053; transport costs, £31,844 and, again, in the case of transport, because of the light railway laid down in sections, a great deal of levelling and subsidiary drainage had to be done on each side of the railway track; a large part of that is also labour. Power lines cost £21,857.  They also are of very simple construction and a large part of the work there must have gone on labour.  We required £68,000 of working capital this year.  I should like to say, in that connection, that, as the production on the bog expands, the production will have to be disposed of, and while normally the production of turf would be taken by the generating station which is on the bog and would be paid for in due course with fair rapidity, even during the summer months, until the generating plant is actually installed, the turf has to be sold; the stock has to be carried over during the summer months and, of course, a very large additional amount of labour cost accrues in that way.  As the House will readily appreciate, the stock of turf which is made during the cutting and drying season can only be disposed of gradually during the winter time and, accordingly, as long as the power <Col N="1209" /> station is not there, the capital requirements of the board will be larger than they otherwise would.  But when the station is built and as it comes into operation, naturally, a large part of the moneys which are now required by the board as working capital will be, I hope, repaid to the Exchequer.</P>

The Deputy could say in respect of the Sugar Beet Company: &ldquo;That is a tidy bill&rdquo;.  But I think that, whatever differences of view we may have had about these undertakings at their inception, at any rate, I think all of us will agree that it is a good thing we have the Shannon scheme now, and I think the general public would agree, too, that it is a good thing we have the sugar beet factories now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should look on this matter a little more objectively.  I know it is quite easy, when an undertaking of this sort, particularly an untried undertaking, is in its developmental stages, to take a rather stringent view, to discount, shall we say, very heavily its possibilities, and to put a very high premium upon the disabilities and the disadvantages which, naturally, the public will have to shoulder when an undertaking of this sort is in its early stages. <Col N="1210" /> That happened in the case of the Shannon scheme and the sugar beet factories.  I think these undertakings have justified themselves and do not think that any reasonable person would be pessimistic in regard to this undertaking. On the other hand, I do not want anyone to be over-optimistic or to think that the job is an easy one.  It is not.  So far as the Clonsast bog is concerned, while there have been difficulties, apart from the outbreak of the present war, nevertheless the future does not seem to be one to be despondent about.</P>
      <P>If I may leave the Clonsast bog, I should like to deal with other undertakings with which the Turf Development Board have been associated.  One is the Lyracompane bog in County Kerry.  It is a much smaller bog than Clonsast, but in some ways it was a much more difficult bog to develop by machinery.  It is a mountain bog, on the side of a mountain with very heavy and difficult gradients, and it is a bog which, accordingly, presented very great difficulties.  It is in nearly full production now.  It has been developed and is producing close on 18,000 tons of turf per annum, all machine won turf which finds a ready sale in Kerry, Limerick and Cork.  That represents pioneer work undertaken by the Turf Development Board and, so far as I know&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;I do not think there is any other instance of a mountain bog of this type having been developed by machinery.  It is now almost in full production and, if it had not been for the fact that this was much too good a year for cutting turf, I believe that it would have shown a profit this year.  The turf cut had a moisture content much lower than 20 per cent.  It is not so easy to adulterate turf as milk, and, because of that fact, in order to get the output in this turf which was drier than what would be regarded as standard turf with a 30 per cent. moisture content, a great deal more wet turf had to be cut than normally would have been the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, I am not denying that.  I should like to emphasise that we do not want the Turf Development Board to interfere with the ordinary private suppliers.  In fact, a great deal of the criticism which this turf policy of ours has been subject to this afternoon has arisen from the fact that we have been very anxious to encourage the private producer of turf and give him every possible facility we could for marketing his turf. All the talk we have heard about bogs and the expenditure of £6,000 on advertising in the early years of the Turf Development Board may sound interesting, but all that expenditure had one object and that was to try to give the private producer of turf a better chance in the market and to try to build up a market for him.  It cannot be said that we have been neglectful of the interests of the private producer.</P>

If you say that the Turf Development Board took over there a bog which had, to some extent, been developed, that may be but, mind you, a great deal of reorganisation had to be undertaken before that bog could be opened.  Now, under the auspices of the Turf Development Board, it is for the first time, so far as I know, showing a small profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. <Col N="1214" /> When it was decided that we could not finance the operations of the Peat Fuel Company any longer, the question arose as to what was to be done with the assets of this company, particularly the bog which had been partially developed and in the development of which so much money had been sunk. Were we to allow the plant for the sake of the £17,000 holding of the prior debenture to be broken up?  Were we to allow all the drainage and other work which had been done on the bog to go for nothing and allow Lullymore bog to revert to its original state?  It was not an easy choice to make, because undoubtedly one could say: &ldquo;Well, what is the use of throwing very good money after bad?&rdquo;  But I think a number of people, particularly those who have used these briquettes, would feel that if an economic process could be devised for the manufacture of these briquettes they were an attractive form of fuel and that it might be worth while making a further experiment.  Accordingly, the first thing that had to be done was to purchase the prior debenture, because if that debenture were not purchased, the debenture holder could put in a receiver and sell the place as a going concern.  It was decided that we should buy the debenture, at any rate, and that we could then decide what was to be done with the undertaking.</P>
      <P>The debenture which gave us the sole right of disposal of the assets of the company in which £232,000 had been invested was purchased at a discount&mdash; at £17,000.  We thought we might have to pay about £19,000, but we succeeded in getting it for £17,000.  In addition, we had to put the Turf Development Board in a position to buy the assets. We, having bought the prior debenture, then remained as sole debenture holder under our trade loan guarantee.  We then had to appoint a receiver, and we put the Turf Development Board in a position to buy the assets from the receiver for the sum of £25,000, which was used by them to satisfy, or extinguish part of our liability under the original trade loan guarantee, so that, in fact, it can be said that we bought the assets of the company and extinguished the prior debenture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The position then was that the Turf Development Board, for the sum of £25,000 with which they are debited, came into possession of the Lullymore bog.  Prior to the purchase, their engineers had gone down and inspected the bog and plant and were satisfied that if we gave them about £10,000 to renovate and improve the plant and change the lay-out, and provided them with a working capital of about £25,000 they would be, at any rate, able to investigate the possibilities of producing briquettes there with some prospect of success.  That is the extent to which the Turf Development Board are committed to the Lullymore undertaking.  They said that if we gave them £10,000 to improve the plant, to renovate it and put it into proper working repair and to make some changes in the lay-out, and provided them, in addition, with £25,000, they would undertake again as an experiment producing the briquettes upon an economic basis <Col N="1217" /> and that they would undertake that experiment with some reasonable prospect of success.</P>

      <P>We may have.  The only question now is whether with new management, a management which has been, I think, very successful in its other undertakings, and under new direction, they can do better than the old company.  They think they can and they are prepared to undertake the risk.  The risk that we are now asking them to undertake is the risk which is involved ultimately in a further grant to them of £25,000.  Let us be clear about this.  The Dáil has already approved in the original Estimates of the purchase of this undertaking, of the buying out of the first debentures.  It has already approved of the grant to them of £10,000 for the purpose of renovating the plant.  In fact, the position in which the Turf Development Board find themselves is this, that not merely have they been able to take over the assets, to put the plant in working order, but they actually have been able to start preliminary operations on the bog this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be some change in the method.  I cannot tell the Deputy exactly what changes, but I do know they are making some changes in the lay-out and in the operations.  They tell me that in some respects the process there can be considerably improved and that they are improving it. They have gone to this extent, that they have succeeded in doing what the old company was never able to do.  They were able to take advantage of the dry season last year to accumulate a stock pile of granulated peat.  One of the mistakes of the old company was that they were very largely living from day to day with regard to the accumulation of a stock of materials on which to work.  The Turf Development Board have been able this year to accumulate a very large stock pile of granulated peat&mdash;I think 35,000 or 40,000 tons.  The <Col N="1218" /> purpose for which they want the £3,685 is to enable them to go ahead with the further processing of that peat and getting it ready for next year so that they will be able to start operations early in the coming season.  The total amount which still remains to be advanced to them is the £25,000, less the £3,685; that is to say about £21,615, the balance of the working capital which they anticipate they will require next year.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise again that the Dáil has approved of the buying out of the prior debentures, that the Dáil approved of the acquisition by the Turf Development Board of the assets of the Peat Fuel Company, that the Dáil approved of an expenditure of £10,000 upon the renovation and improvement of the plant of the former Peat Fuel Company, and that all we are asking now is that the Dáil should go further and provide the Turf Development Board with the £25,000 that they require as working capital, of which £25,000 the £3,685 which is asked for in this sub-head is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he is whole-time. Now, Deputy Brennan mentioned that he had been opposed from the start to this attempt to develop the bogs, because the history of bog development all over Europe was an open book&mdash;that it had been tried too often and failed.  I am quite prepared to concede to him that very many more failures than successes have attended efforts to develop peat deposits not only in Ireland and Great Britain but all over Europe, but it is not true to say that invariably failure has been the result of such efforts.  In that connection, I should like to remind the House that last evening Deputy Dillon referred to the criticism of an informed person on the peat scheme, which had been published in yesterday morning's paper.  While I am not prepared to adopt everything, which this particular gentleman said, as my own, I think it would be well in connection with this particular debate to bear this passage from his speech in mind: &ldquo;...and more particularly that a bog in Ireland would be exactly the same as successfully developed bogs in Germany or Sweden&rdquo;.  At any rate, that disposes, I think, of Deputy Brennan's contention that failure has invariably attended efforts which have been made to develop bogs.  You have it here, from a person whom Deputy Dillon proposes to accept as an authority, that bogs have been developed successfully in Germany and Sweden, as they also have been developed successfully in Russia and as we hope they will be developed in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I have mentioned that matter, I should like to say that the gentleman who made himself responsible for that statement seems to be under a misapprehension <Col N="1222" /> when he assumes, as he does, that our undertakings here have been launched in a purely experimental way without consulting the great quantity of information available on the Continent which would show whether bogs could be properly developed or not.  I have already mentioned to the House that, before the Clonsast experiment was undertaken, the engineers of the Turf Development Board, with the managing director, accompanied by an engineer of the Electricity Supply Board, made an extensive tour of the Continent for the purpose of making an extensive investigation into all the well-known peat development schemes there which were being operated successfully: that they have had the fullest information made available to them by the experts who were responsible for these schemes, that they have had consultation with expert authorities from time to time, and that they have approached this development purely in a highly scientific way. Accordingly, there is no question&mdash;and I should like that to be quite clear&mdash; but that every endeavour has been made to get all the information possible, to reap the benefit of all the experiences and experiments which have been undertaken elsewhere, and I think that, whatever else may be the case, if this project fails&mdash;I do not think it will fail, but if it does, it will not be due to want of foresight or want of capacity on the part of those who are responsible for it.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £28,845 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1939, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain payments of Compensation, including extra wages of seamen and the cost of medical treatment; and for Grants in respect of the provision of certain protective equipment for ships.</P>
      <P>I think the sub-heads to which I ought to direct special attention in this Supplementary Estimate are sub-heads F and I.  An additional sum of £1,900 is required for services in connection with wreck and salvage.  The amount provided in the main estimate was £100, a provision that it was customary to make each year to enable the receiver of wrecks and customs officers to carry out certain provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and to incur expenses in providing storage, etc.  When the property on wrecked vessels is handed over to owners or underwriters there is a claim for the payment of salaries and expenses incurred by the receiver, and where the property is not claimed it is sold for the benefit of the State and the proceeds brought into account in the Appropriations-in-Aid.  Salvage awards in such cases have been charged to this sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the war it was found that a provision of only about £100 was <Col N="1226" /> adequate for the receiver's purpose, but the war at sea since September, 1939, has resulted in a large increase in the amount of valuable property recovered from the sea on the Irish coast.  The amount actually paid out up to 30th September, 1940, was £252, but payments had not then been made in respect of a considerable number of cases which occurred during that period.  We cannot make any dependable estimate of the amount likely to be required during the remainder of the financial year, but it is known that expenses totalling about £850 are due for payment in the immediate future, and in that situation it is proposed to ask the Dáil to provide the additional £1,900 to meet possible expenditure under that head for the full year.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head G, Relief of Distressed Seamen, in most years the Department is called upon to provide the cost of repatriating on an average six Irish seamen who may be found in distress abroad.  The sum hitherto involved has been small, and £25 was usually found sufficient.  That sum was provided under that heading for the current year, but something in excess has been already expended, and there was the somewhat unusual case of the crew of the <i>Luimneach</i>, some of whom had been detained in Spain, and some in German-occupied France.  A sum of about £150 for the repatriation of these men is anticipated, and it is considered that that supplementary sum should be provided within this sub-head.</P>

      <P>I cannot answer that question.  It arises really on the Vote for External Affairs.  As a rule the consuls of the countries concerned would look after them but, as far as expenditure on our part is concerned, it would be a matter for the Department of External Affairs.  The <Col N="1227" /> greater part of the additional amount required under this Supplementary Estimate arises under sub-head I, compensation for crews of ships registered in Éire, and for their dependents in respect of loss, injury or detention arising out of the war.  The amount provided under this sub-head was a token sum of £10, but as has been indicated since it has been decided to place the crews of Irish registered ships on an equal footing in regard to compensation with the crews of British registered ships.  We undertook, pending the introduction of an Irish compensation scheme, to provide compensation for war injuries, pensions, and loss of effects suffered by crews of Irish ships equivalent to that afforded by the British Government to seamen on British ships.  We propose to introduce legislation shortly which will empower the Minister to make orders providing for a scheme of compensation.</P>

These are only ships lost due to war activities.  That is not regarded as a normal risk.  In addition to that we are providing, under sub-head II, a sum of £20,000 in respect of protection against mines. We desire that our ships should enjoy <Col N="1228" /> the same protection in that regard as is enjoyed by ships of belligerent nations.</P>

War at sea is not a normal risk of a shipping company and, accordingly, since we want to have this done, we are not inclined to dispute the matter with the owners of these ships, particularly as elsewhere countries are bearing the cost of these protective measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

I know there are shipping companies trading with ships registered in Éire which are managed from outside sources, and the very fact that ships are registered in Éire is no proof that they are owned by a purely Irish company. The Minister knows that as well as I do.  There is no precedent for this kind of compensation.  Is the Minister prepared to give the information to a Deputy who is asked to vote this money?</P>

Just as there are ships on the English register&mdash;as Deputy Davin knows&mdash;sailing into our ports with this protective apparatus, so there are ships on the Irish register nominally owned by companies here. There are others completely owned by companies here and engaged in essential transport services and we are putting them on the same basis as they would be if they had been on the British register.  That is all.  It is being done in the public interest, in the interest of the crews of the ships, and I cannot see that there could be any possible objection from a public point of view.</P>

      <P>I cannot.  We have simply decided, as a matter of policy, that this should be done in respect of the ships which are on our register and for the crews of which we happen to have, by reason of that fact, a particular responsibility.  If we do not do this, or if we do not make provision for the Irish seamen, even the Irish seamen might refuse to sail under the Irish flag.  It would be a natural thing for them to do.  The only course then would be to allow even the limited number of ships we have sailing under the Irish flag to transfer to the British register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather strange attitude for the Minister to take up. If he could say to the House that it is not in the public interest to give the information, we could understand that. We are discussing an Estimate to make provision for payment of compensation to commercial sources, and one would like to know who will receive that money, but the Minister has made no attempt to give the information, and, so far, he has not even made a case that it is not in the public interest to give it.  This is a Vote for a sum of £20,000&mdash;if the House votes that sum with the explanation so far given&mdash; which is being passed to commercial sources who, I take it, are paying dividends to their shareholders out of the profits which they make from the trading or travelling public.  Their rates have been increased, as the Minister knows, for this purpose, and they are supposed to provide for cases of this kind.  Is that not so?</P>
      <P>I know of no previous case, since this House was established, where the Minister came to the House and asked the House to vote £20,000 of the taxpayers' money without giving some information of a convincing nature.  I think it is a scandalous case to put to the House.  Is it contended by the Minister &mdash;if it is, he is wrong&mdash;that ships registered in Éire are owned by purely Irish companies?  I say that is not a fact. There are companies with ships registered in Éire which are managed from offices outside this country.  They are to receive some of this £20,000, apparently, if the House is foolish enough to vote it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now asking that the ships which are not on the British register, but are on our register, should get the same protection from us.  It seems to me, with all respect to Deputy Davin, that that is very reasonable.  All we are being asked to do here is to vote a sum of £20,000 to safeguard the lives of these people, so far as it is possible to safeguard them.  That means safeguarding the lives of men working on ships sailing under the Irish flag.  Now, we would all probably like to get a good deal more information.  I take it that the Minister has good reason for not giving the information.  He said that his reason for refusing to give the information asked for by Deputy Davin was because, in the Minister's opinion, it would not be in the public interest to do so.</P>

      <P>The question of the desirability of affording this protection has not been raised at all.  The Minister only tried to befog the issue&mdash;talking of offering objection to provide protection.  The one thing that the Minister now knows is that he is providing this protection for 30 ships.  He says these are ships which are on the Irish register.  He knows who owns the ships on that register, and surely he ought to tell us what companies are going to get the £20,000 for this purpose.  We have been told the number of ships affected, but we will not be told the names of the companies which are going to cash the State's cheque. What is the difficulty in giving us the information?  Surely the Minister cannot plead the public interest in withholding information of that kind?</P>

The British Government have made themselves responsible for the cost of these protective measures.  By their courtesy, we are being permitted to utilise and apply these measures to our ships for the benefit and protection of our seamen. The Deputies, and Deputy Davin in particular, suggest that we should ask these ships which, as I have said, are sailing in and out of our ports, carrying our trade and produce, carrying the things we have to export and the things which we have to import: they are asking that we should adopt towards these ships and the crews on them, because you cannot divorce the crew from the ship in this matter, an attitude which is much less friendly, much less sympathetic and much less concerned for the lives of our seamen than the British Government have adopted towards their nationals.  I am not prepared to do that.</P>

Every country is taking special steps to protect its citizens from these risks, and is asking its citizens to pay for them in the ordinary course of taxation. Why should I go to any one of the owners of these ships which at the moment are at sea, at the risk of their owners and at the peril of the lives of their crews, and ask them to do this work at their own expense, when the British Government have not asked their shipowners to do that?  Is it not as vital for us that our ships should remain on the sea as it is for the British Government that their ships should remain at sea?  Ought not the lives of our Irish sailors be as much a concern of ours as the lives of British seamen are of the British Government?</P>

We do not want, and I certainly am not prepared, to go at any length into or to give any details in regard to this matter.  We have satisfied ourselves that the £20,000 will instal this protective system on our ships and I am not going to enter into details in this House as to whether any particular ship is or is not fitted with this device, whether the ships of any particular company are or are not fitted with this device, or whether the ships which are on the Irish register are in more than nominal Irish ownership or not.  I will only say that I would like to see as many ships as possible on our register flying the Irish flag, and I would like to see the crews on these ships sailing under as safe <Col N="1236" /> conditions as possible in the troubled world of to-day.</P>

The purpose of the queries put from these benches was simply to ascertain what companies were going to get £20,000 worth of the people's money.  The question of providing protection for those ships was not raised at all.  Everyone is anxious, some of us much more anxious than the Government have shown themselves, to provide protection for Irish sailors who are travelling in Irish registered boats.  The net point raised in this discussion is: who is going to get the £20,000?  The Minister says he does not want to say what ships are fitted with this device.  Is the Minister losing his memory or is he losing his senses?  He has told us already that every ship on the Irish register is protected by this anti-magnetic mine device. Is the Irish shipping register not open for inspection and does not everybody know then what ships have this protection?  The net point involved is: what companies are going to get the £20,000?  No question was raised from these benches about the propriety of affording protection.</P>

The Minister is simply inventing statements in characteristic fashion and attributing them to people for the purpose of working himself up to an artificial heat over a matter which he wants to conceal. I do not think there is any <Col N="1237" /> reason why the public should not be told who is going to get the £20,000 provided in this Estimate.  It is going to certain companies.

      <P>I wish to refer to matters which arise on sub-head F, dealing with wreck and salvage.  For some time past, various commodities of one kind or another have been washed up on the north-west coast and have been salvaged by the small fishermen there, and handed over in due course to the authorities.  Included in such salvage or wreckage were several hundred bales of what is known as raw cotton wool.  I myself have seen this wool coming ashore at various points on the Donegal coast and the north-west coast generally and each bale weighs five cwts or more.  The salvaging of such goods is not an easy matter; on the contrary, it is an extremely hazardous enterprise for those engaged in it because they have to transport such goods as bales of wool, barrels of oil, timber, and the like over long distances in very small craft.  These fishermen and others engaged in this enterprise have complained to me time and time again of the delay in paying them their percentage of the amount realised from the sale of the salvaged goods, and others who have received payment have complained just as bitterly of the very small amount paid to them for the goods handed over to the Department. In that connection, I would say that if the percentage paid to these poor fishermen is any indication of the total amount realised from the sale of the goods, the prices received at the sale are scandalously low.  My contention is that if valuable raw materials of this description are made available by the small fishermen and others engaged in this work, surely the Department can afford to pay them adequately for their trouble from the amounts received from the sales of these goods, unless, of course, it is the policy of the Department to dispose of such goods at very low prices.  I should like <Col N="1238" /> the Minister to say how the sales of these salvaged goods take place, and on what basis the people who salvaged such goods received compensation.</P>

      <P>In connection with Marine Service Supplementary Estimate under sub-head F, I am desirous to obtain some information from the Minister.  My principal interest arises from the fact that, like Deputies Breslin and Mongan, I represent a maritime county, and complaints have been made in relation to the disposal of and payment for wreck salvaged in County Clare.  In the months of April and May of the present year, over 100 bales of cotton were salvaged on the Clare coast.  The major portion of that cotton was disposed of to a purchaser outside this country, and I presume that that was done because a better price was obtained outside the country than could be obtained within the country.  I am anxious to know if the requirements of the country were actually met in the matter of cotton before its export was permitted.  I know that there is a Receiver of Wreck, but I am anxious to learn from the Minister what his duties and powers are in connection with receiving and disposing of wreck.  If wreck has come under his control, is the Receiver clothed with power to dispose of that property and conclude a sale without reference to any Ministerial Department of State, or was the appropriate Minister consulted in relation to the disposal of these bales of cotton from County Clare?  If so, was every means made use of to ensure that the cotton was disposed of to the best advantage? Were offers invited from potential purchasers inside and outside this country and, if so, what were the respective tenders received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out by Deputy Breslin and Deputy Mongan, the men engaged in this work have to display a high degree of skill and daring.  Up to quite a recent date none of the men concerned was paid.  I hope to learn from the Minister that they have been paid an adequate amount for what has been described as hazardous work.  I should be glad to have some information from the Minister on this matter as it concerns many people.  It is a matter about which <Col N="1240" /> some of us have been questioned time and again, and we are not in a position to give any information.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to deal specifically with the cases which have been mentioned by Deputies Breslin, O'Loghlen and Mongan.  I cannot say that, in respect of goods which were salvaged in May last, people have not been paid up to now, nor am I in a position to refute the suggestion that they have been waiting for payment for six months, I understand that, so far as claims were outstanding in respect of cotton and other goods salvaged early this year, instructions have gone out to the Receiver of Wreck to make the necessary payments to those who actually recovered the salvage.  In the light of what has been said here, I shall look into the matter.  I gathered from Deputy Mongan that, in one case, the men who actually recovered the salvage received £1 5s., while the coast watchers, who are officials, received £4.  There may be some rule for the distribution of salvage rewards.</P>

      <P>I must have misunderstood the Deputy.  I shall read what the Deputy did say.  I understood the Deputy to say that the people who actually recovered the wreckage had to wait for the payments too long and that the payments were trifling.  I understood him to say that they had been actually waiting for almost one year. As regards the points raised by Deputy O'Loghlen, I think the Receiver of Wreck is under an obligation to take all possible steps to secure that the wreckage is sold at the highest available price, in case claims are made against him, so that those who recovered the salvage would be entitled to the maximum reward.  If the Deputy has reason to feel that there has been dissatisfaction in regard to this matter, I shall undertake to look into it and see to what extent we can obviate these delays in future.  I recognise, quite frankly, that where men have, with <Col N="1241" /> some risk to themselves, recovered property from the sea, they expect to receive their reward in as short a time as possible.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Cause and Incidence of Unemployment&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the amendment to the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Being of opinion that the time is overdue for formulating proposals for the abolition of unemployment and for giving effect to the undertaking in the Constitution that all citizens may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, Dáil Eireann requests the Government towards that end to appoint a representative committee to ascertain the cause and incidence of unemployment within industry and agriculture, its reactions on the physical well-being and morale of the people, and to make recommendations within six months from the date of its appointment for the absorption in useful employment at adequate remuneration of all workers able to follow useful occupations.&mdash;(Deputies Norton, Keyes and Pattison).</P>
    <P>Amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; where it first appears and substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A commission should be appointed to inquire into and report upon the extent, cause, incidence, general character and other aspects of unemployment, and to make proposals in relation thereto, Dáil Eireann requests the Government to appoint such a commission.&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce).</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe that the Government have taken up half the <Col N="1242" /> time spent on this proposal, and have said nothing on it.  In fact, the position is, at the moment, that the head of the Government does not believe this recommendation will achieve anything, and the Minister, on the other hand, hopes to get something out of it. The House is left in a position in which the Government has no faith in the recommendation it makes.  Deputy Norton, in recommending the motion to the House, quoted an extract from a leading article in the London <i>Times.</i> There were certain omissions from that leading article.  They may not have been regarded as important by Deputy Norton, but they are not without some significance.  Deputy Norton stopped in his quotation from one part of the leading article at the word &ldquo;collapse&rdquo;, which referred to the inflation which took place in Germany after the Great War.  These words were omitted: &ldquo;...even grimmer than that which followed the post-war inflation.&rdquo;  These words are important for the reason that it is difficult, in present circumstances, correctly to estimate what steps have been taken in Germany to deal with the financial situation there. The words omitted were developed in a speech made by the German Chancellor as far back as 1933, in which he said that, since the year 1918&mdash;a period of 15 years&mdash;there had been 225,000 suicides in Germany.  That is to say, they were at the rate of 15,000 a year. Applying the same proportion to this country, it would mean that there would be two suicides every day, excluding Sunday.  The deaths of about 250,000 people, attributable to the collapse of the German effort in the war and to difficulties which affected Germany after the war, ought not to be ignored by those who lightly speak of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another omission which occurs after the words &ldquo;the rest of the world would do well to imitate them&rdquo;.  This is omitted: &ldquo;Where does the truth lie between these two extremes?&rdquo;.  Those are rather important words, because if one were to take&mdash; I am quite sure that Deputy Norton did it without any intention of misleading&mdash;the portion of the leading article which he read, one would be <Col N="1243" /> inclined to the view that <i>The Times</i> people were themselves satisfied that the German proposal for dealing with the situation was a sound one and that we ought all to follow it.  That particular decision, or that particular conviction or view would not be taken if one were to add the words &ldquo;Where does the truth lie between these two extremes&rdquo;?  Further, there is another omission.  Deputy Norton stopped at a particular part of the article.  He stopped about half way down, and there is in the following paragraph a rather significant statement by <i>The Times.</i>  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;More characteristic was the rigid control which they&rdquo;&mdash;that is the German authorities &mdash;&ldquo;established over the foreign exchanges to insulate their currency from the inflationary effects of what was the mainspring of their system&mdash;the so-called closed financial circuit by which money made available by the State to set industries going was carefully sucked back again by loans and taxation, aided by a vast network of controls and restrictions which kept wages down and hours up and prevented all spending except such as suited the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it is practically an impossibility for people like Deputy Norton or myself, or even for the Government with all the information at their disposal, to weigh up and to pronounce upon the methods which have been adopted in Germany in connection with finance and in connection with their industrial expansion during those last seven, eight, or ten years.  We have much to learn by the mistakes that other people make, but we do not contribute much towards improving our own industrial output, our own efforts at providing employment, if we take only certain parts of the programme which have been found, up to a point, to have achieved certain results in connection with the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>This resolution and this amendment, to my mind, do not deal and do not attempt to deal with the big problem <Col N="1244" /> that we have here.  It does not appear to me that the Labour Party can be absolved from any of the mistakes which the Government has made during the last eight or nine years.  Since taking over office they have, to my mind, seriously damaged the sound, stable employing agencies that there were in the country.  That is a rather serious statement to make, but I can prove it.  I have taken out and have published already comparisons between the agricultural export position in this country and the sums of money which accrued to agricultural producers.  After paying for all agricultural imports the average for the five years from 1927 to 1932 is £14,800,000 per annum.  I am giving the Ministry the benefit not only of the whole of the period up to date but even the ten months of 1940; I am extending it at the same rate, and their average over that period amounts to less than £8,000,000 per annum.  Now, they got office on the assumption that they were going to improve the agricultural industry in this country.  One of their claims was that they were going to make every person engaged in agriculture in this country earn £16 per annum per person more than had been obtaining before they took up office. Not only has that not happened, but they have not even kept up to the record of their predecessors, or anything like it; that figure has diminished from £14,800,000 to £7,900,000.  What does that mean?  There is a loss there of almost £7,000,000 a year of money coming into this country.  There are sets-off, if the Minister likes, of the £5,000,000, and so on, which used to be paid, but, if we are to take off even that much, the advantage is still against the Ministry.  When they came into office they had an average of 11,400 persons going into occupation every year.  This has diminished so that the number of persons going into occupation now is only 9,375.  On either of those two examinations the Government has failed in its economic policy in this country.  It has failed notwithstanding the fact that it is collecting something like £5,000,000 a year in taxation &mdash; probably £6,000,000 &mdash; more than its predecessors; that it has had extensive tariffs, extra taxation, extra <Col N="1245" /> costs in connection with cement, sugar, butter, bacon and industrial alcohol; notwithstanding the fact that it has not balanced the Budget, and that it has incurred a huge deadweight debt in respect of housing.  I calculate the sum total of all this extra money that it had to spend as something like £50,000,000.  Notwithstanding that, the position is that they have not been able to keep even within easy distance of the economic situation they entered into control of when they came in here.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the Government pronouncement is that there is no faith in this commission, how can they expect the House to vote for their amendment?  I do not know what is the Labour view on it; I do not know whether they are going to stand on their own resolution or are going to accept the amendment.  Neither of the two proposals, to my mind, will effect the purpose which is apparently intended in this resolution.  An inquiry into what has happened during the last 13 or 14 years ought to be instituted in order to see what mistakes have been made, to see how it is possible to remedy them, and to see what opportunities there are for improving our industrial and agricultural position. Unless we are determined to correct the mistakes that have been made, to mark an improvement for the future, and to see what opportunities there are for improving employment in this country, there is very little hope.</P>
    <P>I observe from Deputy Norton's statement and from much of the discussion that took place here this evening a disposition to belittle British credit.  I presume it is one of those things that one must do in order to show how patriotic one is.  It is all nonsense.  If we are going to trade principally with Great Britain we ought, at any rate, examine carefully the state of British credit before making statements about it.  An unprejudiced examination of Deputy Norton's statement would indicate that he is satisfied that German finance is superior to British finance.  I express no view on it.  I am satisfied on one <Col N="1246" /> point, that taking the last 20 years or even a longer period, no country has a better credit record than Great Britain.  I am not an apologist for them; I am simply stating what can be borne out by the facts.  There is, perhaps, a country stronger in finance than Great Britain at the present moment.  It is possible the United States of America is stronger, but it has not yet been definitely established that American credit is better than British credit and that is not belittling in any way the credit position in America.  Our trade here is bound up with, and must be dependent upon, British prosperity.</P>

      <P>Our industrial exports have not increased during those last eight or nine years.  We have had an intensive tariff policy pursued during that period and notwithstanding that, there has been a gradual reduction in our exports of industrial goods.  It is no credit to the effort that has been made to industrialise this country for the last eight or nine years when that is the case.  It is not a question of prejudice.  It is a statement that is borne out by the facts.  Nobody would be better pleased than we on these benches to see with a change of Government a great expansion in prosperity, a great increase in the number of persons employed and general improvement throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has not happened.  Had not we better be honest with one another in this situation?  The facts and figures I have given are from Government publications.  If they are wrong, let us hear about them; let this commission examine them.  But this commission will not be a success if it does not go into the events of the last eight or nine years and see what mistakes have been made and where we are heading for.  In my view there could be nothing worse than the policy that <Col N="1247" /> has been pursued for the last four or five years of not balancing our Budget. In connection with the solution of this matter of unemployment we require the efforts of every single order in the community, of every section of it, and such questions as we heard here this evening in connection with the sums of money that are being given to certain ship owners do not contribute in any way towards that confidence which is necessary if we are to have an industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>There is an idea abroad that if we are to improve employment in the country it must be done by Government spending. Let us examine that.  Assuming that the Government tax people up to the last penny of their earnings or incomes, all they get is the income. That is all they can get, and the people who have had the incomes, or the name of having the incomes, will get nothing. Obviously, we cannot do that, and the most we can take from them&mdash;and we are getting very close up to the mark now&mdash;is what we are taking at the present moment &mdash; about one-third. Calculate what the value of one-third of the total income of persons concerned is, on the one hand.  It is a big sum.  Observe, on the other hand, what the persons engaged in industry and commerce and so on have got. They have got the capital.  Would it not be far better to see them employing their capital and having some agency to employ one-third of the income which is derived from that capital?  I do not know of any country that has gone in for this business of Government spending and Government activity in connection with industrial expansion that has made a real success of it.  It is inadvisable, it is not good taste, and it is bad policy to criticise in one Parliament what goes on in another country, so that we cannot specify without giving offence, but, on the face of it, those countries which have made good have made good by the individual and collective efforts of industrialists themselves rather than through Governments.</P>
    <P>In consequence, if this matter were put to a division I would vote for the resolution that has been proposed, not <Col N="1248" /> that I like the term &ldquo;representative body.&rdquo;  I would prefer &ldquo;expert body.&rdquo; I would prefer a body qualified to consider this matter with a view to eliminating all political considerations and getting a sound economic proposal to put before us, to show us where mistakes have been made, and to correct those mistakes as far as possible.</P>

      <P>I want at the outset to assure Deputy Cosgrave that if I did not quote the entire article from the London <i>Times</i> it was only for the sake of brevity I made omissions.  But the London <i>Times</i> is in good company.  The <i>Manchester Guardian</i> in a recent leading article, referring to the Conservative plea that inflation is taking place in Britain, says: &ldquo;But, in any case, it is not the amount of money created which decides whether there is danger of inflation.  As we in this country (England) have finally learned, monetary expansion only stimulates inflation where there are no longer any unemployed resources available to expand production.&rdquo;  I made no comment at all on the method of German finance <i>vis-a-vis</i> the British method of finance, but I did say this, that while certain countries apparently backed credit by the rarest commodity in the world&mdash; gold&mdash;and had been told that that was the only method of backing credit, other countries had backed credit by labour power, and there were examples throughout the world of where the labour power backing for currency and credit had not been shown to be a failure.  That is a wide issue, and it is not possible to discuss that matter in the few minutes at my disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with this Motion, even in connection with his own amendment, clearly indicated that the Minister had no faith whatever in the commission which he was offering to this House, and if the Minister had a glimmer of faith left, the Taoiseach in any case took immense care to extinguish even that glimmer because, referring to the commission which the Government is asking the House to authorise it to set up, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Now I must confess at the start that I have very grave doubts that any investigation which is <Col N="1249" /> likely to be made is going to provide us with a solution.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach is a member of the Government which asks the House to allow it to set up a commission as to the efficacy of which he has apparently very grave doubts. Later on in his speech he says: &ldquo;Personally I believe we will not get any solution of this problem based on the recommendations of a commission.  I do not think a commission will solve it.&rdquo;  This is the kind of commission which the Government are offering to the House, one of which the Taoiseach says from the start he has very grave doubts about its ability to deal with the problem, and from which he says later he does not believe he will get any recommendations such as will help to solve the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>That gives one an idea of the economic dreariness that has taken possession of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. When they were in Opposition they used to have a ready-made cure for unemployment.  The Taoiseach, speaking from these benches, said, in volume 40, column 2362:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cure for unemployment in this country lies in supplying ourselves with manufactured goods which at the present moment we needlessly import... The solution of unemployment is easier in this country at the present moment than it is in any other country facing that problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's method of absorbing the unemployed and getting rid of the economic waste caused by unemployment was indicated in a speech which he delivered on the same occasion, in which he said, referring to the fact that there were 60,000 people then unemployed, whereas now we have 109,000 officially registered:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These 60,000 people, if they were employed and distributed even in the present proportions between agricultural and the manufacturing industries, would produce yearly something like £6,750,000 worth of wealth ...the gross economic loss, the loss to the community in deprivation of wealth, is something like £6,750,000 per year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> If we would lose £6,750,000 with 60,000 idle, it should be quite obvious to the House that the community as a whole is probably losing £16,000,000 to-day. The Taoiseach was very much concerned with the loss of £6,750,000 in 1931, but apparently he is quite unconcerned to-day when the situation is graver.  He has no faith to-day in the remedies he offered to the House in 1931 for avoiding a loss of £6,750,000 to the community.  On the same occasion the present Minister for Supplies said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. de Valera showed&mdash;and showed fairly convincingly to anyone open to conviction&mdash;that unemployment need not exist here; that it exists very largely because of the lack of directive ability on the part of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lack of directive ability gave us 60,000 unemployed in 1931.  How much more are we lacking in directive ability to-day when we have 109,000 persons registered as unemployed in the exchanges and thousands more not registered because of the conditions under which they are compelled to register? The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on this matter when the Dáil last considered it, referred to the necessity for producing goods for export.  Everybody realises that in the world in which we live, if you want to import commodities you must export other commodities to pay for them; but the Minister appeared to think that we should continue to keep our eyes on the markets which offer absorption for certain of our agricultural products and ignore our home market. The export of surplus products should not be in conflict with the capturing of the home market.  It is a sad commentary on our economic madness that while you have to-day approximately 300,000 people not getting sufficient food, farmers find it difficult to dispose of the produce which would serve in a large way to feed those people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us that when he heard there were 80,000 people unemployed he looked up the import lists and said: &ldquo;If you manufacture certain of these articles in this country you will be able to provide employment for approximately 80,000 people.&rdquo;  The <Col N="1251" /> Taoiseach rather marvelled when an examination of the unemployment position showed that approximately 80,000 had been employed.  What are the facts?  It may be that 80,000 have gone into industry but, although the population has not increased in the last ten years, we have 109,000 others idle. You may claim to have put 80,000 into employment.  If that claim can be substantiated you have still to face the fact that although the population has not increased you have put 109,000 other people out of employment.  These 109,000 people are waiting for an opportunity to create wealth to sustain themselves, to enrich the nation and provide for their dependents.  The only thing the Taoiseach can offer them is a commission in which, according to himself, he has had no faith from the start.  The best they can hope for from the Department of Industry and Commerce is a commission, with this postscript, that the Minister is not going to bind the Committee to work to any time limit.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now offering the House a commission in which the Taoiseach has no faith and from which the Minister will not require a report at any particular time. Apparently he wants a commission like <Col N="1252" /> the Transport Commission or the Banking Commission and he will do with the recommendations of the commission just what he did with the recommendations of the Banking Commission&mdash;the majority and minority recommendations. That is what the unemployed are being offered to-day.  The 109,000 who constitute the queues outside the labour exchanges, the people who are living on beggarly rates of assistance, are being offered a commission of this type which will make a leisurely examination of the problem of unemployment, having in mind the declarations by the two godfathers of this commission, one, the Taoiseach, that he has no faith in it and the other the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he will not bind it to report at any particular time.</P>
      <P>Deception could not go further. The only purpose of the Minister's proposal in this case is to set up a commission which will examine this matter in a comfortable, easy-going fashion and the unemployed will wait for another ten years before their economic problems are solved.  In the meantime they have to put up with all the rigours and privations associated with unemployment.  The Minister's proposal is just a trap and a deception for the unemployed.  We propose to vote against it.</P>

Perhaps, with the indulgence of the House, you will permit me, Sir, to say what the general purposes of the Bill are.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to secure that men enlisted in the Defence Forces who were contributors prior to enlistment will be put in the position that the unemployment benefit rights possessed by them prior to enlistment will emerge unimpaired on the termination of their military service, notwithstanding the lapse of insurance years during which no contribution is paid into the Unemployment Fund.  It is also proposed in the Bill to provide for the position under the Unemployment Insurance Acts of certain Irish seamen who had been employed on ships the registration of which has been changed since the outbreak of war from an Irish to a British port, so that they will not be disqualified for the receipt of unemployment benefit in respect of the contributions to their credit in the Unemployment Fund at the date of change of registration by reason of the non-payment of contributions during subsequent insurance years.</P>

      <P>An Order of such far-reaching importance as this should hardly be left to private members to be brought before the House.  This Order not only affects agriculture, which is our principal industry, but it affects the whole economic life of the nation and perhaps sets up precedents that might on flimsy excuses be copied in future.  The Order is not only an Order requiring one-sixth of the arable land of the country to be tilled, but it is an Order which empowers the Minister, if there is not a reasonable effort made to till the required percentage by a certain time&mdash;I think it is the 14th February&mdash;to take possession of the lands and let them or till them.  I should also like the Minister, when replying, to be clear on this: as I read the Order, there will be no liability on the Minister, while using the lands, to pay either annuities or rates, and these would accrue as a further burden on the occupier temporarily dispossessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes exceptions in the Order.  I do not find fault with the exceptions, but I do find fault with him for not excepting dairying land. After all the money that has been spent on dairying, after all the attention it has got in our agricultural economy since we got control of that agricultural economy, butter is the one and only agricultural product that has been rationed.  On the face of it, it is <Col N="1256" /> bad business to require land hitherto devoted to dairying to be broken up for tillage purposes when we find we are sailing so close to the wind that we are in the gale at the moment. There are other exceptions that I think the Minister should have made. In the case of widows and in the case of orphans there are extenuating circumstances which would make exceptions in their case a great necessity. Speaking from memory, I think the British Government in their compulsory Orders during the last war made exceptions in these cases.</P>
    <P>Coming to the effect of the Order itself, I want it to be clearly understood that I am not opposed to tillage. I am an advocate of tillage at all times. I believe that the conception of agricultural economy in an independent State like this should be based, as far as possible, on producing all the food necessary for man and beast in this country.  I have always held that if we are to survive as a nation we must have a tillage economy.  If, when we put that to the test, we find that tillage is not a paying proposition as compared with other forms of agriculture, such as the grazing of cattle purely for export for instance, then I say that there is a problem.  It is not a question of which of them pays the better; it is a question of which of them the nation requires.  If the nation requires a tillage economy, and if a tillage economy is not a profitable one, then there is the problem: why is it not a profitable economy?  That is what we must get down to solve.</P>
    <P>Those are my views on the tillage economy and tillage policy.  Broadly speaking, I am a supporter of the Government's agricultural policy.  In exceptional times like these, when we have to switch on to full production in order to produce 100 per cent. of the food required for man and beast, I agree with compulsion, but I consider that that compulsion should be applied intelligently.  It is not sufficient for the Minister, or his officials, to make an order saying: &ldquo;We have x acres under cultivation this year, and we want an additional acreage under tillage next year to provide our necessaries&rdquo;. Conceivably, we could double <Col N="1257" /> the acreage that we had under tillage this year and yet be short of essentials next year.  Remember the trouble that you are bringing to the farmers of the country by requiring extra tillage, but it should not be too much for the Ministry to put up a recipe as to the agricultural products that we have been short of this year whereby we would be able to concentrate on the production of those commodities that we fell short of this year for our supply of food for man and beast.</P>
    <P>We could, for instance, increase the acreage under tillage this year, as required by the Minister, by tilling the extra amount, the difference between one-sixth and one-eighth&mdash;I think it is one-twenty-fourth&mdash;of the arable land, by putting that under oats, and that would meet the Minister's Tillage Order, but it would not meet the requirements of the country.  We grow about half the amount of wheat we require. Why is there not some inducement held out that will double the acreage under wheat this year?  That is the most essential of all produce.  If the submarine warfare, which is fiercest around these coasts now, is intensified, or even if it is maintained at its present sinkings, how much foreign wheat will we be able to get into this country at the end of next year? I doubt if we will be able to get any in, and if we have only half our requirements of wheat&mdash;and we can never hope to have a better harvest than last year&mdash;the inducement thrown out of 2/6 a barrel extra for the wheat grown this year over the price for the wheat grown last year is not a sufficient inducement, particularly as we are short of fertilisers, and particularly as the feeding of livestock is not a very profitable business at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is nearly too late to remedy the wheat position now, and I do not think it was fair of the Minister or of the Government not to have brought this matter before the House in September so that the sowing of winter wheat, starting in October, could be regulated, and I see no obstacle to our having 600,000 acres of wheat this coming year if the matter were taken up seriously and taken up in time and a fair price offered for it.  I am not saying that 37/6 a barrel for a limited supply of <Col N="1258" /> wheat is not a good inducement to grow, but remember that, as we increase our area under wheat, we are trespassing on land that is not as good wheat land as that which is growing wheat, and our average yield will go down and the price will have to go up to make the operation remunerative. Now, we are asked to grow extra crops. We will grow them.  The farmer never failed to do his duty in this country. No matter how the appeal was made or what the manner of service, he always came up to it and he will come up to this, but while the agricultural position was forgotten we, Deputies, have been asked to go around the country to recruiting meetings for the Local Security Force, A.R.P., and so on&mdash;all good national works in their own way&mdash;but when you come back to consider the position, as we will have to look at it in this coming year, the first and most important local and national security force for this country in this coming year, and in the years ahead, will be the ploughmen of this nation.  You can have 200,000 or 300,000 of the youth of this country marching to stirring tunes.  There will be more glitter and show about it than about the fellow who is muck up to his neck producing the food that will keep those men walking and keep this nation independent of the submarine or any other warfare.  No attention, however, was given to him, and if the farmer does not produce the exact surplus that is required, the fault is not with him but with the Government that did not give him proper direction when it made its appeal to him.</P>
    <P>I do not want to indulge in politics, but we grow those crops.  Have we a market?  Have we a price?  We have been considering the burying of hundreds and thousands of pounds in bogholes for a few hours this evening in this House.  That money, extracted out of this agriculture to which you are now making this appeal to save the country, is being buried in bogholes, as I say, and in other ways equally as mad and insane as the burying of the money in bogholes.  Agriculture in this country has been depressed from 1922 and 1923 up to the present time: first, by the deflation money policy of Britain which depressed the prices of <Col N="1259" /> agriculture; secondly, by the general depression in agriculture the world over; and, thirdly, by agriculture, and agriculture alone, having to pay the cost of the economic war.  During those three scourges of Irish agriculture, agriculture went into debt to the tune of millions.  It is still in debt.  Is there any relief for that indebtedness of agriculture when you call upon it now to make a supreme effort to save the nation in the hour of danger?  No relief whatever has been offered, and I should like to ask the Minister, when he is replying, to explain why relief is not offered and, if there is money to bury in bogholes, why is there not money to relieve agriculture?  We will grow the stuff all right.  You need not worry about that.  The farmers will produce all the food necessary for man and beast in this country, but will they get a price for it?</P>
    <P>We have at least 100,000 people idle. They cannot buy the food we produce unless we first of all give them money to pay for it.  We must give them the money, and if we do, we have to pay for it in taxation. How is a farmer going to produce under these circumstances? We have in this House a Government, an Opposition and a Labour Party, and all practically agreed on the motion that has just passed about having an inquiry of some kind about unemployment.  The Labour Party wanted it definitely, and the Government hushed it off for the present, but all Parties agreed upon an inquiry into the unemployment problem. If there is an unemployment problem so grave as to require a commission of inquiry, and if farmers are asked to produce more wheat, potatoes, sugar and the necessaries directly used for human food for which we have a market here, we must also produce animal foodstuffs in our farming economy.  Our market for these, speaking nationally, would be our livestock. I should like to know from the Minister if he could mention any livestock outside dairy cows that will be a remunerative market for the animal food that we produce.  Oats are selling at 12/- a barrel.  The average <Col N="1260" /> yield, according to Government sources is something like 11 or perhaps 12 barrels to the acre.  The minimum standard wage in County Dublin, and in the greater part of my constituency, would be £93 or £94 a year.  It would take 12 acres of land to pay the wages of one man.  It was not a princely wage at any time.  Even at that low figure, will the Minister tell us what animals could be fed at 12/- a barrel and be remunerative?</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been depressed for three or four causes, yet farmers are called upon to produce more and to change their economy.  They want credit.  What credit facilities does the Government offer?  None.  I cannot understand why responsible Deputies look askance at anyone standing up and saying what should have been said 18 years ago, that the British control our banking system.  Why are farmers here not assured of the banking accommodation necessary to increase production? They are assured of it in Britain.  The note issue here is not greater than it was before the war.  The note issue in Britain is £100,000,000 more than before the war, and it is kept circulating by the volume of extra credit given.  Here we want credit to produce more and we will pay for it. Has the Minister offered any credit facilities?  No.  It is all very well for the Minister to bring in an order and warn us of what is going to happen if by February 14th we have not made arrangements for increased tillage.  If he carries out the order to the letter, he can take up land and work it and not pay annuities or rates on it.  These are to be let accrue as a debt on the already overburdened owner of a farm, and when he gets it back after the emergency he will find himself owing more rates and annuities.  I do not know how county councils will carry on if that happens to any extent.</P>
    <P>While farmers may be driven into the position of having to spend extra money on the new economy the Minister is providing nothing for them.  If I were to go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;You require more tillage.  I have no capital to till one-sixth of my land. Where will I get capital?&rdquo;  he could not tell me.  Surely, if he is asking <Col N="1261" /> farmers to make a supreme effort the whole burden of that effort should not be borne by them.  Why should not banks and financial houses here be called upon to bear their share of the burden?  I do not suggest that they should give grants, but surely they could give credit.  What is the security for that credit?  It is the increased food, and also the obligation to protect the country.  I am quite sure that when the Army Estimates come forward they will be considerably increased.  Farming is a service of far more importance than the Army, because it is national service that is now required of agriculture. I am sure the Minister is looking at this question not from the Party point of view, but primarily from the point of view of producing the food necessary for man and beast without calling on any one class to make all the sacrifices.  I put it to him that more will be produced by looking at the question in that way.  I am sure that is the way he will approach it.</P>
    <P>Let him not forget what agriculture has lost owing to deflation, owing to the general depression that prevailed, and by the economic war.  I am not going into the rights and wrongs of these things now, or as to whether uncalled for burdens were piled on agriculture from which it has not yet recovered, but if farmers are called upon to bear this further burden, surely they should be accommodated with credit.</P>
    <P>A month or two back in the harvest time we had a discussion here about the price of oats.  The low price of oats at the season was indissolubly bound up with a shortage of credit.  People grew oats.  They had surplus oats in the aggregate, and, taking the long view, the Minister might be substantially correct when he said there was no real surplus.  There might not be, but if I am pressed to pay a debt now and I have surplus oats, my first consideration is to get cash for it in order to pay that debt, and I cannot afford to take the long view and store that oats until next March in order to get a good price.  If the Minister calls upon the farmers to produce, he should devise some machinery which will enable them to hold on to their crops and get a good price for them, instead of the <Col N="1262" /> profits of the whole effort going to line the pockets of speculative merchants.</P>
    <P>I would call upon the Minister to make an exception in the case of dairying land.  I know farms of 50 to 70 acres which have been dairying land for years, if not for generations.  There is no fence on those lands.  To ask owners to break them up and till a sixth is, in fact, asking the owners or occupiers to put a sixth of the land from growing good grass.  They are not tillers: they are dairy people.  Dairying is just as profitable to the nation and as essential at the present time as any other form of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I know dairy people who come to me and I plough their land for them.  They have put in a crop indifferently.  It was the best they could do, as they did not know how to till.  Their interest is in dairying and it was a punishment to compel them to till without giving any adequate national return.  I consider that the land, in the way they were using it, was used&mdash;in the circumstances, within and without the emergency&mdash;to the best national advantage. I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider that question of dairying. As I said at the beginning, the dairying product of butter is now virtually rationed, if not actually so, in Dublin. Only two-thirds of the supply is now permitted, I understand, by the merchants to the traders.  I believe that over the wireless we were informed that the price will be 154/- a cwt. for half-ton orders.</P>
    <P>That may be a little digression, but I would like to remind the Minister that there are merchants who are cleverly refusing to supply half-ton orders and making the trader pay 159/- a cwt.  I would suggest to the Minister that he, through his organisations handling this matter, see to it that where a trader gives a half-ton order or more and is entitled to it according to the rules and regulations now obtaining, the merchant should not be allowed to refuse that order and should be compelled to supply the butter at the lower price.  That is a digression.</P>
    <P>The point I was making is that this <Col N="1263" /> is the only agricultural product that at the moment it is found necessary to ration.  Therefore, it is one of the weakest links in the chain, and I submit that land used for dairying purposes is as well used in the national interest as it could be used at the moment.  I am sure the Minister will concede that dairying is a specialised form of agriculture, just as tillage and livestock raising are.  As it is so essential, it should get equal consideration. I say that, and I am a tillage farmer, if I know anything about farming; and I press that very much for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <P>It was a great pity that, in this crisis that was coming upon us, and that we all saw coming, we did not take time by the forelock.  It was a pity that our Minister for Supplies and Minister for Industry and Commerce, instead of fooling about the bogs, did not get in millions of pounds worth of raw materials necessary for our industries. Why was not £10,000,000 worth of timber brought in, with which we could be building houses now, as we have all the other raw materials necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to provide food.  It costs us a certain amount to produce it, and we have to get a price for it in order to carry on.  There is no use in the farmers being compelled to produce food for a nation that is not working.  They will not have the money to buy it.  The Government has not showed proper foresight. Surely it did not take a prophet to see that war was coming after Munich, which event took place in September, 1938, I think, the year before war broke out?  Why were the necessary raw materials not brought in in bulk and stored here to enable us to carry on?  Again, we are asked to grow crops on land that has been impoverished by agricultural depression for ten or 15 years, through not getting an adequate amount of fertilisers. The golden opportunity was <Col N="1264" /> lost: the Government did not see that the raw materials to manufacture fertilisers were imported.  I doubt if there is any potash in the country. There may be some camouflaged mixture that we are told is good for this or that.  We may use it but, normally, we would not take a present of it.  We have the factories here but we have not the raw materials.  The result will be that, probably, with the increased acreage under tillage this coming year, if the figure is strictly adhered to and is no more and no less, we may not produce as much as we did last year, because of the shortage of fertilisers.</P>
      <P>The relationship of the other raw materials required for industry is this: our industry is a market for our agriculture and if we have not the raw materials to carry on those industries and we are dependent on our industries here for our agricultural market, we will have no market.  We have to realise that the people have to be fed. Our Government will devise some machinery by which we will get some price, but we will have to pay that price first in taxation before it can be given to the others to buy our stuff. It seems to me that we are in a dangerous position, in a very serious and precarious position.  I would like the Minister to deal with this question of fertilisers.  I must say that the industrial people have every sympathy for the agricultural community, and they see the shortage in the raw materials and that the curtailment of their activity in industry is curtailing our market.  If there were time, I would have a lot more to say in opening this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to use even the extra time that happened to fall into our lap to air my own views any further. I would much prefer to see a contribution to the debate by 20 Deputies for a short time than have speeches by two or three for a long time.  We want to get a discussion on this very important subject from different angles, from Deputies drawn from different parts of the country, representing different classes of the community and even different classes of the agricultural community.  Of course, we must give the Minister ample rope&mdash;I hope not to <Col N="1265" /> hang himself&mdash;to take this House into his confidence.  Deputies who have suggestions to offer to the Government and the Minister in this crisis will, I am sure, willingly make them.  I want the Minister to understand that he is not to take anything I said in my opening remarks in a critical or hostile sense. If he feels that anything I said was critical, I would ask him to accept it as honest criticism of the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, speaking for my own constituency in the County of Dublin and the large farmers there, I would ask the House to remember that if an effort is to be made under this order to increase agricultural production, that increase must come from an increased area cultivated on the larger farms.  I say that because, generally speaking, the order has no application to the smaller farms.  They are already cultivating more than one-sixth of their arable land.  In fact, many of them are tilling land that is not arable at all.  If, therefore, a big effort is to be made to get a big increase in agricultural production this order must apply essentially to the larger farms.  I know that the large farmers in the County of Dublin are financially embarrassed. They put their case before the Government, but I do not know if the Government even acknowledged it. The Minister will see the danger himself if he is called upon to take up a farm and till it.  He will say, in effect: &ldquo;Well, I will do it if I must, but if I do it I will be liable for neither rates nor annuities&rdquo;.  Yet, I am sure he would not concede that privilege to the embarrassed farmer, and say to him: &ldquo;If you till the land required under this order I will see that you are not embarrassed by the sheriff in regard to rates and annuities during the tillage year 1941&rdquo;.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say on the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that fact, because I agree with the Deputy that it would be inexpedient to annul this order.  Indeed, I could conceive circumstances arising in which it would be legitimate for the Minister further to extend the order and require a higher percentage of land to be devoted to cereal and root crops in the coming year than has at first appeared desirable.  Now, in normal circumstances, I think the more a Government keeps off a farmer's land the better it will be for the farmer, and for the country as a whole, but these are not normal circumstances.  The world is at war, and the first duty of a Government or a Parliament is to ensure that the essential necessities of the community over which it presides will be secured in so far as we can secure them without dependence upon external sources.  No one but an elemental idiot, of whom we have a few in this country, would dream of advocating an appropriate war policy as the proper policy for a period of protracted peace.  One must remember that there are some gorillas in this country whose intelligence not infrequently falls below the level of the gorilla: who imagine that if something can be justified in a period of unexampled crisis, and if they happen to have made a bit of surplus money out of it, will urge that it ought to be adhered to for all time, and that anyone opposed to it is a traitor, and playing England's game and so forth. Well, in so far as the gorillas are human they are entitled to liberty and toleration in a democratic country, and we have to suffer them as gladly as we can.  We have to praise ourselves with being democrats and in believing in individual liberty.  We are jealous of preserving the gorilla's right to yap and yap freely, openly, and wherever he will, but we must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by his ferocious exterior or alarmed by the persistence with which he adheres to his simian views.  We must treat him with <Col N="1267" /> patience and forbearance, and firmly resolve not to fall into the errors into which he would lead us if he could.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind then that we are dealing with a very exceptional situation, we have got to recognise that we are justified in taking exceptional measures to meet that situation.  One of the first measures is to secure that the land of the country will be used in the best possible way to secure the most essential supplies.  Now, the first thing that will occur to any intelligent body confronted with that problem is that, in the absence of adequate supplies of artificial manures, we may be putting a very serious strain upon the fertility of the soil.  We have got to bear in mind that during the last seven or eight years the reserves that ought to have been built up in the fertility of the soil have not, in fact, been created.  Now, I could say a lot about that, but in existing circumstances I do not know that postmortems on the past are desirable for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Belton has said, we do not want to waste time.  What we do want is to get the views of every rational man on what is best to do in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I want to say that, conscious as I am of the heavy incursion that this compulsory tillage policy may make on the accumulated fertility of the soil, I think it ought to be made. I think it was against just such a crisis as this that prudent and far-seeing farmers were accumulating a surplus fertility in their land, so that if a serious crisis should ever arise they would have that surplus to fall back upon on the rainy day to carry them over the period when they would not be able to make their annual contribution to the enrichment of the soil.  It is just like the man who puts into the Post Office Savings Bank a couple of shillings every week, while he is in funds, and accumulates £10, £15, or £20 there, saying to himself: &ldquo;Some day I may lose my job.  The unemployment insurance will help to keep me going, but that £15 I have laid by will be a very valuable aid to preserve my standard of living during my period of unemployment.&rdquo;  He would be a fool <Col N="1268" /> who let his children go hungry or his wife go unshod because he was afraid to spend that £15 which he had saved against the particular day of crisis that had come upon him.  Far from fearing to spend it, he should turn to it at once and prudently apportion it over the probable period of his distress.  It might be that before he got his job back again, it would all be spent, but, in the last state, he would be no worse off than he would have been if he had never made the saving, and it is highly probable that before his accumulated savings were gone, the period of crisis would have passed and he could resume a normal budget founded on a weekly wage.</P>
    <P>That is what the farmer should do now.  It is a pity that we have not got more in the savings bank of the land, and if we on this side had had our way, that savings bank would now be well furnished and we could view the future with comparative equanimity.  It is not well furnished, but it is not well furnished through other people's fault. It is going to help none of us to go into that question now, but such accumulated saving as is there&mdash;and it is substantial&mdash;may legitimately be used now. We must do everything we can to make the drain on it as light as possible, but such drain as maximum production makes necessary should be courageously undertaken, and it would be folly to pursue a policy of undue conservatism in the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I think the Government and the community are entitled to make demands on the agricultural community, but, if they are, the agricultural community are entitled to make reciprocal demands upon the Government and the community they serve.  If an industrialist contemplates setting up in this country, he goes to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and says: &ldquo;I am prepared to employ 100 men and am prepared to produce a certain commodity, if (1)  I get a trade loan, and (2)  I get an adequate tariff or quota&rdquo;, and he always gets them. Now, I say that the agricultural community are entitled to go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We are not going to employ 100 men; we <Col N="1269" /> are going to employ half the entire population and we are going to fill the stomachs of the other half.  We are not asking a trade union wage of £3 a week because the best we have ever been given is 30/-.  At this stage, we are not raising that question, but we are asking this, that you will give us a price for our product on which we can live.  Do not constrain us to produce the maximum production for your benefit, and when we have done that tell us to go and sell it in whatever way we can, that it is none of your business to help us to dispose of it. It is not just to force us all into production, and, when we have all produced, to leave us to be plucked by the speculator who knows that we have not got the storage to carry the crops you asked us to produce for your benefit.  Therefore, we want you to say, if you desire the production of these crops: &lsquo;On harvest day, I will take your crops from you at a fixed price&rsquo;.  It may be that storage considerations will require the Government to say: &lsquo;You must keep them there on your farm until we are ready to take them, but on the day you thresh the oats, if you have storage and you put the oats into the loft, we will give you a price for the oats and you become the bailee of these oats for the Government.  If you cannot thresh them, we will have to arrive at some agreement about the value of the stack; we will buy the stack and pay you for it, and you will hold it until we are ready to take it from you'.&rdquo; Similarly in regard to barley and similarly in regard to the other crops which the farmer normally regards as his cash crops.</P>
    <P>I want to lay special emphasis upon this point.  Once that scheme is put into operation, it may well be that not 10 per cent. of the farmers will find themselves constrained to take advantage of it, but the fact that the scheme is there creates a seller's market, while, if the scheme is not there, the farmer is trying to sell on a buyer's market. Let me tell a story to illustrate that point.  In certain rural towns which I know well, a surplus of pigs developed and I approached the Pig and Bacon Commission&mdash;and I glady admit publicly that they were co-operative and <Col N="1270" /> helpful when I explained the problem to them&mdash;and got them to send an official buyer down to say: &ldquo;I will take all the pigs available in the town on a given day&rdquo;.  The first day he got a great gale of pigs; the second day he got a great gale of pigs again; the third day he got only about 15 pigs; the fourth day he got only about 15 pigs, and he began to ask himself whether it was not a waste of time to be coming down there.  I said: &ldquo;Wait, brother; if you are in any doubt as to the value of your advent to this town, although you only got 15 pigs, come round to the back-way where I will show you something&rdquo;.  There were the farmers' carts lined up and there were men out bowing before them, apologising for the delay, telling them that in another moment their pigs would be attended to and asking them not to become impatient.  The farmers were the lords of creation.  There was the utmost attention and deference shown to them and the utmost anxiety to persuade them to keep their pigs for the buyers.  A month before I had been in the same place, and I saw them with the rain pouring off them at 9 o'clock at night, and if they asked: &ldquo;When are you going to take our pigs?&rdquo; they were told: &ldquo;Take your bloody pigs home. Whoever sent for you?  Stand there and keep your trap shut until we are ready to attend to you, and if you do not like it, go home and take your pigs with you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact that those men were now selling on a seller's market made them dignified, independent men, but while they were left at the mercy of the speculator selling on a buyer's market, when I saw them there, I thought of their grandfathers standing at Lord Dillon's rent office, with their hats in their hands, and begging his lordship to take the rent from them and being told that if they did not take those hats off and bend the knee, they would be evicted in the morning and being ordered to conduct themselves and not to be hustling and jostling in that way and inconveniencing the agent, Mr. Strickland.  I thought then of the day when the Plan of Campaign came into operation and Mr. Strickland said: &ldquo;In the name of God, give us your <Col N="1271" /> rent sometime.  There is no hurry about it and you can give it any time.&rdquo;  We changed the market from a buyer's market into a seller's market 50 years ago, and the Pigs Marketing Board, in their way, changed a buyer's market into a seller's market.</P>
    <P>What I am asking the Minister to do now is, in regard to the produce which he is constraining the farmers to produce for the benefit of the community in the coming season, to change the market and make it a seller's market instead of a buyer's market.  Is that asking too much?  That is all I ask.  I am not asking fancy prices; I am not asking extravagant prices; I am not asking a standard of living far in excess of what the farmers ever enjoyed heretofore. All I am asking is a simple thing: Change the market from a buyer's market to a seller's market and leave us to fix the prices, and by the experience I have quoted to you, you will probably find that, although your scheme is designed to be capable of handling 100 per cent. of the produce, in fact, it will not be called on to handle 10 per cent.  I believe that when you are making a case, far from asking too much, you should ask too little.  I think we might legitimately ask for far more for the farmers than I am asking now, but I am asking for something which I believe we can and ought to get, and ought to get now, because if we do not get it now we will not get the production, we will not get the crop.  I shall confine myself to that request and make none other&mdash;that the Minister and the Government will turn the farmer's market next autumn from a buyer's market into a seller's market. If he does that, he can leave the rest to us.  That provides for what the community is entitled to demand off the farmers, and that is all I am asking of the Minister on behalf of the farmers.</P>
    <P>There is a third matter which requires attention.  You may have the land and you may have the muscle but you cannot bring the land and the muscle together if you have not the wherewithal to effect the juncture. That wherewithal is either cash or credit.  There are hundreds of good <Col N="1272" /> farmers who have not got cash and who cannot get credit, and I want to deal with them.  But, before I go on to that matter, I want to deal with the question of the supplies of raw materials. There is not a tariff order ever made in this House or confirmed by it in which there is not a provision that where the Minister for Supplies, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is satisfied that the item tariffed is being imported as the raw material of an ex-war industry or as the equipment of any industry, the person importing is entitled to get a licence to import free of duty.  Will you take off the raw materials and equipment of the average farmer the prohibitions, taxes, tariffs and quotas that at present operate to prevent his getting these materials and this equipment?  A great many of the best farmers in this House come from the eastern counties.</P>
    <P>In these counties, for years, they have had comparatively modern agricultural equipment.  I come from west of the Shannon and I have seen the small farmers west of the Shannon trying to till their soil.  I have seen the small farmers do that with the &ldquo;laidhe&rdquo; and, when they turned the land with the &ldquo;laidhe,&rdquo; they had a harrow-pin, made by the local smith, tied in some cases to a donkey's tail and in other cases to a horse's harness. They started up and down until you would be sick looking at them and until they would be sick looking at the harrow-pin.  At the end of a long day's work, the land was almost as rough as it was when they started harrowing. I watched my own men operate in that way until I was sick looking at them. Then I got a spring harrow.  To a man like Deputy Belton or a man like Deputy Hughes, or a man like Deputy Allen, that, probably, seems no great event&mdash;that he got a spring harrow. But no greater revolution was ever precipitated in the parish in which I live.  They came from miles to look at it.  And we did as much in three &ldquo;scribes&rdquo; as the fellow with the harrow-pin would do in the whole day. That may sound a small thing to the man who normally employs labourers to do the work for him, but in the case of the small farmer who is trying <Col N="1273" /> to reach on his work, to deprive him of the spring harrow by raising the price above his capacity to pay is to impose upon him a servitude as cruel and as unnecessary as if you put him in penal servitude tramping a treadmill. We have no right to do that.  If you want to promote the manufacture of that kind of article in Ireland, you should do it by subsidy.  You should not do it by a method which makes it impossible for the little man to get things done.  If you want spring harrows manufactured in this country and the manufacturers here cannot compete with the British manufacturers, then go to the Irish manufacturers and say: &ldquo;What is the difference between you?&rdquo;  If they say: &ldquo;It costs us £2 more to produce harrows in Ireland than it costs to produce them in Britain,&rdquo; then say to them: &ldquo;Produce as many as you can and we will give you £2 per harrow. We will give you that sum from the Exchequer and that will put you on an equal footing with the English manufacturer.&rdquo; Then let them go out and sell them.  If the Government wants to get the harrows manufactured here, let them even say: &ldquo;Here is a grant of £3.  That will give you an advantage of £1 per harrow.  Go out and compete.&rdquo; But the one thing they should tell manufacturers they will not allow them to do is to raise the price of harrows to a point which makes it impossible for the small man in the west, or south-west, to buy them.  The same applies to ploughs, mowing machines, scythes, sickles, spades and the other implements.</P>
    <P>Are people in this House awake to what it means to the man who is trying to dig with a spade to find that every time he throws his weight on the spade the spade bends?  Or, when half the time, his spade is split?  Does anybody here realise the maddening thing it is digging potatoes with a fork from which the prongs fly out, leaving you with two prongs and a wide gap?  The man who lives in Rathmines will say: &ldquo;Why do you not go out on the tram to town and buy another fork?&rdquo;  It might be five miles to the nearest town, even if the man had the cash to buy the fork.</P>
    <P>Let us admit that he is not so hard <Col N="1274" /> up that he has not the cash to buy a potato fork.  But what man wants to doff his heavy boots, get on his light boots and cycle five miles to buy a potato fork?  When he gets back the prongs may go again.  It is terribly difficult to carry into this House the exhausting hardship which difficulties of that kind inflict on the people least able to bear them in rural Ireland.  I do not want to dwell upon that matter further because I bear in mind that the movers of this motion want to hear the views of different Deputies upon it. But I say to the Government&mdash;take the tariffs off the implements of agriculture, and if you want to encourage the home manufactures, do it by direct subsidy.</P>
    <P>I say, too, let us get as much manure as we can.  If anybody can get good superphosphate of lime anywhere, the Minister should say he will give a bounty of £1 a ton on it, no matter where it is manufactured.  It is vital that we get all the super we can wherever we can.  Let the Minister say: &ldquo;Wherever you can get super this year, we will give £1 a ton in respect of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If he does not say that I believe that large quantities of super which we could get will not come into the country, because the importers who would be able to get it will not risk getting it if they are not able to sell it at competitive prices with the Irish manufactured manure which is getting £1 subsidy from the Government.  The matter of potash has been mentioned. I do not know that there was any shortage of potash last year, but if there should develop a shortage of potash there is a great deal of potash to be got out of seaweed.  I do not say that that method should be adopted if you had Chilean potash at your disposal, but suppose there is a shortage of potash I believe that potash is extractable from seaweed, and if you get sufficient potash for the root crops then I think there are sufficient reserves of potash in the land to carry the cereals for a year or two, by which time I believe the acute nature of this crisis will have passed.  Now, we come to the question of credit.  There is no use in asking the Minister in a general way to provide credit in this country, unless you are prepared to tell him how to do it, and that is what I am going to do.</P>

      <P>I am not a bit afraid of it.  I get so sick of reading in the <i>Standard</i> and ill-informed papers of that kind blather about the gold standard and cutting ourselves free from sterling, and getting out from under the dominion, of the Bank of England, that I think it is time somebody got up and said: &ldquo;That is codology&rdquo;.  If those who are writing it knew anything they would know it is codology, but the reason they go on writing it is because they are so invincibly ignorant and incapable of instruction that until the crack of doom they will go on writing it; but it is right that some voice should be raised to say <i>coram populo</i>&mdash;before the country&mdash;that it is all rámeis and codology. If the rational elements in the country believe in that codology there is no salvation for anybody.  But there is no use in saying it unless those who say it are prepared to say: &ldquo;The position of credit is a critical one, but here is the way to solve it,&rdquo; and that is what I am going to do, and I dare all and sundry to disprove one syllable <Col N="1276" /> of it.  The situation is that a considerable number of farmers in this country need credit.  The fact is that there are abundant funds in the bank provided that security can be got to satisfy the proper anxieties of the bank.  Here is the way to do it.  Under the Land Acts, up to the Land Act of 1932, the land annuity fixed for payment annually or semi-annually by the tenant purchaser was a sum related not only to the intrinsic value of land but to the ascertained capacity of the land to pay and leave a fair margin over from which the tenant occupier could keep his family and maintain a reasonable standard of living.  Now, that is most important.  Therefore, the land annuity was related not only to the intrinsic value of the land but to the capacity of the land to produce it.  Under the 1933 Land Act, quite fortuitously and without any regard to the then value of the land, the land annuities in this country were reduced by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Government to go to the farmer who stands in need of credit and say: &ldquo;Very well.  Suppose your land annuity is £100 per year&rdquo;&mdash;I am taking that as a round figure&mdash;&ldquo;we let you off under the 1933 Land Act £50 per annum of that annuity.  We are prepared to capitalise that remission at twenty years' purchase; that is £1,000. Having done so, we will issue to you £1,000 of land bonds No. 2, and on the day we issue them to you we will restore the amount of your annuity to the sum you were paying prior to the passing of the 1933 Land Act.  You can take that Government security, that £1,000 in bonds, and go to your bank manager and say: &ldquo;I am prepared to transfer those bonds to your name as collateral security for a fluctuating overdraft which will at no time exceed £800, you to give me authority to overdraw within the limit of £800 and to charge on that overdraft, in consideration of my collateral of Government Stock transferred, an interest rate of bank rate plus 1 per cent., that is at present 3½ per cent.&rdquo;  Now, note well what would then proceed to happen. The farmer would be paying an annuity of £100, of which £50 would be earmarked for Land Bond Fund No. 2, and he would over 40 years extinguish <Col N="1277" /> the capital lent him in the form of bonds, and pay the appropriate rate of interest during the whole currency of the loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Four per cent.  The Government would pay interest on those bonds, and would recoup itself for the interest disbursed out of the sum pouring in semi-annually to Land Bond Fund No. 2, thus ensuring for the farmer an income of £35 a year. The farmer would lodge his bonds in the bank, but do not imagine that that means he would have outstanding a loan of £800, because at certain periods of the year he would owe the bank nothing.  When the purchase of stock, or of seeds or manures became necessary his overdraft would rise to a high figure, but in the harvest of the year the realisation of his cash crops would bring down his overdraft, and the sale of his fat stocks or forward stores might completely extinguish it. He might legitimately abstain from any saving during the period, because at the conclusion of the 40-year term fixed for the redemption of the annuity he would be possessed of a capital sum of £1,000, which would be his outright, in the form of bonds of the Irish Government, having attached to them no further annuity obligation, and which he would be free to leave as collateral in his bank, or which he could hand to his stockbroker and realise for cash at the price ruling for Government securities on the day of the sale.  Now, that scheme brings together the credit-worthy farmer, who is willing to borrow, and the bank, which has in its vaults abundant cash which it is most anxious profitably to lend.</P>

Deputy Belton might reply: &ldquo;There are the title deeds of the property.&rdquo;  I might reply: &ldquo;There is the bill of sale of the merchandise; there are the shipping documents of my merchandise.  Hold them against the arrival of my cargo.&rdquo; And the manager would say: &ldquo;That is good security.  Right, Mr. Dillon; we can negotiate these at any time.  We will lend money on them. That is all right.&rdquo;  Suppose I went in and said: &ldquo;There is my farm.&rdquo;  He would say: &ldquo;No; I am not going out into the street to evict a man with the name of Dillon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined a scheme which will provide credit for the farmers of this country.  I understood Deputy Belton to ask me to clear up certain points which were not clear to him.  He discourteously rejects the explanation which I understood him to ask for.  I depart from the matter at once because I have no doubt other Deputies will fully understand the point I have made.  It may be right to say this, that our object is to get credit for the farmers.  Our object is not to turn the farmers of this country into perennial pensioners on the Government.  I say if a farmer borrows £1,000 on the security I have outlined and then will not pay he ought to be evicted.  He ought to be evicted, and the Government is the only power that can go in and evict him.  The Government should evict him and take his land from him and give it to somebody who was prepared to be honest and to pay his debt and let the farmer go to blazes who was not prepared to pay the debt he honestly undertook to pay.  It is not possible for a bank to do it, because local agitation would be stirred up against them and they would be unable to realise their security.  It is for that reason that the farmers cannot get credit because the banks cannot take land as security.  This means that I have outlined enables a farmer to pay back his loan in infinitesimal instalments that no joint stock bank could consider.  It places the sanction of realisation on the shoulders of the Government, where it ought to lie, and it gives the bank a readily realisable security that enables them to give credit where and when credit is wanted. <Col N="1280" /> That is the solution to that problem and if these things are attended to forthwith we can face the future, albeit with anxiety, with confidence that we can get through this crisis as we have got through many another.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Dillon has occupied so much time, but I congratulate him on portion of his conversion at any rate.  If the only result was to make Deputy Dillon favour tillage and the growing of beet and wheat, there is a good day's work done, even though he is still a bit of a lunatic as regards credit.  I think the House is indebted to Deputy Belton for giving us the opportunity for this debate.  I honestly say that because there are a few matters on which it would be better that there should be discussion.  I would not agree with Deputy Belton with regard to the exemption of dairying land.  I do not think any land should be exempt from the tillage order.  I cannot see how any man is going to keep a stock of cows if he does not till something to keep them for the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He could get it from the man who tills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He could.  There is enough of that sort of thing.  Secondly, I agree with Deputy Belton in regard to wheat.  I think the price of wheat has not been fixed at an economic price for this year.  I have said that to the Minister before and I say it here openly.  The difference in the costings alone in regard to wheat between this year and last year would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of about 35/- to 40/- an acre.  The difference in the cost of seed wheat alone between the month of November of this year and the month of November of last year is somewhere about £11 to £12 per ton. We got seed wheat freely last October and November at £14 a ton.  To-day the same seed is £25 10s.  That would be roughly an increase of about 25/- an acre on seed alone.  The Minister was allowing 2/6 a barrel.  If you get a ton to the acre that is allowing £1.  So that in seed alone the farmer suffers a loss of 5/-.  To follow that up, there is an increase in the cost of artificials&mdash;<Col N="1281" /> as much of them as can be got&mdash;an increase in the cost of plough parts. God alone knows what the price of spare parts for reapers and binders will be, what will be the price of coal, if coal can be got next harvest, what the price of threshing is going to be. With all those things piled up, my honest conviction is that with an increased cost of £2 an acre, the present price would not clear the farmer and that he would require at least 40/- a barrel for wheat.  I do not think that the Government have been fair to the farmers in regard to the wheat position.  I am very much afraid that the agricultural community will again be inclined to gamble on barley this year as against wheat. Having a guarantee of 30/- a barrel for a certain quantity of barley, they will be inclined to gamble on getting away with it.  I think it is a foolish policy on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>We have, as Deputy Belton says, about 50 per cent. of our requirements in bread for this year.  Thanks to the Government, despite unbelievers like Deputy Dillon, we have 50 per cent. of our requirements this year, but I think, in view of the present world affairs, we would nearly want to make preparations for 100 per cent. of our requirements for the coming year.  We are not going to get 100 per cent. of our requirements, even at 40/- for wheat, because&mdash;I again agree with Deputy Belton&mdash;the larger the acreage you put under wheat, the more land you devote to wheat, the more you are going from the eight to ten barrels an acre down to the six and seven barrels an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So, it is not such a good proposition after all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You have at all times a certain proportion of the land of this country on which you can grow from eight to ten barrels of wheat to the statute acre.  You have other land and, if you get from six to seven barrels an acre from it, you will be very thankful.  That is the type of land that is considered fit only for oats.  If a man is to put that land under wheat you must be prepared to make the crop pay him, and, therefore, <Col N="1282" /> the price of wheat will have to go up if you are to get an increased acreage. I do not think the Government are wise in persisting in the price of 37/6 a barrel for wheat.  I think that policy is unjust to the agricultural community and it is going to work out in an equally unjust manner for the people of the country generally.</P>
      <P>With regard to artificial manures, I would like to give the farmers who are convenient to beet factories a little advice, and that is to draw all the slaked lime they can.  I give that advice as one who was an unbeliever at one time, but then I tried it and I found that it paid.  I found that by using it last year I was able to increase my wheat output by two to three barrels an acre&mdash;and it increased that much on old lea ground.  I got well over three tons extra to the acre in the case of beet.  The slaked lime is to be had free at the factory.  All the farmer has to do is to go there and draw it away.  When artificials are so scarce it is a good job we have it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to follow the harebrained scheme suggested by Deputy Dillon with regard to credit.  In that connection we are in a rather extraordinary position.  It is hard to get credit in present circumstances, and yet it is absolutely necessary that the farmers should get credit somewhere. Credit will have to be provided from some source.  If an industrialist was able, as was pointed out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce a short while ago, to produce £55,000 he could get £90,000 from the Industrial Credit Corporation, and he was able to get, in addition, two drafts from the Government of £35,000 and £30,000.  In that way he was able to make up £155,000 on his own £55,000.  If the chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation was able to do that in one room, surely the Agricultural Credit Corporation, in the next room, ought to be able to do the same type of thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong?  Any hair-brained individual with an industrial scheme in mind can walk into a bank or into the Industrial Credit Corporation and draw out all he requires, and yet, when a poor farmer goes in for a loan, they almost lock the door and send for the <Col N="1283" /> Guards.  There must be something wrong with the system of economy that creates a position of that sort.  It was all right to take £155,000 of the people's money and sink it in a bog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have been much better if the £155,000 were scattered amongst the farmers of the country by giving them a little credit? We have the chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation quite prepared to give £90,000 to a so-called industrialist who puts up £50,000, but the farmer will not get £200 or £300. There is something wrong with the system that allows that condition of things to exist.  That system of economy should not be allowed to continue. If the farmers of this country are going to till, they must be given credit facilities.  The Sugar Beet Company, bad and all as they are&mdash; and they are bad enough for anything &mdash;are prepared to give credit facilities to those who are growing beet.  You can go there and order artificial manures and they will pay for them out of the beet crop.  Could not something on the same lines be arranged in regard to the growing of wheat, whereby the miller will give a guarantee to the merchants and pay out of the harvest cheque?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some scheme of that kind ought to be arranged.  There is a big margin between the prices paid by the farmer last year and the prices he will have to pay this year.  Last year his seed wheat cost him £14 and this year he will have to pay £25. He paid £4 for a ton of superphosphate last year and this year it will cost him £6 10s. or £7, if he can get it.  These are the obstacles that lie in the way. We have a definite market for wheat. We should grow all we require and there is a safe market there for it. Even if Solomon came here&mdash;the Minister is not too bad; in my opinion he <Col N="1284" /> is next door to Solomon in some of the things he has worked out here&mdash;he could not guarantee that the oats grown in the coming year will be bought from the farmer next harvest or that the barley will be bought from him next harvest.  If we are to judge by the British market to-day&mdash;and you can give it all the sweetness you wish &mdash;it will not pay to produce bullocks for it.  It did not pay the farmer during the last five or six months to produce butter for it, and neither did it pay him to produce bacon for it.  These were three losing games.</P>
      <P>Nobody is going to guarantee that this time 12 months when the harvest is in the farmers will get anyone to buy from them or that there will be any English market to take our produce. Therefore, in my opinion, the land of this country should be put under wheat as far as possible.  Let us at least guarantee bread for our own people.  The Government should adopt this attitude: &ldquo;Very well; we have to get bread for our people and we are prepared to pay the price.&rdquo;  It is as well to give a bit extra to the farmer who grows wheat to feed the people rather than to give it by way of subsidy on the price of milk in order to supply butter to John Bull.  Let us see that our own people will not starve. If there is any agricultural produce to spare let John Bull get it, if he pays for it.  I do not know whether his money will be worth taking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at any great length in this debate.  At the outset, I would say that I do not think there is a Deputy of any Party in the House who does not agree that an effort should be made, having regard to circumstances of the present day, to grow the largest possible amount of necessary food for this country.  The only disagreement that will arise amongst Deputies is as to the manner in which that might be brought about. I think there is something in what the last speaker said in regard to the production of wheat and it applies to other crops also, that probably the greatest inducement that could be offered is a price inducement.  I have no doubt that in normal times the price at present offered for wheat would <Col N="1285" /> have been considered fairly good, but circumstances, owing to the international situation, have changed and what might have been a good price a few years ago is not necessarily a good price now.  The inducement to grow an increased quantity of wheat must be made as strong as possible.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Corry has pointed out, much of the land that grew wheat in recent years has deteriorated and must necessarily produce a much smaller quantity of wheat next year than it did this year or that it will produce next year, should the crisis continue. I think anybody familiar with wheat growing will know that good wheat has been grown for two and three years in succession on the same land, but many farmers, I have no doubt, will engage in what I consider the rather fantastic operation of growing wheat for the fourth time on the same land, some of it with very little manure, as manure is not available.  Anybody who has experience of wheat growing will know what the quantity and the quality of wheat produced under such conditions must be.  I leave that question to those who represent the tillage counties, because I believe that we must rely on these counties, to a large extent, for the production of the most important crops.  Any inducement to increase home-grown food supplies must be mainly directed to those counties if you want to produce the best results.  If you wish you may endeavour to get increased tillage in other counties, but you will not get the same experience of crop production amongst farmers in these counties.  The land will not be as well tilled and will produce less than it should produce, while the crop will not be of as good a quality as can be produced in the tillage counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am principally concerned with a matter to which Deputy Belton referred in his opening speech&mdash;namely, that certain allowances should be made for people carrying on dairying.  Deputy Belton ably explained the reasons why the dairy farmer should be exempted, but the main reason why the dairy farmer should be exempted is not based on the case made by Deputy Belton, good as it was.  I am not making the case that dairy farmers in counties <Col N="1286" /> such as Tipperary, Limerick and parts of Cork should not be asked to produce any tillage.  I think it is up to them to produce at least the necessary foodstuffs for the stock on their lands.  The dairy farmer should be asked to produce at least that quantity, but I think there are reasons why he should not be asked to produce animal foodstuffs beyond these requirements until it is proved that they cannot be got otherwise, and I believe they can.  I think it will be admitted that the dairy farmer is engaged in an essential industry, that the production of milk, butter and beef is as vitally necessary as the production of cereals and other crops.  If you do not admit that dairying and beef production are as essential as tillage, then my argument collapses, but I urge that the production of milk, butter, store cattle and beef is quite as essential a part of our agricultural economy as any other form of production. If you persist in compelling the dairy farmer to till one-sixth of his arable land, what will happen is that you will compel him to get rid of some of his dairy cows.  That may or may not be right; I hold that it is not.  I hold that such a policy is not in the national interest.  The arable portion of the ordinary dairy farmer's land is the portion on which he grazes his stock.  There are other portions which are not arable, and which may be used for other purposes&mdash;such as producing the hay necessary for the winter feeding of the cattle.</P>
    <P>If you compel a farmer who has 10 or 12 cows grazing on 20 acres of land, to till one-sixth of that land he will have to get rid of one-sixth of these cows&mdash;probably two cows.  The general result will be that you will have a diminution in the cow population.  That may or may not be satisfactory.  I hold that it would not.</P>
    <P>I contend that the greater portion of the increased tillage should be confined to the tillage counties.  I am satisfied that in counties outside the dairying counties&mdash;in the Minister's own county, and in Deputy's Allen's county, for instance &mdash; there are numerous farmers who are twice as well versed in tillage as the ordinary dairy farmer would be.  I am talking as one who <Col N="1287" /> knows something about tillage.  I am quite certain that in these tillage counties there are numbers of farmers prepared, and even anxious, to till much more than one-sixth of their arable land if a proper inducement were held out to them.  You can get all the grain you want in the tillage counties. I do not mind what inducement is offered to them.  I do not mind if farmers in the dairying counties even have to contribute to the inducement to be offered to farmers in the tillage counties, but I do say that it is as essential to the national economy to protect the dairying industry, to see that the present number of cows, and the same quantity of milk, butter, and other products are maintained, as it is to produce crops.</P>
    <P>We are a very varied agricultural community, and what applies to one district does not apply to another.  We may have our differences on that point, but I think the Minister realises as fully as I do that there will be some difficulty in enforcing a general compulsory tillage order.  Perhaps the Minister felt that he could not get out of it in any other way, that it had to be a general order or no order, but it may be that in the administration of the order afterwards he can find a way out of the difficulty.</P>
    <P>On the matter of credit, I think a word is desirable.  I have a lot of sympathy with what Deputy Corry says as to the facility with which industrialists can borrow and the extreme difficulty with which a farmer can get anything.  I think Deputy Corry expressed that rightly.  I think it would be almost as easy for a camel to get through the eye of a needle as it is for the ordinary farmer to approach any of the existing lending organisations and borrow twopence&mdash;it cannot be done.  Some method or other must eventually be discovered.  I will not occupy the time of the House in expounding a remedy.  I have my own views on the subject, but it would take more time than I should like to occupy to give my views.  There will be another opportunity for that.</P>
    <P>I do want to say that, although we may get the necessary acreage of <Col N="1288" /> tillage, we will not get it properly done, we will not get it properly seeded or properly cared for unless some credit facilities are provided for the farmers who have to engage in it.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention particularly to that.  There must be some way out of the difficulty, and I hope the matter will not be lost sight of.  In conclusion, I would again ask the Minister to consider the possibility of not requiring people in the dairying districts to produce the full quota of tillage unless no other way out can be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the previous speakers who said that this debate may be helpful.  I believe it may be, because it is evident that every speaker, no matter from what side of the House he spoke, was only too anxious to do what is best in the circumstances.  It is only from that point of view that I want to speak, to point out what the difficulties are, and to invite solutions for those difficulties.  In considering this question in the Department of Agriculture and with the Government. the position was that we had sufficient animal products in the way of dairy produce, eggs, poultry, etc., for our own population and, in fact, sufficient to carry on the normal exports we had been carrying on until the commencement of the war.  What we did require was sugar, wheat, and animal feeding stuffs.  These items are all to be got by increased tillage, and that was the reason why we set out to get increased crops so that we could feed our own population and, if possible, continue to maintain the number of animals we had in the country in case our imports were either lessened or cut off completely. That is the sort of problem we had in mind.  It is not exactly the same as some Deputies have expressed here when, for instance, they said that the production of milk is as important from the point of view of the country as the production of wheat, or the production of butter is as important as, say, the production of malt or barley. That was not exactly the problem, but what was important from an economic point of view.  We had in mind what we were in need of in case of a total <Col N="1289" /> blockade or in case our imports were cut down.  Therefore, we had to look for the grain crops in particular, and also for sugar beet.</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted by everybody, in fact I am sure it would be advocated by everybody here, judging by the type of speeches made, that where a farmer produces a crop for human consumption he should be paid a remunerative price for that crop.  I claim that for wheat and beet the farmer has been paid what might be regarded as a fair price for these crops. Deputy Belton, I think, expressed what even I would agree with when, talking about wheat, he said that under ordinary circumstances, a price of 37/6 per barrel is a good price and would give a good profit to the farmers who were growing wheat and who will continue to grow it.  But he has some doubt whether that price will bring us 100 per cent. of our requirements. I agree that it will not bring us 100 per cent. of our requirements. I am afraid, however, that we would have to pay an outlandish price for wheat in order to get 100 per cent. of our requirements.  If we paid 40/-, we would probably get more; if we paid 50/- we would get more, if we paid £3 we would get more.  But I am not sure that even £3 a barrel would bring us 100 per cent of our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to consider this matter from the point of the consumer.  We have to take a reasonable view.  Knowing that we are paying the farmer what is a fair price, are we justified, then, in putting on another 5/- or 10/- a barrel in order to go to near 100 per cent. of our requirements?  It might be better to say to the consumer that if a crisis were to occur, and if we were to pay the necessary price for wheat to continue the loaf as it is with 100 per cent. flour, with 70 per cent. extraction, and so on, the loaf would reach such a price that it would be practically unpurchasable. It might be better to say to the consumer that in a crisis like that, if we ever reach it, we would have to mix in more pollard with the flour, perhaps some barley meal, perhaps some oatmeal, in order to keep the loaf at its present price.  In any <Col N="1290" /> event, we will have to keep the loaf at its present price, although it may be inferior to what it was before the war. But it is better to have it a little bit inferior at the present price than to have a first-class loaf at three times the price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be exaggerating when I say three times the present price.  Perhaps I should say one and a half times the present price.  That is the sort of problem we have in mind. We have to look at it in that way. I agree that where the farmer is producing human food he should get a fair price.  I think he has got that for wheat and beet and also for malting barley.  As to the other things, however, such as growing barley for feeding and growing oats for feeding, the farmer is growing them for his own animals or for the animals of another farmer.  The oats and barley are either used by the farmer himself, which they are to the extent of 90 per cent., or sold to another farmer to the extent of about 10 per cent. of what is produced. As far as I can see, it is not advisable that the Government should interfere at all in that matter.  But if Deputies think it is advisable that the Government should interfere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have compelled them to grow the crops.  That is a different matter.  I am talking about where the farmers exchange the crops.  We have compelled them to grow them because, as the Deputy knows, we have heard of cases of farmers who would not grow them unless compelled; in other words, they would keep cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  We have heard Deputies claiming that the farmers who have cows would not grow feeding stuffs unless compelled to do it, and they would expect to get oats and barley from some other farmers. <Col N="1291" /> But there may not be some other farmers to grow them.  In fact, it is quite likely that before the next harvest there will be a shortage of feeding stuffs, of oats and barley, even though some farmers may have a surplus. I say that where it is a matter of farmers growing oats and barley for themselves, and by that I mean all the farmers, there is no good reason why the Government should interfere to help in the marketing of the grain, because any interference would only make it dearer on the farmers who buy it.  I do not know of any satisfactory scheme, but if a satisfactory scheme can be put forward for dealing with that problem, I would be very glad to examine it and to adopt it, if it is a good and feasible one.  I do not like to see farmers having to sell oats to dealers or speculators, as they are sometimes called, at a low price, and the oats being sold afterwards at a much higher price before it reaches the farmer consumers.  I should like to stop that if possible.  It has not been done on a big scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I should like Deputy Belton to go into that again.  He claims to know a lot about finance&mdash;high finance, if you like&mdash;but come down to simple things and the position is that you have nine farmers out of ten who grow oats and do not sell any of it, and only a very small percentage of them who do sell it.  If you were to guarantee a percentage of the price, it is quite possible that they might claim some credit on their oats, but nine out of ten of them will not sell it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree, but these details are very difficult to get over. Another point is this: When we are talking here about the farmer who wants to sell his oats and barley, I cannot conceive of a good farmer, who only tills one-sixth of his land, as this order prescribes, having any oats or barley for sale.  I defy any farmer in this Dáil to get up and tell me that a farmer&mdash;a good farmer, at any rate&mdash; if he only tills one-sixth of his land, would have any grain at all for sale&mdash; at least he would have very little of it for sale.  I know that well, just as every farmer Deputy here knows it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not come into this.  The poor farmer, with poor land, and very little stock, would till in any <Col N="1293" /> case.  If he cannot have stock on his land, he tills that land.  That, by the way, covers another point.  Deputy Dillon and other Deputies talked about the credits that were necessary for tillage.  Deputies who have been in tillage and who understand it know very well that the finances necessary for tillage are much less than the finances necessary for grazing, and if a farmer has 100 acres well stocked, and if he has put ten acres or 20 acres under tillage, he has more than enough to finance his tillage operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has not the money, then it does not arise out of the Tillage Order.  As I say, our object in this was to try to get over the difficulty of not getting in the grain that we wanted. The question of artificial manures comes in now.  I know that you will not get as good a crop without artificial manures as you will get with them if they are properly applied, but let us not make too much of this question. Take the peak year of the consumption of artificial manures in this country.  I suppose 1938 and 1939 would be regarded as about the same as peak years for the consumption of artificial manures.  Take one of these peak years and I think you will find that we could not have had any appreciable per centage of our crops manured at all.</P>
      <P>For instance, there is a great deal of talk now about potash for potatoes, and some people think that potatoes cannot be grown without potash.  Now, it is quite evident that with the amount of potash used in this country, not more than 20 per cent. of the potatoes grown here got any potash at all. It is the same with the grain crops. Whether they were grown successfully or not I cannot say, but they were grown without artificial manures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, we are not doing what is unknown if we have to do without artificial manures.  I admit that we will have a lesser yield, but we can grow the crops.  We also hear talk about destroying the fertility of the soil.  Now, I would not be a bit afraid, if it were a case of my own land, of growing, for three or four years, the ordinary rotation of crops without artificial manure.  I know that the land would not be as good at the end of the three or four years, but I would not be afraid of doing so, and I am quite sure that I would be able, within two years anyway of the war being over, to get the land back to its former condition. I am quite sure that it would be easy to restore it to what it was before.</P>
      <P>With regard to artificial manures, the position is bad.  Things change so rapidly and so often that, every day, the position appears different, and usually appears worse.  I can say that. Now, we will have enough nitrogenous manures.  I have said that all along, and I think there is no doubt about it. We will certainly not have enough potash, or nearly enough.  We will have some, but very little.  That is the position with regard to these things.  That is certain about these two, and the only one about which there is any doubt is the one about which there has been doubt all along, and that is phosphates which, of course, is most important. The position about phosphates for the last two or three months was that we were fairly certain we would have 50 per cent. of what we had last year, and that we hoped that we might reach 70 per cent.  That is still our position, but the hope is not as good now as it was a month ago, and that is all I can say about that.</P>

      <P>Yes, but there will be very little free potash.  Now, talking about the seaweed, as far as I can get information on this question&mdash;there are varying opinions, but the best opinion I can get on this question of extracting potash from seaweed is that it would be cheaper to bring the seaweed as it is into the middle of the country&mdash;into, say, the outskirts of Mullingar, just to take an example&mdash; pay the transport, bring it to a farmer near Mullingar and let him spread it on his land, than to manufacture potash from the seaweed and then transport the potash here.  That gives you an idea of how uneconomic it is to manufacture potash from seaweed.</P>
      <P>I have touched upon the point made about dairying.  There is no reason that I know why dairying should be exempt from the order, because the position is that we want grain grown for human food as well as for farmers. A dairy farmer cannot expect to get grain from someone else because that person may want it.  Therefore, he must grow it himself.  The only reason that could be put forward why dairy land should be exempt is that it was exempt in 1917 and 1918.  But there was a different position here at that time.  We were then part of the United Kingdom and the production of milk and cream was very important.  We are not now part of the United Kingdom, and we have plenty of cream, plenty of milk and plenty of butter, too, even if we have to go short of it for a couple of weeks.  Deputy Belton mentioned that widows and orphans were exempted by the British during the last war from the terms of the order.</P>

      <P>No matter how many millions are devoted to agriculture that argument could be used.  If we gave £20,000, £30,000 or £100,000 to something else that argument could be made.  Really the position is that we have given many millions to agriculture. I do not want to delay the House by dealing with that position now, as Deputy Belton wants this motion considered apart from the extraneous subjects.  With oats making 12/- a barrel, I do not claim that tillage farmers are making fortunes.  I think they might make the crop pay and not lose anything at 12/- a barrel.  On the other hand, most animals at present prices would pay if fed on oats at 12/- a barrel.  Farmers who can produce oats at 12/- a barrel do not lose, but I agree that they will not make fortunes. If farmers can get oats at 12/- a barrel, the next question is, can they make animals pay at that price?  I think they can, for instance, for feeding calves, cattle, and for a certain proportion of pig feeding.  In any of these cases I think it will pay to produce oats at 12/- a barrel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point I want to deal with was one raised by Deputy Dillon regarding credits.  I think that scheme was outlined before, either by Deputy Dillon or by some member of his Party.  I remember reading or hearing of the scheme, but I am not aware that it ever came under the very close consideration of the Government, or of <Col N="1297" /> anybody in my Department.  What strikes me about it is this: That if farmers had to take bonds, and had to pay the Land Commission annuities against them&mdash;5 per cent. was suggested by Deputy Dillon&mdash;if the bonds were not being used the farmers would lose. They would not be getting sufficient interest on the bonds to pay the annuities back to the Land Commission.  If the bonds were being used, and if farmers could get loans from the banks another trouble would arise.  If all the farmers used the bonds for credit, and on a rough calculation some £50,000,000 or £70,000,000 would be involved, I do not know what they would do with all that credit or with one-tenth of it.  All the seeds, manures and implements used in tillage for a year would not represent more than £2,000,000.  If the farmers commenced to buy cattle or stock they would be buying against one another, and would eventually drive prices against what would be fair export prices.  Then, when the position settled down and they had got what they wanted, the animals would have to be exported probably at a loss, so that a large amount of credit given to farmers at the one time would eventually do a great deal of harm.</P>
      <P>These are objections to the scheme that strike me, but there is no reason why the proposition should not be examined more carefully, to see if anything could be done in that way.  And talking of credit, I do not think things are as bad as Deputies suggest. I have never believed whether in Opposition or on those benches that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was as bad as some Deputies suggest. If farmers go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation with a fair proposal, and if the corporation comes to the conclusion that they are borrowing only sufficient to carry on, not overburdening themselves with debt, and are likely to pay off loans they will get them.  The complaint is made that it is a slow method.  It is slow, and three or four weeks seem to be a long time to a person who is looking for money, if he gets it at all.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is there to make loans of some magnitude if people want to restock land and have a good case.  The county councils have a scheme for getting seeds or manures.</P>

What they really mean is giving farmers something that they will not pay; men who cannot possibly pay back they are so far gone.  We have that in every class.

      <P>Of the 400,000 farmers here Deputies may be sure that there are a few of them will never do any good.  Some people have that type in mind.  It is not credit for that type they are thinking of, but credit for men who cannot do anything for themselves, to whom no institution could give credit.  The other point I have in mind is that every year I hear a great deal of talk about the need for credit at harvest time, and the difficulties farmers have in getting credit.  I have never had pointed out to me, although I have asked the question for the last six or seven years, one field that was left unsown for want of credit.  It was suggested right round that men could not get seeds or manure.</P>

This is not a time for that.  It is quite possible that, if anything of that sort takes place, the land will not be cropped this year at all, and it will be a national loss.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is a time limit to this debate, I intend to be brief, though I do not think it wise or desirable that there should be a time limit to a debate of this importance.  An Order of this kind carries with it the same powers as an Act of this House. <Col N="1300" /> It is essential that any Order, if there is a motion to annual it, should be given at least the same consideration in this House as a Bill that is being introduced.</P>
      <P>There are just a few very important points which have been raised in this debate, and I am glad that both the Minister and Deputy Corry have admitted that this motion has had some useful effect.  This question of tillage is undoubtedly the most important one that faces the country at the present time.  Anyone who happened to read in to-day's paper the statement of the late British Ambassador to the United States regarding the position of imports and exports and external trade generally must realise that there is a very, very serious year facing this country.  For that reason, all the brains and intelligence that can be mobilised to the solution of this problem should be mobilised at once.  The farmer is being compelled by this Order&mdash;which is equivalent to an Act of this House&mdash;to undertake a certain percentage of tillage.  The farmer, as far as I know, does not object to this Order.  I have not yet met a farmer who says that it is unjust for the State to take upon itself the right to compel him to put a certain amount of his land under tillage, but there is not one farmer who does not assert and demand that, when the farmer is compelled to do this in the national interest, he should at least be guaranteed a remunerative return for his labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering what return he is getting, let us consider the average yield of tillage, which has been ascertained by Departments of State. Figures have been published for the four years ending 1936 regarding the average yield of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes.  Those four years were, to a large extent, very favourable years for tillage.  According to the figures published in official statistics, we find that the average yield for wheat in the Twenty-Six Counties for those four years was eight and a half barrels per acre.  At the official price last year of 35/-, that would bring in a gross return of £14 7s. 6d. per acre. That is the return which the farmer <Col N="1301" /> gets for putting an acre of his land under tillage.  I do not think there are any official or reliable statistics published to show the cost of production of crops.  In this House I have frequently asserted that it is a grave shortcoming on the part of the Department of Agriculture in having failed to provide the necessary statistics of costs of production.</P>
    <P>We know that, during the years 1917, 1918 and 1919, when compulsory tillage was enforced under the British Government, official statistics of costs of production were compiled and published by the British Government. Why did our Government refuse or fail to continue that system of publishing costs of production?  It is only on those costs that one can ascertain whether a crop or a price is economic or otherwise.  I have also frequently pressed in this House that the Department, in order to demonstrate that their views and methods are sound, should undertake the management of farms in different counties.  In this way they would be able to ascertain, first of all, the cost of production and the average yield, and would also be able to demonstrate to farmers the most efficient methods of farming. Since the Department has not adopted this suggestion and has failed to publish costs to show whether farmers are making a profit or not, I say they are sidestepping their responsibility, adopting a shuffling attitude, and simply allowing present uneconomic conditions to prevail.  They are failing to take any steps to remedy those conditions or to face up to their real responsibilities.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the price of an average acre of wheat is £14 7s. 6d., and the cost of production, as any practical farmer could tell the Minister, cannot be less than £15 per acre. It will be seen clearly, therefore, that on the average crop there is no return whatever.  Of course, it is the crops which yield over the average of eight-and-a-half barrels per acre that produce a profit.  When we take eight-and-a-half barrels as an average, we must remember that there is a very large percentage of the acreage under wheat producing less than that and, therefore, <Col N="1302" /> the production is at a very great loss to the farmer.</P>
    <P>In connection with oats, the position is even more serious.  According to official statistics, the yield of oats in this State is 11 barrels per acre. The price during the past year was 12/6 per barrel, so that the return the farmer gets from an acre of oats at that price is £6 17s. 6d.  I do not think anyone would suggest that under any system of farming oats can be produced here at that price, and in respect to that I assert that the Government have failed completely.  At the outbreak of the war last year, the price for oats improved and was considered by farmers to be fairly satisfactory. The oat crop for 1939 was, I think, sold at about 15/- per barrel.  Less than three months after, the price went up to 30/- a barrel.  I suggest that it was not the unfortunate farmer who spent nine months producing that crop that got the profit, but rather the profiteering middlemen.  They reaped the three months' profit and the Minister apparently stood by.  The Minister has frequently suggested that it is not desirable that he should intervene in the matter of marketing, but surely he must realise that he has responsibility to ensure that the producer will get for his product a price which will bear some relation to the price at which that product is ultimately sold to the consumer.</P>
    <P>If the Minister allows the profiteering that took place in regard to the oat crop last year to be repeated in the future, then I say he is not doing his duty to our producers and to the tillage farmers.  In fact, he is failing to carry out the duty which the order we are discussing imposes on him.  He allowed a profit of 100 per cent. to be made on the oat crop last year, and, as far as one can gather, is not prepared, even now, to take any steps to prevent a repetition of that criminal profiteering. In regard to the oat crop for the present year, the Minister almost threw up his hat in the other House when a discussion took place there on the question as to how farmers were to dispose of their surplus oats and barley, and said that question had been solved; but how?  By compelling the unfortunate farmer to sell his produce <Col N="1303" /> at an uneconomic price, the oats at from 12/6 to 12/9 per barrel, and a very large percentage of barley at from 17/6 to £1 per barrel.  Now there has been a very substantial increase in the value of those products, and who is going to reap the benefit of that?  In my opinion it is not the man who is complying with this order and taking all the risks involved in increasing tillage, but rather the idle profiteering middleman.  Unless the Minister is prepared to take steps to prevent that profiteering, then I assert he is not doing his duty to the tillage farmer.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I should like to refer to, and that is the utilisation of our produce for pig feeding. The price of pigs has been fixed at 67/-, but the producer is being compelled by the profiteering rings of bacon curers to sell his pigs at 62/-, live-weight.  The Minister is allowing the profiteers to get away with that robbery.  Surely the Minister should feel that he has some responsibility towards producers who are being compelled by him to increase production. In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to include the rape crop amongst the tillage crops provided in the order.  On inferior land, in the mountainy districts, this crop is required for the feeding of stock much to the same extent as turnips and mangolds and other root crops, and for that reason I think it should be regarded as a tillage crop.  It is grown to a large extent in the poorer districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister conceded that a fixed price of 40/- for wheat would induce the production of more wheat, and said that any shortage we may have will have to be made up by diluting the flour and raising it to the 100 per cent. level.  Therefore, we have to choose between a higher price for our bread and an inferior bread.  I think an extra price would encourage a 100 per cent. production of wheat, and that the public, on the whole, would vote overwhelmingly for having a 100 per cent. wheaten bread.  I think the Minister's policy should be to get enough wheat grown to give us that 100 per cent. wheaten bread.  I suggest to him that he should go further up the scale from 40/- to 45/- per barrel, <Col N="1304" /> and see what that will do in regard to the production of wheat.  It is a pity that was not done earlier.  I think myself that 45/- a barrel would secure for us 75 per cent. of our grain requirements. On the question of interfering and fixing the price of oats, which was referred to by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cogan, I think this matter of holding on to oats or cashing it in harvest time all depends on the financial position of the farmer, and in my opinion if adequate credits were provided for the farmers they would solve that problem.  The farmer would be able to hold his grain and take a risk of getting a higher price for his oats or perhaps a lower price, or even feeding the grain to animals.  I should be more inclined to support the view of the Minister as regards providing adequate credits for the farmers, so that they would be enabled to hold the crop until a suitable opportunity presented itself for marketing.</P>
      <P>It is a terrible pity that more time was not given for the discussion of this important subject.  I am certain there are Deputies in all parts of the House who were anxious to speak on it.  I know at least eight or nine Deputies myself who were anxious to speak, and who could do so with effect and with practical knowledge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon was rather extravagant in his language and one would think that he was the only Deputy who possessed any intelligence or any knowledge about finance or currency. I did not deal with finance or currency at all, nor, when dealing with the question of credit for the agricultural industry, had I in mind the position of the needy farmer or industrialist who wanted to borrow a lump sum to speculate with.  What I was concerned with was that the national credit system of this country should pump sufficient credits into both agriculture and industry to put more purchasing power into the pockets of the public and thereby enable them to pay the price for the crops we produce.  That can be done in only one way, that is, by our controlling credit.</P>

      <P>No, control of credit.  We have as much right to control our <Col N="1305" /> credit and currency as New Zealand, Australia, Canada, South Africa, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark or any other nation in the world.  We are the only free nation in the world which has not got control of it.  It appears as inflation to Deputy Allen and it is all bosh, moonshine and &ldquo;codology&rdquo; to Deputy Dillon.  It is time that these Deputies got down to it and studied the essentials of freedom.  We have no more of a note issue in this country to-day than we had before the war, and who controls it?  The Bank of England, which watches over the value of our pound to see that it is exchangeable in value with British sterling. How is that controlled?  The more credit put up here, the more notes require to be issued, and, in the eyes of the British, the less value these notes are, so that credit is controlled by the Bank of England in order to keep down note issue and to make our notes of the same value as the British note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting any form of credit or any form of currency; I am not suggesting the Douglas system, and there is no use pointing to Alberta, New Zealand or any other place, so far as I am concerned.  My position in this matter is that we, having political freedom in this House, should have financial freedom by the establishment of a central bank operating in this city, the capital of the country, which we have not got at present.  That is my position, and I have as much fixed property to go up in smoke as any other man in the House, and I am not afraid of inflation. The British pound is inflated, while ours is not, and we have to exchange a deflated pound for an inflated British pound.  I challenge contradiction of that.  Until we get adequate credits here, the facilities which every country has for production, we will not be able to produce.  Why are 100,000 of our people unemployed? What has the Government to say to the building trade being brought to a standstill and building operatives, who would be purchasers of the extra food we are growing, and will grow more in the coming year, who would be earning good wages and be in a position to <Col N="1306" /> buy that food from us, walking around idle?  They will not be able to live now unless we give them home assistance to buy the food from us.  We are taxed to give a paltry sum to the unemployed in order that they will be able to buy more of our produce.</P>
    <P>Consider the position in which we would be if these unemployed were working at full wages and able to come, with heads erect, into the market and buy our stuff at market prices.  They would be able to pay us a better price for it and we would not have to pay in taxation for what is keeping them in idleness.  It is all due to want of foresight because our Government, when they saw the danger ahead, did not import into this country the building materials which we lack here.  The same applies to other walks of industrial life.  Our unemployed will be a burden on us instead of being a marketable asset. Why have we that position?  We had idleness before the war began and we had all the raw materials for building, including the operatives, before the outbreak of war.  All we wanted was the finance to pay the men to assemble these materials and to produce houses. We had all the essentials but we had not got that money.  There are men in the House who shout: &ldquo;Inflation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mad finance&rdquo;, men who went out to fight for freedom, and when they have it, they do not recognise it, and do not use it.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that the Minister should laugh at that.  I wonder for what reason we fought for freedom, and what is freedom.  Is freedom some state or condition to enable another fellow to exploit you?  I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture and I were competing side by side in, say, the growing of early potatoes for a restricted market, whether he would be satisfied to give me control of his banking account.</P>

      <P>If the Minister considers that I, in my ignorance, know more about banking than he does, it is time he started to study, because I do not know much about it, and if this great debate comes off, I suggest that the Minister should take the chair at it.</P>

      <P>I hope the notes will be helpful to him.  The Minister proposes to work farms which he takes over under this scheme, but that he will not be liable for rates or annuities while working them.  Does he think that fair or equitable?  If you put a man out of his land for the time being because he will not work it, perhaps through lack of funds, surely, when the Minister goes into it, or puts a man into it, he should at least see to it that he would pay the outgoings on that farm.  He will not do so, and all this is to be piled on to the man from whom the land is temporarily expropriated.  Again, I want to urge him to consider the very hard lot of a widow left with a farm and a young family.  I am sure that if the Minister found that that widow was not tilling the land, he would not like to put in a man who would be more or less of the character of the old emergency man and say to him: &ldquo;Till this land, one-sixth of it.  Let it pay you or not, and you are not liable for annuities or rates,&rdquo; but all the time rates and annuities will be piling up for the widow who is displaced.  Does the Minister think that just?  I suggest that where a widow finds herself in such a condition&mdash;and the same applies to orphans&mdash;she should be allowed to <Col N="1308" /> make an application to the Minister, and that if the case is proved to his satisfaction, or to the satisfaction of his representative, power be vested in the Minister to waive the compulsory conditions in her case.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he would consider that point.</P>

      <P>Do you not appreciate the hardship of it?  The Minister might consider it over the festive season of Christmas and perhaps he would be softened before February comes around.  This motion was put down by Deputy Cogan and myself in order to have the discussion which has taken place on it.  Neither of us is opposed to tillage.  It was put down merely in order to have a review of the Tillage Order and its conditions, to offer suggestions and criticism and generally to be helpful.  The Minister appreciated, and admitted his appreciation of, the spirit in which the debate was carried on by those who spoke before him.  I think I am expressing the opinion of those with whom I had an opportunity of speaking since the Minister took part in the debate when I say that the Minister has reciprocated that spirit and I hope that we will have the co-operation necessary in this emergency in agriculture as well as in every other Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the rape crop was raised at the last meeting of the agricultural consultative council and I undertook to consider the rape crop where the seed was not sown on lea land, because it was sown there for the purposes of evading the order. Where it is sown for a tillage crop, I undertook to consider it, but I wound up my statement at that meeting by saying that I was very doubtful whether there would be any rape seed at all available this year.</P>
