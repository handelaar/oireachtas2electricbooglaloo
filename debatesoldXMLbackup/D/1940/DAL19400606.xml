      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he will state if Frank Ryan is still in the custody of the Spanish authorities and whether, in view of the fact that all other foreign nationals were released from imprisonment in Spain, he will state what steps he has taken in recent months to secure the release of Frank Ryan, and what further steps he proposes taking in the near future towards that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if representations were made to him last year as to the effect on certain businesses in Dun Laoghaire of the operation of Part II of the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938; if the businesses referred to cater specially for tourists and visitors; if in the circumstances he would consider declaring Dun Laoghaire an exempted area for the purposes of the said Part of the above Act during a defined holiday season either absolutely or conditional on provision being made to have substitute weekly half-holiday periods given to employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Application for permission to keep open shop on the weekly half-holiday was made by two traders in Dun Laoghaire last year. While the traders in question may be said to cater for tourists and visitors, their business would appear to be mainly that of the newsagent, stationer and tobacconist type.  Adequate provision for meeting the requirements of tourists and visitors on the weekly half-holiday has already been made by the exemption of a large number of businesses, including the businesses of selling toys and souvenirs, from the provisions of Part II of the Act.  In the circumstances, I do not consider that action on the lines suggested by the Deputy is called for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two such appointments have recently been made.  The persons appointed had no previous post office service.  In accordance with the normal procedure, nominees of the employment exchange were considered in conjunction with men already in the service in a temporary capacity.  The selections were made on considerations of particular suitability for the positions, not of previous employment in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say on what grounds he can even pretend to justify the appointment of persons who <Col N="1537" /> have no previous experience in these posts in preference to persons with 15 years' temporary service in the Post Office, persons who have been employed in these posts for upwards of two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that these people who have no previous experience in the Post Office could not possibly be classed in the same category as people with 15 years' service. I should like to know on what grounds he can justify the appointment of persons with no previous experience in preference to people who have been there for at least 15 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give any instructions in this matter, and the only information which I have at present about it is that the Deputy's house was searched on the authority of an order issued by a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána <Col N="1538" /> under Section 24 of the Firearms Act, 1925.  I have asked for a full report as to the circumstances in which the order was issued and executed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that I wired to the Minister on Monday evening asking for an explanation, and it is now Thursday, and I have not got an explanation yet, although the raid took place at 5 o'clock on Monday morning, I think it is showing very little consideration for a member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have given the undertaking, in answer to Deputy Hurley, that I am having the whole thing inquired into.  I got into touch with the Gárda Síochána, but they have been very busy in the last few days.  I gave that as a reason for not having a full report, but I hope to have it soon.  As I have said, the Guards have been very busy recently, and that is the only explanation I can give as to why I have not got the report.  I did ask for it when Deputy Norton raised the matter with me.  I also got a telegram from Deputy Hurley asking for an explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate that, in a case of this kind, an inquiry as to the cause for such procedure should take precedence of all or any other duties the superintendent may have to discharge.  The retention of public confidence at the present time <Col N="1539" /> is of supreme importance, and this inquiry should take precedence of everything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is really serious in going on with item 10&mdash;Local Government Bill, 1940 &mdash;Second Stage?  I wonder if any member of the House has had time to study that Bill?  The present does not seem to be a suitable time in which to introduce a Bill of that nature.  The Bill is one which is designed for normal times, and it is in normal times, I suggest, that it could be properly considered.  I do not believe that, even if the Government had this Bill in their hands to-morrow, they would operate it.  They would not have the desire or the opportunity to operate it.  I think the Minister would be well advised to leave over a Bill of this nature for consideration to some future time when Deputies will be in a position to devote their full attention to it, and perhaps make it a better Bill than it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the local elections may, in the national interest, have to be postponed, is there any need to press this Bill through at this stage?  Would it not be better, as Deputy Brennan has suggested, to leave it over and have it considered in calmer circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As the law stands, the local elections will have to be held before the 30th September.  No decision has yet been reached to amend the law and, therefore, if these elections are to be held and the Managerial Bill put into operation, it is essential that this Bill should be passed, and that all the necessary arrangements should be made before that date. There is no desire to rush it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that a one-sentence Bill would enable the Government to postpone the holding of the elections until such date as we had agreed on.  A Bill of that kind would get over the difficulty he speaks of.</P>

      <P>On this Bill I want to put this consideration to the Minister. It is proposed to make provision under it for the enrolment of persons in the regular Army and Volunteer reserve.  I have already put privately to the Minister this consideration: that a large number of persons will, I hope, join both the regular Army and the Volunteer reserve forces because they are anxious to serve the nation in this hour of trial and difficulty. Many of them have an insurable position under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and, therefore, I would like the Minister to give to the House an assurance that their joining the Volunteer reserve, or the regular Army, will not in any way prejudice their position under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  In other words, that on the day they leave the Army, when the emergency has passed, they will be in the same position in respect to unemployment insurance as they were on the day before they joined the Army.  I am sure that the Minister, with his outlook on this matter, will accept that viewpoint and, therefore, I do not propose to argue the details of the case.  If the Minister would say that some provision will be made by an amendment of the relevant sections of the Unemployment Insurance Acts to cover cases of that kind, I will be quite satisfied that it will be done in due course.</P>

      <P>This is a section which calls for having a date put down to the period of emergency.  It appears to me that there should be two periods of emergency&mdash;one a longer period and the other a shorter period, being the one in which the soldiers who are recruited for the emergency are entitled to retire.  The emergency may last for a longer period.  It may last for 12 months or so after the cessation of hostilities.  It is sometimes presumed that there is not a normal condition of affairs until the terms of peace have been settled.  I expect that the Minister does not want to keep these troops during that period, that it is only for the emergency that he requires them, and that he will not keep them a day longer than is necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This section introduces a new principle, unless I am mistaken, namely, that of an officer being tried summarily by an authorised person.  Presumably the reason for the introduction of this is that, during the period of emergency, it will be difficult to arrange for the setting up of courts-martial. I think that is one of the explanations for it.  Two points arise in connection with this.  The first is that it amounts to a judicial act on the part of commanding officers who are not experienced in the law.  The second point is: when exactly will the commanding officer make up his mind as to what is to be the penalty to be inflicted in a case of this sort?  It may be a very good system, but it is open to considerable abuse.  It would be well if the commanding officer had the benefit of the advice of some legal officer in connection with a matter of that kind.  On the other hand, it is inadvisable, particularly in the case of an emergency, to have courts-martial. There would be delay in setting them up and, possibly, the officers should be discharging other duties.  But, in the normal course, it is not very advisable to have a commanding officer doing this.  The term used is &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo;, and that looks as if he were to be somebody almost on a par with the commanding officer.  Will the Minister tell us something about this particular section and how he proposes to take precautions so that there will not be abuses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really intended to deal with minor misdemeanours. Heretofore, an officer who committed some minor type of indiscretion could not be punished by his commanding officer or, if the commanding officer did inflict some minor type of penalty, the officer had the right to demand a court-martial.  As the Deputy is aware, a court-martial means considerable expense, apart from taking up the time of the officers concerned, and it has been deemed necessary to have officers to deal with this minor type of indiscretion.  There is certainly no question of doing away with courts-martial for the more serious types of offences.  I can assure the Deputy <Col N="1550" /> that the officers concerned will in fact have legal advice.  In every command area there are one or two or more legal officers appointed who, on all occasions, can be consulted by officers who have to make decisions of a legal character.  I can assure the Deputy that the people involved will be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another phase of this which I wonder if the Minister has considered.  An officer, after all, is in a very responsible position and should have some respect for the dignity of the commission which he holds.  It would be very inadvisable if, by reason of the operation of a section such as this, officers felt that they could commit minor indiscretions and merely be fined £1, £2, or £5, as the case may be.  It would reflect on the service as such.  This section might reasonably give rise to the impression that these minor indiscretions could be committed with impunity.  An officer who committed an indiscretion should be &ldquo;told off&rdquo; by his commanding officer, and there should not be even a fine.  If there were a couple of such cases, that officer should be brought before a court-martial. Nobody wants Army officers who are undesirable in the Army. They should be men of good character, and should be able to live without having these methods adopted in order to impose discipline.  I do not like the clause, and I hope there will be no attempt when this emergency is over to put it into military law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If an officer feels that he can take a risk and commit a minor indiscretion, in the hope that he will get away without the punishment provided in this section, it is also within the authority of the investigating officer under sub-section (2) (b) (iii) to insist that the officer be brought to trial by court-martial.  If he came up frequently for minor indiscretions, under sub-section (3) (b) he could be brought up for trial by court-martial, so that really there is a way of dealing with a person who is always, so to speak, walking the tight-rope.  I should like to have an assurance that <Col N="1551" /> such an officer could be dealt with under sub-section (2).  The procedure to be adopted there on the part of the commandant or other officer of higher rank is clear.  Under sub-section (2) (b) the commandant can take steps to dismiss the charge, can bring the officer to trial by an authorised officer or can, because of the nature of the case, or the recurrence of a number of cases, insist on trial by court-martial.  In sub-section (3) it is provided that an authorised officer may when a case is brought before him, dismiss the charge or award any of the following punishments: (i)  a fine not exceeding £5, (ii) a severe reprimand or (iii) a reprimand. Can I take it from the Minister that if the authorised officer feels that the case is one in which the charge should not be dismissed, but any of the fines imposed, then the officer, before any severe punishment can be inflicted on him, has the right to ask for trial by court-martial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is actually the law at the present time.  In answer to Deputy Cosgrave, no officer will be anxious to commit an indiscretion because every one of such indiscretions would be recorded on his sheet and the possibility of his ever receiving promotion, with a series of even minor indiscretions against him, would be very slight.  His chances of promotion would be very small.  In itself that would be a deterrent.</P>

      <P>I do not know the purport of this section at all.  I do not like it, and I do not like giving anyone the right to have anyone arrested on mere suspicion.  Assuming a man is a deserter, why provide machinery to bring him before a Peace Commissioner or a District Justice, when he is, in fact, a member of the armed forces? Could not that fact be confirmed by <Col N="1552" /> the military authorities?  I do not like the idea of giving anyone the authority, even in a case of emergency and for cause unknown, or perhaps owing to some personal enmity.  Surely all the Gárda stations will be notified and the Army authorities will be aware that A.B. is a deserter, and in that case he can be taken into custody.  It is going too far to give wholesale authority to have such people brought before a Peace Commissioner or a District Justice.  Simpler machinery would be to provide that all Gárda barracks and military stations will be informed that A.B. was a deserter, and to be on the look-out for him and detain him.  To give a blank cheque to anyone to act on suspicion, when perhaps there was no ground for it, seems to me to be likely to cause trouble, especially where a person might think that some other person should have joined the armed forces.  Deputies can visualise the situation where a person might be arrested on suspicion and apparently would have no protection.</P>

      <P>This simplified the former manner of dealing with deserters from the armed forces.  Heretofore, a deserter had to be brought before a District Justice and very often that entailed confining that person in durance vile.  We suggest a simplification of that procedure, and if a deserter is discovered in a small village or town he can be brought before a Peace Commissioner, who simply remands him to military custody.  He can then be dealt with for what he is, a deserter, from military service.</P>

None of us can say when the actual emergency, that we all anticipate, is likely to occur, but if it does arise, Deputies will agree that speed limits will go by the board if the exigencies of the situation should demand it.

      <P>In page 20, line 48, after the word &ldquo;Forces&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;for a period of emergency&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that this provision applies only to a period of emergency. The section only makes compulsory an arrangement that is carried out by most employers when an employee returns after a period of service with the Forces, that is to see whether he could not be reinstated.  I want to make it clear that it is not compulsory in cases where a man would be away serving for seven years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  Men who are offering their services to the nation ought to be given some assurance that, after offering themselves to be trained and made capable soldiers in an emergency such as the present, they would be restored to their employment on leaving the Army.  It did not, unfortunately, happen in the last mobilisation.  There were some&mdash;I would not say many&mdash;cases where men were, in my opinion, disgracefully treated.  They came along at the request of members of the Government. They offered their services, which were accepted, and they were detained in the Forces for such a period as the Army authorities thought necessary.  They were then exempted from service, and when they went back to resume their employment they found that their positions had been filled by men who were just as fit as they were and who, if they had had <Col N="1555" /> the same patriotic ideas, should have been in the Volunteer Force as well. I do not want that to occur again, and I am pretty sure that it will not occur in the case of any decent employer in the city.  The Chamber of Commerce has notified me to-day that it is advocating this to every employer throughout the country, asking them to ensure that any man joining up in the Volunteers or &ldquo;for the duration&rdquo; will be guaranteed his employment again at the end of the period for which he has been called up.  In those circumstances, I do not think that the Deputy should press the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister and myself seem to be at cross purposes.  I am not suggesting that this should not apply to a person who is called up for the emergency or who enlists for the emergency.  The only point I wish to make quite clear is that it does not apply to a person who runs his full time of military service under the ordinary enlistment Acts.  I do not wish to narrow it to the actual period of the emergency.  I want to make it quite clear that a person who has enlisted for the emergency could get back his employment.  If the provision suggested in my amendment had been in force, surely the case that the Minister has outlined could not have arisen.  I do not see how a person who has enlisted for the period of emergency is going to find that interpreted against him when the period is over. If the Minister can tell me what fears he has along those lines, I would be quite anxious to meet him.  I only want to make it quite clear that this only applies to a person who enlists for a period of emergency and who is retained for that period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> It seems to me that Deputy Dockrell is rather right in saying that the section, as it reads, would indicate that where a person enlists in the Forces&mdash; and was an employee&mdash;for, say, a normal period of two years and ten years with the Reserve, or who might continue with the Forces for five years and spend the rest in the Reserve, that person&mdash;having left employment in ordinary peace times and gone into the Army&mdash;will be entitled to get back his work after he came out of the Army. I suggest, in the first place, that if that is not the intention it would be reasonable to put in the words that Deputy Dockrell speaks of and that, in any case, the marginal note, if it indicates the intention of the Minister, would suggest that those words ought to be put in.  It seems to me that there is a conflict there as it stands.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes provision for an employee of the State &mdash;presumably of a local authority which is subject to a Minister of State &mdash;to &ldquo;obtain the consent of the authority or some person acting on behalf of the authority&rdquo;.  There is no such provision with regard to the other party.  I do not know of any case in which a person going away to enlist at the present moment would seriously inconvenience an employer, but I can conceive of a case in which such might occur.  A man may be engaged in a specialised kind of work and he may get in somebody who may stay for a couple of years.  You give the State, on the one hand, authority to say that a man cannot go, but you do not give the employer the same right to say that in respect of anybody who does not enlist.  If you are <Col N="1557" /> going to take the line that the State is a sort of maternal individual, the maternal care ought to be exercised all round and not in respect of certain State servants only.  The Minister gives a reason for that particular exclusion and says it was made in regard to the head of a Department of State and that an employer has not that right.  I am sure that the Minister can conceive of a certain man in a certain employment being almost vital for that particular kind of employment.  The man goes away and the employer is put to some expense and trouble in getting another person. Having trained that person for a period of two years, perhaps, the other man may come along and must be taken back.  I do not see any provision here where there is the right to make such a case as I mentioned, and I am sure that there must be such cases in connection with certain persons.</P>

Even in the case of agricultural workers, where it has been proved to the authorities that certain men are absolutely essential, they have been exempted.  That applies also to persons such as the Deputy mentioned&mdash; persons in the employment of Government Departments and other employment of that kind.  There is no comparison between the value of the service such people can render to the State in their present positions and the service which they would be able to render if taken into the Volunteers.  In every case we shall deal as fairly as possible with claims for exemption.  Everybody, of course, who makes a claim for exemption thinks that he has the strongest possible case.</P>

Similarly, the man who enrolled last September is worth ten who enrol to-morrow.  I should like to make a special appeal to the Minister to make some provisions for these men who have been already victimised.

      <P>There is another point which I should like to put forward for the consideration of the Minister.  In sub-section (1) (d) it is provided that every former employer who fails to reinstate a former employee on his discharge from military service, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £50.  Under sub-section (1) (e), if the former employer is found guilty of such offence, the court may also order him to pay to the former employee a certain sum, approximately six months' pay. On the construction of the section it seems that, before the court can award an employee six months' pay, the employer must be found guilty of an offence.  While sub-section (4) of the section provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make regulations in respect to employers who try to evade their responsibilities under the section, it is only after an employer is found guilty of the offence that the court may order the payment of certain compensation to the employee.  Who is to prosecute the employer?  Is the Minister perfectly satisfied that under sub-section (4) the Minister for Industry and Commerce will prosecute the employer?  Clearly the employee cannot get compensation unless the employer is prosecuted and is found guilty of the offence.  It is clearly necessary that somebody should have responsibility of initiating the prosecution so that if the employer is found guilty of the offence the employee may get the compensation provided for in <Col N="1560" /> sub-section (1) (e).  Is the Minister satisfied that under sub-section (4) the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to initiate the prosecution?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, if he finds that the Seanad regards this Bill as the curious thing that we regard it here, whether he would convey to them our apologies and explain the circumstances in which it did not get the detailed examination here that a Bill on an important subject such as this is ought to have, and would he, between this and the discussion in the Seanad, consider a proposition that he may find himself up against in the Seanad, that is, a request that this Bill be made of a temporary character, say, for a period of three years or such period after the present emergency terminates as may be thought reasonable so that the matter can be re-reviewed in the light of any possible operation of the Bill that there might be in the meantime?

Is dócha go bhfuil sé léighte ag na Teachtaí agus mar sin fanfa mé go dtí go mbeidh ceisteanna á gcur.  Ní dóigh liom gur gá dom-sa cur leis anois, agus fanfa mé go bhfeice mé an mbeidh aon cheist le cur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> Ag seo síos an Meabhrachán atá i gceist:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Is truagh liom nach éadtrom na Meastacháin atá leagtha amach le haghaidh na Seirbhísí Oideachais atá faoi chúram mo Roinne-se.  Rinnemar ár ndícheall chun caitheamh airgid do mhaolú; ach, mar sin féin, tá suim na Meastachán os cionn chúig mhilliún punt.  Do thír na h-Eireann is trom an tsuim í sin, óir is mó í ná an seiseadh cuid dár bhfagháltas bliana.  I gcomparáid le n-ár dteacht-isteach tá sé chómh hárd de chaitheamh ar oideachas agus atá le fagháil in aon tír eile sa domhan.  Níl amhras ar bith ná go bhfuil ár náisiún fial thar barr leis na seirbhísí a mbaineann na deontaisí seo leo; agus tá sé de cheart ag an bpobal bheith ag súil le deagh-thoradh.</P>
    <P>An bhfuil an deagh-thoradh san dá fhagháil dá ríre againn?  Ní féidir an cheist sin do fhreagairt chomh réidh agus d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh dá mb'ionann cuspóir do gach ceann de na seirbhísí oideachais sa tír seo.  Is fíor gur ullmhú i gcomhair lán-bheatha gach aon chinéal oideachais; ach tá a hobair féin agus a cuspóir féin ag gach ceann de na trí príomh-sheirbhísí&mdash;an Bun-Oideachas, an Meán-Oideachas agus an Céard-Oideachais.  Mar sin de, is riachtanach scrúdú fá leith do dhéanamh ar gach seirbhís aca, más áil linn cruinn-áireamh do dhéanamh ar an toradh a gheibhtear as an gcaitheamh airgid go léir, tríd is tríd.</P>
    <P>Is é an Bun-oideachas an chloch bhuinn do gach taobh den Oideachas go léir.  Do naonbhar as gach deichneabhar de mhuinntir na hEireann, is í an Bhun-Scoil a n-aon ionad léighinn. Tá sé iontuigthe ag gach éinne, dar ndóigh, gur ar na gnáth-adhbhair léighinn, no an léigheann saoghalta mar adéarfá, atáim ag trácht annso. Is é gnó na scoileanna san a gcuid daltaí do theagasc sa chaoi nach mbeidh siad i n-easbaidh aon cheann de na cáilidheachta a theastuigheas ón ngnáth-dhuine fá láthair .i. léigheamh, scríobadh, áireamh, cruinneas agus deis réasúnta labhartha, fios a bheith aca cad is ionad dóibh ar an domhan <Col N="1567" /> agus cionnas a thárla ár gcineadh san ionad san.  Fairis sin, is d'obair na scol so féachaint le snáithí ár seantsaoghail náisiúnta a thabhairt le chéile tré bhuanú na Gaedhilge, chomh fada agus is féidir san a dhéanamh ins na scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Má tá ag eirghe le na hoidí scoile na dualgaisí sin do choimhlíonadh go réasúnta, is cóir dúinn a bheith sásta le n-a saothar.  An fíor go bhfuilid ag cóimhlíonadh na ndualgaisí sin? Dubhradh annso sa Dáil agus in áiteanna eile nach bhfuil príomh-ghnó na mbun-scol dá dhéanamh go sásamhail&mdash;go bhfuil a lán dalta ag fágáil na scoile agus gan ach eolas suarach aca ar léigheamh, ar scríobhadh, agus ar áireamh.  Ní hé sin an scéal atá le léigheamh i dTuairiscí na gcigirí.  Isé adeirid sin gur lugha ná cúig fén gcéad (5%) den iomlán an méid oidí atá ar an aicme &ldquo;Gan Eifeacht&rdquo;, agus i dtaobh an chuid eile, a cúig déag is ceithre fichid fén gcéad (95%) go bhfuil breis agus a dtrian san &ldquo;an-Eifeachtach&rdquo;.  Más féidir bheith muinighneach as an bhfiadhnaise sin, ní fuláir admháil go bhfuil dul-chun-cinn sásamhail, tríd is tríd, á dhéanamh ag bunús na ndáltaí atá ag freastal ar na Bun-Scoileanna. Ach an bhféadtar a bheith muinighneach go bhfuil an dul-chun-cinn sin dá dhéanamh ag gach leanbh fá leith? Admhuighim nach bhfuil ar mo chumas, i láthair na huaire, lándeimhin a thabhairt don Dáil ar an gceist sin.  Is maith an sás an Chigireacht chun obair scoile i gcoitchinne do mheas; ach, de ghnáth, ní féidir a bheith ina hurmhór ach baramhlacht.  Ina theannta san, ní féidir ach eolas an-ghenerálta a bhaint as an marcáil, óir is rí-leathan na téarmaí a úsáidtear.  Oide den aicme &ldquo;éifeachtach&rdquo;, cuir is gcás, d'fhéadfadh sé bheith beagnach &ldquo;An-Eifeachtach&rdquo;; d'fhéadfadh sé gan a bheith ach go cuibheasach; nó b'fhéidir nár mó ná gur chóir é d'áireamh ar an aicme &ldquo;Eifeachtach&rdquo; ar chor ar bith.  Ins an réim leathan sin go léir is fíor go bhféadfadh míchothrom a bheith ann maidir le toradh i gcás daltaí fá leith.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> Gheobhadh duine a rádh gur ar thoradh scrúdúcháin agus cigireachta le chéile a bhunóchadh an deagh-Chigire a bhreith ar obair scoile; ach is eagal liom nach mbíonn faill ag na cigirí scrúdú doimhin ar bith a dhéanamh.  Níl againn ach cúigear agus trí fichid Cigire; agus, dá mbeadh gan aon obair eile do bheith ortha, ní bheadh aon dul aca ar cheithre chéad míle dalta do chur fá scrúdú aonaránach.</P>
    <P>Más áil linn deimhin a bheith againn ar feabhas oideachais gach dalta is baolach nach fuláir feidhm a bhaint as fromhadh éigin níos mine ná cigireacht; agus ní léir dom aon tslighe eile chuige sin ach tré scéim éigin faoi n-a gcaithfeadh gach aon dalta dul faoi dheimhin-scrúdú i ngach adhbhar fá leith&mdash;agus sin de dhéanamh tráth amháin éigin ar a laighead roimh dheireadh a ghnáth-chúrsa Bhun-Scoile. Go dtí go gcuirfimíd a leithéid sin de scrúdú ar bun, ní bheidh fíordheimhin ag an bpobal gur fiú a gcostas na Bun-Scoileanna&mdash;gur fiú suas le ceithre mhilliún punt sa bhliain do chaitheamh mar mhaithe leis an méid daltaí a bhíos sáthach eolach ar léigheamh, ar scríobhadh agus ar áireamh ag fágáil na scoile dóibh.  B'é an réidhteach do b'oireamhnaighe ar an scéal, dar liom-sa, na hoidí le chéie do thoiliú chun an scrúdú so do dhéanamh, le cabhair agus le comhoibriú ó na Bainisteoirí agus ón Roinn; agus bhí súil agam go ndéanfaidís amhlaidh.  Ach is oth liom a rádh nár chuibhe leo glacadh leis an dtairigsint a chuir an Roinn fé n-a mbrághaid chuige sin; agus caithfear, ar an adhbhar san, an gnó so do chur chun cinn tré shocrú éigin eile.</P>
    <P>Teagasc na Gaedhilge féin an mhórcheist eile a bhaineann leis an mBun-Oideachas.  Is féidir linn dhá roinn a dhéanamh den cheist sin, eadhon, (1) teagasc na teangan féin agus (2) múineadh adhbhar eile léighinn tríd an teangain.  Maidir le teagasc na Gaedhilge féin, is ar éigin is gádh dhom a rádh go gceapaim gur fíorriachtanach an Ghaedhilg do bheith ina gnáth-theangain ag an bpobal.  Uime sin, measaim go mba cheart dar gcóras oideachais go hiomlán bheith ag <Col N="1569" /> féachaint go buan don mhór-riachtanas chéadna.  Sa chóras oideachais go léin measaim go mba cheart an Ghaedhilg do bheith dhá teagasg agus dá húsáid sa chaoi ar féidir don phobal&mdash; taobh istigh de thréimhse réasúnta&mdash;í do labhairt chomh réidh nádúrdha agus labhraid an Béarla indiu.  Má cirigheann linn an árd-réim sin do shroisint, is é is dóigh liom-sa go mbeidh níos mó déanta againn chun oighreacht ár gcinidh do chaomhnadh ná mar do b'fhéidir linn a dhéanamh ar aon chuma eile.  Má theipeann orainn sa nídh sin, creidim go rachaidh ár náisiún in éag, dá mhéad saoirse dá mbeidh ag an Stát, ná dá láidreacht é.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil furmhór mór ár ndaoine ar aon aigne liom sa tuairim seo.</P>
    <P>Ach tá an-éagsamhlacht tuairime i dtaobh an chuma is fearr chun an árdréim sin do shroisint.  Measaim gur deagh-chomhartha é an pobal do bheith ag cur suime sa cheist seo, agus tugann sin misneach dúinn.  Ach ní ceist í gur féidir a réidhteach le dearbhadh tréan ó aon taobh.  Is ón taithighe ar an obair agus ón taithighe sin amháin is féidir aon fhiadhnaise mhuinghíneach d'fhagháil; agus is ó na hiarrachtaí sin atáthar a dhéanamh ins na scoileanna is féidir an fíor-eolas agus an fíorthaithighe d'fhagháil chun an scéal do réidhteach.  Is é an deacracht atá ag cur orm-sa i láthair na huaire, ná fuil aontacht tuairime le fagháil ó na daoine atá i mbun na hoibre seo.  Ní hionann tuairim atá ag na Cigirí féin faoi'n cheist.  Tá an scéal mar a gceadna ag na hoidí.  Mar sin de an dá dhream is dlúithe a bhfuil baint aca leis an obair agus a bhfuil taithighe in aghaidh an lae aca uirthi ins na scoileanna níl aontacht tuairime le fagháil ó aon taoibh aca faoi'n cheist. Maidir le hadhbhair áirithe&mdash;adhbhair gur riachtanach árd-chumas teangan agus téarmaí teicniciúla chun iad do theagase i gceart&mdash;is deacair liom féin a chreideamhaint nach measa-de iad an teagase san do thabhairt tré theangain ar bith eile seachas teanga dhúthchais na ndaltaí.  Dá mbeinn-se i mbun obair ath-bheóchana na Gaedhilge ins na scoileanna i dtús ama, is dóigh liom go mb'fhearr liom claoidhe <Col N="1570" /> leis an nGaedhilg féin do mhúineadh, go mór mhór ins na ranganna ísle ins na Bun-Scoileanna.  Is dóigh liom nach mbacfainn le hadhbhair eile do mhúineadh tríd an nGaedhilg go dtí go mbeadh greim mhaith ag na daltaí ar an teangain féin.  Ach níl aon deimhin agam go mbeadh an ceart ar fad agam dá ndeanainn amhlaidh.  Níl aon amhras ná gur éirigh thar bárr le n-a lán.  Bun-Scol i múineadh na n-adhbhar uile tríd an nGaedhilg ón gcéad lá a théigheann an dalta ar scoil.  Do chonnaic mé féin an obair i gcuid de na scoileanna san, agus bhí mé an-tsásta léi; ach, gan tuilleadh faisnéise, níl ar mo chumas a rádh an éireochadh leis an ngnáth-oide ar an modh céadna obair éifeachtach a dhéanamh.  Ní féidir a dhéanamh i lathair na huaire ach an iarracht d'infhiúchadh go haireach.  Má mheasaim, de thoradh tuilleadh faisnéise, gur chóir an modh d'atharú in aon treó, déanfad socrú dá réir.  Obair is eadh í gur gádh dul ar aghaidh leí go mall réidh faithchilleach, agus gan ró-dheifir bheith orainn go mbainimíd triail cheart as gach céim agus go bhfeicimíd ár mbealach níos soiléire.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcéad seirbhís thábhachtach eile, an Meán-Oideachas, tá áthas orm a rádh gur dóigh liom go bhfuil an scéal sásamhail go leor i gcoitchinne.  Ins na Meán-Scoileanna táimíd ag leanacht de chúrsa Oideachais atá bunuighthe le seal fada, cúrsa Oideachais a d'fhás de bharr taithighe na gcianta ar an Meán-Oideachais san Eóraip.  Do b'éigean dúinn roint athruighthe a dhéanamh ar an gcúrsa Oideachais sin chun a chur in oireamhaint dár riachtanaisí speisialta féin; ach, tríd is tríd, do leanamar den treoir a bhí leagtha amach de thoradh na taithighe sin ariamh anall.  Breis is cheithre fichid duine as an gcéad (80%) dár gcuid Buachaillí, tógann siad an Laidean mar cheann de na príomh-adhbhair ina gcúrsa Meán-Scoile.  Sin uimhir fén gcéad chomh hárd agus atá le fagháil in aon tír san Eóraip, agus is aoirde í go mór ná an uimhir fén gcéad a thógann an t-adhbhar san sa Bhreatain Mhóir nó i Meriocá.  Tuairim is cúig dhuine fhichead fén gcéad (25%) a thógas an Ghréigís.  Tá an uimhir sin <Col N="1571" /> íseal i gcomparáid leis an uimhir fén gcéad a thógann an Laidean; ach is aoirde í go mór ná Meán-uimhir na hEorpa sa chás chéadna; agus tá sí breis agus dhá uair chomh mór leis an uimhir fén gcéad a thógann an Ghréigís sa Bhreatain Mhóir nó i Meiriocá.  Sa chuid is mó de Mheán-Scoileanna na gCailíní sa tír seo, bíonn beo-theanga Eórpach ar an tríomhadh teanga a thógann siad in ionad na Laidne; agus sa chás san is aoirde ná i gcás na Laidne féin an uimhir fén gcéad, óir tógann breis is cúig dhuine is ceithre fichid fén gcéad (85%) dar gcuid cailíní an Fhrainncis cuir i gcás.  Ina theannta san bíonn an Laidean mar adhbhar ag roint mhaith aca.</P>
    <P>O thaobh na dteangan den scéal, níl ann ach aon lag-phoinnte amháin, eadhon, a laighead de na buachaillí a thógann beo-theanga Eorpach i dteannta Gaedhilge agus Béarla le linn a gcúrsa Meán-Scoile.  Ní thógann ach timcheall cúig is fiche fén gcéad (25%) de na buachaillí an Fhrainncis, cuir i gcás; agus is í sin an bheo-theanga Eorpach is rogha leis an mór-chuid aca.  Is mór an truagh cúig déag is trí fichid fén gcéad (75%) aca do bheith gan eolas do chur ar bheo-theangain éigin Eorpaigh; ach is cóir cuimhneamh go mbíonn an Laidean, in éinfheacht le Gaedhilg agus Béarla dá foghluim aca go léir beagnach.  Rud eile glacann a lán aca an Ghréigis le cois na dtrí dteangan atá luaidhte agam.  Ar an ádhbhar san, ní cóir a rádh go bhfuil aon laige ag baint le cúrsaí teangan i Meán-scoileanna na tíre.  Is ar a mhalairt de chaoi ar fad atá an scéal&mdash;tá siad go láidir folláin.</P>
    <P>Is féidir an rud céadna do rádh i dtaobh na Matamaitice.  Bíonn an t-ádhbhar so ag gach aon dalta sóisearach, óir is riachtanach dóibh go léir an Mhatamaitic do bheith ar an gcúrsa léighinn aca.  Agus gidh nach bhfuil sé éigeantach ar na daltaí sinnsearacha staidéar do dhéanamh ar an adhbhar so, is beag nach mbíonn sé aca-san go léir, freisin.  Breis agus 99% de na buachaillí agus 90% de na cailíní glacann siad an Mhatamaitic le haghaidh Scrúdú na hArd-Teistiméarachta. <Col N="1572" /> Tá an scéal beagnach chomh maith céadna i gcás na hEolaidheachta.  Bíonn an Eolaidheacht dá foghluim i bhfuirm éigin ag breis agus a deich is trí fichid fén gcéad (70%) de na daltaí.</P>
    <P>Ag breathnú ar an scéal ina iomláinte measaim gur cóir dúinn a bheith sásta le cúrsa Oideachais na Meán-Scol.  Is é mo thuairim, freisin, go bhféadaimíd a bheith sásta leis an toradh, do réir mar a teasbáintear sin ins na scrúduighthe.  Sa chás so déantar scrúdú agus cigireacht le chéile, agus is féidir dul chun cinn na scoile agus dul chun cinn gach dalta ar leith a scrúdú i dtráthanna aithride.  Tá againn, freisin, toradh na dtrialach a ghníos dreamanna eile, scrúdú Máithreánach na nOllscol cuir i gcás.  Is léir ó na trialacha sin le chéile nach bhfuil an córas gan locht.  Tuigtear dom gur b'é an príomh-ughdar atá leis sin, go raibh cláir léighinn na Mean-Scol go nuige seo ró-leathan agus ró-éigcinnte, rud a d'fhág eolas scapach, seachránach agus obair neamh-shlachtmhar ag roint mhór de na daltaí.  D'fhonn an scéal san a leigheas, tá socruighthe agam, in ionad cursai a bheadh ró-leathan éigcinnte, go mbeidh cúrsaí gearra ann agus iad bunuighthe den mhór-pháirt ar leabhra a bhéas luaidhte roimh ré.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim, freisin, go mbeadh an obair níos cruinne fós agus go ndéanfaí scrúdú níos fearr uirthi, dá mbeadh scrúdú eile, no cúpla scrúdú, b'fhéidir, againn do na daltaí i dteannta scrúduighthe na Meán-Teistiméarachta agus na hArd-Teistiméarachta mar táid anois.  Tá an cheist sin dá hiniúchadh agam fá láthair.  Tríd is tríd, ámthach, tá mé sásta gur féidir do chóras an Mheán-Oideachais&mdash;agus na hathruighthe sin atá luaidhte agam déanta air&mdash;a phríomh-chuspóir do chóimhlíonadh, is é sin, cloch bhuinn do chur fá chúrsaí saoidheachta is cultúra i gcoitchinne. Bhí tráth ann agus ba é sin cúram na nOllscol; ach ní féidir leis na hOllscoileanna é sin a dhéanamh i gceart, feasta.  Tá a ndóthain mhór d'ualach ortha mar gheall ar an ngádh atá anois ann le doimhin-staidéar i mbrainnsí speisialta eolais.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> Is ar na Meán-Scoileanna is mó atá sé de chúram anois an t-aos óg do theagasc i gcaoi go mbeid sáthach oilte chun an náisiún do stiúradh go céillidhe éifeachtach ar an mbóthar atá romhainn amach.  Má déantar an obair sin mar is ceart ins na Meán-Scoileanna, is cinnte gur maith is fiú iad an leathmhilliún punt de chuid an phobail atáthar a chaitheamh ortha in aghaidh na bliana.  As m'eólas féin ar an obair atáthar a dhéanamh ins na scoileanna so agus an treoir atáthar a thabhairt ionta, tá tréan-dóchas agam go bhfuil an cúram tábhachtach sin dhá chóimhlíonadh aca.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an tríomhadh roinn den oideachas&mdash;an méid a thagann fá chúram Bhrainse an Cheárd-Oideachais &mdash;ní dóigh liom-sa go bhfuil an scéal chomh soiléir sin.  Tá dhá chineál scoile a thagann fá chúram an Bhrainse sin&mdash; na Ceárd-Scoileanna agus na Gairm-Scoileanna no Scoileanna Leanamhnacha. Ins na Ceárd-Scoileanna fachtar oileamhaint chinnte theicniceach, ach ní déantar mórán den teagasc sin i gceachtar den dá chineál eile.  Is é is cuspóir dhóibh-sean, teagasc úsáideach Iar-Bhunscoile a thabhairt do na daltaí, maraon le cleachtadh ar shiúnéireacht agus ar obair mhiotail, ar ádhbhair leanamhnacha i gcoitchinne, agus ar thuath-eolaidheacht nuair is féidir é. Tá na Ceárd-Scoileanna ag obair o thosach na haoise seo.  Tá a gcuspóir deimhin féin aca, agus go dtí poinnte áirithe, ar a laighead, tá sin dá choimhlíonadh aca.  Forfhás nua atá ins an dara cineál scoile.  D'fhás siadsan as oibriú an Achta Oideachais Ghairme Beatha a ritheadh tá deich mbliana ó shoin; agus, uime sin, tá sé ró-luath go fóill breitheamhnas deimbin a thabhairt ortha.  Ach, gan tagairt don taobh san den scéal ar chor ar bith, níl a ngnó ná a gcuspóirí leagtha amach chomh deimhnitheach agus atá i gcás na gCeárd-Scoileanna; agus ní féidir liom a rádh i láthair na huaire ciaca is fiú no nach fiú an costas iad.  Fá'n dtuaith go háirithe, is cinnte go bhfuil gádh le cineál éigin d'Iar-Bhunscoileanna chun dhá chuspóir do chóimhlíonadh: (1) Ba riachtanach dóibh tréineáil i Siúinéireacht agus i dTuath-Eolaidheacht do thabhairt do <Col N="1574" /> na buachaillí, agus chaithfeadh siad caoi do thabhairt do na cailíní chun bun-eolas maith d'fhagháil ar chúrsaí Tighis.  (2) San am chéadna, níor, mhór dóibh gnáth-oideachas leanamhnach, freisin, do thabhairt don dá dhream. Ach nílim cinnte fá láthair gurab iad na Gairm-Scoileanna an gléas is fearr lc haghaidh an dá chuspóir sin atá luaidhte agam.  Do moladh go mb'fhéidir teacht ní b'éascaidhe ar réidhteach na ceiste tré sheomra speisialta breise do chur le bun-scoil chomhgarach i ngach paróiste&mdash;seomra i gcomhair teagaisc, gach re lá, i Siúinéireacht agus Tuath-Eolaidheacht do bhuachaillí agus i dTigheas agus Dúil-eolas do chailíní.</P>
    <P>Is feidir gur tríd an dá mhodh is fearr a gheobhfaí réidhteach an scéil, is é sin le rádh, seomraí mar iad sin do sholáthar ins na háiteanna in ar dheacair cúrsaí sásamhla d'Oideachas leanamhnach do chur ar fágháil faoi na Coistí Gairm-Oidis.  Pé cuma ina réidhteóchar an scéal, is é mo thuairim-se gur chóir do na scoileanna claoidhe leis na hádhbhair a bhaineann le saoghal agus le hobair na tuaithe in áit a bheith ag gabháil d'ádhbhair léighinn nach bhfuil mórán bainte aca leis an saol san, ach a iompuigheann intinn agus aigne na ndaltaí ó shaoghal na tuaithe ar fad, b'fhéidir.</P>
    <P>Mar dubhras cheana, tá a mhalairt de scéal ar fad le haithris fá na fíor-Cheárd-Scoileanna. Ní fuláir dúinn gléas éigin cinnte a bheith againn chun printísigh do thréineáil le haghaidh na gceárd is na dtionnscal éagsamhail uile.  Ní fuláir an tréineáil sin a bheith do réir na modh is fearr agus is nuadha; agus tá na Ceárd-Scoileanna ann chun an gléas sin a chur ar fagháil dúinn.  Tá deacrachtaí áirithe sa scéal i gcás tíre mar seo againne ina bhfuil a lán tionnscal beag a caithfear a chur go daingean ar a mbonnaí féin; ach, tá na deachrachtaí sin dá réidhteach do réir a chéile; agus, i gcás tionnscal áirithe, fuarthas an bhuaidh ghlan ar na deachrachtaí sin.</P>
    <P>Tá árd-mholadh ag dul do Chomhlucht Siúicre Éireann agus do Bhord Soláthair an Leictreachais, cuir i gcás, de bharr na scéimeanna atá ceaptha acu le n-a gcuid printíseach a oileamhaint.  Tá <Col N="1575" /> togha scéim oideachais i gcomhair a gcuid printíseach ag Clódóirí Bhaile Atha Cliath freisin; ba chóir go dtiocfadh toradh foghanta as agus obair thairbheach dá bharr.  Tá sé antábhachtach ar fad go ndéanfaí scéimeanna cinnte bunúsacha den tsaghas san do bhunú le haghaidh na gceárd agus na dtionnscal eile.  Muna mbídh socrú cinnte den chineál sin ann, beidh sé an-deacair printísigh do thréineáil go sásamhail; óir ní féidir dóibh a riachtanas de thréineáil cheárdamhail d'fhagháil ach tré fhreastal a dhéanamh ar Cheárd-Scoil cúpla oidhche sa tseachtain.  Sa chás sin, má ghníonn an printíseach freastal ar an scoil ar feadh trí no ceathair de sheisiúin, féin, ní bhíonn, de ghnáth, toradh rathamhail ar a shaothar; agus is iondual go mbuaileann lag-mhisneach an buachaill agus nach bhfanann sé sáthach fada ann leis an toradh sin féin d'fhagháil as.</P>
    <P>Tá nídh eile, agus tá baint an-dlúth idir é féin agus an dá dheacracht atá ann maidir le hOideachas Iar-Bhunscoile do lucht talmhaidheachta agus do lucht tionnscal.  Is é sin árdú na haoise ar ceadmhach do dhaltaí an scoil d'fhágáil.  Ta sé de chumhacht againn sin do dhéanamh faoi'n Acht Freastal Scoile, 1926, agus faoi'n Acht Oideachais Ghairme Beatha, 1930, óir, mar gheall ar cheachtar de na hAchta san, is féidir iallach do chur ar dhaltaí freastal ar scoil nó go mbéidís cúig déag no sé déag de bhlianta d'aois. I láthair na huaire tá freastal éigeantach mar seo faoi thriail 1 gCathair Corcaighe, faoi stiúrú Coiste Oideachais Ghairme Beatha Corcaighe. Ó thárla nach bhfuil an triail dá déanamh ach le bliain, ba ró-luath go fóill breitheamhnas do thabhairt uirthí; ach go dtí seo tá ag éirghe go sásamhail léi.  Is mór an chabhair do fuarthas ó na fostuightheóirí, agus is beag bacainn do chuireadar ar na hoibridhthe óga maidir le freastal ar na ranganna páirt-aimsire.  Is annamh ghníos na micléighinn iarracht dul ón oibliogáid atá orra na ranganna do fhreastal, agus féadfar a rádh i gcoitchinne go bhfuil suim mhór dá cur ins na cúrsaí.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> Tá an Roinn ag scrúdú an scéil, féachaint ar cheart an scéim seo do chur i bhfeidhm in áiteacha eile.  Ceist do-réidhtighthe í, ó's nídh go dteastuigheann ó na feirmeóirí a gcuid mac do choinneáil sa bhaile chun cuidiú leo in obair na feirme ó bhíonn siad tuairim's ceithre bliana déag (14 bl.) d'aois.  Ar an adhbhar sin, agus ar adhbhair eile, ní mór bheith an-chúramach maidir le hiarracht ar bith chun árdú do dhéanamh ar thréimhse an scoil-fhreastail éigeantaigh.  Caithfí bheith an-fhaíthchilleach ionnus go ndéanfaí an cothrom idir riachtanais gach aicme le n-a mbaineann an scéal. Mar sin féin, dá n-éirigheadh linn scéim fheileamhnach oideachais pháirtaimsire do chur ar fagháil a mbéadh iallach ar dhaoine óga leanacht de, níorbh eagal liom narbh' an-tábhachtach an nídh don tir é.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá nídh eile ar mhaith liom trácht orra: (1)  an easbaidh oibre atá ar mhórán Bun-Oidí, agus (2)  soláthar tighthe Bun-Scoile.  Táimíd ag cur suim mhaith airgid i leath-taoibh ina gcomhair sin araon, d'aindeoin an chaoi 'na bhfuil cúrsai airgeadais fá láthair.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, tá líon na ndaltaí scoile ag dul i laighead le tamall anuas, agus, ar an adhbhar sin, níl an oiread postaí ann i gcomhair oidí agus do bhíodh roimhe seo.  Le cuid féin den scéal sin do leigheas, táthar tar éis an líon mac léighinn a glactar isteach ins na Coláistí Oileamhna do laigheadú chomh mór agus b'fhéidir é.  Ach bhí dualgais áirithe le coimhlíonadh againn maidir leis na daoine óga a raibh iontráil fachta aca i gcúrsa cheithre mblian ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin.  Bhí sé de cheart aca-san cead d'fhagháil dul ar aghaidh nó go mbéidís cáilighthe ina múinteoirí.  Is leir nach bhféadfaí an scéal do réidhteach láithreach ar an mbealach sin.  Mar sin de, rinneadh athrú eile ar na rialacha bhaineas le líon foirne na scol.  De bharr an athruighthe sin, cuireadh postaí nuadha ar fagháil do chéad a's fiche fear, agus do chéad a's triocha bean do bheadh gan postaí ach go ndearnadh an t-athrú.  Ina theanta san, táthar ag súil gur gearr go mbímíd i ndon céad a's triocha eile fear <Col N="1577" /> do chur i bpostaí sealadacha den tsórt chéadna nó go n-athruighidh an scéal sa chaoi ina mbéidh gléas aca postaí buana d'fhagháil.  Do réir na bhfigiúirí atá le fagháil i láthair na huaire, meastar gur fíor-bheag an méid oidí a bhéas gan obair ar theacht Mí Meadhon an tSamraidh, 1942.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid atáthar ar intinn a chaitheamh ar thighthe scoile, cé gur as Bhóta na nOibreacha Poiblidhe bainfear é, is ar Roinn an Oideachais atá sé de chúram na deontaisí do dháiliú, agus, ar an adhbhar sin, is cóir dom cunntas gairid fá'n scéal do thabhairt do na Teachtaí.  Táthar tar éis a dhéanamh amach go bhfuil tuairim's trí chéad (300) scoil ann nach bhfuil i gcaoi fheileamhnach le obair do dhéanamh ionnta; agus tá géar-ghádh le scoileanna do chur ar fagháil ina n-áit.  Cosnóchaidh sin seacht gcéad agus caoga de mhílte punt. Rud eile a bhfuil géar-ghádh leis is eadh scoileanna do thógáil i gcomhair na gceanntar so i mBaile Átha Cliath a bhfuil tighthe nuadha dhá dtógáil ionnta.  Cosnóchaidh sin dhá chéad agus caoga de mhílte punt.  Is léir gur obair mhóir í sin a gcaithfear roint bhlian do chaitheamh léi; ach tá sé ar intinn againn an obair do chur chun cinn chómh tapaidh agus is féidir é.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gceathrú seirbhís a bhaineas leis na meastacháin seo .i. Seirbhís na Scol Ceartúcháin agus na Scol Saothair, tá sé ar intinn againn Bille nua do thabhairt isteach chun go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm priomh-mholta an Choimisiúin a rinne fiosrúchán ar chóras na scol so roinnt bhlian ó shoin.  Is féidir, dar ndóigh, uimhir éigin de mholta an Choimisiúin do chur i ngníomh gan dlithe nua ar bith; táthar ghá dhéanamh sin le cuid aca, agus tá sé déanta cheana leis an gcuid eile.  Socruigheadh cheana féin árdú deóntaisí do thabhairt ón Riaghaltas do na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin; cuireadh ar fagháil deontaisí ón Riaghaltas do na Scoileanna Saothair mar gheall ar dhaltaí faoi bhun sé mblian d'aois; ceapadh cigire chun a chur ir áirithe go dtabharfar aire agus freastal mar is cóir do na páistí i gcúrsaí sláinte.  Ach tá aon mholadh tábhachtach amháin do rinne an Coimisiún, agus go dtí seo níor éirigh <Col N="1578" /> leis an Roinn é do chur i ngníomh.  Is é sin go n-íocfaí costas an Oideachais liteardha ins na scoileanna san as na deóntaisí Stáit i gcomhair an Bhun-Oideachais. Bhí gach ullmhú déanta ag an Roinn chun an moladh so do chur i ngníomh i mbliana féin; ach, gidh go mba tábhachtach an feabhsú é, b'éigean dúinn a chur ar gcúl mar gheall ar an gcaoi 'na bhfuil cúrsaí airgeadais fá láthair.</P>
    <P>Ba riachtanaighe ná sin féin árus níos feileamhnaighe do chur ar fagháil ná an ceann atá fá láthair i nGleann Crí; agus tá a leithéid d'árus dhá sholáthar anois.  Bhí dhá shlighe ós ár gcomhair, tráth bhí an cheist seo faoi mhachtnamh againn: (1) d'fhéadfaimís foirgneamh nua do chur ar fagháil, agus, ina theannta san, feirm a bhéadh sáthach mór chun biadh d'fhás agus chun gléas oibre agus tréineála do thabhairt do na buachaillí; (2) d'fhéadfaimís árus d'fhagháil a mbeadh feirm ag gabháil leis agus a bhí in úsáid cheana mar scoil nó mar choláiste.</P>
    <P>Rinneamar rogha den dara slighe, agus bhí dhá adhbhar againn leis: Ba í ba lugha costas, agus ba í ba lugha moill.  Sa chaoi ina bhfuil costais foirgnidheachta fá láthair, b'fhéidir go gcosnóchadh sé £60,000, nó £70,000, chun árus nua ar fad do sholáthar, agus é do bheith mór go leór agus gléasta go sásamhail.  Rud eile: bhainfeadh sé cupla bliain dínn, ar a laighead, an t-árus do chur ar fagháil, agus níor mhaith linn an oiread sin moille do chur ar an scéal.  Gan baint don chostas ar chor ar bith, níor mhaith linn é bheith d'fhiachaibh orainn na buachaillí d'fhágáil i rith geimhridh eile san áit atá aca i nGleann Crí; agus, mar sin de, rinneamar an rogha atá luaidhte agam.</P>
    <P>San Daingean, i gCondae Ua bhFáilghe, atá na foirgnimh do thoghamar; agus táid in úsáid fá láthair ag na Sagairt de Chumann Oblátach Muire gan Smál mar árus comhnaidhthe ag a gcuid mac léighinn. Is leis an Riaghaltas (leis an Roinn Dlighidh agus Cirt) na tighthe seo; fuair na Sagairt de Cumann Oblátach <Col N="1579" /> Muire gan Smál ar léasa iad chun bheith ina n-árus ag Scoil Ceartúcháin do bhuachaillí; ach measadh narbh oireamhnach don ócáid sin iad, agus stadadh dá n-úsáid i mbliain a 1934. Cuireadh deis ó shoin orra, agus táid i bhfad níos fearr anois ná na foirgnimh atá i nGleann Crí.  Táthar ag brath corradh agus £2,000 do chaitheamh i mbliana, ionnus go mbéidh siad in oireamhaint le haghaidh na mbuachaillí i Meadhón Fóghmhair seo chugainn.  Ina theannta san ní fuláir suimeanna eile airgid do chaitheamh ar an bhfoirgneamh so ins na blianta atá romhainn chun tuilleadh slighe agus fairsingeachta do chur ar fagháil.  Chuige sin tá beartuighthe againn leanamhaint do dheimhin-phlean ghenerálta.  Do réir a chéile, agus do réir riachtanaisí an cháis ó am go ham, a déanfar an obair.  Ach táthar ar aigne gach cuid di do choinneáil in oireamhaint den deimhin-phlean ghenerálta atá luaidhte cheana agam i dtreo go n-éireóchaidh linn tar éis tréimhse áirighthe árus nua ar fad no bheith againn in ionad na bhfoirgneamh atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Mar dubhras cheana, tá Bille dá chur os comhair na Dála chun molta eile an Choimisiúin do chur i bhfeidhm, agus b'fhéidir gurbh' fhearr gan mórán ar bith díospóireacht a dhéanamh ina dtaobh sin nó go dtugtar isteach an Bille.</P>
    <P>Sula gcríochnuighidh mé an cunntas seo fá staid an Oideachais ba mhaith liom trácht ar cheist a bhaineas go dlúth leis.  Is í an cheist í sin&mdash;cionnus is féidir a chur in áirithe go mbéidh an Ghaedhilg dá labhairt go laetheamhail ag na daltaí tar éis fhágáil na scoile dhóibh?  Dá fheabhas dá ndéanfar an Ghaedhilg do theagasc ins na scoileanna, beidh an teagasc sin gan mórán toraidh muna mbídh an teanga dhá húsáid sa chaoi adubhairt mé.  Ag trácht ar an deacracht sin dúinn, táimíd ag trácht ar nídh atá mar ghlas ar obair na haithbheóchana go léir.  Cad í an eochair osclóchas an glas sin?  Cionnus a deimhneóchar go mbéidh an Ghaedhilg dhá labhairt de ghnáth ag na daltaí tar éis fhágáil na <Col N="1580" /> scoile dhóibh?  Ceist í sin nach furas a fuascladh.  De iomlán obair na haithbheóchana, is í sin, dar liom-sa, an deacracht is mó ar fad.</P>
    <P>Ar an droch-uair, ceist í nach furas do Roinn an Oideachais mórán do dhéanamh le n-a réidhteach.  Furmhór mór na ndaltaí, ní bhíonn baint ar bith ag an Roinn leó ón am a bhfágann siad an scoil.  Níl an deacracht chómh mór sin i gcás na ndaltaí a théigheann chun na Meán-Scol nó chun cineál ar bith de Iar-Bhunscoil.  Is mó bhaineas an deacracht leis an gcuid eile de na daltaí&mdash;leis an gcuid aca nach mbíonn aon bhaint ag an Roinn leó ó fhágann siad an Bhun-Scoil&mdash;agus is iad sin an dream is líonmhaire ar fad.</P>
    <P>Is iomdha moladh do rinneadh leis an nGaedhilg do choinneáil dá labhairt ag na daltaí tar éis fhágáil na scoile dhóibh.  Moladh go gcuirfí ar bun Cathanna de Ghasóga do bhéadh ina nGaedhilgeóirí, go gcuirfí campaí agus brughanna Gaedhealacha ar fagháil, agus go gcuirfí clubanna Gaedhealacha ar bun i ngach paróiste sa tír.  Bhéadh caitheamh aimsire le fagháil ins na clubanna so, tráthnóna, ag buachaillí agus ag cailíní, ar choingheall gurb í an Ghaedhilg do labhróchadh siad le linn bheith annsin dóibh.  Tá Roinn an Oideachais toilteannach gach cabhair is féidir do thabhairt do dhaoine a chuirfeas a leithéidí seo de scéimeanna ar bun; ach is éigean a rádh go han-deimhin gurb iad na daoine féin a chaithfeas na scéimeanna a bhunú agus a oibriú.  Is riachtanach gach scéim den chinéal so do theacht ó dhaoine atá ina gcomhnaidhe i gceanntar na scéime, agus is iad na daoine sin a chaithfeas an scéim a stiúradh.  Caithfidh an pobal a gcion féin a dhéanamh in aitbheóchaint na teangan agus gan a bheith ag brath ar an Riaghaltas chun gach nídh do dhéanamh.  Ní féidir le haon Roinn Riaghaltais aisti féin an teanga Ghaelhilge d'aithbheóchaint.  Obair í sin atá le déanamh ag an náisiún go hiomlán.  Rinne Roinn an Oideachais gach nídh do b'fhéidir ins na scoileanna chun a chur i gcumas an náisiúin a gcion féin do dhéanamh.  Ní heagal liom go dteipfid ar mhuintir na hÉireann a ndualgas do choimhlíonadh; <Col N="1581" /> ach is mór agus is deacair an obair í seo, agus, chun an bláth ceart do bheith ar an iarracht, caithfidh muinntir gach ceanntair fá leith tosnú lom láithreach ag obair ar a gconnlán féin.  Tré n-a saothar agus tré n-a ndúthracht féin, agus go mór mhór tré n-a spiorad féin, caithfidh siad a chur in áirithe nach ina lom-ádhbhar léighinn a bheas an Ghaedhilg atá dhá foghluim sa scoil ag an aos óg.  Is riachtanach a chur in áirithe nach bhfágfar feasta í i muinghin a labhartha sa scoil, ach go mbéidh sí dhá labhairt go laetheamhail leathadach ag muinntir na hÉireann i ngnáthbheatha na tíre.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tendency in the present emergency to let a kind of emergency feeling distract people's attention from the normal and precise carrying on of other aspects of our national life.  Whatever measures have to be taken and whatever steps have to be taken to provide for the defence of the country, I think that there could not be a greater disaster to the country than that there would be anything in connection with either the steps taken or the statements made with regard to the situation that, by dissipating the efficiency of people's minds, would mean that these steps would be taken in an unorderly or undisciplined way or would affect the orderly, disciplined and constructive carrying out of our economic life or any other aspect of our life.  I intervene on this Estimate simply for the purpose of making a few remarks, not particularly thought over, because of the fact that we have not had an opportunity of considering the Education Department recently or of studying too carefully the Taoiseach's statement, but we have in the Taoiseach's memorandum a statement to the effect that at the basis of all educational services is primary education and that for nine-tenths of the Irish people the primary school is the sole source of secular education. From time to time there have been various comments and various criticisms of the position of certain <Col N="1582" /> classes of instruction in the primary schools, and recently we have had the shutting-down of training colleges and the slowing-down of the preparation of teachers to add to the number of our teaching staff.  We had a number of redundant teachers and the Taoiseach speaks of certain ways in which some of these redundant teachers have been absorbed at the present time.</P>
      <P>I think that the present time is particularly ripe for looking closely at the results that are being obtained in the primary schools in every single one of the main subjects.  The Taoiseach in his statement here confesses that he is not in a position to give the Dáil a guarantee of the general progress of individual pupils in the primary schools.  I take it that in making that statement he is not making it as a personal statement, simply for the reason that he has not been able to give personal attention to it because of the short time he is looking after the Department.  I take it that it is a departmental expression of opinion.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is a fact that there is quite a number of schools in the country which have not had an annual inspection for six, seven, eight, or nine years.  We have the reports that have been published in recent years and the comments with regard to particular subjects in the schools are not very reassuring.  Take mathematics first.  For the year 1935-36 the report, on page 25, says, &ldquo;Tá go leor de na cigirí ag gearán fá mhúineadh na huimhriochta.&rdquo;  A number of inspectors are complaining with regard to the teaching of arithmetic.  For 1936-37, the Report says, &ldquo;Deir na cigirí fré chéile go bhfuil dul ar gcúl le feicsint i múineadh na huimhriochta agus san toradh atá leis, agus gur lag atá an t-ádhbhar i na lán scol.&rdquo;  Further on, it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ach i na lán scol nach féidir aon chuid den mhilleán a chur ar an nGaedhilg, toisc go múintear an uimhrigheacht tre Bhéarla, sé tuairim na gcigirí go bhfuil laghdhú ar éifeacht an teagaisc.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, they say that the opinion of the teachers generally is that there is <Col N="1583" /> a retrogression in the teaching of arithmetic and in the results of the instruction, that the subject is very weak in many schools and that when you take the position in the schools in which the subject is taught through Irish, the position is bad and that nobody can say that any part of the blame rests on the fact that the instruction is given through Irish.</P>
    <P>With regard to history, the 1935-36 Report, at page 24, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bíonn roinnt mhaith eolais ar chúrsaí móra staire a dtíre agus ar na taoisigh ag na páistí atá i ranga V-VII, ach ní múintear an tádhbhar go healadhanta.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, while the children of the Fifth and Seventh standards have a fair knowledge of the history of their own country and its leaders, the subject is not taught very scientifically.  The Report, in the following year, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do réir tuairiscí na gcigirí, cé nach bhfuilid ar aon fhocal faoi, tá feabhas éigin ag teacht ar mhúineadh na staire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, some of the inspectors say, though they are not all in agreement, that there is a certain improvement in the teaching of history.  With regard to geography, the 1935-36 Report, at page 25, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Múintear cúrsa ar Éirinn go maith nó cuibheasach maith de ghnáth; is minic nach dtéightear mórán thairis sin, agus is beag eolas a bhíos ag na páistí ina lán scol ar thíreolas na coigchríche.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The teaching of Irish geography is fairly well done usually, but they very seldom go beyond that and the children in many schools have very little knowledge of any geography outside that of their own country.  In the subsequent year, the last year for which the report was issued, the report says, at page 19:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rinneadh trácht anuraidh ar na lochta a bhíos ar mhúineadh an ádhbhair seo agus ní gádh iad a phléidhe arís.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> They say that they had referred to the position in a previous report and need not go back on it again.  With regard to music, the last report, at page 19, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá scoltacha ann nach múintear aon cheol ionnta toisc gan na hoidí bheith oilte ar an ádhbhar; agus tá scoltacha eile ann nach bhfuil féith an cheoil go láidir ins na hoidí, agus ní fhoghluimeann na páistí ach roinnt bheag amhrán uatha.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have mathematics, history, geography and music, and the summing-up of the criticism of the inspectors is that nobody could really be satisfied that these subjects in the primary schools which, for nine-tenths of our people, represent the basis of our educational services and which are the fundamental things, outside religion, are satisfactorily taught.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, when we see how important it is that our people should have a sound educational foundation, nothing should be left undone to bring under the closest possible review the work being done in the primary schools and I suggest, as I suggested before, that, particularly in present circumstances, when you have a surplus number of teachers, the present inspectorate should be strengthened for special purposes by groups of the most experienced primary teachers we have and that one group be set to take, if you like, samples of the country and to go thoroughly into the position with regard to mathematics, another group into the position with regard to history and a third group into the position with regard to geography, music and other subjects.  I suggest that, in fact, you set up not a commission to inquire generally, but a commission of first-class people, who are available, of technical experts in transmitting information to primary students, people who had shown by their work that they were the foremost men or women in this important work, and concentrate them in groups on particular subjects and so get a complete view of the position of each of these subjects in sample areas covering a fairly large number of schools.  I <Col N="1585" /> do not know how in any other way the Department or any Minister can tell the House that they are in a position to give a guarantee that, to the best of our ability and teaching power, these various subjects are brought to the highest standard to which we are able to bring them.</P>
    <P>The events of the last 20 years must in some way have a disturbing influence on our educational life and a returning to a systematic, trained, disciplined outlook, concentrated on certain subjects so that there would be no trying to put one subject in a particular perspective with regard to others, but that there would be a critical and scientific examination of each particular subject by people concentrating on it, would, I think, do a tremendous lot to refocus both the minds of our students, and particularly those in the higher classes in the primary schools, and our teachers on the importance of these subjects, and on the best and most systematic way of dealing with them and so give us some picture of what exactly we should expect the teaching of these subjects to bring to our primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that, outside the big issue of primary education, there is the question of Irish and that here there are two questions, first, the teaching of Irish and, second, the teaching of other subjects through Irish.  I suggest there is a third, that is, the big issue of primary education as such in those districts which are purely Irish-speaking.  We have got into the habit in the last couple of education reports of having a report on the Irish-speaking districts, but purely in relation to the effect on the spoken language in the homes of the £2 grant. If there is any class of people in the country whose only inheritance to enable them to make a success in life is primary education, they are the children of the Irish-speaking districts.</P>
    <P>I have referred before to the concentrated work or the results of primary education in Irish-speaking districts, on the one hand, and the conserving of the vigour of the Irish language as an educational medium, on the other, and I have suggested that the Irish-speaking <Col N="1586" /> districts should form an inspectorate of themselves.  I feel it is essentially a weakness for the teaching staff of the Irish-speaking districts that they have to deal with inspectors who have one leg in the English speaking districts and another in the Irish-speaking districts.  I feel not only that that weakness exists, but that if you had the Irish speaking districts as a separate inspectorate, the group of inspectors dealing with these districts would have the very important task of making the best out of the Irish language in those districts as a medium of education and even a wider task, being a commission gathering information, of looking with precise minds on the general tendency with regard to the increasing or decreasing use of the language in the Irish-speaking districts. They might have to be added.  But I think that no personnel that could be added to the group of primary school inspectors in the Irish-speaking districts could be as effective as they themselves in estimating the strength and vigour of the language in the social or home life of the district, not to mention the position in the schools.  Whatever loss or whatever wastage there is, either in the amount of Irish spoken in these districts or the vigour of the language in these districts, will not be truly assessed or observed until something like that is done.</P>
    <P>On the secondary education side, the Taoiseach speaks of the importance of the secondary schools now in regard to their task of providing a body of enlightened public opinion.  I feel that not only have they to provide a body of enlightened public opinion but that they have to form the character of our people in addressing themselves to clear lines of thought, whether social, scientific or economic.  The Taoiseach says, with regard to mathematics, that they form an essential part of the course of every recognised junior pupil. I feel that that is an over-statement. The Taoiseach goes on to say that although mathematics is not essential for senior pupils, over 90 per cent. of the boys and over 90 per cent. of the girls take the subject in the leaving certificate examination.  If that is correct&mdash;it conflicts with the experience of some of us&mdash;I should like to reopen <Col N="1587" /> the question as to why the extraordinary change, made last year in the secondary school programme, was made.  Is it not a fact that a girl can go to a secondary school and pass through the whole period of her secondary school life without sitting down in class for arithmetic or mathematics? It appears to me that, in the case of a girl, mathematics is not a compulsory subject for either the intermediate certificate or the leaving certificate.  Even during her intermediate certificate period of study, she need not attend a class in mathematics. Boys need not go in for an examination in mathematics in their leaving certificate year.  They need not go in for an examination in mathematics in their junior year but, in their junior certificate course, they will have to attend mathematical classes.  I understand that that is the position.  It was definitely the position when we argued the matter here last year.  Except a change has been made in the programme for this year, I suggest that the position is as I have stated.  I have already drawn attention to the fact that the Professor of Education in the National University attached considerable importance, in his evidence before the Primary Programme Conference, to this question of mathematics and to the relationship in the past between the knowledge of mathematics spread throughout the country and the thorough character, politically and socially, of our people.  He pointed to the relationship between the study and knowledge of mathematics in other countries which are technically successful and the technical success which they had achieved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also deals in his statement with the question of Irish becoming more and more a spoken language amongst our people.  Again, I want to point out&mdash;I am not able to develop the matter beyond the extent I did before because there has not been sufficient time for consideration of these matters within the last few days&mdash;that a large number of secondary schools are giving instruction through the medium of Irish.  An enormous amount of valuable work has been done, and heroically done, by secondary teachers in the <Col N="1588" /> country, lay and religious, in teaching through the medium of Irish and preparing a lot of matter for their classes that would be found without difficulty in text books if they were not teaching through the medium of Irish.  You have a transfer of those pupils to the university.  I am aware that those into whose hands in the university that class of student is committed, though conscious of the excellence with which the work is done in some directions, have ideas and reflections to make on the result of that work.  I am quite sure that nobody would have more experienced opinions or more experienced criticism of the weakness, as well as the strength of that work, than the people who are themselves handling the secondary school pupils.  I have asked that there be some kind of consultation, however informal, between those teaching Irish in the universities and the Department and those teaching in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; secondary schools or their representatives.  I think that a conference of that description could review with advantage that very important focal point in the whole development of Irish as a language that our people will speak easily around us.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, there is a very great wasting of developed power at that stage.  When children reach the secondary school age, their mind enlarges.  With the difficulties there are about books and the phraseology to meet the requirements of modern thought, it is very easy to deter pupils from using Irish as naturally or as normally as they had been using it.  When they embark on university studies, that difficulty is, unfortunately, increased. There is, at that point, a serious tendency on the part of young people who have used the language fairly naturally amongst their friends in the City of Dublin to slip from the use of Irish into the use of English. That tendency is noticeable when their minds come to be enlarged and when the scope of their studies is also enlarged by the type of work carried on in the university.  I suggest that a conference for an exchange of opinion amongst the types of people I have mentioned might help to show ways in <Col N="1589" /> which the programme might be strengthened in the secondary schools and might help to find out ways in which some of the wastage which occurs naturally and inevitably when that class of student reaches the university might be avoided.</P>
    <P>As there is a certain number of teachers available at the present time, I should like to ask whether it would be possible to take some of our national school teachers, or some of those who are free, and give them a systematic course in physical training, so that some beginning would be made in a systematic way to extend physical training in the schools generally.  We have a wide scheme whereby adenoids and tonsils are taken out, but there is very little thought given to the building up of the physical condition of the children.  In primary schools where there has been systematic physical instruction given to the children, it is at once obvious.  You can readily detect the schools where physical training is given, and that applies particularly to primary schools.  It would be most desirable, now that we have the opportunity of doing it, to extend that system.</P>
    <P>You are shutting down the production of teachers, and I suggest that if you do that you may be doing very serious damage to the Irish language; but where you are shutting down on the production of teachers, and you have some idle teachers, then I think something should be done to fill up the gaps that we have in our primary programme.  The Taoiseach points out that nine tenths of our people are dependent on the primary schools. That being so, I feel that until we round off the scheme with some system of physical training and do more for singing&mdash;getting into better perspective what singing and what songs may mean in primary education&mdash;then primary education will not have the particular type of complete scheme that it ought to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very interesting statements contained in the document circulated by the Taoiseach, and those who have any experience of teaching will be prepared to agree <Col N="1590" /> with some of them.  There is an indication that a certain amount has been achieved in the past year in the way of trying to remedy the grievances that existed in the teaching service.  I have in mind the numbers of teachers, made and female, that were unemployed for numbers of years and now, I think, that problem is nearly solved.  That is something that we can congratulate the Minister upon.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made some very interesting statements with regard to teaching through the medium of Irish. This is a subject which has created a good deal of controversy for some years in the teaching world.  Many hold the view that the Minister expressed here when he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Personally, I find it hard to believe that the teaching of certain subjects which require a wide range of language and technical expression is not seriously affected by being given through a language which is not the native speech of the pupils. If I had been the initiator of the scheme for the revival of Irish in the schools, I think that I would have preferred to concentrate on the teaching of Irish itself, especially in the lower classes of the National Schools, and to leave the teaching of other subjects through Irish for a later stage when the pupils would have got a good grip of the language.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that the majority of teachers will agree with the Minister in that statement, especially the majority of infant teachers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy was a member of the Programme Conference in 1926, when there was a re-drafting of the primary school programme.  There was put into that a note saying that in the infant classes all the work should be done through the medium of Irish.  The representatives of the teachers' organisation were not in entire agreement with that, and it was somewhat modified, because the teachers knew very well what the position would be, and they could foresee what has really taken place in the schools since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various factors which come into play in the work of education, <Col N="1591" /> factors that the ordinary man in the street does not take into account at all.  There are, for instance, the factors of environment, of physical health and of books.  There are various other factors, but these, I think, are the factors which have a very big impact on the teaching in the schools. Let us take the case of the children who come from the poorest homes in the city, from the slum areas.  Surely, those children are very much handicapped by the fact that their environment, and very often their physical well-being, are so sadly neglected? They are undoubtedly very much handicapped by those factors.  Those children come from homes where English is the home language, and they are thrown into an environment where nothing but Irish is spoken, a language which to them is a foreign language. The position there is that their speech instincts for indicating their ideas to others are repressed.  They are bound to be repressed, because the children naturally feel out of the thing when they cannot take part in the play or conversation around them, as it is conducted in a foreign language.</P>
    <P>Instead of concentrating on the teaching of the infants through Irish, I think the Taoiseach's idea should be carried out, and that the home language should be the principal language for teaching subjects in the infant classes.  The Irish language can be taught in the ordinary way, but the teaching of other subjects through Irish is definitely bound to have a detrimental effect on the education of the child.  That was very forcibly brought home to the Second Programme Conference in 1926.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation gave evidence before that conference to the effect that it was a mistake to have the work in the infant standards entirely in Irish, except where Irish was the home language.</P>
    <P>That opinion was backed up by the late Right Reverend Dean Macken, Secretary of the Catholic Clerical Managers' Association.  He said that representations had been made to him that younger children ought not to be taught through Irish.  The Ursuline <Col N="1592" /> Nuns, Blackrock, County Cork, state that the infant programme should not require subjects to be taught in Irish. The Brigidine Nuns state that in an English-speaking district it is not possible to teach infants through the medium of Irish.  The Mercy Nuns, in Waterford, state that where infants come from English-speaking homes, teaching through the medium of Irish was a hardship both on the teachers and the children.  They added: &ldquo;The Irish language taught to such infants should be of the nature of mere rote work, such as recitation, singing, etc. Subjects involving any degree of thinking, such as kindergarten, story-telling, picture and nature lessons should not be taught to these infants through the medium of Irish.&rdquo;  The Most Rev. Dr. Keane, Bishop of Limerick, said: &ldquo;Infant programme should include home language&rdquo;, and Cabra Convent: &ldquo;The ideal conditions do not yet exist under which the infants' school would be the place where the pupils learn their Irish&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The programme conference itself dealt with the point when it said: &ldquo;One of the leading characteristics of the 1922 programme is its insistence on the principle of teaching the infant classes through the medium of Irish. The members of our conference agreed on the supreme importance of giving effect, as far as possible, to this principle; and in confirmation of their belief they received authoritative evidence... The members of the conference were, therefore, at one in holding that the true and only method of establishing Irish as a vernacular is the effective teaching of it to the infants.... Yet in this matter of teaching Irish to very young children, it was felt by us that the principle of the motto <i>festina lente</i> is especially applicable.  We have therefore changed its wording.  By that change, English could be used before 10.30 a.m. and after 2 p.m.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, the physical condition and well-being of a child is a very big factor in the education of that child.  Of the 23,671 school children medically examined in the year 1936 in the City of Dublin, 13,501 were found to be suffering from dental <Col N="1593" /> caries; 6,018 from defective visions; 5,716 from diseases of the nose and throat; 2,455 from diseases of the heart and circulation, and 737 from malnutrition. Of those examined in County Cavan during the same period, 46.68 per cent. were found to be suffering from defective teeth; 14.61 per cent. from defective eyes; 7.33 per cent. from malnutrition; while 3.15 per cent. had defective clothing and footgear. In the year 1937, of the 3,220 children examined in County Kildare, 1,708 suffered from nose and throat defects, 1,257 from defective teeth, 567 from disease of the glands and 316 from eye defects.  The report of the medical officer of health for Sligo, for the same year, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;About 6 per cent. of the children were definitely below the standard of normal nutrition, exhibiting signs of anæmia, loss of muscle tone, lack of vitality and mental abilities. Scarcity of food or lack of means had little or no bearing on the cause. All too frequently it was found that the child took practically no breakfast; late hours, and ill-ventilated sleeping accommodation, preventing him from having any desire for the morning meal.  The breakfast of the ill-nourished, and many other children was generally tea, bread and butter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those children, surely, are not in a position to receive full benefit from the instruction given them.  As I have said already, this question of teaching through Irish, especially in the infant classes, is one that will have to receive attention, and, I think, judging by the statement the Minister has circulated, it will receive attention, because he evidently is thinking along the lines that the majority of the infant teachers are thinking on.  Last year, when in Geneva, I availed of the opportunity to visit some of the schools there to see how they were tackling this question of bi-lingualism.  I was of the opinion that the Swiss had bi-lingual schools, but, as a result of my visit to the schools in Geneva, where French is the home language, I found that French is the language used for all subjects in the primary schools there.  It is only when the child leaves the primary school and goes to a secondary or a <Col N="1594" /> higher school that a second language, usually German there, is taken.  All the work in the primary schools is done through the home language.  I think that we in this country have been rather too enthusiastic in trying to get Irish taught&mdash;going faster than it is possible to go.  The fact is that the home surroundings, and the physical well-being of the children, are very big factors here.  Unfortunately, we know that we have thousands of children in the cities of Dublin and Cork who are not getting proper care and treatment because of the unemployment and poverty of their parents.  Closely linked up with the teaching of the Irish language is this question of inspection. The Minister, dealing with that in his statement, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be argued that the good inspector bases his judgment of a school on examination as well as on inspection, but I fear that such examination of pupils as an inspector can manage must be very limited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is my contention, and that of the Teachers' Organisation, that the system of inspection in operation, in the primary department especially, does not make for the best results. There is too much, as a rule&mdash;I do not say that all inspectors have this failing&mdash;of fault-finding, and too little attention paid to explaining, especially to the younger teachers, the methods that would lead to better results.  The aim and object of many inspectors seem to be to find fault, and to be able to record those faults.  To my mind that is not the purpose, or work, of an inspector.  I think that the work of an inspector should be this: that he should use his expert knowledge and experience to demonstrate in the schools the best methods to teachers who needed such instruction.  In the case of the older teachers, it surely is not necessary to have an annual inquisition year after year, because in many cases the inspector's visit is an inquisition.  I want to say very definitely that the inspection system in the primary department requires reform. It is the fear of an adverse report from an inspector, or the notice that may come as a result of his visit, that causes all this worry and heartburning <Col N="1595" /> to teachers.  It explains why you have so many objections and protests about the curtailment of the programme and of other things.  All that, as I have said, is due to a fault in the inspection system.  Again, there are many inspectors who have to do a good deal of this work, purely routine work that could be carried out by a typist or clerk rather than by an inspector.  There, again, the inspector's time is wasted, and the work that I hold he should do &mdash;the visiting of schools in his area so as to have closer contact with the teachers and to meet them in a more helpful way on his visits&mdash;is wasted by having to perform this very simple routine work.  I wish to bring that point to the notice of the Minister.  I know that having the inspectors doing routine work of this kind is taking them away from the work for which they are appointed.</P>
    <P>In the inspection system we have too much of this grading and very often there is a good deal of trouble with regard to the exact point which the teachers reach.  The question is always being examined as to whether they are efficient or highly efficient or some point in between.  I think that is rather an incalculable method of classifying the teachers.  The teacher is doing good work, or he is not doing good work.  If the teacher is doing good work that ought to suffice.  If he is not doing good work there is a way of getting rid of him.  The Taoiseach tells us that the number of non-efficient teachers, that is, those not up to the standard required, is not five per cent. Therefore the big majority of the teachers are doing good work and that ought to be quite sufficient without all this grading to find out what particular point in the grade the teacher should occupy.  When the present Minister took up office he got in touch with the Teachers' Organisation.  He was very glad to get the help of the organisation. He had some conferences with them and at one of these conferences he suggested that the members of the organisation should have from time to time conferences with the heads of the inspection section.  That was reciprocated by the teachers and it was decided that there should be a conference <Col N="1596" /> of teachers with the local inspectors down the country.  The teachers organisation has offered to put the machinery of their organisation into operation in order to bring about that conference with the local inspectors. I am sure such conferences would do a great deal of good.  I remember we had them in the old days between the members of the teachers' organisation and the inspectors and they were carried out in a heart-to-heart manner.  They were helpful.  Suggestions were made at these conferences that were useful.  Unfortunately with regard to the suggested conferences the teachers' organisation has not yet got any intimation as to when the conferences are to be held and when their machinery is required to be put into operation and at the disposal of the Ministry.  These conferences can be very helpful and it now only awaits the Minister's request to get them going.  As far as I understand the teachers' organisation is quite willing to have them going immediately, when I hope they will do a certain amount of good.</P>
    <P>There was one matter in which the Minister made a mistake, and that was in regard to the compiling of those proposed readers.  The Department or somebody else sent out invitations to teachers here and there all over the country asking them to send on suggestions and so on.  I suggest that that work could have been very well done through the organisation itself.  As the Minister recognises, the organisation has spread through the whole country, and the members will be only too pleased to help in that direction.  But they were not asked.  I do not know what would be the result of the efforts of the Department to get suggestions and ideas from the various teachers throughout the country.  I suggest that the organisation would be only too pleased to put its machinery at the disposal of the Department in getting work like that done.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement referred to the voluntary continuation course which has been in operation for the last year or two in Cork City. That has met with a certain amount of success, but I am afraid that its success <Col N="1597" /> can hardly be as great as it would be if the course had been more extended. What I mean is, that the course is 180 hours for the whole year &mdash;it is five hours a week.  In order to facilitate employers who have some of those children between 14 and 16 years of age, the course for a particular group of children is confined to one day in the week.  That means that the group of children who go into a continuation school on a Monday do not return again to school until the following Monday.  Anybody who has any experience of teaching knows that the maintenance of discipline is the essence of good work, but it is very hard to keep discipline on people that you will have with you only one day in the week.  I do not know whether it is possible to extend the course.  In trying to do so, you are up against certain obstacles. Very often the little boys and girls are the only breadwinners in the home, and it is very difficult to insist that a particular child should remain at school instead of bringing in a few shillings in the week that he would earn at his work.  I am afraid that that is a defect that will militate against the real success of that scheme.  However, it is probably too early to give a definite decision one way or the other, but I want to give the Taoiseach the benefit of my opinion as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was hopeful that the Taoiseach would have in his statement the news that those industrial school teachers who have been clamouring for admission on the Department's roll would be included in his statement.  But, unfortunately, from the reply he made to me last week it does not seem that they are to be brought in.  There are not very many of those teachers, but those who are there are very badly paid, and they have no security of tenure in their jobs.  I have a letter here from one of those teachers and I think it speaks for itself.  The letter in part reads: &ldquo;We ask you now to raise the matter once more, and to press on the Minister the injustice meted out to us as regards salary.  As you are aware, we are paid by the Superiors of these schools a miserable weekly wage&mdash;a couple of pounds a week&mdash;with no security of any kind <Col N="1598" /> though doing the very same programme as national schools, and examined by the inspectors as well.  In fact, the work is far harder, and it is done under far more difficult conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is rather hard to understand why these teachers have not been brought into the Department Vote.  After all, they are performing a work of national importance in these schools.  As this man suggests, they have to work harder, and more strenuously, and under worse conditions than do the ordinary teachers.  They are engaged in the same kind of work.  The only difference&mdash;and the only reason why they are not brought in, as the Minister suggests&mdash;is the financial consideration. I ask the Minister again to review that matter.  The number is not very large&mdash;only about 60.</P>

      <P>Reference was also made in the Minister's statement to the necessity for carrying on, if not increasing, the rate at which defective school buildings are being got rid of. He gave a figure, I think, of 300 schools.  Of that number, I suppose, 200 would be schools which were really insanitary.  I made the suggestion on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works that some kind of machinery should be set up to get over the roundabout and cumbersome way in which these school buildings are being dealt with.  The Department of Education, the Office of Public Works and the Finance Department all come into it.</P>

My experience is that you have to go through a whole lot of tracing and probing to find out what the position is in regard to a particular building. You have to go to the Department of Education to find out what they have done, then to the Office of Public Works, and then to the Department of Finance.  While the matter is going from one department to another the work is being held up.  I cannot see any great difficulty in setting up some kind of machinery whereby the whole job would be done in one particular section, or one particular section of a department, let it be the Department of Education, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the school buildings, it is necessary also, especially in the new schools, that there should be an ample supply of water laid on.  The provision of a playing field for each school is also absolutely necessary. Deputy Mulcahy referred to physical training.  I do not know if Deputy Mulcahy has very much connection with the primary schools in Dublin, but if he had he would know that to-day is a sports day for all the schools in Dublin.  All the schools are closed down and these sports are taking place at Croke Park.  In connection with these sports they also have hurling and football matches.  The same thing happens in Cork, and I am sure in the other cities, so that the physical training side is well looked after.  I suppose there would be a few thousand children taking part in the sports in Croke Park to-day.  Surely, that is physical training in its highest form.  To carry out that idea successfully, however, it is necessary to have playing fields attached to each school.  These are two very important points which I wish to put to the Minister.  As to the provision of an ample supply of water, what happens is that when the children in the school go out to play, either on the road, or in a neighbouring field, their hands, and, probably, their faces get dirty, and in the ordinary country school, and probably in many schools in towns as well, they have no opportunity of cleaning themselves.  The fact of having a water supply, and being <Col N="1600" /> trained in clean habits is bound to have a very big effect on character formation.</P>
    <P>I now come to a matter that is probably very controversial, but is one about which I must say something, and that is, I will not say the demand, but the request that the teachers made for an increase in their salaries to meet the increased cost of living.  Everybody expresses publicly great sympathy for the teachers and appreciation for their work; but when it was a question of treating them with consideration in connection with their request for an increase of salary to meet the increased cost of living, the Minister was rather abrupt with them.  I am not going to enter into the merits or demerits of the case for a bonus to meet the increased cost of living, but I think that the Minister should have received the deputation to discuss the matter when asked by the Teachers' Organisation.  There is great indignation, naturally, at the refusal to concede anything in the way of a cost of living bonus, but there is greater indignation still at the way they were turned down.  To say the least of it, it would have been more diplomatic if the representatives of the Teachers' Organisation, which is a very influential and powerful body in the country, were received and allowed to put their point of view before the Minister.  Even if he had to say no, I am sure he would say it in such a way that the thing would not have been so bad.  Certainly there is great indignation felt at the way they were turned down.</P>
    <P>That seems to be characteristic of Governments, because, in 1923, when the previous Government were in office, without any warning or consideration whatever, the teachers' salaries were reduced by 10 per cent.  The history of this matter all along the line is that there has been some lopping off here and some lopping off there.  The only little consolation the teachers got was that in 1938 there was an increase given of 5 per cent. to meet, as was said, the increased cost of living.  Since 1938 the cost of living has gone up by leaps and bounds, and the only reply is that the Minister for Finance has set his face against any increase whatever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> In common with some other public servants, teachers came under the operation of the Economies Act in 1933. In April, 1934, at a time when others affected by the Economies Act were having their pre-1933 salaries restored, a new and permanent cut, varying from 5 per cent. to 9 per cent., was made in the salaries of national teachers.  Their pensions were likewise permanently reduced by the latter. After four years' persistent agitation the Government, in April, 1938, were pleased to make a small restoration, equivalent to 5 per cent. of the 1934 salaries.  The terms in which this increase was announced by the Minister are of special significance and will bear repetition here:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has reviewed the question of the rates of pay of national teachers in the light of changed conditions since 1934, when the existing scales were fixed, and they have decided that an increase of 5 per cent. be granted as from April 1st, 1938.  The adjustment now made in the salary rates is to be regarded as appropriate to existing conditions, and the Government holds itself free to re-examine the position should any substantial alteration take place in the general economic and financial position of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how that will be answered. My reasoning is that existing conditions have changed so much that the claim of the teachers is worth reviewing. That has not been done.  One of the greatest grievances the teachers have is that they were not treated with courtesy by the Minister, who recently closed and barred the door, as far as any discussion of their claim is concerned. I do not know how the employees of any outside firm would take such treatment.  Many classes of workers have got increased remuneration owing to the increased cost of living.  There has been no case where an employer said he would not give an increase or would not hear what was to be said in its favour, except that of the Minister for Education.  That is not treating the organisation and a body of teachers as they ought to be treated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> In Killarney the Taoiseach went out of his way to throw bouquets at the teachers; they were such a fine body, and were doing such great work for the nation.  Later on when very humbly and very timidly they asked for a little more money, they were told that the matter could not be discussed.  I am afraid that kind of treatment is not going to make for the good relations that should exist between the Taoiseach, who is a practical educationist, and the teaching body.  The statement that the Taoiseach has given us has been very detailed, and he seems to realise the position.  As to the important question of teaching through the medium of Irish, I hope he will have time to develop his idea, and that it will be evidenced by a change in the new programme, if possible, for the coming school year.</P>

      <P>I was appalled to hear Deputy Hurley say that he considered one day's sport at Croke Park was sufficient physical training for the rising generation.  The point I want to raise on this Vote concerns the National Museum.  I understand that Dr. Mahr has been absent for the past nine months.  The full salary appears on the Estimate and presumably he is being paid.  I should like to know from the Minister why he continues to be paid, or if that is the fact.  I understand that the work Dr. Mahr was responsible for is very much in arrears, and I should like to know if it is proposed to take any steps to put the matter right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy will agree with the Minister for Education that the amount of money in this Estimate is very large and constitutes a big proportion of our national income.  We were all pleased to hear the Minister for Education asking this question: &ldquo;Are we getting real value for such colossal expenditure?&rdquo;  Anybody who has any experience of national schools, to which nine-tenths of the people go, must admit that the standard of education amongst the pupils is very low. Examinations are held from time to time for positions in the public service, confined to pupils with a national school education, and it has been found <Col N="1603" /> that the standard of education has been appallingly low.  People are asking what exactly is being taught in these schools at the present time.  I have had brought to my notice examination papers in which boys and girls from 15 to 16 years of age, or older, who had left national schools, were unable to name the six counties comprising Northern Ireland or the chief rivers of Ireland.  These were simple questions, yet it is an extraordinary fact that these pupils were unable to answer them.</P>
      <P>We have to ask ourselves then are we getting real value for the enormous amount of money that is being spent on primary education?  I believe we are not.  There is a real case for a more exacting examination of pupils attending national schools.  There should be a yearly examination of all pupils to discover what progress has been made. That would require additional inspectors but, having regard to the fact that there is a surplus of national teachers, it would not cost very much to promote some of the more efficient teachers to be inspectors, so that they would be able to conduct more intensive examination in these schools, and discover exactly where the shortcomings life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appalling that we have so much sham and make-believe in regard to education in our national schools.  It is appalling that when boys and girls leave the national schools, the idea is conveyed to the public that they have been educated in a number of subjects, yet they are unable to answer ordinary questions in practically any of the subjects in which they are supposed to have been educated.  In building up the character of our youth, the first requirement is to inspire them with self-confidence, with a belief that they are in a position to understand thoroughly and meet any examination in the subjects which they have studied.  On the other hand, if those pupils who have left the national schools and are going to engage in ordinary work or follow on to secondary schools, realise that they have not got the education they are supposed to have, they will have no confidence whatever in themselves in <Col N="1604" /> stepping out on life, they will be absolutely irresolute in mind and possess very feeble characters.  That is the first thing we have got to avoid.  The education in the national schools must be intensified.  If it is found that the number of subjects supposed to be taught is too great, that number must be cut down and the education must be reduced to fundamentals.  The subjects which are taught must be taught with the highest degree of efficiency.  Then the young boys and girls of the coming generation will step out into life with confidence in themselves and in their future.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the teaching of subjects in infant schools through the medium of Irish is wise or prudent. There may be national teachers so well qualified in the Irish language as to be able to teach other subjects efficiently through Irish, but so far as the overwhelming majority of the teachers is concerned, they have not got a sufficient knowledge of the Irish language for that purpose.  It is, therefore, a great injustice and hardship on children who have been brought up in homes where nothing but English has been spoken, to introduce them to an entirely new language in such a way that they find themselves in a position of complete bewilderment and confusion.  Such a system of education can only result in stunting the mental growth of those children, and I have it on good authority that such hardship is also physically harmful and has ill-effects on their nervous system.  There is absolutely no justification for the introduction of such a system.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the need in the national schools for at least an elementary knowledge of agriculture.  I realise that it is rather difficult to teach agriculture in national schools to any great extent.  So far as the higher standards in the primary schools are concerned, however, definite manual instruction should be given in this subject.  During the period of the last European war, a system of school gardening was introduced in practically all the primary schools in rural Ireland.  It imparted to boys a zeal for horticulture and gardening of all kinds and gave them <Col N="1605" /> a certain fundamental knowledge of agriculture which was particularly desirable.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is difficult to teach agriculture to any great extent in the national schools, but an introduction to the subject can be given through the medium of a well-conducted school garden.  Such an innovation would be far more important and far more beneficial than physical training. After all, manual work is physical training in the best possible sense.  In addition, it should be compulsory in all primary schools to make adequate provision for playing fields, so that no boy or girl would come through the primary schools without at least having learned to play some of our national games, such as football or hurling.  Games of this kind are not only beneficial physically, but are also in the interest of the nation generally. No obstacle should be allowed to stand in the way of providing playing fields in all our primary schools, and it should be insisted on that national games be played in those schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to technical and vocational education. I have not very much knowledge of the working of the technical schools, but I have some knowledge of the working of vocational schools in rural areas, and I am not satisfied that we are getting very much benefit from the expenditure in that direction.  In those vocational schools a very extensive number of subjects are being taught.  In the first place, it seems to me that it is not possible for a young teacher&mdash;and most of our vocational teachers are young and inexperienced &mdash;to teach all these subjects thoroughly. In addition, I am not satisfied that mixed vocational schools are desirable from the point of view of discipline and the formation of character generally.  I do not believe that it is possible for a vocational teacher in these schools to maintain proper discipline in a small rural school in which there are boys and girls from 14 years of age upwards being educated. To my mind, the whole idea of vocational education will have to be investigated thoroughly, and changes will have to be made.  For girls, <Col N="1606" /> whether in rural or in urban areas, the best type of vocational education will be obtained in a residential domestic economy school.  We know that the chief work for the majority of our girls in future will lie in the home, and therefore domestic economy is the most important subject they can be taught.  I believe that for the proper teaching of domestic economy the residential school is the most desirable.</P>
    <P>With regard to boys, the majority of our boys have no future outside the agricultural industry.  For that reason something more extensive than the vocational school of the present time will be required.  I believe that it would be far better if, in addition to the vocational schools in various areas, we had a farm provided&mdash;it might not require to be very large&mdash;upon which an agricultural education in the widest and best sense could be provided. There is no use in anybody saying that you can teach agriculture inside a school.  There is no use in imagining that you can learn all that requires to be known about stock, the growing of crops and the management of agricultural implements sitting at a desk. There is only one way to learn agriculture, and that is on the land.  If a serious attempt is to be made to teach agriculture, it may be necessary to provide, in addition to vocational schools for the purpose, a sufficient amount of land to enable boys to engage in the actual work of farming under suitable instructors.</P>
    <P>The most important fact which I want the Minister to realise in regard to education is that the first essential is to educate our young people to work. At the present time I believe there is a great tendency to slide over work by any and every conceivable means.  I think that that applies to all walks of life, but it begins in our schools and colleges.  For that reason there should be an individual examination of every pupil attending primary schools in the first place, to find out how much progress he makes in each year.  If additional inspectors are required for that purpose.  I think the Minister would be justified in providing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  There are just one <Col N="1607" /> or two points which I jotted down, and which I hope to put in the form of questions to An Taoiseach.  I should like to know if he has any definite views on the growing demand for a break in school hours in order to permit the children to partake of a mid-day meal. Quite recently, I attended a meeting at which a number of ladies interested in educational matters raised this point, and indicated how desirable it would be for the children's health, and how much it would enable them to acquire the education that is being imparted to them.  I should also like to ask the Minister if his Department could anticipate the need for building schools in areas to which portions of the population are being transferred, so as not to leave the inhabitants of a newly-built area without a school for a period of two or three years.  Very grave hardships are inflicted on the parents of children who have to travel long distances from these newly-built areas into schools in the city, as frequently they find it difficult to pay bus fares.  Pending the erection of schools in these areas, might I suggest that, as he and his Department have already admitted the desirability of cheap fares for school children, they would endeavour to have the system extended to areas that are at present deprived of these facilities.  I have in mind particularly areas such as Upper Drumcondra, Ellenfield, and Larkhill, where there is no school, and the children have to travel as far as three miles to attend school.  They have to leave their homes in some cases as early as half-past eight in the morning, and do not get back until about half-past four in the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider whether the time has not arrived for a review of the Acts recently passed in which the principle of free education was admitted.  I have seen one of the forms which a parent has to sign before his or her children are given free school books.  The form is full of difficult questions, and contains one very objectionable word which a number of parents would like to see removed.  I refer to the word &ldquo;necessitous.&rdquo;  The form states that only necessitous children will be provided with such books. <Col N="1608" /> The word &ldquo;necessitous&rdquo; is sometimes very difficult to explain.  For instance, a child of a family in which there are only three or four might not be necessitous, whereas a family in which there were six, eight, or ten children, although the parents were in receipt of the same wages, might find it very hard to purchase books at the prices which are charged to-day.  The same word applies, I believe, in the case of children who receive the benefit of the School Meals Act.  An extension of that Act is most desirable.  Under the Act, the manager of a school can apply for a certain quantity of milk, and, sometimes, cake or buns.  I believe in one or two places a hot meal is provided. I would suggest to the Minister that a review of these two Acts is a reform that would be received gladly, and applauded by the people who are most deserving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the Minister.  I think the time is opportune now to carry out some examination to see how far the vocational schools that have been established in the last few years have catered for the rural population.  My opinion is that those schools are doing very good work for the urban populations, but I am afraid they are never going to perform the functions it was hoped they would perform for the rural population.  Rural children who live within a radius of from five to ten miles of a school may get some benefit from these schools, but outside that radius they get no benefit whatever. You have vocational schools, I think, in nearly all the medium-sized towns, but there are very few of them through the country, and I cannot see how you can hope to provide vocational education through the medium of these isolated schools in purely rural areas.  I am convinced that some other system is needed in order to provide the children in rural areas with vocational training, and I suggest that the Taoiseach should have examined the question of&mdash;I think his predecessor was examining it&mdash;how far the existing national schools might be used to provide vocational training for <Col N="1609" /> boys and girls in the matter of rural science and domestic economy.</P>
      <P>I can see no real objection to these schools being used in the evenings, for a number of hours a week, by itinerant teachers.  There is no possibility whatever&mdash;and I am convinced of it&mdash;of providing vocational training and vocational education for the children living in the rural areas, unless by some such system as I have suggested. It must be remembered that the big proportion of the funds for these vocational schools comes from the pockets of the rural community, and I suggest that there should be some examination of that question and that a decision should be come to in regard to it in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I would favour&mdash;and I believe it would be favoured generally&mdash;the increasing of the school-leaving age, say, up to 16; that is, from 14 to 16, if you had those itinerant teachers attending the national schools, each boy and girl could attend for so many hours a week and get training in domestic economy and rural science.  Many of these vocational schools in rural areas have no rural science teacher at the present time, and I think that they are certainly not performing the function that was originally meant for them. With regard to the question of domestic economy in female schools, I understand that it is an optional subject and that, in a big number of schools, both domestic economy and needle work are optional subjects, and it is said that there are so many compulsory subjects the teacher would not have the time to teach them.  Well, if the children are not taught needle work and some domestic economy, I do not know what is going to happen in the future.  Our mothers and our grandmothers were taught these subjects but many of the children to-day have no means of learning them except what they are taught by their mothers.  That is what I understand, at any rate, and I wonder is it true.  I heard it said recently and I was very much surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another suggestion I should like to make is this.  In these days when there is a demand that so many things should <Col N="1610" /> be given an agricultural outlook and bias, so to speak, I wonder would it be possible to have an agricultural subject for matriculation in the University, and that every boy should matriculate in some agricultural subject.  This is a rural community to a great extent and I think it would give the whole population a more rural outlook, and a better understanding of some of the problems that the people living in rural areas have to contend with, if there were some such provision as that. These are the only remarks that I have to make, and I hope that they will be given consideration.</P>

Is soiléir é sin ar fheabhas na scoláirí i gcuid mhaith den tír agus is dóigh liom&mdash;agus táim ag labhairt ar son dream mór Gaedhilgeóirí&mdash;gur fearr dul ar aghaidh leis gan aon athrú do dhéanamh air.  Má deintear aon athrú, beidh an Béarla mar ghléas múinte ina lán de sna scoileanna agus sé mo thuairim gurabé an chuspóir is ceart don Roinn a choimead os a gcóir ná an Béarla do chur amach os na scoileanna ar fad í ndiaidh a chéile.</P>

    <P>Ní féidir leis an dá theangain dul le chéile.  Gheobhadh ceann aca an lámh uachtair ar an gceann eile agus sé atá ós na Gaedhilgeoirí go bhfuigheadh an Ghaedhilg an lámh uachtair.  Níl aon ghléas eile ach na bun-scoileanna chun an lámh uachtair sin d'fháil agus dá bhrí sin, agus mar gheall ar an imnidhe atá ar chuid mhaith Gaedhilgeóirí i dtaobh na ceiste seo, iarraim ar an Taoiseach an cheist do scrúdú go hana-chúramach sara ndéanfa sé aon athrú ar an ngléas atá ann fé láthair. Tá fhios agam go maith agus tá fhios ag Gaedhilgeoirí na tíre, go bhfuil an Taoiseach chó-imnidheach mar gheall ar an nGaedhilg agus atá aon Ghaedhilgeóir agus nach ndéanfadh sé aon <Col N="1614" /> díobháil do chúis na teangan ná do chúis aithbheochana na teangan.</P>
    <P>Rinne sé tagairt do phoinnte eile atá ag déanamh buartha dhúinn: Cad tá le déanamh maidir le ceist na Gaedhilge do na scoláirí atá tar éis an scoil d'fhágáil?  Tá an méid sin gléasanna curtha os cóir an Taoisigh agus os cóir na Roinne le blianta anuas ar an gceist sin gur deachair a rá cioca is fearr, agus is fíor i slí nach bhfuil an smacht céana, nó an ceangailt céana, nó an bhaint céana, ag Roinn an Oideachais leis na scoláirí atá tar éis scoil d'fhágáil, ach tá eagla orm muna ndeineann an Roinn rud éigin mar gheall ar an gceist sin, ná fuil aon dream eile sa tír ag a mbeidh an comhacht nó an t-airgead chun é do dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom féin go bhfuil gléas ag an Roinn cheana chun dul ar aghaidh foghanta do dhéanamh maidir le labhairt na Gaedhilge do chur chun cinn i measc an aosa óig atá tar éis scoil d'fhágáil, sé sin, gléas an gairmoideachais. An sean-ghléas a bhí ann sarar tháinig an gairm-oideachas isteach, bhí ag eirighe leis go maith. Nuair bhí na múinteoirí Gaedhilge ag obair fé sna Coistí Ceard-oideachais ins gach conndae bhí an teanga ag dul ar aghaidh agus obair mhaith á dhéanamh; ach thárla rudaí a chuir isteach ar an obair go mór, agus a chuir isteach ar na múinteoirí.  Dar liom-sa, ba cheart dul siar chun an ghléas sin ins gach conndae, agus bhí dlúth-bhaint agam leis le blianta agus chonnaic mé an mhaitheas a dhein sé.</P>
    <P>Tá an gléas ann chun rud foghanta do dhéanamh chun an Ghaedhilg do chur á labhairt i measc na mbuachaillí agus na gcailíní atá tar éis scoil d'fhágáil agus go bhfuil cuid mhaith Gaedhilge aca.  Ba cheart don Roinn féin úsáid do bhaint as an ngléas sin ar fud na tíre.  Do chuireadh an tairisgint sin os cóir an Aire roimhe agus bfhéidir go bhfuil sé ag scrúdú na ceiste fé láthair san Roinn ach sílim gurabé sin an gléas is fearr.  Is furus é do chur ag obair agus iarraim ar an Aire féachaint isteach ann.</P>

      <P>I have not got much to say on this Estimate, but I feel it my duty to call the attention of the Taoiseach to what I would describe as <Col N="1615" /> the dissatisfaction in the country with the system of primary education.  I do not know what the Taoiseach may think about it, but the general opinion is that the system is very unsatisfactory. Children are working much harder than ever they worked, and I believe that the teachers are also working harder, and yet the results are very unsatisfactory.  I do not think it would be any exaggeration to say that pupils leaving primary schools to-day are three years behind pupils of the same age leaving the schools 40 years ago.  I have not got the slighest doubt about that.  We have proof of it every day, and if the Taoiseach looks up the reports of speeches by members of the teaching profession and the managers of schools, he will find that that is the general opinion, and those people are qualified to give an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be something wrong with the system of teaching, because in a number of very essential subjects, pupils leaving school to-day are very backward.  As I have said, they work at home lessons for hour after hour at all seasons of the year.  That was not the practice in past years, and yet the pupils then were fairly efficient when they reached the age of 14 years or so.  They did not even attend for the same number of school days, because there was no compulsory education system.  Yet they were far ahead. The tree is known by its fruit, and this system is not bearing fruit.  I ask the Minister to give the matter a little attention.  I know that he is very busy and that he cannot give the attention to this matter that it deserves, but he has available people who are qualified to go into the question closely and to consider whether some changes should not be introduced.  There seems to be something wrong with the system of teaching Irish, because it is not a success.  I believe that tuition in Irish is responsible for half the time spent at school.  Life is very short, and when children spend nine or ten years at school&mdash;half that time being devoted to learning a language that they never speak afterwards&mdash;it is clear that the right system of teaching is not in operation.  Otherwise, they are trying <Col N="1616" /> to teach a form of the language that is out of date.  There are a number of dialects, and we should aim at their simplification and standardisation. These are merely suggestions.  I do not pretend to be qualified to advise what should be done, but something should be done.  Everybody knows that there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the question of simplifying the spelling.  In the United States, a progressive country, they aim at simplifying the spelling of the language which they use.  The same thing is occurring in Great Britain.  They are getting away from the old-fashioned, roundabout methods.  If Irish were standardised, and if the spelling were simplified, it could be much more easily acquired by the ordinary pupil.  The system of weights and measures is out of date, too.  Most countries in Europe, with the exception of Great Britain, have adopted the decimal system.  That might be a little bit strange for a while, but in a very short time, especially for the young people going to school who have not got into the habit of the old system, it would come very easy.  That is a matter that is worth consideration.  Matters like these should be given attention by the Taoiseach, or, if he cannot personally attend to them, he should get others who are competent to deal with them to bring them under review.  We should try to get some change in the system of teaching.  The present conditions are not the fault of the teachers or the children.  They never worked so hard as they are doing.  There must be something wrong with the system when they are three years behind.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the payment of part-time Irish teachers. Can nothing be done to relieve them in the shocking position in which they find themselves?  I have before me a document from the secretary of their organisation setting out the remuneration on which they have to carry on. In effect, the maximum they are able to earn is £70 a year.  They have given of their best for the promotion of the language, and surely the acid test of our sincerity regarding the promotion <Col N="1617" /> of the language should be our treatment of those who have devoted their lives to it.  These teachers seems to be in a singularly unfortunate position.  The circumstances are known to the Minister, and, without making any rhetorical appeal, I ask him to look into the circumstances under which these men are condemned to carry on. The circumstances are beyond their control, and they are not able to earn more than £70 a year.  They write very plaintively of their position in the area of which we have control, and I am sure that their complaint will receive sympathetic consideration from the Minister.  We should show that there is some appreciation of the services they are giving in the revival of the language.  They were the pioneers, and they are the people who mainly bore the brunt of the language-revival work. If the language movement is to be a success, it must percolate to the working-class population.  When the pupils leave school, they should have an opportunity of continuing the practice of the language at the continuation classes conducted by these part-time teachers. I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to what I have said on behalf of these teachers.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Allen as the Taoiseach on this Estimate what his view was with regard to technical vocational organisation in the rural districts, and also whether there was a sufficiently rural bias in the education available in the rural districts.  Developing his theme to a greater degree, I would suggest that, during the past ten years, the minimum number of facts which should be possessed by people entering rural life in this country far exceeds those available after the people have left whatever schools are open to them in the rural districts.  We are facing in the world to-day fiercer and fiercer competition in agricultural production. We are finding it more and more difficult to maintain our place in the export market.  Whereas, 20 years ago, farming was a matter of tradition, with a little specialised knowledge added, to-day farming is becoming a matter of expert technique and science is blasting away a great deal of tradition and <Col N="1618" /> replacing it by methods which were utterly unknown 20 years ago.  When Deputy Allen suggested a rural bias in education, I am quite sure he was speaking as one of the agricultural community.  I cannot help regarding education in this country as, of necessity, including agriculture in its programme.  We have agricultural instructors and, so far as I can make out, they only reach from 5 per cent. to 15 per cent. of the population engaged in agriculture.  They are fine men who do a good job, men who work about 14 hours a day, but, without exaggeration 80 per cent. of the persons engaged in agriculture never receive the full training which should be available to them at their hands. I cannot help feeling that that is a very serious fact, and it gives me to think that the Department of Education should begin to consider how far it should include in its programme agricultural education in general.</P>
      <P>Obviously, as Deputy Allen said, one cannot teach agricultural science in the primary schools.  One can only hope to teach simple rural science there.  But agricultural science should form part of the secondary school programme.  Everybody who enters into the vocation of agriculture should have available to him exactly the same knowledge of how to produce goods for export as those who are his rivals abroad have.  There is absolutely no question or doubt that our farmers lack, at least, 50 per cent. of the knowledge made available almost universally to those who are their economic rivals.  Take one small subject&mdash;grass cultivation.  I regarded it as my duty during the past few months to read everything I could about modern methods of grass cultivation.  I found that, even with my broad general knowledge, I was unable to understand the more scientific end of it, because it was a matter of botany&mdash;and very advanced botany.  The manager of a creamery in the south of Ireland reported that only 2 per cent. of all the farmers bringing milk to the creamery had any knowledge of botony in the modern sense, or of the manurial treatment of grass land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the average New Zealand farmer, or the average Danish <Col N="1619" /> farmer, because of the type of education imparted in those countries, inevitably must outclass the Irish farmer as far as his knowledge of grass cultivation is concerned.  I mention grass because we were at one time accustomed in this country to divide ourselves between those who believe in grass and those who believe in tillage. In actual fact, grass has now become as important a crop as any other agricultural commodity.  One requires more knowledge, more education and more instruction in relation to it, and perhaps in some ways it is more difficult to learn, than almost any other branch of agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in future our citizens should have available to them the same knowledge in regard to agricultural matters as the citizens of other countries.  If we regard writing, reading and arithmetic as compulsory subjects, and if we are able to send the Civic Guards to prosecute people who are not sending their children to school, I cannot see why, particularly in the face of the agricultural crisis which will come to this country when the war is over and when whatever temporary advantage occurs in agriculture ends, before long it should not be compulsory, in the interests of the State, for every citizen to learn the elements of agriculture of a modern kind.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Commission of 1924 recommended agricultural continuation schools for boys from 14 to 17 years; night schools for boys in the winter and classes for the girls in the summer. That same commission made a number of other valuable suggestions, clearly linking up the Department of Agriculture with the Department of Education. The fact remains that no Deputy can deny that, as a result of unfortunate political conflicts among us and as a result of the close association of the Great War with the beginning of our independence and the economic changes resulting from the Great War, there is a great cleavage between the young and the old generations.  The departure from the land here is a matter that is not altogether connected with the escape from the land that has <Col N="1620" /> occurred in other countries.  The explanation is largely because we have definitely lacked the rural bias in our education which will at least encourage people to enjoy rural life, to be proud of rural life and to make the maximum effort to appreciate rural life.</P>
    <P>When I see that our compulsory subjects are confined to reading, writing and arithmetic, I cannot help thinking of the enormous difference in the way in which farmers of the smaller class, with the same size of farm, make use of whatever facilities they have been given.  One farmer will have a comparatively comfortable farm and house and will be able to make a magnificent effort, which we in the towns would be incapable of making, to live for himself, while all around other people, perhaps because of unfortunate circumstances, are obliged to live a life which is far from pleasant.  One cannot blame them for leaving that type of life.</P>
    <P>I am merely expanding what Deputy Allen said.  I am quite sure the Taoiseach has considered this matter during his short term in the Department of Education.  I want the farmers in this country to be taught as much about a blade of grass as the farmers in other countries.  If we are to survive what will inevitably be a grim, machine-minded existence after this war, in a period in which countries will be struggling to maintain economic existence, we must devote ourselves to encouraging self-sufficiency and developing our exports in a highly-competitive market.  This is the time in which we should thoroughly study this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech just delivered by Deputy Childers tempts me to make a few remarks.  I wonder does it occur to Deputy Childers that the Party to which he belongs should go away somewhere and do penance for their sins in the political sphere.  The Deputy spoke about grass.  Does he know that the first Minister for Agriculture in this State was practically driven out of public life mainly because he believed that grass was an essential part of the agriculture of this country? Curious complaints have been made here from time to time with regard to <Col N="1621" /> education.  The entire thing is wrong. What is wrong with regard to education in this country?  When I was a child, in the national school totally different condition prevailed.  To me it appears ridiculous that, in a country where there is little employment for young people and where there are few industries, youngsters can walk out of school the day they have reached 14 years of age.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern has complained about the standard of education.  He says that the children of to-day are three years behind in the matter of education as compared with the children years ago.  I do not agree with that.  I think the child of 14 to-day is as well, and perhaps better, educated than a child of the same age 30 years ago.  Deputy McGovern and those with whom he consulted are forgetting that years ago the boys stayed at school until they were 17 or 19 years, and one can visualise the knowledge they gained in that time of mathematics and English and history and geography.  They had a complete knowledge of these subjects and they were fit to go anywhere.</P>
      <P>The few years from 14 to 17 in a country like this, where in the main there is nothing to do for these young people, could be usefully spent in the school.  They cannot get away now, and what are we going to do with them?  Would it not be a great thing to equip them for the purpose Deputy Childers talked about?  Those living in towns, and anxious to follow an industrial life, would get expert knowledge and a good technical training. The children in the country would spend two or three additional years at school, doing subjects with a strong agricultural bias.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I spoke on this matter I was told there was not school-room for those people.  The only way to meet that statement is to put up a concrete case.  The school I attended when I was a boy had an attendance of 100 to 120 pupils.  I admit it was a pretty crammed place.  There is an average of only 25 in that school to-day. Perhaps the average is not as high as that.  Is there not plenty of room in that school to maintain all <Col N="1622" /> these children for an additional two or three years?</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Taoiseach anxious to have a survey made of the condition of school buildings in this country? There are schools here that are a positive disgrace.  When I see some of them I think it is a sin to compel parents to send their children there. I would refuse to send my child into some of those buildings at the risk of being prosecuted.  I would refuse to ask any mother to spend her time bringing up children, strong and healthy, to send them to those buildings. I do not know whether the Taoiseach has paid a visit to those schools in the country.  If and when he goes round, he should look at some of them and judge for himself.  If he did, I think he would take very active and drastic steps to put and end to it.</P>
    <P>There are different reasons for all that.  First of all, the whole machinery with regard to the erection of schools is cumbersome.  A site has to be got; there is usually a hold-up about that. I have often wondered why it was that the Department of Education did not take compulsory powers long ago to acquire sites for schools.  In addition, there is all the humbug about a local contribution to the cost of the erection of a school.  In view of the fact that the cost of education is a State charge, I do not see why a local contribution should be insisted on for this purpose.  Has not all the money required to finance education to come off the taxpayers, and are not the local people taxpayers?  If the cost of all this was spread over the entire State you would seem to be striking a balance, because you must have school buildings everywhere.  The building of new schools has in some places been held up for years, due to a lot of squabbling about the payment of the local contribution.  Ultimately the Department gives way, and there is no contribution at all except perhaps a very nominal sum.  In face of the new conditions, I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should consider taking steps to apply a measure of compulsory attendance at school up to 16 or 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>In the statement circulated by the <Col N="1623" /> Taoiseach he lays emphasis on the teaching of Irish.  He is not dogmatic about it.  That, I think, is the best way by which success can be attained. Really, this is a very difficult problem. I come from a semi-Gaeltacht area, and I cannot say, from what I have seen, that progress is being made in the teaching of Irish, despite all the money that is being spent on it.  As a matter of fact, the contrary is my opinion.  I have always given as a typical example the townland in which I was born.  When I was a child, Irish was spoken in every house there, except one, which was the house of a non-Catholic.  As a matter of fact, there is still living in that townland a woman who has never spoken a word of English.  Almost all the people in that townland to-day, and especially the younger generation, speak nothing but English.  I think that is pretty generally felt.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to deal with, and may I preface it by saying that I do not want it to be thought that I am complaining about those people getting the money, quite the contrary; but I have always looked upon it as ridiculous to give a grant of £2 to children in the fior-Ghaeltacht simply because Irish is the language of the home.  As a practical proposition I would like to hear how the expenditure of that money can be justified&mdash; I mean paying it for the purpose of getting Irish spoken when Irish is the language of the home.  I think it would be better if that money were given to homes in the breac-Ghaeltacht so as to encourage the people there to speak Irish, and thereby make their area a portion of the fior-Ghaeltacht.  It seems to me ridiculous to give £2 to a child for speaking the only language it can speak.  The child could not do anything else but speak Irish, because it is the language of its father and mother, of everyone that it meets on the road and in the townland in which it lives, and in the school it attends. I would prefer to see that money given for some other purpose.  I would make the speaking of Irish in the fior-Gaeltacht a national thing: that it was in the interests of the country to do <Col N="1624" /> so and was a patriotic thing to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy laid emphasis on the question of physical training in the primary schools.  I do not know whether he was speaking in general terms or not, but he referred particularly to the primary schools.  In my opinion, physical training should be compulsory in the primary and secondary schools.  The time devoted to it would be well spent, and would be supplementary to the large sums of money that are being spent under the heading of public health.  I should like to see physical training introduced into the schools at the earliest date possible. Deputy Mulcahy also spoke at some length on the teaching of mathematics to the boys and girls in the primary and secondary schools.  The new procedure dealing with this was introduced before the Taoiseach became Minister for Education.  In my opinion, it should be put an end to as soon as possible.  I think that mathematics should be a compulsory subject for boys and girls sitting for any examination under our secondary system. Goodness knows, the standard of mathematics, and of education generally, is low enough.  A Bill is at present before the Oireachtas for the setting up of an educational establishment for advanced studies.  Mathematics is one of the subjects to be taught there, yet we are leaving it optional with boys and girls in the secondary schools as to whether they will take mathematics at their examinations. I think the sooner that system is ended the better it will be for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has asked me if I propose speaking on all the matters I took a note of.  I am afraid if I were to do that we would have to spend a very long time here discussing this Estimate. The whole question of education is one that, under different circumstances, would merit consideration not for a day but for a whole week at least.  In the statement which I circulated I tried to give some of my own ideas with regard to these educational problems after I had checked them with the heads of the several Departments and with some of the inspectors. <Col N="1625" /> Now, there is not the slightest doubt about it that a good deal of complaint is being made&mdash;it is very widespread anyhow in this country&mdash;against the results we are getting under our educational system, particularly in the primary schools.  One hears it everywhere. The question is: is it justified or is it not?  I have tried to find out whether there are any standards of comparison by which we can judge: whether here in this country the standard reached by children leaving the primary schools at, say, the ordinary age is as high as the standard reached by children of the same age in other countries?  I have not been able to satisfy myself, I must admit, that there is any standard by which we can go, or that there is any judgment on which we can satisfactorily rely.  If I ask the experts in the Department they will tell me that, so far as they have been able to judge from visits paid to schools on the Continent and in England, Scotland and Wales, as well as from other sources, such as reports which they have at their disposal, they are satisfied that our children leaving school at the age of 14 have as good a general, and as sound a basis of, education as children of the same age in any other country.  They tell me that visitors to this country&mdash;educationists who are interested in this subject, and who come to them after seeing and visiting a number of our schools, and are in a position to give judgement upon them &mdash;are also of opinion that our standards here are at least as high as theirs: that we have reached as high a standard here as they have in the countries of which they have knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it might be said that the experts to whom I refer are naturally anxious to make it appear that the work with which they are charged is well done.  That may be.  I myself have not had any opportunity&mdash;and it is very difficult for anybody to give a judgment on it&mdash;of personally judging these standards.  But this seems true: that in every other country they make the very same complaint about their own primary systems and the results of <Col N="1626" /> their own efforts at education as we make here.  So that these complaints are universal, they are found in every country.  Probably the basis of these complaints is that we expect too much, that we all forget that we are grown up, and in judging what we were able to do at 14 years of age we carry back ideas of what we were able to do at a very much later date.  If we were able to see ourselves and what we were able to do at 14 years of age we probably would not have as high an ideal as we profess.  I do not know whether the children to-day who are passed through the primary schools are better fitted for life and to make a living than we were at the same age.  The question of boys and girls staying on until 18 or 19 years of age was raised by the last speaker.  There is nothing to prevent children being sent to school at 16 or 17 years now, any more than formerly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>With this difference: that assuming that one, two or three go to a school now, the class is too small.  In the years that have gone it was practically the whole school staying on and you had a class to which the teacher could apply his time. There is that difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possibly the difference but, at the present time, in fact, they could do it.  I myself remember the older boys at the back desks sitting down and working out exercises in algebra and so on with the teacher coming round, giving them an occasional helping hand and looking at what they were doing.  But that could be done to-day.  We are paying for the children up to the age of 18 years, and we have compulsion up to the age of 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When talking here of those criticisms about the standards we have reached, I often ask myself this: whether we are not comparing two different things. To-day we are comparing those who have been compelled to go to school but who, in the old days, would probably have dropped out much earlier or not have gone to school at all, we are comparing the lowest standard of those compelled to go to school to-day with those in the highest standard <Col N="1627" /> at the time to which Deputies refer. At any rate, I find no standard which would enable me to form a sound judgment upon it, and when I hear these complaints I say: &ldquo;I do not know; I am not sure.&rdquo;  It is for that reason that I urge that we should have, at least, one examination, to begin with, some test at a leaving age by which we would be able to see, on a reasonable standard, how many of those who had passed the full primary course had reached that standard.  Before my predecessor left we had been urging very strongly for this one examination at least.  We had been trying to get that accepted by the teachers.  We wanted the teachers to co-operate but the teachers are not ready to co-operate.  I think in the public interest we are entitled to have some standard because we are entitled to know whether the fruit which we expected from the work has come along or not.  I think we will have to take the bull by the horns and, even though the teachers do not like it, we will have to insist on such an examination at the end of the primary school course.  I think it is due to the people that there should be some standard by which they would know whether the work is well done or not.</P>
    <P>Another matter of a general character to which I would like to refer is the question of the subjects taught at school.  We are all, in our way, faddists.  Each one of us has a particular liking for one particular thing: one person wants music, another person wants drawing, another person wants rural science, and another person wants some other particular subject taught; and if those particular subjects are not taught they each imagine that the whole system is wrong and unsound.  Now the number of years available, and the conditions are such, that we must make up our minds that we cannot, in a primary course, or indeed in any course, teach everything.  We have to make a selection of the things that are most generally useful.  It is for that reason that people who have been thinking about these subjects come back again to what is called the &ldquo;Three Rs&rdquo; as the foundation, and I think everybody will admit, whatever <Col N="1628" /> else we may have, that we must have these and a certain standard ought to be reached in these.  We ought, as a result of the years in the primary schools, get boys or girls to the stage at which they can read, write and express themselves with reasonable fluency in the vernacular, whatever it is.  In our case, we want them to be able to do that in Irish.  That is what we are aiming at.  We have not succeeded because we have not, so far, been able to bring the Irish into the position of the full vernacular.</P>
    <P>We are trying then to get our children to have two languages in which they can read, write and express themselves with reasonable fluency.  That is a fairly big task in itself.  To do it in one language is a big task, but to do it in two is a very much greater task, particularly when you have to do it as in the case of the Irish language&mdash;which we want to make ultimately the universal language here&mdash;in face of the fact that we have not the conditions and surroundings which would enable the children to get the help which they can only get from these surroundings.  So that on the language side alone, we have a very much heavier course now than had the children of our time who had only to learn to read, write and express themselves with reasonable fluency in one language&mdash;namely, English&mdash;the language that was spoken for the most part all round. I am, of course, speaking of the country outside the Gaeltacht.  Mind you, that language training which they will obtain is going to be of the greatest possible value to the children. There is no doubt whatever about that. And the second language is of additional value, because, quite instinctively by using a second language, the use of the other language becomes more accurate.  They begin to appreciate the value of words, and to appreciate shades of meaning and the nature of things that they would not at all appreciate if they had only one language.  Therefore, we should appreciate the fact that the teaching of a second language in our schools must of necessity be of great educational value to the children.</P>
    <P>Leaving the languages aside, what <Col N="1629" /> else have we to do?  I do not think that any person can regard himself as fitted for the life that we have to lead in modern conditions unless that person is able to write, and by writing I mean not merely the mechanical process of writing, but also the process of written expression, which goes side by side with oral expression with the different characteristics of both.  With these, I do not think there is anybody who will deny that we must have a certain facility in computation, and that means a minimum knowledge of arithmetic.  Then you have the question of how far you can go, and what are the essentials.  There, again, I think that the essentials are sufficiently numerous, and the course is sufficiently wide to require practically the whole time available in a primary course without adding to it other mathematical subjects, such as algebra, geometry, or sometimes a slight introduction to trigonometry, with mensuration and so on.</P>
    <P>If I were to settle that course of my own will, and had nobody else to consider, I would make arithmetic the basis of the mathematical teaching in the primary schools, and I would not bother to get on to formal algebra. I would naturally use generalisation. I might use arithmetic in the proper place to give an introduction to a formal algebra course.  Afterwards I might occasionally make use of the arithmetical basis to get on to some of the properties of figures, in other words, to give an elementary idea of geometry, so that the science would not be a completely foreign matter to children when they leave school.  But I would not set out formally to teach either algebra or geometry in a primary school course if I had completely the setting of the course.  I would do that because I would rather spend the time that I had in improving the knowledge of arithmetic than I would in starting on a new subject, a subject in which I could only give the barest outline in the time at my disposal.</P>
    <P>If we take the languages with the question of mechanical writing and writing from the point of view of composition and of expressing oneself in writing, and if we take arithmetic, I <Col N="1630" /> think we have got the real essentials, the foundations which are absolutely necessary if pupils leaving school are to be able to enter into life and understand it.  Of course there are a number of other things that one would like to add on.  But I call these the foundations, the essentials, and I would rather have these done well, because they are the key to other things, than go on to other subjects, if those were to be neglected by doing so.</P>
    <P>Then to come to history.  A certain knowledge of or acquaintance with history is undoubtedly useful.  But, if the children have been taught to read the language in which the text books of history are written, then they have the key to reading for themselves.  If you get them interested in reading for themselves, then you can leave them to do history and even geography.  But in our schools we do require a certain amount of history to be done and a certain amount of geography.  I would be satisfied if we got an outline of the history of our own people in the primary schools and a knowledge of geography which would give a general idea of the countries of the world, with a more particular knowledge of our own country.  I do not think it is at all necessary to have a very detailed knowledge on these subjects at all.  I am talking of the primary schools now.</P>
    <P>Many of us remember that when we were in the 4th or 5th standard we had to do a great deal of geography.  Most of us knew then the position of places on the globe which we do not know to-day, even with our experience.  I remember that we used to sit in front of a map of the world and try to puzzle each other by asking: &ldquo;Where is Christmas Island&rdquo; and all sorts of extraordinary places like that.  We had at that time an unnecessarily detailed knowledge, it seems to me, of countries, both the political and economic geography of them, with long lists of commodities exported from various countries. It seemed to me that that was a good deal of useless lumber that we did not want.  I suppose you can always say that knowledge is no load, that if you acquire it it is no harm.  That may be quite true, provided the time spent in acquiring it could not have been <Col N="1631" /> more usefully spent in learning something else.</P>
    <P>These are the things we require in a primary school, and if we can get our work done so that a reasonable standard in the languages is arrived at, and a reasonable standard of arithmetic, which is practically all the arithmetic anybody ever learns, the fundamental rules of numbers, fractions, and so on, which you hardly add to in after life, we can be satisfied that our primary course is fulfilling its function.  All I want is to see a test that that has been done by having some examinations at the end which will satisfy us that a reasonable standard in reading and writing and expressing oneself in the languages has been arrived at and a reasonable standard in arithmetic, and, if you wish to add to that, a reasonable standard as regards a knowledge of geography and of Irish history.</P>
    <P>I believe that we can get that standard if we have good work, and good work means consistent work, and consistent work means a good deal of mechanical routine.  What I am afraid of is&mdash;and I did fear it would happen when I was a professor in the training colleges&mdash;that teachers are thinking all the time of making subjects interesting and attractive, and that if they spend all their time at that sort of thing the mechanical routine which is necessary to go through a subject as a whole cannot be carried out.  It is useless for anybody to think that good work can be done in a national school, or in any school without a good deal of hard mechanical routine work.</P>
    <P>What you have got to do is to get people not to dislike that sort of work. They will not dislike it.  The curious thing is that you will get children who will be quite happy doing mechanical work, for which they have great facility at that age, who will be disappointed, and very weary, if the mistake is made of trying to reason with them, or asking them to use their reasoning powers before they are sufficiently developed, or before their knowledge of a subject is sufficient to enable them to use it. I think a great mistake was made there.  From what I saw in my time I always thought it would have a bad influence <Col N="1632" /> on the country as a whole, this attempting to appeal to the reasoning powers of a child, before the child had developed the power to reason properly. At the time other things that the children were by nature fitted for were neglected, when it was easy for their memories to have stores upon which they could ruminate as they grew older, and as their reasoning powers permitted.</P>
    <P>With regard to criticisms of primary results, I do not know whether the criticisms are justified or not.  The chances are that they are not justified. We have such a habit of grumbling and growling about everything that we start by thinking we are not facing life properly and we try to find fault.  If we encouraged, rather than tried to find fault, we would get much better results. As long as I am in the Department I will try to urge&mdash;and I said this several times since I took charge of the Office &mdash;a little well done and thoroughly done.  It is not easy at the beginning to get to like work, but after a time people get more interested and, in fact, time hangs most heavily when they are not working.  We can get good work done, but work which is of interest must often have in addition work of a mechanical or routine and of a drilled character, both for the pupil and the teacher.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of the teaching of the language.  I do not think Deputy O Briain has quite got what I expressed in the statement, or perhaps it did not show my mind clearly on the question.  There has been a good deal of complaint about the policy of the Department by people who did not go to the trouble of finding out exactly what the policy of the Department is.</P>
    <P>Even teachers have been criticising, but if they had looked at the circular that was sent out, and also at the note, they would realise that the policy of the Department was that when there was a teacher who knew the language, and who was, therefore, able to use it properly, and when there were children in a position, on account of their knowledge of it, to assimilate the knowledge being given them, under these conditions the Irish language was to be used in the schools.  I am <Col N="1633" /> speaking of teaching through Irish. If people approached it from that common sense point of view, they would not be making the complaints that have been made.  Nobody wants a teacher who does not know Irish to teach other subjects through Irish. That would be ridiculous.  He could not do it.  Nobody expects if a child does not know a language that it could be taught another subject through that language.  The Department was not making that foolish assumption, or asking impossible things to be done.  What the Department wanted was that where a teacher did know the language, and where children had such knowledge of it that they were able to assimilate the instruction given them under these conditions, that Irish would be used as the medium.</P>
    <P>With regard to infants' classes, that is a peculiar type of problem.  In infants' classes it is only language that is taught, and the child is put doing little things.  Irish words are used, usually in connection with such phrases as &ldquo;Close the door,&rdquo;&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stand up.&rdquo;  Children are being taught the language by what we might regard as the direct method of teaching. There is no formal teaching in the case of infants, and it is not right to say that we are trying to teach infants through a language they do not understand.  What is being taught in the infant classes is really the language itself, and the children are being taught to use the language at a time when their power to learn a language is very great.  They are being taught the language by the direct method.  We have often met people who, when asked where they learned German, will say that they had a governess who spoke German well, or if they knew French, they will tell you that they had a French governess.  If it is possible for a child in isolation like that to learn in a home where another language is spoken generally, it ought to be possible for our children, when they go to primary schools, to learn the language.  If there is a good teacher, there is no reason why that teacher could not give them the language in the same way as a governess <Col N="1634" /> gives another language to others.</P>
    <P>Talking about progress, or want of progress, in the language, most of us learned languages in the secondary schools.  For a number of years I was learning French, and I know other people who under similar conditions studied under reasonably good conditions, but could not speak French. That may have been our own fault, but the fact was we could not speak French.  We could read it, and perhaps write it with some effort.  We did not know that language after five or six years in secondary schools and did not have any such knowledge as children leaving primary schools have of Irish.  There is not the slightest doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the position of infants, I think there can be no objection whatever if there is a sympathetic teacher.  You want a special type of person, a sympathetic teacher of the right type to take charge of infants. The best teachers ought to be those who are most gifted and put in charge of young children.  That does not often happen, but it ought to be the case. Given a sympathetic teacher, who gets hold of children at that stage in the infant classes, that teacher can manage.  It is extraordinary how much of the language the children will learn in a year or two in such classes.  I do not see what harm of any kind could be done to children in that way.  I do not believe people who say that the children's minds are stunted when this thing or that thing is done.  I do not believe a word of that.  I believe if the teacher is sympathetic, and takes children at that stage, and teaches by the direct method, no harm whatever is done.  It is said that the children are brought into an Irish atmosphere from the home atmosphere of the English language and that the school appears artificial to them.  That may be true.  Every one of us, when we went to school&mdash;whether it was English or Irish&mdash;found the school atmosphere very artificial indeed: we were very glad, when we knew how to read the clock, to look at it to see if the hour had come to get away.  I do not think that there is much in the argument regarding infant classes.  Fundamentally, <Col N="1635" /> it is necessary to have a sympathetic teacher of the right type, who knows the language; for, if the teachers do not know it they cannot teach it by any method.  The whole purpose of the Department has been to provide just such teachers as rapidly as possible and I think that wonderful progress has been made in that respect.</P>
    <P>We come on now to the higher classes where subjects other than the language are being taught.  At that particular point, I would probably differ from some other people interested in the revival of the language.  We ought to approach this subject with our minds open&mdash;ready to agree and decide on whatever gives the best results.  We should not have ideas in our minds in advance, that this or that method must necessarily be used and that it would be wrong to change to another method, even if it were clearly shown to be better.  In regard to the spacing of time, if I were choosing, I should rather give more time to developing the knowledge of the language itself than to the use of the language in learning another subject.  For example, two years after the infant classes, if I had to teach arithmetic through Irish I should rather give three-quarters of the time to the language itself, so that the mental instrument or instrument of expression they were going to use would be better, even if I had to cut down the time used for the subject concerned. We all know that if we want to perform calculations, we have to know tables and to know certain results by heart.  If you learn these at the start in one language, that is the language you are likely to think in.  You do not learn two sets of tables&mdash; though I am told that it is astonishing how quickly this can be done and that there is a process which is midway between translation and direct memorising. These tables are only learned in one language and if we are going to use Irish for arithmetic the tables will have to be learned through Irish.  Having begun in that way, there will be the simple application of those tables in what we call long multiplication, long division, and so on.</P>
    <P>While the mechanical processes are taking place, that can be continued; <Col N="1636" /> it is only when you begin to give problems in arithmetic apart from the mechanical processes, that you have to explain the why and the wherefore. That may bring difficulties with the use of any language that is not thoroughly understood by the children, or of which the children have not a complete mastery.  Good teachers, anxious to promote the use of Irish, will use it; and if, occasionally, they have any doubt whatever of the ability of the pupils to understand them, they will not hesitate to use English if the child knows English better.  No inspector that I know of would object to that.  He would object if it were abused in the way that Deputy Donnchadh O Briain thought it might be abused, in that Irish might be cut out of the school altogether, so that teachers would get out of the difficulty. But if they are doing their work properly, the inspector can have no objection.  When talking to a child it is easy to see whether the child understands or not, to see whether the child's mind has made contact with the teacher's or not.  If it had not made contact through Irish, you will have to use the language through which contact can be made.  If the bias, the desire to use Irish as much as possible, is there, the use of English for explanatory purposes is quite permissible, and, as far as I know from the Department, no inspector would find fault with that.  As far as arithmetic is concerned, tables and other mechanical processes can be learned through the medium of Irish. When you come to problems, however, you can use English where an English explanation is necessary in order to make contact with the child's mind. In teaching arithmetic, three-fourths of the time could be spent with Irish.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of history teaching, people are inclined to think sometimes that history is only a story, and that it lends itself to a language very easily.  After all, it is only a story&mdash;and the simplest and most elementary use of a language is in telling a story.  An exceptionally good teacher could give a good history course to the children trained by himself or herself for four or five years. Of course, teachers have succeeded in <Col N="1637" /> doing that, and there can be no patience with people who say that it cannot be done.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;Good teachers are born rather than made.&rdquo;  When teaching was a pure vocation things were on a different level from what they are when it is a general profession to which people can come in to follow as a career.  That is a problem in various professions to-day, where you have to deal with people who come in to follow a career without having any special vocation for that particular profession.</P>
    <P>To those teachers who have special abilities or qualifications for teaching I would say that they must not imagine that, because they themselves are satisfied of their success, their brothers or sisters in the profession can be equally successful.  A certain amount of latitude must, therefore, be given to the use of the English language, in teaching subjects in schools, to teachers who have not got exceptional abilities or an exceptional knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>However, all we can say is that an exceptionally good teacher can give a history course in the Irish language, again assuming that the children have had a fair introductory training, whereas the teacher who is not a really good teacher will have great difficulty in doing so.  Such teachers will have difficulty in getting over these general ideas which are in history.  We, who are grown up, think of history as a relatively simple subject, but it is not simple to those who are looking out on the world for the first time and who have no ideas of politics or matters of that sort.  In the case of the geography of this country, there are instances where the good teacher can teach geography without any great difficulty through the medium of Irish.  The less able teacher will have difficulty in doing that.  Going through the various subjects taught in the schools, I ask is it unreasonable to expect that the majority of our schools should be able to carry on the teaching of other subjects through Irish?  I do not think it is unreasonable, but I do not think we should be rigid in regard to the matter. If, on occasion, there is clearly a desire <Col N="1638" /> on the part of the teacher to do as much as possible, I do not think that anybody would be so rigid or so unreasonable as to say that the use of the other language to make the instruction plain should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I do not think, as far as the primary course is concerned, there is anything further I can say about it.  Some people would like to bring in agriculture, some music, and some drawing. With regard to these subjects, I say that there is only a certain number of hours available in the day and only a certain number of years available up to the age of 14, that we cannot have everything, and that it is very much better to concentrate on the fundamental things.  It would not be fair to call other subjects&mdash;rural science, algebra and things of that sort&mdash;trimmings, but I would so regard them as compared with the other things of fundamental value.  Vocal music is exceptional. I am afraid to say much about music because I know nothing about it myself, and what I do say may be only a peculiar personal view.  I suppose it is one of the cultural things in life, and that apart from the power to read, which is given through the work in primary schools, that if you can get people to enjoy that particular cultural side upon which music touches, you will be doing good work.  If I were going to add to these fundamental subjects, the one I should like to add would be vocal music.  I think it is a good thing to get people these days to sing rather than growl.  If we became a nation of singers rather than a nation of fault-finders, we would be much better off.  It would enable us to look at the bright side of things at a time when there are so many dark sides to the picture.</P>
    <P>The question of school buildings was also referred to.  When I went to the Department I think there were about 600 schools that were regarded as requiring attention and, of these, 300 were in a bad way.  Although the Minister for Finance had a very tight pull on the purse-strings, we got him to release them with regard to school buildings.  We are going ahead as quickly as we can at the present time and there is no let-up in regard to that <Col N="1639" /> matter.  The suggestion was made that we might short-cut some of the present Departmental routine, but I do not think that would help matters very much.  The Department of Education has to come into it and you would have to have architects if you tried to deal with the matter apart from the Board of Works.  I do not think, in the long run, it would help very much. We could not side-track the Minister for Finance because, naturally, if the money is to be allocated at all, there must be somebody in charge.  You could not allow the several Departments to go off on their own and just spend whatever they required.  The Department of Finance would have to be consulted with regard to the provision made.  I do think the Department of Finance has not been at all ungenerous in regard to educational services.  Compared with other countries, we are spending more than most.  I do not know if there is any country where a larger proportion of the revenues is being spent on education than in this country.  I do not think, therefore, that there can be any complaint in regard to the attitude of the Department of Finance or that the Minister for Finance has been ungenerous in regard to education.</P>
    <P>There was one particular matter in regard to which I tried to soften his hard heart, namely, the teaching of literary subjects in industrial schools. He said to me: &ldquo;You have got a lot of demands in other directions; this is something new.  We want to cut down these new demands as much as possible.&rdquo; The sum in question is about £29,000 per annum.  All I can say is that the Minister for Finance has promised that, as soon as he is able to deal with the matter, he will do so, but at the present time he cannot meet all the demands made upon him.  Regretfully we have to leave that matter over.  I personally regret it, because my predecessor had indicated that it was our intention to make money available for that purpose.  It would have been made available were it not for the present financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>With regard to school buildings, we <Col N="1640" /> are not held up on the money side.  As for the matter of local contributions. again, we cannot have it every way. We must remember that our system is a denominational system and that the local managers have a considerable and an important part to play in our whole system.  My hope would be that the managers of our schools would carry out that function to the full.  I have not been long enough in the Department to know to what extent that is being done, but when I was young&mdash; and I suppose things have not changed very much for the better since&mdash; although we had very careful priests, going back and looking at the situation as I see it now, recollecting what happened in my own area which, I think, was fairly representative, my view is that a good deal of the inspection and the work carried out by the central Department could have been very much more easily done and more profitably done by the managers.</P>
    <P>We are anxious that the managers would take a full share in looking after the educational work carried on in the schools.  They are very much better than any inspector.  An inspector comes in on a particular day for a few hours.  The manager can walk in at any time.  He can have a weekly visit if he wants to have regular visits. or he can make irregular visits.  He will know whether a reasonable standard has been reached or whether the work is being done properly, in a way that no inspector can know.  The managers, then, are a very important part of our whole system, and in giving them the rights which they have, we cannot at the same time abrogate the demand that some local contribution will be made.  It is true that in some cases&mdash;and I doubt whether we were wise in doing it&mdash;the conditions were such that it was thought that no contribution, or a very little contribution, should be made.  And because these exceptions were made, everybody now wants to be an exception.  They all want to be treated as the exceptional cases were treated, with the result that it is becoming more and more difficult to get a reasonable local contribution. I think that the local community, who are served by the <Col N="1641" /> school in a particular way, ought to be asked to pay their particular share, which is not a big one&mdash;it is only one-third of the cost.  It does mean delay, because they all think that, since some school in some very poor area was let off and did not have to pay more than one-sixth, or even a smaller fraction, other places that could well afford to tax the community to that extent should be let off also.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything else with regard to the primary system which it should be necessary for me to reply to except, perhaps, this matter of physical drill.  As far as I remember, there used to be a sort of thing that was called physical drill.  I remember that I had some sort of physical drill in the primary school&mdash; some kind of marching, and so on&mdash;and I think I remember having something in the nature of a physical drill in the secondary schools.  However, from my memory of any physical drill that I saw in these schools, it did not appear to me that it was very much worth while bothering about.  Now, games are on a different footing, and I certainly think that, in so far as it is possible within our means, to provide playing grounds, playing fields, and so on, we ought to attempt to do so; but it is no small thing to face, and the cost would be considerable. The cost of providing the necessary playing fields would be very great and there is also the difficulty of getting the right place.  The provision of playing fields in connection with the schools, however, would be very helpful, in my opinion, because there they would get physical exercises in the best possible surroundings.  I am not going to say that you could not superimpose on that, or have with it&mdash;but, again, it would be very expensive&mdash;a system of regular exercises which we generally refer to as physical drill.  I am sure that you could have that.  I would not like to make any promise in regard to that matter, or in regard to playing fields, but I shall look into it.</P>
    <P>Another thing that was asked about in connection with the primary schools was the provision of an extra room or two in the schools where, say, rural <Col N="1642" /> carpentry or work that would be suitable for young farmers and young farm labourers in a rural community could be taught, and where the girls would have an opportunity of being taught something with regard to cooking and domestic economy.  I am informed, however, that it would be a very expensive business, and that the provision of an extra room or two to the present schools would require a very large capital sum.  Then there is also the question as to whether it would be really effective for the purpose, or whether it would be the best way to achieve the purpose.  I just touch on that point, and am merely pointing out that it would be very expensive, but I do not want to prejudice any further inquiries that may be made into that matter.</P>
    <P>Now, whilst I would not have agriculture or these things taught in the primary schools proper, because I think the other things are more necessary and of more general value at that particular time, still I do think that if you had continuation courses it would be a great help to the rural community if they could get some instruction in agriculture.  There is this to be remembered about agriculture, it seems to me&mdash;that there you have an opportunity of learning the subject at home.  As somebody suggested, you will not learn agriculture out of a text-book in a school; very largely, you will learn it by practice and by seeing with your own eyes the things that are being done.  That is the best way to learn it.  Very well, then.  If we could get the presentday farmers&mdash;the fathers and the young people on the farms who are actually doing the work&mdash;instructed in the proper methods of agriculture, the children would naturally see the right processes as they were being employed, and unless you had continuation classes in the schools&mdash;taking the students out and giving them practical demonstrations afterwards, which would be fairly expensive&mdash;I think the best way would be to improve the work that is being done by the Department of Agriculture in teaching the actual farmers as to what they should do with their farms, and how to apply <Col N="1643" /> the best methods in the best way to get the full economic value, and then the children on these farms would learn their agriculture in the best possible school.  If you had that supplemented by some kind of continuation work then I think the results that are desired here would be obtained.</P>
    <P>Passing from the primary schools to the secondary schools, one of the questions that was raised in connection with this matter of the secondary schools was that of compulsory mathematics. I think that Deputy Mulcahy, in particular, is under a misapprehension as to what the regulations are, what the syllabus is, and what are the prescribed courses and conditions.  It has been suggested to me that, probably, the mistake arose from the fact that certain proposals were issued at one time, but that they were departed from and are not the proposals which were actually put into the programme.</P>
    <P>In the programme the position is that all the boys who are pursuing an approved course&mdash;the course must be approved before the grants are paid&mdash; must study mathematics and take mathematics in the intermediate course and in the preparatory course for the intermediate course.  They must do mathematics; it is compulsory, and if they wish to get the Intermediate Certificate they also have to pass an examination in mathematics.  So that mathematics, in so far as we could make it compulsory, is compulsory for the boys in the intermediate course and up for the intermediate examination.  Now, as regards girls, mathematics is also obligatory on the girls as part of an approved course.  If we are to recognise them as pupils following an approved course, they must attend mathematical classes; they must do mathematics, but they are not required, as a condition of passing the intermediate examination, to pass in mathematics.  You may ask, why? Why not make it a compulsory subject in that examination for the girls as well as for the boys?  Well, it was put up to us in this way. <Col N="1644" /> Sometimes there are exceptional people who find mathematics extremely difficult and it was suggested that these exceptions are to be found more frequently amongst girls than amongst boys.  Accordingly, we said: &ldquo;All right; if the girls follow the approved course and pass in their full number of subjects, leaving out mathematics and passing in an alternative subject, then we will not regard them as having failed in their examination.  We will allow them to pass without mathematics but they have to spend the full number of hours in studying mathematics as an approved course.&rdquo;  That was to meet the case of exceptional people, but the proof that mathematics is not neglected is that over 99 per cent. of the boys and over 80 per cent. of the girls take mathematics in the Leaving Certificate Examination in which it is compulsory for either boys or girls.  So that even though the exception is made, 80 per cent. of the girls take mathematics through their whole course.  We are not preventing them, remember; we are only not insisting that they must pass in mathematics.  For those who feel that they have not any particular ability in regard to mathematics, we are not insisting that they must do mathematics in order that they may pass the intermediate examination. I think that Deputy Mulcahy was not aware of the fact that we are compelling them to go through the approved course and, as a matter of fact, this very high percentage of girls take mathematics even in the final examination in which nobody need take it.</P>
    <P>I have to confess that since I came into the Department I have not had the same opportunity of dealing with technical education.  I have given a good deal of attention to the secondary and primary branches.  I propose now to try to give the same attention to the technical and vocational sides.  So far I have not had an opportunity of doing that so I cannot speak from direct personal knowledge.  I would like to say that I did go into about half a dozen primary schools.  I intend visiting a number of others.  I went into half a dozen schools to see what was the result as far as Irish was concerned.  I <Col N="1645" /> was told that I was being taken to what would be regarded as particularly good, medium and not so good schools. I must say that from what I could observe in the short time I was there, I was more than pleased with regard to the progress that seemed to have been made in regard to Irish.  I must say that.</P>
    <P>Having heard complaints by the score, I went rather expecting to find things of a certain kind.  I was agreeably surprised.  I am taking the word of the people who took me to these schools that they were of the classes indicated.  I intend visiting other schools.  These were schools not very far from Dublin&mdash;country schools just outside Dublin, but I hope to go into other schools.  I can only say that if all the schools in the country are anything like the six schools that I saw, then let nobody say that we are not succeeding in our effort to get the language known amongst the young people.  I think we have succeeded far beyond anything I would have believed if I had not gone into those schools.  Where we are failing in this matter is that when they leave the schools they have no immediate reason for speaking Irish; they have no immediate inducement to speak Irish.  If we can take up the work that has been done in the schools in teaching the language and if we can try to take that up at that stage and give them a reason for using it one with another, in their ordinary daily lives afterwards, we shall have succeeded. I would like to assure members of the House who may not themselves have gone into the schools, that they make a mistake if they believe the stories that we have completely failed in the work we have been trying to do in the schools.  I think there has been wonderful progress made and I believe that if we keep on with confidence and try to help by doing something for them in the years after they have just left school, either by some of these suggestions that have been made or otherwise, then the money which has been spent will be justified from the national point of view because we will have succeeded.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say with <Col N="1646" /> regard to secondary schools except that last year, in consultation with the inspectors and in consultation with different groups of headmasters, we introduced prescribed text books and tried to get the courses there more definite than they have been before. My view anyhow is that that is a step in the right direction.  The schools are examining the programme this year and we expect to be in consultation with them.  We expect that the schools will be able to give us their views as to any further slight changes or modifications that may be necessary.  In the case of the Irish and English languages we have not prescribed texts in the same way as we have in regard to, say, Latin and Greek and modern languages, but we hope to develop in that direction.  After this year's examination, and, perhaps, another year's examination, then I think we will develop in the direction of having a certain number of prescribed texts also, both in regard to Irish and English, again going on the motto that it is better to do a little well than to go over a wide course, doing it in a superficial, inaccurate and rather indefinite manner.</P>
    <P>In regard to free school books, I have to confess that if I were the person to decide in that matter I would give no free books.  I would try to provide cheap books, and I would provide few of them.  Few books and cheap books, so that the cost would not be great, is what I would aim at. I would try to have them cheap by having them made more or less standard books.  I know that there are people who would not agree with that view.  My own view is that they would not appreciate the books if they were given free.  They would be thrown aside, and they would not have the same care for them.  If they had only to pay a small amount they would be kept and treasured, and would be, perhaps, more useful.</P>
    <P>With regard to school meals, that is a matter which does not come under my particular Ministry at the moment so I shall not deal with it.</P>
    <P>I was asked about part-time Irish teachers and the poor remuneration <Col N="1647" /> that they get.  I think the idea has been to try to eliminate these as far as possible.  I think we have only a few of them left now.  I will look into the position.  I think the aim of the Department is to have as few part-time teachers as possible.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that there might be a break in the day.  I think it was Deputy Byrne who asked that question. That is a matter for the managers. The managers can, if they wish, arrange the school time to suit it. There are many difficulties.  It would be quite impossible for the Department to make a rule on that matter, because conditions are so different in different places.  Anybody who thinks of it for a moment will see all the difficulties.  If children, for instance, have to go a long distance, they would have to pay the double fare, and so on. A lot of factors would come in if we were to break the time in that way. However, again it is a matter that the managers can handle if they wish.  If there are any particular local circumstances which make it possible to do it, they can do it.  I agree with the general principle that it would be a very good thing for the children to get a meal and to get a break, but, unfortunately, we have to balance that with other things, and conditions are against it.  If I were a manager I might, even with the best will in the world, find the difficulties too great for me to overcome.</P>
    <P>I was also asked, when there are big housing schemes being carried out, why we should not anticipate our requirements. I think that is a very proper suggestion.  It may be very difficult to anticipate.  I do not know to what extent we might be able to anticipate the requirements as to the number of children who would have to be accommodated.  I think it is looking ahead, and that is always wise in planning.  I think that it is a suggestion that might be considered.  The Deputy was particularly talking about 'bus fares, and so on.  The new schools are going to be built in the area to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> With regard to the salaries question, Deputy Hurley said that I was very abrupt in the reply which was sent.  I looked at it in this way: I knew that the financial conditions were such that we could not dream of doing it under present circumstances, and what was the use of wasting my time and the time of the teachers' representatives in talking about something to which the answer was determined in advance?  I saw not long ago a letter from some people&mdash;I think in Donegal&mdash;who came up here to see some Department in regard to a particular matter.  They wrote to me complaining that at the interview it transpired that a decision had been taken which made it quite impossible for them to get what they wanted, and they said that they should not have been brought that distance just to be told that a decision had been taken, but that they should have been told before they came.  That was a case in which evidently the person concerned took the view that Deputy Hurley suggests I should have taken, that it was a matter of courtesy to let them come along, to listen to them, and then to tell them in the course of the conversation that a decision had been reached which would make it impossible to give them what they wanted, unless something extraordinary transpired at the interview.  I did not want to do that.  I knew that under the circumstances and in view of the general policy decided on by the Government, I could not ask the Minister for Finance to consider the question of an increase of salaries.  I do not think I was discourteous, but I was quite straight with them in stating that no purpose would be served, as no purpose would have been served, in seeing them on that matter.</P>
    <P>A question was also raised about teachers' conferences, and I was asked why we did not avail of the invitation issued by teachers to have these conferences with inspectors.  That matter has been brought to my notice once or twice recently, but there is a genuine difficulty in regard to it, that is, that the teachers will not invite to these conferences those who do not belong to their organisation.  After all, that <Col N="1649" /> is a matter outside the Department, and if the inspectors are to have local conferences with teachers, it is only right that all the teachers should have an opportunity of profiting by anything the inspector may say.  Were it not for that difficulty, the matter would have been fixed long ago, because we would certainly have agreed.</P>
    <P>I have a note about smaller matters, such as the using of schools for pamphlets about education, upon which I do not think it is necessary for me to comment.  With regard to the readers which we propose to bring out, it has been suggested that, following the general principle, there is a great deal in having one book which would be known to parents.  For instance, in regard to Irish, nothing would help the teaching of Irish in the schools more than to have the same books for the younger children as were used previously by the elder children.</P>
    <P>In that case, they would have home help, and I should like to see for a number of years some readers, particularly in Irish, standardised so that one book would be used by the children in a family.  I would hope that the time might come when even the parents themselves might be able to teach the language and to say: &ldquo;I know that by heart.  I learned it when I was at school.&rdquo;  I think that would be particularly valuable.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that I did not take the teachers' organisation, as such, into consultation in the matter.  I intended doing so at a later stage. What we did was to write to a number of people who had been teachers, and who were likely to have a right appreciation of the pieces of literature suitable for children, and ask them to suggest some pieces which they considered suitable.  We wrote to individual teachers.  Deputy Hurley's point, I think, was that we should have asked the teachers' organisation to communicate with their own members.  We communicated directly with those we knew were particularly fitted to help, and we got suggestions from them, but before the book is finally decided on, I will have <Col N="1650" /> an opportunity of discussing it and its contents with the organisation.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the director of the museum, and the present position in his regard.  The position was that at the beginning of the war he was absent on museum business.  He has had some difficulty in getting back, and provision is being made for the appointment of an acting director to carry on in his absence.  The salary was paid up to the beginning of December, but is not being paid at the moment. It was also suggested that we were shutting down the training colleges. That is not the right way of looking at it.  The position was that there was no use in training teachers for whom there was no room.  We have, in fact, a fairly difficult problem to handle at present in regard to teachers trained in excess of our requirements.  There was no use continuing on that line, so that the shutting down was not a sort of deliberate act of policy on our part. We closed them simply because we did not need so many to meet requirements.</P>
    <P>As to inspection, as I pointed out in the statement I circulated, it would be quite impossible for the number of inspectors we have&mdash;there are only 65 of them, I think&mdash;to examine directly and immediately 400,000 pupils.  What I have suggested is that we should have one primary leaving certificate examination by which we could test what standard had been reached.  We would have to increase our inspectorial staff very substantially indeed if we were to attempt to do what has been suggested by some Deputies.  Deputy Mulcahy had some idea&mdash;I am not quite clear as to what he had in mind, or how he would operate it&mdash;of putting a number of groups to examining certain subjects, and ascertaining what proficiency had been reached.  It is the main function of the inspectorial staff to help the teachers in so far as they can see how the work is being carried on in the school, but I am afraid I do not see exactly what Deputy Mulcahy had in mind with regard to these groups.</P>

      <P>If you take a half-dozen first class teachers, whom you can now replace in your schools temporarily, and give them the work of investigating a certain number of schools in certain areas, if you like, of considering simply the question of what is the position of geography in the schools, taken as a sample group, what is wrong with the methods, what is wrong with the results and what is wrong with the objective, you will get a concentrated report from experienced teachers on a particular subject.  You will not get it from the inspectors under the present system, but you could get it on each of the subjects by having a small group and giving that group three or four months of the working year in which to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that that would be so, because we have a number of inspectors who will see more in their time and be more continuous on the job than any group you could send out.  If you want a check on the inspectors, that is another matter, but if you simply want information, I do not think a group like that could get it for you, because at present you have a large number of inspectors who, in various ways, are in touch with these different subjects and have a full knowledge of what is being done. If there is a question of what is wrong, you can get the necessary knowledge from them.  By getting a group of inspectors together, you can get results from their knowledge but if you wish as a check to go outside&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid you would not get it in that way.  If any question regarding Irish, for example, crops up I can get the views of the inspectors.  They can tell me what can be done and that would be as good an expression of opinion as any we would get in the other way.  But it would not be a thing by which the average man in the street would be able to judge.  If we have a Leaving Certificate examination, and 50,000 or 100,000 pupils go in for this examination, and if you show the percentage of passes, which means that the pupils concerned must have done a certain number of questions on the papers, the average person can satisfy himself as to the standard reached in the examination.  I am assuming, of course, that he is a person capable of forming a definite opinion, that he has some idea of what a reasonable standard is.  He can see by the results the standard reached.  I do not think he could do that by means of an expression of opinion in the way indicated. If that is wanted, you can get it by grouping the inspectors.</P>

      <P>Probably there was never a time when there was greater need of sane and serious thought than there is at the present time but, even in this grave hour, we have to maintain our right of independent criticism.  We shall exercise that right with a full sense of the responsibility placed upon all of us.  I have been listening to speeches, and I have read the speeches of many members of the Government on the question of the better defence of the country.  So far, these speakers have failed to give expression to any desire to have a better economic system.  I believe that it is equally important to consider every aspect of the economic and social organisation under which we live and to see what should be altered and expanded to meet the changing circumstances of the times. National unity is a very empty thing if we have not a common effort for the common good.  I am also satisfied that national defence and national freedom will not survive and cannot survive while masses of our people are undernourished, <Col N="1658" /> badly housed and are the helpless victims of the profit-making movement.  I listened to speeches delivered yesterday and I have seen big headlines in the papers this morning to a speech delivered by a Deputy yesterday about the dangers threatening the country.  I am not at all satisfied that we are sufficiently frank with the people.  I want to say to the Taoiseach that we are not taking the people sufficiently into our confidence.  I have read speeches of Ministers during the week telling us that, if certain people invade this country, it will encourage others to invade it, forgetting, evidently, that we have an invader in the country already.  Our people are confused. What, they ask, is all the excitement about?  Of whom are we really afraid?  Deputy Dillon told us yesterday that we are being asked to do to the invader what Denmark did. He did not indicate the people who made that request.  I do not think it is fair to scare our people with those statements.  I am satisfied that our people are prepared to make very great sacrifices, to make great changes in any emergency that may arise.  There are many people in our country prepared to make sacrifices; they made them in the past and they will make them again.  I should like to see those people taken a little more into the confidence of the Government.</P>
      <P>I find that there is great confusion at the moment among good Irishmen&mdash; and, when I say good Irishmen, I mean men who made sacrifices, perhaps not so much in the open field with the gun; but they have made many sacrifices and they are prepared to make more. I find that there is too much make-believe. We are told we are going to be invaded by some enemy.  I do not know whether we are afraid to admit it or suppress it or hurt the feelings of some of the big countries.  I want to emphasise that there is already an invasion of our country and that invasion is a bigger danger in the way of drawing some other country to invade our land than anything else.  I do not like to see our people scared into thinking that we are within hours or days of being invaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the position <Col N="1659" /> is serious, and it is because of that I am speaking in this fashion.  I believe that we have not that loyalty and co-operation from the masses of the people that we ought to have.  I refer now to the plain people who are hard hit.  If you are talking about national defence, you must take into consideration supplying the people with food and clothing and shelter and taking them into your confidence.  That would be a much more effective defence than talking vaguely, confusing the people's minds, and neglecting to inspire the necessary confidence in them.  It is quite probable that our Ministers are a bit too far away from the people to realise what they are talking or thinking about.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of vague talk about the indifference of the people as to what nation is likely to invade us. I have heard many views expressed by good, honest people, who are prepared to fight for their freedom and stand against any invader.  Their minds are confused and they are unable to express themselves clearly because of the vagueness that is going on.  We have had speeches from Ministers and Deputies about the danger of invasion. We should be more frank in our statements, because the confusion that exists might be more dangerous than anything else.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that our national defence relies to a great extent on supporting our people in periods of discomfort and helping them in some progressive economic effort.  We are not asking for increased doles&mdash;I hate the word &ldquo;dole&rdquo;.  What we want to do is to try to capture the honesty and loyalty of the people who are prepared to fight for us in any emergency.</P>
    <P>We talk a lot about fifth columnists. I am inclined to say that there are certain fifth columnists already in this country, and they are much more serious than some of the fifth columnists our people talk about.  We should be more frank and definite in our statements about the invasion of the country.  I do not want any Minister to tell us that if one country invades our land another country might <Col N="1660" /> be tempted to do the same.  There is already an invasion of our country, and we should be frank enough to admit it. The people who talk about the freedom of small nations should withdraw from this country.</P>

      <P>During my 17 or 18 years experience in this House I cannot recollect any previous occasion when the Estimates for Government Departments were passed in such a short time.  I am sure the Government will recognise that that is due to the fact that in the present delicate international situation consideration of a kind never before extended to any Government here has been given.  I am sure the Government will recognise that the adoption of these Estimates in such a short time will make it possible for Ministers to give more attention to the work of their Departments than they have been able to give in other years. The necessity for giving more personal attention to departmental adminstration is apparent, and I hope the time saved in connection with the Estimates will give Ministers an opportunity to deal with the present problems that must be dealt with, apart from those connected with the international situation.</P>
      <P>The internal position of this country is not satisfactory, and I am sure the Taoiseach will not say it is.  The official figures would not enable him to say that the position, from the point of view of employment or unemployment, is better this year than it was last year, or two or three years ago. The discussion of the Estimates is the only opportunity members of Opposition Parties get to raise grievances which have not been dealt with in the ordinary departmental way.  I have raised matters here which I could not get settled through the medium of correspondence. I hardly ever raise a matter here that I have not previously put to a Department in the course of correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a genuine need for the speeding up of the administration of several Government Departments.  We have two or three thousand more civil servants at our disposal for that purpose than we had ten or 12 years <Col N="1661" /> ago.  I hope the facility given by Opposition Deputies here in enabling the discussions on the Estimates to be completed in such a short time will be properly appreciated by the Government and that representations made by Opposition Deputies will be more closely attended to and dealt with more expeditiously than similar matters were in the past.  I trust that is not an unfair request to make.  I have indicated that Ministers will have more time at their disposal to deal with Government matters, and matters affecting their own Departments.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Taoiseach that the internal position of the country would be reviewed and dealt with two or three times a week by a Cabinet sub-committee.  The necessity for doing so exists in my opinion.  I would like to see the position in regard to unemployment, and the reactions of the international situation, looked into by certain selected members of the Cabinet.  If that cannot be done, the only other way that these important matters can be dealt with is by the establishment of an economic council.  I do not want to provoke a discussion on that in the short time at my disposal.  For instance, I would like to feel that the financial position of this country, arising out of the passage recently of legislation in a neighbouring country, which is bound to have reactions here, was receiving the careful attention of Cabinet Ministers or departmental experts.  Nobody in this House or outside of it can foresee the consequences of the present international situation, and of its reactions, from a financial point of view, on the people of this State, even though we are not actually engaged in hostilities.</P>
    <P>We set up a Banking Commission six years ago to guide our Government on matters of internal financial policy. I hope that the recommendations in the Minority and Majority Reports of that commission will be reviewed and studied, as the situation develops.  We do not know what the Government policy is arising out of the report of that Banking Commission.  Other commissions have been set up here, the reports of which have been made <Col N="1662" /> available to the Government, or are in course of preparation.  These reports have a bearing on big questions like transport and drainage, matters that are bound to have an effect on our unemployment situation.  I would like to have it from the Taoiseach that the reports of these very important commissions are being studied, and that action will be taken, where action is necessary, arising out of their reactions on the international position.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter of very serious and pressing importance that I want to refer to.  It is the question of the control of the prices of the necessaries of life.  I want to say that I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the failure of the Government to use the powers which they possess to control the prices of the necessaries of life.  It would be far better to have this so-called Prices Commission abolished than allow it to remain in existence and carry on, as it has been carrying on, ineffectively, for some time past.  The policy of the Government is to keep down the rate of wages so far as it affects their own State employees, and to use their influence to keep down wages wherever their influence can be exercised in that direction.  That policy could be justified if, on the other hand, they paid as much attention to controlling the prices of the necessaries of life.  Ministers, as well as members of the House who have any knowledge of the conditions that prevail in the City of Dublin, know how costly the ordinary commodities are, and what an increase in the price of them has taken place since the outbreak of war.  Would any farmer Deputy, on any side of the House, get up and say that people who charge 6d. a head for cabbage in the City of Dublin are justified in doing so?  I can prove that that price has been charged to poor people in the City of Dublin, while at the same time I know that the farmers in the County Dublin who produce and sell that cabbage through the Dublin market are getting less than a 1d. per head for it.  That is the kind of activity that has got to be controlled in this city and through the country.  Otherwise, there will be a reaction that will possibly have very <Col N="1663" /> serious consequences.  Other commodities could be mentioned, the prices of which may not have been increased as much as the price of vegetables, and in respect of which profiteering has not been carried on to the same extent.  I want an assurance from the Taoiseach that these matters, affecting the daily lives of our people, will be dealt with more effectively than they have been since the outbreak of war.</P>
    <P>I said that there was delay in dealing with certain departmental matters which is the cause of unnecessary correspondence, so far as Deputies from all Parties are concerned.  I need only quote the undue delay and the irritating way in which claims for military service pensions are being dealt with. The Taoiseach, and I quite agree with him, appealed to the people of this State to increase three-fold, if possible, the output of turf as compared with what it was last year.  Does he know that the failure of the Land Commission to acquire and divide bogs is the explanation of the limited production of turf in the country?  Does he know, for instance, that most of our bogs in the midland areas are owned by landlords, or bog owners, who live on the letting of turf, and that, therefore the people who are anxious to increase the production of turf for sale in our provincial towns cannot do so?  They cannot do so because the Land Commission is too lazy to do its own job, or does it in such a way as to prevent the appeal made by the Taoiseach being responded to in a proper manner.  I would ask the Taoiseach to look into the working of some of the Government Departments, to speed up administration, and to keep a careful and watchful eye over the internal situation in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters that I want to draw attention to.  The first is the necessity for ship repairing facilities in Cork Harbour in connection with the dockyard either at Haulbowline, Rushbrooke or some other part of the harbour.  The necessity for that is apparent to anybody who knows anything about the accommodation in Cork Harbour, and the facilities there for bringing in ships. There are no facilities for doing repairs, and that is a very keenly felt want in the area.  I would also like to raise generally the question of a mercantile marine.  The necessity for that is all the greater now that freights and freightage charges are so excessive.  I do not think it is too late, even now, to set about the purchase of some ships in which the commodities required here could be transported.  The expenditure would, I think, repay itself because of the very high freights that are now being charged for the carriage of goods.  Perhaps the Taoiseach, in his capacity as head of the Government, would seriously look into that, and let the House and the country know what are the chances for such an undertaking.  These are the only matters I want to raise.</P>

      <P>Can I be a prophet? Can the people in Switzerland say what is going to happen to them, or can the people in Sweden say?  The fact is that we are a small country, <Col N="1665" /> and that it may suit one of the belligerents to attack us.  The simple question for us is to put ourselves in such a position of defence as will make the attack a costly affair: if all goes to all to put ourselves in the position of being able to defend our liberties as best we can.  Is not that clear enough? The Deputy says &ldquo;predict for us definitely what is going to happen&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, anyone who wants to get an excuse can say that. What would have happened the people in Switzerland if somebody were to get up there and say: &ldquo;The Government is vague; it does not tell us whether we are going to be attacked from the north, south, east or west; we want to know who is to attack us&rdquo;?  What would be the present position of the people in Switzerland if the people there had been talking like that?  The fact is that the people in Switzerland have known for years that though they are in a position of neutrality, yet they must protect themselves by spending their resources in getting their man-power into a position to protect them.  They are in the position in which they are to-day, because they took those measures in time. Nobody in Switzerland said: &ldquo;We will not take any measures against A, but we will take measures against B and C.&rdquo;  The Swiss people are in the position in which they are to-day simply because they are well armed, and are determined to defend their neutrality against all comers.  They would not be in that position now if they had a section of their people saying: &ldquo;I am interested in one country; you are interested in another country and you in a third.&rdquo;  Because we cannot make up our minds as to which particular country is going to attack us, then we are to do nothing. Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody who does not wilfully blind himself can say that we are well out of the war zone, or that we can be sure that it would not suit any of the belligerents to interfere <Col N="1666" /> with the liberties which we claim to be ours.  These are liberties which we can only hold if we are prepared to defend them.  How can I make it clearer?  I am not a prophet.  Neither can I try to hide the fact that the whole national territory is not under the control of this Government.  That is not the way to look at the problem. Partition did not happen since the war began.  It exists, and we have to try to get rid of it, but we are not going to get rid of it by losing the independence we have here, or by stupidly refusing to take proper measures to defend ourselves.</P>
    <P>Those who were here 20 or 25 years ago, and those old enough to know the efforts made to secure the freedom we have, will appreciate what I am saying. The freedom we have was not taken as the final ultimate thing, but as a basis to get the freedom of the whole country.  Are we to keep that now? Because I do not tell from what direction we are going to be attacked, the Deputy complains.  The fact is that we are going to put ourselves in a position to meet the attack from whatever quarter it may come.  Those of us who have to choose a policy or to adopt the particular measures to be taken, have to judge as best we can how we are to meet the attack from any quarter, and to deal with it.  We will meet the attack from any particular quarter, and especially from where it is most expected and most likely to come.  I am afraid I cannot go more fully into the matter.  If there is anybody who still wants to go on saying it is vague and indefinite, and that it is not going to happen in this country, I can only say this: that last September, when the war broke out, I was convinced that we would require to build up our forces if we were to keep ourselves free and to keep our country safe from the ravages of war.  At that time I had only an opinion.  But now I say, look at the map of Europe to-day and see what is happening there, and see what part our island might play, and then ask ourselves if there is no reason for anxiety and if there is no reason to get ourselves into a state of defence with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> With regard to the question of the publication of certain matters, it would be very much better if Deputies were to come to me or some other responsible person and make private inquiries. They could approach those members of their own Parties who are taking part in the Defence Conference. But the person who uses the privileges of this House to talk publicly about certain matters is not acting in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the economic side I want to tell Deputies that they cannot feel any more than I and other members of the Government do about these questions of social and economic difficulties that have arisen in our time. These are difficulties that each and every country in the world have been baffled with, and there has been no definite solution anywhere except a solution which brings evils of another kind. We have been trying to deal with these economic questions by building up industries. Since this war began it was obvious that our difficulties would increase sevenfold.  Our whole trade situation may be upset a great deal more than it is.  Naturally the Government are considering by what methods we can tide our people over these circumstances. Our economic side is part of our national defence, and we have to attend to it from day to day.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Unemployment Assistance, (Third Employment Period) Order, <Col N="1668" /> 1940, made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 24th day of May, 1940, and presented to Dáil Eireann on the 30th day of May, 1940, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    <P>It is with very sincere regret that I find it necessary to move this motion asking to have annulled the Third Employment Period Order.  Following as it does Period Orders 1 and 2, if taken cumulatively, this practically means the wiping out from vast sections of the people the benefits conferred on them by the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933.  The first of these orders, as we know, has taken benefits away from people in rural areas&mdash;from single men, widowers without dependants and people with a valuation of £4 and over.</P>
    <P>These Orders have been resisted in the House by the Labour Party each time they were introduced as being an unwarranted interference with that section of the community who most need the help and assistance of the State and who were given that assistance by an Act placed on the Statute Book, only to be toyed with year after year by a stroke of the Minister's pen in the shape of an Unemployment Period Order.  But certainly the extreme limit was reached when Period Order No. 3 came to be introduced in the year 1940, beyond all years, at a time when it is the desire of everybody to have co-operation and contentment, when appeals are being made from every platform and from the Government Benches to have a united front so as to pull together to try to tide the country over the serious times in which we are and the much more serious times that seem to be lying ahead. That is the time selected to strike off married men with families from the benefits of the Unemployment Assistance Act in nearly all the rural areas. In fact, outside of the municipal and urban towns and some small scheduled areas in the country districts, the entire country is affected by this Period Order.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that Order of the Government would be stupid at any time, that it would be perfectly unjustified <Col N="1669" /> and unwarranted, but that in present circumstances it is criminally stupid and, in its effect, will be calculated to defeat the best intentions of those who are trying to rally and consolidate the people in a solid phalanx. What can be the reaction to appeals for co-operation of married men with families, who it is not suggested have got work, and who have been enjoying, if you like to use the word, this miserable pittance for the past few years, trying to keep body and soul together on a maximum of 14/- per week, no matter how many children they may have?  Whether they have one, two, three or ten children, outside the scheduled areas set out in the Order they are to be deprived of any State benefit whatever.  They will have to live somehow.  No effort has been made to provide work for them.  The previous Government did not attempt to cater for the unemployed.  They said it was not their job, that it was the function of the private employer. The Fianna Fáil Government changed that dictum in response to the appeals of the Labour Party in 1933, and they implemented their promise by the passing of the Unemployment Assistance Act, setting out definitely that they believed that citizens of the country were entitled to have work provided for them, and that until such work was provided they were entitled to a maintenance allowance.  A certain meagre, miserable standard was set up which was never intended, according to Government spokesmen themselves, to be a living wage standard, but merely to tide the people over between one period of unemployment and another.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the plan for absorbing the people into employment never materialised.  The problem has grown bigger and the only action that the Government take is to slow down year after year their progressive action of 1933, until we find the depths of retrogression reached in 1940.  They seem to have regretted ever having been so progressive as to pass this legislation, and the method of administration adopted is sufficient evidence of that.  It is hedged round with all kinds of provisions to ensure that there will not be any nefarious practices carried on, that <Col N="1670" /> the State funds are adequately protected and safeguarded.  To that we have no objection.</P>
    <P>But, on top of the necessary safeguards that one could reasonably agree to, they have had recourse to what I have protested against over and over again in this House, the anonymous letter system.  This is the only Department I know of that accepts anonymous letters without question and allows them to be the medium for robbing men of unemployment assistance. On receipt of one of these letters signed &ldquo;Captain Moonlight&rdquo; or something like that, it is the duty of the labour exchange manager to deprive a recipient of unemployment assistance of any further money without further investigation.  Subsequent investigation may prove the man to have been wronged by this anonymous scribe, but months may elapse before unemployment assistance is restored to that man and his family.  I mention that to show that, in addition to the investigations made by the officers of the Department and the Gárda Síochána, we also have these anonymous letter writers, who we have been told from the Ministerial Benches here are not going to be discarded, as they are a very useful and fruitful source for protecting State funds.  With all its elaborate machinery to protect State funds and give effect to an Act of Parliament which was intended to see that nobody should get benefit who was not entitled to get it, what is the justification for the introduction of this Third Period Order, with its scheduled area covering a territory running mainly down the west coast?</P>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage to ascertain the number of people directly affected by this order, but I think I am safe in saying that the number of men affected will be between 30,000 and 40,000.  If we estimate that each of these is responsible for three dependants, we have immediately between 120,000 and 160,000 people who are to be given no benefit from this until the end of October next.  They have to go somewhere for assistance.  They have to go to the home assistance officer.  There is quite sufficient strain at present on <Col N="1671" /> the rating authorities, and the amount they are capable of giving in the way of relief is hopelessly inadequate.</P>
    <P>I have a letter here&mdash;one of many of the same kind&mdash;which is by no means congratulatory, and I would not like to read it in full.  It is from a poor man living within three miles of Limerick, at a place called Coonagh. He says that he is the father of four children&mdash;one five years old, one two years old, and twins six weeks old. He has been struck off unemployment assistance, and says that he has to go to the dispensary for home assistance, and is only getting 9/- per week.  He points out how he has been struggling to exist on 14/- a week unemployment assistance.  There is no work in his locality.  He cannot get work in the City of Limerick, because the schemes there are required for the relief of people in the city, where we have considerably more than 4,000 unemployed, and are at our wits' end to provide relief schemes for them.  This man and others like him who are outside the borough cannot get employment in the city, and there is no work in the county for them.</P>
    <P>Without any investigation whatever, and regardless of the consequences, the Minister by his Order strikes off between 120,000 and 160,000 persons, and compels them to live without any assistance whatever so far as State funds are concerned.  If you average the income from this assistance at 10/- a week, on that basis, possibly £300,000 is going to be saved.  That seems to be giving further expression to the desire of Ministers and the Government to get away from the progressive legislation they passed in 1933, for which they earned certain encomiums.  Having departed from the practice that hitherto obtained they now seem to want to get back to the position of having no responsibility for unemployment.  That £300,000 is not going to be saved to the State.  It means that £300,000 is going to be withdrawn from circulation in rural areas by poor people who were living on what has been mis-called the dole. The money will be withdrawn from circulation amongst shopkeepers and <Col N="1672" /> others, while the people who were dependent on it will have to go some place else to get assistance.  The rates will have to come to the rescue.</P>
    <P>The rating authorities outside municipal and urban areas have not been touched so far.  At present municipal and urban authorities have been subscribing generously to the Government in order to help to meet the charge on the Central Fund, but the rural areas have not been called upon to do so.  It looks as if they will be called upon to do so now.  Viewing the matter from every angle, I consider this to be the most indefensible and stupid action taken since the Government came into office.  There seems to have been nothing but utter disregard for the serious situation in which we find ourselves.  From expressions of opinion I heard in Cork, Limerick and Kerry, counties which I have visited since the order was made, I never heard a more genuine outburst of indignation than at this period order.  I listened with patience to hear what explanation the Minister had for his action.  I am satisfied that he will not give a satisfactory explanation now. He may build a barrier around the question, but I am satisfied there is no satisfactory explanation, having regard to the fact that our unemployment problem to-day is as serious as it is. The period order was put into operation for the first time in February this year.  It was put back to coincide with the new summer time.</P>
    <P>The order generally came into force in March, but it came into force in February this year to coincide with summer time, and we were glibly told that the figures of unemployment had been reduced from 117,000 to 85,000. As a matter of fact, they were not reduced, but there was a transfer of names from one side of the labour exchange to another.  That does not put food into the stomachs of hungry children.  The people affected have not been employed.  Their only consolation now is that the married men with their families can go where they like, and the devil take the hindmost.  We will probably be told, arising out of the fuel shortage, that they can get plenty of <Col N="1673" /> work on the bogs.  I was on the bogs in Kerry last Monday, and I had discussions with some of the people affected by this order.  Those who are on the bogs cannot eat turf.  It is no substitute to give them freedom to roam the bogs and to cut turf and make that an excuse for withdrawing the miserable pittance they got to keep their wives and families alive.  Can they be blamed if they are accused of lack of patriotism, or if they suggest that it did not matter to them who came to rule this country, because they could not be in a worse position?</P>
    <P>This seems to be the last straw, and the Government's indication of having no mercy for citizens who should be as much entitled to consideration as the biggest merchants.  They only ask the right to live.  They are prepared to work if work is provided.  No work is available, and if it were available the machinery of the Act would prevent them drawing benefit.  If that is the case what is the necessity for this period order?  Either there is work for the people or there is not.  If there is work they will not draw the dole.  If there is not work is the Minister prepared on behalf of the Government to condemn these people to exist on the wind, by withdrawing from them a right granted by a majority of the House, and that should be as sacred as any legislation that was passed by it?  It is not going to create respect for our laws if legislation dealing with one section can be terminated to suit Ministers every time there is a fad fictitiously to save £300,000.  But the £300,000 will not be saved.  It is being stolen in the worst possible fashion, and will create dissension, discord and ill-will at a time when appeals are being made for a united front to harmonise all our forces to do what is best for the nation in the period we are passing through. I ask the House to assert its authority so that there should be more respect for legislation passed by it, and to give an answer to the Minister in the only effective way it can be given, by annulling this order by a vote of the House.</P>
    <P>The annulment will have this effect, that the 130,000 people dependent on <Col N="1674" /> the 30,000 or 40,000 persons affected by the order, will bless the men who vote to give them assistance to which they had a God-given right.  If the Minister wants to test the feelings of the House, as a gesture of the unity shown by all Parties, I ask if he is prepared to take off the Whips, and to allow a free vote of all Parties. I believe that even in the Fianna Fáil ranks the resentment against this order is as keen as it is amongst Deputies in other Parties.  Of course, members of the Government Party are bound by Party ties, and the Minister will scarcely agree to the suggestion to take off the Whips but, as a matter of duty, if there is any sincerity in the talk about concord and unity, it is up to him to allow the House, which was responsible for this legislation, to have a free vote to determine whether or not that legislation will be treated with contempt and contumely.  If that is done I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister will not get half a dozen to support him in this nefarious proposal and that the order will be annulled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I do not think this is a Party matter at all, but that the Minister is viewing it in a different light.  The fact is that we have had already two unemployment period orders.  The Minister will agree that during the two years 31,000 unemployed people were taken off the official register and put on to another.  I have some idea of the position in the rural areas.  The Minister made an order taking off 31,000 people who were unable to find employment, but a number of them have been put on the home assistance register in the Cork area, where the position is a peculiar one as far as the period order is concerned. There appears to be evidence that the Minister did not consult experienced officers in the Cork Labour Exchange. If there was any consultation with these officers, it is surprising what an effect this order had in Cork.  We have over 2,000 houses built outside the city area, the tenants of which are drawn from the city.  I am informed that at least 200 people will be cut off benefit by this order who up to now were <Col N="1675" /> receiving 14/-.  In the case of those with five in family they received a maximum of 14/- which was supplemented by 8/- from the home assistance authorities.  Under the period order these people will lose the 14/- they got from the labour exchange and will have to depend on home assistance.  If the Minister had consulted the responsible officers in the labour exchange he would find that in districts like Blackrock, Douglas and Ballincolling a number of workers had the sad experience of having to depend for the past two years on what they got from the rates.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to look upon this as a Party matter. We are not looking upon it as a Party matter.  I wish to state definitely that there has been a very serious reaction. In Cork area on last Monday night there was a little demonstration by some of those people and there was a question from some of them when they invaded the corporation at Tuesday's meeting.  A resolution was passed there asking the Minister to annul the order.  There is no reason in the world why some of those people should get unemployment assistance if they could get work on the land.  They could be taken from the labour exchange.  It is not fair to cut them off when there is no work for them. It means cutting off men with large families without any notice.  I appeal to the Minister to annual the order until some serious consideration can be given to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For more reasons than one I am asking that.  I think it happened at a very wrong period.  If someone came along to try to create discord, he could not come at a more opportune period.  I do not agree that it should be treated as a Party matter.  Deputies from the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Benches, when they look into it, will also agree with the appeal that I make in all seriousness to the Minister to annual the order, until there is some serious investigation into the matter. The Taoiseach has spoken about the need for gaining the confidence of those people.  There is a request for co-operation and for assistance in <Col N="1676" /> national defence, but there cannot be co-operation of the people in general while they are being treated in that fashion without consideration for their circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have had a serious problem in the Cork area for some time.  People are not able to pay the rent of the new houses and now, because of the Employment Period Order, we had a demonstration in Cork last Tuesday night.  These things are not a help and only create discontent.  Certain elements will thrive on that.  I second Deputy Keyes and I appeal to the Minister&mdash;without considering the question of securing political points&mdash;to annual the order until such time as serious consideration has been given to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion which has been proposed by Deputy Keyes and seconded by Deputy Hickey.  I do so more particularly because I have a very definite mandate from the board of assistance, of which both Deputy Hickey and I are members, to do everything in our power to have this order annulled.  The amount passed for home assistance in Cork has gone up enormously, due entirely to the increase in the cost of living and to the larger amounts which had to be given to those who are applicants for home assistance and who are not eligible for unemployment assistance, or where the amount that has been given to them is inadequate to sustain those who are unfortunate enough to have to appeal for assistance. At a time when the cost of living has mounted up rapidly, it is an act of positive cruelty to deprive these men of what they have been looking upon &mdash;I suppose, once legislation has been passed&mdash;as a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To deprive them suddenly of what they had hitherto looked upon as a means of livelihood is a species of cruelty which I, at any rate, regard as uncalled for from the members of what is looked upon as a democratic Government. Whatever may be the views of certain people with regard to unemployment assistance, there is no question <Col N="1677" /> that the money is being spent again amongst the community.  Those who are shopkeepers and traders, at any rate, get the benefit of that particular sum, and it is not a sum lost to the country, as apparently seems to be the idea of those who have stopped this allowance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has referred to the difficulty these people have in paying their rents.  The same thing applies to South Cork Board of Health, where the members are the same as that on the board of assistance.  The people are being given houses &ldquo;fit for human beings to live in&rdquo;, and of a nature that both the boards of health and the Government have set up as a very high standard.  These people are being given this class of house to live in, and at the same time they have no means of livelihood to enjoy them and are forced to fall back on the home assistance board to give them what the board itself looks upon as the duty of the Government to give.  Once you have conferred a privilege or a certain benefit upon the community, to withdraw that benefit is worse than if you never gave that benefit at all.  On an occasion when the Government is coming into office, or on any other particular occasion, the standard of the community may be raised by certain payments.  Where they withdraw those payments, they are doing something worse than if they had never given them and are inflicting a greater measure of cruelty.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance referred to the diminishing schemes for unemployment works. After all, does not that imply that the men who would benefit by those schemes must fall back on unemployment assistance?  To pass a small vote for that, and cut them off from benefit on the other hand and throw them back on the rates&mdash;which are mounting as rapidly as they possibly can, until they have reached an unbearable figure at the present moment&mdash;means the community is suffering, apart altogether from the still greater suffering on these people.</P>
    <P>There is no question at all about it: I think all the Cork Deputies, and certainly the citizens of Cork City and <Col N="1678" /> Cork County, are at one in this matter, in resenting the action of the Minister in cutting off this unemployment assistance to married men, particularly in cases where they have large families. It means that an undue degree of suffering is going to obtain, where there are people who cannot get work at the present time.  Unemployment, undoubtedly, is diminishing at the present time and the obligation rests on the Government to maintain at least the most helpless class of its citizens.  I am at one with the Labour Party, and I am sure every Party in this House is at one with me, in asking to have this order annulled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said by Deputies Keyes, Hickey and Brasier.  I look upon this as a colossal blunder, in so far as the action of the Government is concerned.  It appears to me to be an indiscriminate action, without any thought at all having been given to the effect of the order when it is put into operation. Within recent times, when the cost of life necessities has been soaring, this Party were looking forward to the Government giving an increase in unemployment benefit, not only in the rural areas but also in the city areas. Now we find ourselves confronted with a situation whereby married men in rural areas are being taken off unemployment assistance altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out by the three Deputies who have spoken, it is very hard to understand the Government at this juncture.  At the moment, an appeal is being made by the Government for co-operation.  That appeal has been answered by the various Parties in this House, with the result that to-day we have the people united in an effort to protect the country, if it should be in any danger in months to come.  How does the Government expect to get the co-operation of the people in the rural areas, when by a stroke of the pen they are taking their names off the unemployment register? I have heard it said over the week-end that in so far as this action is concerned, the Government are deliberately doing this in order to <Col N="1679" /> force people to join the Army.  That is a feeling that is in the country&mdash;one that is being broadcast&mdash;and that is what is being said by the unfortunate people whom the Minister has decided to leave without unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has referred to the effect that this will have upon certain people living on the outskirts of Cork City.  That particular situation applies in various urban areas in Ireland.  At the meeting of the board of health in County Wexford on Monday last a deputation was received, pointing out that because of the fact that this order was being put into operation, they of necessity had to seek home help from the board.  The board of health are faced with the situation now that they have to try to maintain those people who have been taken off the unemployment register by the Minister.  Practically all these people are living on the outskirts of the town and are town workers.  They know nothing, good, bad or indifferent, about agricultural work, even if there was agricultural work there to be done.  While employed, they had been occupied in doing the work of builders' labourers, carters and work of the kind usually found in towns.  I should like the Minister to let us know what steps were taken to ascertain whether there was work in the rural areas for these people or not.  Has any application been made by farmers to the labour exchanges to know whether labour is available for them or not?  Surely it would be time enough for the Minister to take action of this kind if farmers had made application to the labour exchanges and it was found that no labour was available.</P>
    <P>Within the last few weeks we had a Budget statement from the Minister for Finance.  No reference was made in that Budget statement which would lead anybody to infer that such measures as the Government now propose to carry into operation were contemplated. Surely if the Government had anything like that in their minds at that time, it would be only proper that the Government should take the House into their confidence so as to <Col N="1680" /> enable the House to make proper financial provision for unemployment assistance if they did not think that the provision made in the Budget was sufficient to cater for the needs of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the deputation that came before the Wexford County Board of Health on Monday last. These men are living in new houses erected by the board of health, immediately outside the town of Enniscorthy.  As I said before, they have always been town workers.  Some of them were taken out of the town and put into these houses.  Their rent is 3/6 per week and now they find themselves without any money at all to meet that rent.  Three and six pence a week is a high rent for a man who has a weekly wage; 3/6d.  a week is high enough, in all conscience, for a man who has 14/- a week; but 3/6d. a week for a man who has no income at all is an impossible proposition and I think the Minister ought to realise that.  As I pointed out before, you are asking for unity and co-operation.  How can you expect co-operation from these people, how can you expect co-operation from people whom you ignore&mdash; I think it is only right to say that when we take this order into consideration &mdash;people about whom you do not care whether they get food or not or whether they have money to pay their rent or not?  By a stroke of the pen, you take them off the unemployment assistance register.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the mind that conceived this step at all.  In normal times it would be bad enough, but it is a colossal blunder at this particular period.  Thousands of men in this country are waiting to see how this motion will go.  Hungry children to-night are praying that the order may be annualled by the Dáil.  I appeal, therefore, to every member of the House, no matter to what Party he belongs, to support this motion, to ask the Minister, from all parts of the House, to annul the order, and to prevent the Government from making this colossal blunder which, to my mind, will react very unfavourably on the spirit of unity that now prevails amongst all sections in the country.</P>
    <Col N="1681" />
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion.  I must say that I was completely mystified when I heard that this order was issued.  I cannot understand the purpose of the order. I do not believe anybody with any conception of the state of unemployment in the country and the condition of the people who have to live on unemployment assistance could approve of this order.  The very callousness of this order is something beyond realisation.  As Deputy Hickey stated, the matter was brought up at a meeting of the Cork Corporation last Tuesday evening and a motion was passed asking that the order be annulled.  That motion was passed on the proposition of a Fianna Fáil member.  I was told that that Fianna Fáil member was very active when he learned that the order was being put into operation, trying to get in touch with the Minister.  I think he got in touch with the Minister and also got in touch with local Deputies in an effort to see that the order would not be enforced.  I am sure, as Deputy Corish has stated, that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are equally resentful in regard to the operation of this order.  There is no doubt that the position before the order was issued was a very serious one so far as people who were in receipt of unemployment assistance were concerned.  That was apparent to anybody who has contact with the people unemployed in the different areas.  You have heard from members of the Labour Party and also from Deputy Brasier of the Fine Gael Party, of the position that existed before the order was issued and of how the meagre amount allowed in unemployment assistance had to be supplemented from the local rates.  The position now is that the local rates will have to bear the whole burden of the maintenance of these people.  That position can be realised by anybody who has contact with the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resentment that has arisen in the minds of these people is startling.  To give an example of it, last week while I was away an unemployed man called to my house looking for me and he was in a very resentful mood as I was not there to hear his case.  He seemed to have the idea that I should have been <Col N="1682" /> there to hear what he had to say.  When he found that I was not there, he did not want to tell the person who met him what his business was, but he stated that very soon Hitler would be here and everything would be all right. It was pointed out to him that that was a rather serious statement to make, but that, perhaps, he did not realise it. He said that he did not mind, that he had a wife and seven children hungry at home, and that even though Hitler might take away the children from him, they would be fed in any case, whilst they were hungry here.  That is the feeling that is abroad in the country. I do not want to make any alarmist statements but the unemployed people have already been very badly hit by the increased cost of living.  On top of that we have now this order put into operation. Surely the Minister cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, suggest that all these people will be absorbed in any kind of employment?  The employment is not there.</P>
    <P>We had as the slogan of the present Government Party in 1932 and 1933, and even at the last election, that everybody would be provided with work or with maintenance until work was provided. The work is not there and now the maintenance or partial maintenance that had been given to them is to be cut off.  Surely that is not fulfilling the pledge they gave to the people of the country and upon which they got such a very large measure of support?  I do not know whether it is better to express the indignation that one feels at an order such as this or to appeal to the Minister's good sense to withdraw the order and to devise some other means of raising whatever money may be needed.  I take it that is the principal reason for the order, to save whatever money would be involved in the payment of unemployment assistance to these people.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this to the Minister: is it seriously suggested that, by the operation of the order, the people who are affected by it will be able to get employment?  Is that seriously suggested to the House because otherwise it means that these people are told to go and starve?  The home assistance authorities will find it very <Col N="1683" /> difficult to make provision for them and therefore the alternative is starvation.</P>
    <P>Now, the position referred to by Deputy Hickey with regard to the Cork City area is a very peculiar one. It is a matter that I heard raised in this House on each occasion on which this Employment Order for single men came in.  The position is that numbers of city workers, people who lived under bad and slum conditions in the city, were shifted out to new houses that were built outside the city boundary, and because of that change the single men were immediately affected by this Employment Order. Now, the married men in that area will also be affected, but by no stretch of imagination could you regard these people as agricultural workers.  They never had any contact with agricultural work, and that the Government recognised that they were not agricultural workers is evidenced by the fact that they are eligible for work on the city schemes in Cork City for the relief of unemployment.  I ask: is it because of the change that the space within the city boundary is so circumscribed and there is a scarcity of building grounds, and these people have to go outside the city to live, that they are classed as agricultural workers the moment they go out?  Surely, that does not make sense.  When they lived under bad conditions in the city they were city workers, but the moment they are decently housed outside the city they become agricultural workers.  Will the Minister tell the House how these people are to get work or to get maintenance when they are deprived of unemployment assistance?</P>
    <P>Deputy Brasier told the House of the way in which the home assistance authorities had to subsidise these married people, with families, in order to bring their means of sustenance up to something approaching a level that would just provide them with the bare necessaries of life.  The operation of this order means that all sustenance will be definitely reduced to nil unless the home assistance authorities take pity on these people and give them the charity of their assistance.  I have <Col N="1684" /> stressed this matter of the unemployed workers around the city area, and that happens also in Blackrock and Douglas and around the Glasheen area.  These people are not agricultural workers, and even if that work were available they are not people who are suitable for agricultural work because they have never been accustomed to it.</P>
    <P>Even in the agricultural areas, the unemployed in those areas cannot get work because there is no work available or any extra work, even with the farmers, at this time of year.  Then you have the rigorous means test that is imposed in order to qualify for unemployment assistance, and that clearly proves that work is not available in those areas.  Without any regard to that, however, or without any case being made for the Unemployment Period Order, it is put into operation in one fell swoop.  That, I think, is the greatest hardship of the whole thing.  We did not hear of this order being put into operation or coming into operation until late last week, and it was to come into operation on the 5th June.  Therefore, it looks as if the whole thing were put through in a kind of secret fashion so that the public would not become aware of it until it was actually in operation.  That, I think, shows that the Minister even was not very much enamoured with the putting into operation of this order.</P>
    <P>The speeches that have been delivered from these benches are speeches from people who have actual contact with those who will be affected by this order.  They are not in any way alarmist speeches.  They are giving the picture as it actually is.  I wish to join in the appeal that is being made to the Minister not to put this order into operation, but to annul it and give the unemployed the little assistance that they were getting under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  As was pointed out, there is all the greater reason at this particular time for not putting the order into operation, because there is definitely a lot of resentment and a feeling of unrest amongst the unemployed in this country. Therefore, I join with the other speakers in appealing to the Minister <Col N="1685" /> and I ask the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to join with us in asking the Minister to annul this order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, Sir, that some of the Deputies who have spoken have forgotten that, when the Unemployment Assistance Act was going through this House, it was indicated that one of the great difficulties which we had in framing proposals which we could stand over in the Dáil arose in relation to the provision which might be made for men who, although they would be unemployed in the rural areas during certain slack seasons, might, nevertheless, be expected to find work available for them during the busy seasons in agriculture.  That difficulty was very largely an administrative one.  When we are dealing with unemployment assistance recipients in urban areas we have a check&mdash;it may not be a perfect check but, at any rate, it is some safeguard against abuse&mdash;in the fact that people sign on at the employment exchanges day after day and that it is not easy for them to claim benefit when, in fact, they may be employed.  In the rural areas the difficulty is greater.  You cannot ask people to walk a long distance every day to sign on, and, as well as that, the opportunities for securing employment surreptitiously are very much greater.  Accordingly, it was quite clearly indicated, when the Unemployment Assistance Act was being put through the House, that one of the basic assumptions upon which the Act was going to be administered was this: That during certain months of the year there would be employment available in the country areas, and that we proposed, for that reason, to say that during that period, certain classes&mdash;in fact, in regard to certain districts, practically every man, whether married or otherwise would be assumed to be in a position to get employment, if, in fact, he really wanted it.  That, I say, was the basic assumption underlying the whole of the Unemployment Assistance Act, that during the months of the summer and the harvest, there would be in the rural districts in Ireland employment available for any <Col N="1686" /> man, married or single, who was in fact looking for it.  I am not going to say that that assumption holds good in 100 per cent. of the cases.  I am not going to say that, but we had to proceed on that principle, because otherwise it would be quite impossible to apply to the rural areas an Act of this sort, so easily subject to abuse, so costly&mdash;because it is a very costly Act&mdash;it costs £1,500,000, and it does not matter whether that money is provided out of the Exchequer, or whether some portion of it is taken from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, or whether some portion of it is contributed by the local authorities&mdash;the Unemployment Assistance Act does cost in round figures&mdash; and I am speaking now without the Estimates&mdash;£1,500,000 a year, and with these two facts in front of us it would, I say, have been quite impossible for the Government of the day to have contemplated the introduction of this Act, and its application to rural unemployment, unless they were quite prepared to use this machinery of the Employment Period Order freely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the Act having been passed, I think, in 1934, and the years 1935, 1936, 1937 and, if you like, part of 1938, being years during which agriculture was greatly handicapped in this country and when the normal amount of agricultural employment might be presumed not to be available, the Employment Period Orders machinery was not operated to the same extent as it was expected would be the case when the Act was first submitted to the House.  But those special conditions have passed.  We are no longer confronted with the fact that our agricultural production going into Great Britain is taxed or is subject, as it was then, to undue quota restriction.  We have now, as compared with 1934 and 1935, a comparatively free export market for our agricultural produce.  When I say that, I do not want to be taken as saying that it is a market which is entirely satisfactory to this country but I do say that, taking it by and large, it is, in the farmer's point of view and the producer's point of view a better market and a more attractive market than in 1934, 1935 and 1936. Proceeding on that basis, it is reasonable <Col N="1687" /> to assume that our farmers, being normally anxious to avail to the utmost of that market, are going to expand their production.  They did expand their production.  I think that production was greater in 1938 than it was in 1937, 1936, or 1935, and if they are going to expand production voluntarily, naturally, there is going to be an increased demand for labour in these rural areas over and above what there was during the periods when the Employment Period Orders did not cover such long intervals of time as this one does, and did not apply to all classes of rural labour in those areas where employment might be expected to be available.</P>
    <P>The condition is changing now, as I have said.  The producer has the incentive to increase his production voluntarily in order that he may supply the increased demand of the export market.  Those of them who wish to cultivate beet or wheat have further inducements to grow these crops, one, by reason of the fact that there is a much better price for beet and wheat available than there was previously, and the second, by reason of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture has passed an order compelling farmers to till a certain proportion of their land.  For those reasons, in addition to the other which I have mentioned, it is again reasonable to assume&mdash;and it is upon the basis of reasonable assumption that we must proceed in this matter&mdash;that there is going to be increased employment available in the country areas, and I am so advised by the Department concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 31,000 cut off already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but I am only dealing with the one aspect of this problem and that is the fact, that it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be increased employment and there is, in fact, increased employment in certain of the rural areas because, remember, this order does not apply to every rural district in Ireland&mdash;I will deal with that aspect of it later&mdash;but it does apply to those areas in this country which are suitable for tillage, where the land is good and <Col N="1688" /> where there is every reason to believe that there will be increased agricultural production during this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, we have the development of turbary.  I know Deputy Davin's views on that.  He has expressed them.  I agree that perhaps in the case of privately-owned bogs there may be some impediment in the way of the full development of our peat deposits in the country during the present year. But it would be a mistake to assume that the larger part of the bogs of this country, the bogs which might be available for an increased production of turf, are in private ownership.  They are not.  The Land Commission, as the Deputy himself has told me, are perhaps the largest owners of turbary in this country and the Land Commission, in conjunction with the Turf Development Board, are taking steps to make turbary available for those who may wish to cut it and who, in cutting it, will provide employment either for themselves or for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know&mdash;and as a matter of fact, we have had it discussed here in this House&mdash;that the Turf Development Board have had difficulty in getting a sufficient number of workers to work the bogs which at the present moment they are developing.  In fact, the position has become such that in some cases they are offering free transport and bringing men from many miles away in order to work on these bogs. The activities of the Turf Development Board are not confined to one county in this country.  Their activities are spread over a number of counties but they have the same experience every where, that they find it difficult in those areas where there are peat deposits to get workers.  What am I to assume from that?  What conclusion am I to draw from that except this, that, apart altogether from the individuals who might be engaged in the ordinary agricultural operations, there is a shortage of rural labour in a certain number of counties covered by this order, in which there happen to be bogs available for exploitation.  I cannot proceed on any other assumption than that in the light of the facts that are submitted to me.  Then again I know, though the details are not yet available&mdash;they <Col N="1689" /> will be available, I am sure, before the period covered by this order elapses&mdash;that the Department of Agriculture is working on a scheme for assisting farm improvements, and has, I am sure, brought it almost to completion.  They have informed me that they hope soon to make the details public.  They are working on a scheme of farm improvements which they anticipate is going to absorb a very large proportion of any surplus that may be available in the rural areas.  I am talking now on the assumption, which I do not accept, that in fact there is any large surplus of labour unemployed and available in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>I am talking on that assumption.  It is not one which I accept for a reason which I will put to the House in a moment but, on the assumption that there is this large supply available, the Minister for Agriculture has a completely new scheme of farm improvements which he anticipates, apart altogether from the demands which might be made upon the labour pool by his tillage policy, and by the work of the Turf Development Board, would absorb a very large percentage of any surplus of labour that might be available in the areas to which it will apply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  I do not want to be put, and the Deputy must not try to put me, into the position of making the case for this order purely upon the basis of this scheme which the Minister for Agriculture is at the moment <Col N="1690" /> drafting.  On the contrary, I have pointed out to the Deputy already that, due to the natural expansion in the demand for our products&mdash;and, mind you, there has been a considerable expansion in that respect&mdash; and due also to the efforts of the Turf Board and other efforts which are being made by the Minister for Supplies and myself to ensure that any deficiency there might be in our normal coal supplies will be met by the resources of our own bogs and due, as I have said, to the effect of the Compulsory Tillage Order which the Minister for Agriculture has made, I have reason to believe, or, at least, I think it is reasonable to assume that there will be a much greater demand for labour in rural areas than there was last year and than there was in any preceding year since, say, 1929. That is not overstating the case, I believe.</P>
      <P>We have then this other scheme of farm improvements which I think would, of itself, make very great demands upon the labour resources in the rural areas.  In addition to that, we have another fact which is now emerging: due to the failure of supplies of minerals of various sorts from the continent, we are now faced with inquiries regarding certain of our mineral deposits which hitherto had not been regarded as capable of profitable exploitation.  We have in a number of cases taken steps to re-open quarries which have been closed for years&mdash;not slate quarries, but granite quarries and quarries for stone of that sort&mdash; and which are now finding a demand for their material as a substitute for stone which formerly came from Norway and elsewhere.  Again, we have inquiries with regard to dolomite deposits, barytes deposits and a number of other mineral deposits of the sort, and steps are being taken to work these deposits, if we can.  As they are all in rural areas, they again will make a big demand on the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You might say to me: &ldquo;After all, if the statements made by Deputy Keyes and other speakers are correct and this order is, in fact, going to deprive 30,000 unemployed people of unemployment assistance and that these 30,000 <Col N="1691" /> people have no outlet for their labour, what effect are these schemes and the developments to which I have referred going to have on the situation?&rdquo;  In that connection, the first thing to point out is that, although Deputy Keyes said that this order was operating throughout the country with the exception of some small scheduled areas in the congested districts, the exception in this case is that the areas which are excluded from the operation of the order are the most densely populated and, from the point of view of the number of persons who might be affected, are more important than the areas covered by the order.  The areas excluded represent the most densely populated districts in the country and of the total number affected&mdash;the figure of 30,000, I may tell the Deputy, was quite an exaggeration; the utmost figure that could be covered by the order would be about 23,000&mdash;of the 23,000 people, fully 50 per cent.&mdash;that is a rough estimate&mdash;live in the areas which are exempted from the operations of the order.  The married men in those areas and those men who have dependents will not be affected.</P>
    <P>The reason for such exemption is clear: the people concerned live in the congested districts as defined in the Act of 1891 and in those areas contiguous to them where agricultural conditions are similar.  As I have said, they represent the most densely populated portions of rural Ireland and from the point of view of the ability of the land to maintain people are by far the poorest.  The order, in fact, might be taken to apply only to the truly arable area of the country where there is every reason to believe there is, and will be, plenty of employment available during this summer and during the coming harvest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is an optimist, anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an optimist because this is a matter to which some study has been given.  A person does not do a thing like this without giving it a great deal of consideration, strange as it may appear.  What conditions have we found to exist in relation to <Col N="1692" /> the men who are likely to be affected? We know from a return which was compiled last year that, according to their own statements, there were only 9.2 per cent. of the people who are now likely to be affected by this order who did not secure work for wages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>For one week, perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not assume from this that we are excluding them for the 52 weeks of the year, and, if they got and are likely to get work, whether it was or will be for two, three, four or 13 weeks, within what period of the year are they most likely to get it?  Within the period covered by this order.  Inside that period, on their own admission, 91 per cent. of the people covered by the order got work for wages.  Others of them may have been able to work for themselves or they may have been dependents, living in their fathers' houses, and may have had work without getting a return in wages for it. They may have been getting a return in kind or a deferred return in the shape of profit upon their own labour when the produce of that labour was disposed of.  Accordingly, while this would, undoubtedly, be a very grave and serious matter if the case which the Deputy made against the order were well-founded, when we find that 91 per cent. of those people were, on their own admission, able to get work last year when opportunities for employment were not anything like what they are to-day, is it not reasonable to estimate that more than 91 per cent. will get work this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis, you would be entitled to assume that 100 per cent. would get work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not say that.  I suppose there will be cases where, though work will be available, people will not really try to get work, or where people will not be able to work when they get it.  If so, those persons were not intended to come within the Unemployment Assistance Act.  If there are people who do not secure employment because, in fact, they are not able to work, then it was never intended that <Col N="1693" /> they should be provided for by the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that we are doing something never contemplated before, whereas what we are doing is operating the Act in the manner in which it was originally intended to be operated, in the manner in which we told the Dáil it would be operated when we were asking the Dáil to pass the Bill.  In the changed conditions of agriculture in Ireland, opportunities for employment might be expected to be available for all those concerned who want work and, because <Col N="1694" /> of that, we are operating the Act as originally intended.  That is a plain and simple proposition.</P>
      <P>A number of special points have been raised.  The case of Cork was mentioned. Undoubtedly, there is a special case there.  But upon whom lies the onus to deal with that special case? Surely, upon the people who created it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That case does not arise solely upon this particular Employment Period Order.  Deputy Hickey and Deputy Hurley mentioned it before in relation to other matters.  As I have asked before&mdash;this matter may not be entirely relevant to the discussion&mdash; upon whom lies the onus of dealing with this special case?  I say, and I think that reasonable men will agree with me, that the onus lies upon those who created the special conditions.  We did not buy this property outside Cork city boundaries.  We did not build houses there and we did not bring people from inside the boundaries of our municipality to put them down there.  The Corporation of Cork did that.  I do not say that they could have done anything else.  I do not know whether they could or not.  Perhaps, they could and, perhaps, they could not.  But surely, as a matter of general principle, if the Corporation of any city acquires land for the purpose of building dwellings for its citizens, then it ought to take the necessary steps to bring that land within its own municipal confines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They did that 18 months ago and got no response from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be an easier way of dealing with the whole problem&mdash;to have the city boundary extended so as to bring these people in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of a number of people outside the Dáil is very much like that of certain people inside the Dáil&mdash;they want to have it both ways.  The people who live in <Col N="1695" /> these houses do not want to be inside the city boundary for certain purposes but they want to be inside it for the purpose of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Since they elect to put themselves outside the city boundary for any purpose, they must be outside the city boundary for all purposes&mdash;even for the purpose of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I cannot remedy that.  I should be making confusion worse confounded and creating more anomalies than I could possibly cure if I were to attempt to do so.  For that reason, I cannot do as Deputy Hickey and Deputy Hurley have suggested&mdash;agree to make any special provision which would bring these tenants of the Cork Corporation inside the Cork City boundary.  The municipal corporation must do that for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to fight that row for himself down there.  He cannot transfer it to me. I have enough to answer for on my own without fighting his battles for him.  The position in relation to this matter is a difficult one, but we have got to face it.  As the Government, we have to think of the community as a whole.  Deputies have referred to the high cost of living.  Demands have been made for increases in wages which are going to increase the cost of living still further.  Our difficulty during this trying period is to endeavour to keep a proper balance between those <Col N="1696" /> who are providing out of their own earnings for the upkeep of those in regard to whom they have no family obligations, those who have in that way to be provided for out of the earnings of others.  In relation to that we have to be careful that money does not go astray; that, in fact, if there is employment available in this country for any man or woman, we will leave no inducement or in no way make it easier for those people not to take that employment or not to seek for it.  The position is too difficult for those who are in jobs and who are earning perhaps a meagre pittance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are this year opportunities for employment in rural Ireland that were not available previously, we must see to it that they are availed of.  This Employment Period Order was made in accordance with the fundamental understanding which underlay the Unemployment Assistance Act when it was submitted to the House&mdash;that during the summer months the Act would be partly if not completely suspended in regard to rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not be much of a prophet, but I certainly told the House that I did not expect any sort of reasonable reply from the Minister.  I was not disappointed by his reply. His reply might be classed under two heads.  First of all, peculiarly enough, the Minister alleges a certain difficulty and a danger of fraud in the rural areas.  It seems strange that it took them from 1933 until 1940 to discover that.  I will say at once that there is no truth in his statement.  I suggest that the machinery in the possession of the Government is quite ample to prevent that sort of thing; it is quite adequate to detect anything in the nature of fraud.  The experience gained in the course of the last few years has proved that and I think that is a very lame excuse that has been put forward by the Minister when he suggested that it was a matter of administrative difficulty and that consideration had to be given to the protection of the State against fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point relates to the suggestion of a huge increase in employment <Col N="1697" /> this year&mdash;the assumption that the Minister suggests he was entitled to take, that all the people would be employed this year.  What is the great difference between this year and last year that is going to make for that increased employment?  The outstanding point is the order of the Minister for Agriculture for increased tillage. Did the Minister or his advisers, the people who very dishonestly advised him in this matter, take steps last year to ascertain from any people what the true position was?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to say that about my advisers. I do not always take advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to prove what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Deputy to ascribe it to my advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that, on the information of his advisers, 91 per cent. of the people worked last year.  That is a most dishonest statement. They did work, perhaps, for one day in the period, some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis the Minister would be perfectly entitled to assume that 100 per cent. of the people would work this year.  That would not be a very big stretch of imagination. I suggest, however, that the position might be that there would be only one day's work for many of these unfortunate people.  I suggest that the advice given to the Minister was just dishonest.  There is no Deputy who has taken a greater or a deeper interest in this particular question than I have. I have been intimately associated with the working of this Act, particularly in my own county, and I say that it was a particularly dishonest piece of advice to give to the Minister and if that is one of the things that has helped him to come to his decision, then I would not advise him to rely too much on that advice any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister where does he expect all this work is going to come from?  If he is so very sanguine about this increase in employment, what is particularly urgent about the date of this period order?  Why <Col N="1698" /> should there be so much anxiety to have the 5th June as the date?  Why not wait with this order until the other schemes that have been referred to materialise?  If the Minister for Agriculture is bringing in the scheme which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not quite in a position to define&mdash;it is one of the hopes that they are holding out&mdash;would it not be reasonable to suggest that the Government should hold their hand until the scheme would materialise?  You could then judge how many men would be absorbed by that scheme that will come from the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be pinning great hopes on increased tillage.  Is he aware that there are considerable exemptions being granted in respect of the compulsory tillage order?  Around Bruff and Kilmallock there is any amount of grass land.  That is not going to provide any additional work for our labourers.  I have already drawn attention to an area no less than 5,000 acres in extent and I have asked the Minister to endeavour to have the order applied in that connection.  It includes much of the area so well known as the Golden Vale.  In Limerick County there is a small area around Abbeyfeale, Purt and Kilmoylan, where people have been exempted from the operation of the period order.  The result will be that the working men from outside that area will be struck clean off.  There is a vast area in east and south Limerick that will be included in this order.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know what is going to be done for the men in Ballyhahill&mdash;where are they to get work? In recent times in Limerick there have been dismissals of adult workers and yet the Minister talks of the huge increase in agricultural employment. Is it not a fact that there has been a huge decrease since 1932?  Taking the Government's figures for last year, considering all the official statistics, we get a figure of about 46,000 persons less.  We are told that the Turf Board have considerable difficulty in securing employees, but the Minister did not indicate on what bog the shortage took place.  There was no shortage in Clonsast.  The experiment carried on there was carried on only with the <Col N="1699" /> goodwill of the Turf Board.  They did not ask for the men, because they had all the employees they required.  A similar position exists at Lyracrompane and I have not heard of any bog where they did not get the men they required.</P>
    <P>The Minister has struck off 31,000 men under the No. 1 and No. 2 Period Orders.  These men were standing by, waiting for additional work, and now <Col N="1700" /> the Minister sends them the married men to keep them company.  The Minister challenges my figure of 30,000.  That is only an estimate, because I have no data on which to go, but I should like to suggest that my figure is more correct than the Minister's when he states that it would be either 22,000 or 23,000, and then he added that 50 per cent. of those would not be affected.</P>
