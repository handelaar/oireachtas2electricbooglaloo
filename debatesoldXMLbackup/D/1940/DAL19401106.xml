      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received representations from Wicklow County Council regarding a proposal to construct a new coastal and tourist road connecting the towns of Wicklow and Arklow, and whether he is aware that the county council has raised a substantial amount, in rates towards the cost of this work with a view to relieving the large number of unemployed in the area; and if he will state the reason why the work has not been proceeded with on the Wicklow section and the reason for the suspension of the work on the Arklow section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The work on the Wicklow section of this road was not proceeded with pending the acquisition of the necessary lands for the making of the road.  I am in communication with the Wicklow County Council in regard to this matter.  Progress on the Wicklow section cannot be made until the site for the new road is acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, 1939, a grant of £1,400 subject to a local contribution of £700 was allocated for the first year's programme on the Arklow section of the road.  This sum has now been expended.  Consideration is being <Col N="319" /> given to the question of the allocation of a further grant for the completion of the work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received representations from the Gárda authorities and the ratepayers as to the dangerous condition of the main road between Wicklow and Bray; whether he is aware that several fatal accidents have occurred on this route owing to dangerous corners and the camber of the surface; and having regard to the fact that this road is recognised as the principal tourist and traffic road, particularly in the summer season, and to the fact that money is available for the work, whether he will make a substantial grant towards the cost of making this road safe for traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, representations were received last year from the Gárda Síochána in regard to excessive camber of the road from Bray to Rathnew. No representations in the matter appear to have been received from ratepayers of the county.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the reply is in the negative.</P>
      <P>As regards the third part, when the representations referred to were received they were communicated to the acting county surveyor, who submitted proposals for the super-elevation of dangerous bends at an estimated cost of £5,400.  Before deciding upon the nature of improvements it was deemed desirable to have a full examination of the area.  The county surveyor has been requested to arrange for such a survey.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that employees of horticultural nurseries are treated as agricultural workers for the purpose of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, and whether he will take steps to ensure that such workers will in future receive the same benefits as industrial workers in view, of the fact that they are ordinarily resident in municipal areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>Employees in horticultural nuiseries who are engaged on agricultural work are regarded as agricultural workers for the purposes of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts irrespective of their place of residence.  The rate of contributions paid in respect of them is only half of that paid for industrial employees, and it would not be possible to give them the same rate of benefits without increasing the contributions. It is not proposed to make the residence of the worker the criterion for determining the rates of contributions or benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true in fact that these workers' circumstances are closely analogous to industrial workers and would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider some scheme whereunder the rate of benefit to which their widows would be entitled should be made identical with that of those living in exactly the same circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 2 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, the expression &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; includes nursery work and market gardening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that under the Conditions of Employment Act market gardeners are treated as industrial workers whereas agricultural labourers <Col N="321" /> are not and that it is only for the purposes of the Agricultural Wages Act and the Widows and Orphans Acts that the horticultural worker is classed as an agricultural worker?  In view of the fact that under the Conditions of Employment Act he is regarded as an industrial worker, will the Parliamentary Secretary not consider treating him as an industrial worker for the purposes of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that it would be scarcely feasible to isolate one class of the same section of labour.  I think the Deputy has in mind that sections of nursery workers living in cities should be entitled to the higher rate of benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to the report of the meeting of the Dublin Corporation at which it was stated that 69 persons suffering from tuberculosis were without sanatorium accommodation, and if, further, he will state the cause of the delay in sanctioning the corporation proposals for the provision of buildings, treatment and equipment for the sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I have only seen a reference to the matter in the public <Col N="322" /> Press.  As regards the latter part of the question, it was intimated to the corporation on the 7th ultimo that in view of the commitments of the Hospitals Trust Fund the total accommodation in the new sanatorium for early cases of tuberculosis should be limited to 300 beds, which was the number originally agreed upon with the corporation after consultation with their medical adviser, but that the planning of the institution should be designed in such a way as to be capable of extension at a later date if necessary.  Since then I have received further representations from the corporation for the provision of accommodation up to 350 beds.  For the reasons already communicated to the corporation I intimated on the 5th instant that I cannot agree to any provision at present in excess of 300 beds, and that if the course already suggested to the corporation is not adopted I would be unable to give further consideration to the proposal being proceeded with at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, may I ask the Parliamentary Secretary will he not provide temporary accommodation for the new number?  I think I have mentioned 69 in my question, but I understand that there are 200 patients waiting for tuberculosis treatment. Would the Parliamentary Secretary not sanction the renting of temporary accommodation, because I understand that he is aware of the fact that it will take at least two years to provide the building that has been referred to? Will he permit the taking of these 200 sufferers into a temporary building and give the necessary sanction for doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be quite prepared to have such a proposal examined, but I think the Deputy will appreciate the difficulties that might arise: first, as to the cost of the temporary buildings, and, secondly, as to their suitability for the purpose, and, again, as much time might be lost in the provision of temporary structures, that might ultimately not be available for any other useful purpose, as would probably provide the permanent institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand, then, that the 200 tuberculosis patients in the City of Dublin are to wait two or three years more until the new building is ready?  This is a matter of grave national importance, and I think that a committee of this House should wait upon the Minister with a view to putting the situation before him, since this is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If the corporation had acted on the Minister's suggestion to adopt plans for a 300-bed institution, instead of insisting at this particular stage on a 350-bed institution, we would be well on the way at the present, time towards providing that institution with 300 beds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is aware that the original proposal&mdash;his proposal&mdash; would only increase the accommodation for tubercular patients by 90, and the corporation asked for an extra 50 because they had that number on their waiting list?  Again, I think that, in this grave matter, the city and county has a claim on the members of this House to send a committee to wait on the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I could even give that assurance.  The question of an inquiry will depend on whether the Women's National Health Association or any other interested body put a case before the Minister.  The Department has not been consulted, or had not been consulted, before the official statement was made to close down these industries. As a result of the debate in the Seanad, I understand that contacts have been made between certain interested parties and the Women's National Health Association with a view to getting from them a full memorandum as to why they find it necessary to close down, what prospects there are of the success of the scheme, and what is the possibility of having a modified scheme substituted for the present one if the latter is not feasible; but until some submission is made to the Minister he cannot do anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, we are not to understand that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is standing on his dignity down at the Custom House until somebody approaches him on this matter?  It is manifest that all sides of the House do not want these industries to close down, and will the Minister send for the authorities concerned and ask them to tell him what are their difficulties, what has been the measure of success in the past, and what prospects they hold out for success in the future in the event of his giving some assistance to them?

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if sanction has been refused to proposals by the Limerick City Manager, acting on behalf of the city council, for the repair and reconstruction of the embankment of the Abbey River at Corbally, Limerick County Borough; and if he is aware that this work, if carried out, would be a very much appreciated public amenity, and in addition, would give much needed protection to 90 acres of highly valued land, to 20 houses, which have been built out of moneys borrowed from the Limerick City Council under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, and to the main road leading to East Clare, and to the power station at Ardnacrusha, and if, in view of the urgency of this matter, he will have the previous decision reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The works referred to in the question were proposed by the corporation as an amenity scheme, the cost of which would be met mainly out of the funds allocated to the corporation for the financing of works for the provision of employment. It was not established to the satisfaction of the Department that the corporation were legally empowered to expend any of their own moneys on the <Col N="327" /> repair of the embankment.  Before the works were rejected as an amenity scheme it was ascertained from the Irish Land Commission that repair works at a cost of £1,002 had been carried out by the commission between the years 1931 and 1934, although that Department was under no obligation to repair the breaches.  Portion of the expenditure by the Irish Land Commission was to be recouped by the owners of the benefited holdings, but so far no payment has been made by any of the beneficiaries.  On the evidence before my Department I could not approve of the Corporation of Limerick undertaking any liability for the maintenance of the embankment.  I will, however, have the position further examined in relation to the houses and road to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>Oh the basis of information received from manufacturers and other importers, it is estimated that the stocks held by them at the end of October represent in the case of phosphatic manures (including compound manures) approximately, one-third of a normal year's requirements, in the case of nitrogenous manures upwards of one-half of a normal year's requirements, and in the case of potassic manures about one-third of a normal year's requirements.  In existing circumstances, it is not possible to say at this stage what additional supplies will be available before the end of the sowing season.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state:&mdash;(1) what is the normal output of Ardnacrusha per annum in million units of electricity; (2) what it is estimated will be the normal output per annum in million units of electricity of (a) Poulaphouca (when completed), (b) the proposed Clonsast scheme: (3) what it is estimated would be the output per annum in million units of electricity of (a) the Pigeon House (working to capacity), (b) the proposed Erne scheme if worked on the larger plan with the co-operation of the Northern Ireland Government, (c) the proposed Erne scheme if worked without the co-operation of the Northern Ireland Government; (4) what is the estimated number of units required on the Electricity Supply Board undertaking for the years 1940, 1941, 1942; (5) what is the estimated peak load in regard to each of the above undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>1.  The output of Ardnacrusha per annum is dependent on water conditions throughout the year.  These may and often do vary within very wide limits from year to year, and even as between corresponding months in different years.  The possible output, however, in any one year from the existing plant is largely determined by the relationship which exists between the electrical demand over the summer months of that year and the inflow into the Shannon in the same period.  Bearing in mind these extremely variable conditions, the output of Ardnacrusha for a dry year may be estimated at 110,000,000 units; for an average year at 250,000,000 units; and for a wet year at 360,000,000 units. The position is best exemplified by actual experience over the past ten <Col N="329" /> years.  The 12 months' period which ended 31st March, 1934, was a particularly dry one, and the inflow to the Shannon lakes during it was accordingly limited, so that the total number of units generated in Ardnacrusha during the 12 months in question was 103,223,750 units of which 101,473,000 units were available for distribution.</P>
      <P>For the years 1936 and 1937 the inflow conditions most nearly approached the average for the 46 years 1893-1938 inclusive.  Accordingly for the 12 months ended 31st March, 1937, 246,398,100 units were generated at Ardnacrusha, of which 244,502,000 were available for distribution; while for the period 12 months ended 31st March, 1938, 239,202,800 units were generated of which 236,998,000 were delivered to the distribution network.  The rainfall conditions for the 12 months ended 31st March, 1939, were, with the possible exception of 1931, the most favourable experienced over the past ten years, and this position was reflected in that the total number of units generated at Ardnacrusha over the period was 286,483,600 of which 284,284,000 were available for distribution.  On the other hand during the operating year which ended 31st March, 1940, the conditions were less favourable than they had been in the preceding four years, so that the number of units generated at Ardnacrusha fell to 210,248,900 units of which 208,023,000 were available for distribution.</P>
      <P>2. (a).  The estimated output of the Liffey will be 30,000,000 units, and (b) the estimated output of the proposed generating station at Clonsast will be 90,000,000 units.</P>
      <P>3. (a).  As the function of the Pigeon House station is mainly a stand-by and peak load station the estimated output in millions of units could not readily be given, having regard to the continuous fluctuations in the demand. The output of the Pigeon House station in any year depends on the water conditions at the Ardnacrusha station, and on the total load oh the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The installed plant capacity is 95,000 kw., but the station would never <Col N="330" /> be called upon to give an output corresponding to this capacity continuously.</P>
    <P>3. (b) and (c).  In regard to the Erne scheme it is not possible at this stage to give figures as to the estimated output other than the tentative figures of from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 units which I quoted on the Second Reading of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill at present before the House.</P>
    <P>4. The total number of units generated for the year ended 31st March, 1940, was 406,998,700 units.  It is estimated that the total number of units to be generated in the year ending 31st March, 1941, will amount to 437,000,000 units and in the year ending 31st March, 1942, 467,000,000.</P>
    <P>5. It is not understood what this part of the question means.  For the information of the Deputy it can be stated that the peak load taken at Ardnacrusha in the year ended 31st March, 1939, was 79,900 kw. on the 21st February, 1939, and in the same year the peak load taken at the Pigeon House was 48,000 kw. on the 19th May, 1938.  In the year ended 31st March, 1940, the peak load taken at Ardnacrusha was 83,000 kw. on the 22nd December, 1939, and 63,500 kw. was the peak load taken at the Pigeon House in the same year on the 23rd January, 1940.  It will, moreover, be seen from the Electricity Supply Board's published reports that at the Ardnacrusha generating, station, the total capacity at the generator terminals is 93,500 kw. at 30 metres head and 77,500 kw. at 25.5 metres head.  The installed capacity at the Pigeon House is 95,000 kw. and the installed capacity to be provided at Poulaphouca and Portarlington will be 34,000 kw. and 20,000 kw. respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early in the season to say whether the stocks of turf now in any particular area are surplus to the requirements of the area, since it cannot be assumed, in present circumstances, that in the future coal can be procured from abroad in the quantities ordinarily imported in the past.  If for any cause imports of coal diminish or cease completely there will be a shortage of fuel. In the meantime the position in respect of turf stocks is subject to careful observation.  While bearing this in mind, however, I would advise individual producers of turf to do what is possible to dispose of their stocks in the normal way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of extending the fertiliser scheme to basic slag was carefully considered when the scheme was being originally prepared two years ago, but it was decided to exclude this product&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) because of the fact that basic slag is not a standard commodity but varies in phosphatic content from 18 per cent. to 42 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> (2) because of the administrative difficulties in arranging for the payment of a subsidy on basic slag and of ensuring that farmers would get the benefit of the subisdy.</P>
    <P>The matter does not arise at present as there is only a relatively small quantity of basic slag in the country which was purchased at last season's prices and, unfortunately, the prospects of getting further supplies at any price are exceedingly remote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From information at the disposal of my Department, it is estimated that the consumption of artificial manures under normal conditions in the 1939 season was approximately 200,000 tons of phosphatic manures, about 25,000 tons of nitrogenous manures and potassic manures equivalent to about 14,000 tons of muriate of potash, or a total of about 240,000 tons. It may be assumed that if ample supplies were available during the coming season a similar quantity of fertilisers would be required plus a quantity corresponding to possibly 500,000 acres of extra tillage as compared with 1939.  On this basis a total of about 270,000 tons would be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, reasonable supplies of phosphatic manures and ample supplies of nitrogenous and potassic manures were available last season and I do not agree that the position was as the Deputy now states it.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, it is proposed to discourage the use on grass lands of superphosphate and compound manures containing superphosphate by restricting distribution until the approach of the cropping season when the fertilisers manufacturers will allocate available supplies to retailers on the basis of distribution in previous years.  This arrangement will ensure that tillage counties will get their due quota.</P>

The Deputy is not correct in stating that I have advised farmers to reduce stocks of pigs at present, but even if a reduction in the number of pigs fattened should become necessary it is desirable that, in view of the increasing difficulty of obtaining supplies of imported feeding stuffs, the whole of the barley not required for industrial purposes should be retained for feeding purposes, and for that reason I am not prepared to grant licences for the export of barley.</P>

      <P>We will deal with oats later.  I think myself that barley will pass into consumption before next spring.  Therefore, it is doubly easy for the Government to assist us in the storage of it.  I have stacks of barley in the fields, and the rats are making cow tracks through them.  You can see the tracks of the rats where they walk away in the grass.  When we threshed the barley, after it had been about a month in the field, I think we killed about 150 rats in about 40 small stacks. Picture the small farmer who sees the rats eating his crop off the land and cannot thresh it because he has nowhere to put it.  I urge on the Minister to look into the matter and see if some plan could not be worked out to relieve the small man who has not got storage.  All that the Minister need do is to provide for storage, because I believe that by February or March next, or by May at the very latest, the barley will have passed into consumption.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the feeling there is through the country on this matter?  Does he realise that it is only the big men who have been able to get their barley threshed; that they were the only people who were able to get a machine and so were enabled to get the barley away at Guinness' price of 30/- per barrel?  Does he realise that the small farmer, through no fault of his own, could not get a machine, and therefore got left?  He is in the position now <Col N="342" /> that he cannot sell his barley while his neighbour, the big farmer, was able to get his barley threshed and get it away at 30/- per barrel.  All that has created a very bitter feeling throughout the country, and I wonder if the Minister realises it.  Is the Minister prepared to consider Deputy Dillon's suggestion of pooling the barley we have in the country at a fair price?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies surely must realise that if you had anything like a Government scheme to take up all the barley and oats in the country, keeping it and storing it and sending it on to the maize millers would add considerably to the cost.  Someone would have to bear the cost of that: either the farmers buying the grain for feeding stuffs or the farmers selling it for feeding stuffs.  The fewer intermediaries we have in this matter the better, because the fewer we have the more the grower will get for his crop. I think it is really foolish to advocate any such scheme.  If the Deputies opposite have made any inquiries in the matter, I am sure they must be convinced that there will be very little barley on farmers' hands in the course of the next few weeks, not to speak of the next few months.  I know there is oats on hands.  We know that about five-sixths of the oats grown by farmers is used by themselves.  That has always been the case, and always will be.  Hence there is very little surplus oats for sale.  The fact that a lot of farmers grew barley this year&mdash; that is barley over and above what was required&mdash;was a speculation on their part.  As far as this Government is concerned, it cannot be denied that they have always advised farmers to grow wheat if they wanted a ready market.  We cannot be blamed, in any part of our propaganda, with regard to the growing of crops. The farmer was entitled to speculate on setting a good price for his barley if he grew it.  If he failed to get that, I suppose he was unfortunate, and that is all we can say.</P>

      <P>Why does the Minister refuse to give him an export market? If it is considered to be in the national interest to conserve food supplies, why <Col N="343" /> ask the small farmers in the country to finance that scheme?  Why does not the nation, as a whole, finance it, and why penalise the individual farmers who are now left with barley on their hands?  The whole situation should be taken into account, but neither the Minister nor his Department has ever faced up to that aspect of the question.</P>

The prices which maize millers have agreed to pay for oats and barley under this arrangement are: oats £8 per ton, and barley £10 per ton delivered at mill.  I am not in a position to state the proportion of the total production of oats and barley at present unsold which will be marketed by the end of December, but I am satisfied that the arrangement to which I have referred affords reasonable facilities for, the disposal of any surplus barley or oats which cannot be used for feeding on the farms on which the crops were produced.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether in view of the admitted deficiencies of the premises at Clonmel Borstal Institution and the temporary transfer of the staff and inmates to Cork Prison he will endeavour to secure an allocation from the Employment Schemes Vote of moneys to be spent in adopting existing premises or building new premises as a work of permanent value, and thereby provide a scheme for the provision of employment and relief of distress.</P>

      <P>So far as can he seen at present, the probability is that the provision of more suitable accommodation in place of the Borstal premises at Clonmel would not involve a sufficiently high proportion of unskilled labour to make the work a suitable object for an allocation from the Employment Scheme Vote.  The question of providing suitable permanent premises for youths sentenced to Borstal detention is, however, having close attention, and in the consideration of the matter I shall keep the Deputy's suggestion in mind.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the accommodation at the Borstal Institution has been &ldquo;receiving close attention&rdquo; for the past 20 years, the fruits of which &ldquo;close attention&rdquo; were that the boys were immured until recently in a jail built about 120 years ago, that they have been transferred to another jail of even less attractive interior than that from which they were removed and that, for the past 20 years, these youths have been in a jail to which there is no land attached, with the result that there was no occupation with which their time could be engaged and no prospect of any suitable occupational treatment being given to the boys in the new premises to which they have been sent?  In view of these circumstances, will the Minister represent to the Government that this is a matter of the first urgency and that it is a public scandal that, in this country, our Borstal Institution should be housed in a hard-labour jail?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have decided to extend summer time throughout the coming winter.  The major consideration which influenced the Government in deciding to extend summer time here is that such an extension would facilitate work at our ports and particularly at the port of Dublin.  The extra hour of daylight in the evening is of advantage for the loading of cargo, particularly at these hours when the greater portion of cargo for shipment comes forward and when last minute arrangements may have to be made, as the work can be carried out more safely and more expeditiously in daylight than in artificial light.  In the existing circumstances, anything which would facilitate, even in a minor degree, the punctual dispatch of ships and cargo from our ports and render easier the loading of such ships is obviously of the utmost importance.  The Government were advised also that the extension of summer time would effect a saving in fuel and artificial lighting and, in view of the urgent need for conserving supplies, this appeared to them to be an important consideration.</P>
      <P>The Government are well aware that there are objections to the extension of summer time but, after a careful consideration of the matter, they have come to the conclusion that the balance of advantage lies with extension. One of the strongest objections raised against extending summer time is that summer time has an adverse effect on school children.  This is admitted.  School managers, however, can at their discretion alter school hours to suit local convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have decided to extend summer time only as a special <Col N="353" /> measure in the present circumstances. The whole question of the summer time system is at present being examined by a committee.  The committee were consulted regarding the question of extending summer time throughout the coming winter, but they stated that they are not at present in a position to express any view on the question.</P>

      <P>I think I dealt fairly fully with the matter on the previous occasion.  The proposal contained in Order No. 37 is to fix the quota for the current six months at 80,000, and to exempt from the quota restrictions hats exceeding 14/11 in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter twice before.  One point is that this quota order was originally put in force for the purpose of providing employment for a certain number of girls in Galway.  There are a certain number of girls working in a hat factory in Galway, but the number of girls working in Galway bears little or no relation to the number of young girls who lost their jobs in millinery warehouses, as a result of the destruction of the millinery trade, consequent on the establishment of this industry in this country.  In the words of the Prime Minister, however, you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs, and the eggs which got broken on this occasion were about 500 women who had employment and livelihood in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, who are now on the dole and who can console themselves that a certain number of girls&mdash;a far smaller number&mdash;have jobs in the City of Galway making hats which, in the early stages of this industry, their employers were unable to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not mention that fact but for the ensuing fact which derives directly <Col N="357" /> from the inability of the firm of Jabotiotinsky, or whatever the name is, the Czecho-Slovakian company running this factory in Galway, to sell their hats.  When they started manufacturing, they built up an immense stock of hats which they were quite unable to sell.  They ran into tens of thousands, and, in that situation, the millinery wholesalers in this country got together and formed a ring, a certain limited number of them.  They went down to Galway and said: &ldquo;You have your backs to the wall; your capital is all sunk in a vast agglomeration of hats which you cannot sell and never will be able to sell.  Unless you are prepared to play ball with us, we will let you go bankrupt, but if you are prepared to co-operate with us in establishing a watertight ring of distributors of millinery in this country, we will undertake to sell all that unsaleable millinery for you in the country.&rdquo;  I understand that, with the connivance of the Department of Industry and Commerce, that ring was established.  What happened?</P>
    <P>They went out and, by vigorous salesmanship throughout the country, disposed of this vast agglomeration of unsuitable millinery manufactured in Galway, and then they announced that the terms of their agreement with the Galway that factory provided that no hats were to be sold from that factory, except through this limited number of persons who belonged to the wholesalers' ring.  Other people who had carried on a legitimate business in millinery wholesaling, but who did not join the ring, then found themselves faced with this situation: the quota prevented their getting hats from abroad, and the ring's agreement with the Galway Hat Factory prevented their getting hats from Galway, so that they could go out on the street and starve, which they proceeded to do. In those circumstances, some of those women&mdash;and there were women&mdash;went to the gallant masculine members of the wholesalers' ring, pointed out that their families depended on this little business which they had built up, and asked that they be given some share of the merchandise to distribute, so that they could continue to live.  They, were told: &ldquo;Not a hat.  We did the <Col N="358" /> donkey work in disposing of the rubbish for the Galway Hat Factory, and now we are going to skim the cream&rdquo;&mdash;and they are skimming the cream.</P>
    <P>Up till recently, all hats were subject to the quota, but then certain influential ladies in this country approached influential gentlemen in the Government and said: &ldquo;We are damned if we are going to wear Galway hats.  You can quota the cheap hats if you like.  We do not give a hang what the ordinary little girls wear, but if you think we are going to plaster Galway hats on our heads you are making the mistake of your lives.  Our hats run from two guineas to seven guineas a piece, and you have got to take the quota off them.&rdquo;  They did, so that the ladies who can pay from two to seven guineas for hats can get their hats wherever they like, but the farmer's daughter or the servant girl who wants a hat has got to wear a Galway hat or go without.  One of the results of this transaction is that country girls and city girls too are going without hats, and are tying handkerchiefs over their heads, and that has thrown 500 women out of a job.  There are 500 women drawing the dole to-day who have lost their jobs through the ruin that has been wrought on the millinery trade.  That may be damned funny to some gentlemen who are drawing £480 in this House, but it is not a bit funny for those women who had respectable homes&mdash;some of them widows, keeping families&mdash;and who made no hullabulloo about the little business they were doing, a legitimate business.  They have been thrown out on the road with no one to speak for them, and&mdash;which is perhaps the most tragic element in it&mdash;they do not know what hit them. They do not know where their business has gone, but it has vanished.  The reason, to anyone familiar with the millinery trade, is that you have destroyed the ability of the small milliner to have an exclusive stock; you have forced the small milliner in the country into competition with the big department store, and destroyed everyone in a small way of business in that particular trade.</P>
    <P>Now, that has been done.  That grave and cruel injustice has been <Col N="359" /> done.  I am trying to secure now that another beastly injustice will not be done, that is, that this ring of wholesalers will not be allowed, under Government protection, to squeeze out of their livelihood another group of people who have the right to live, and throw out of business people who had been carrying on a legitimate wholesale millinery trade in this country before ever there was a ring or a quota.  The Minister said to me on a previous occasion, and I accepted his word because I admit he is a man of his word when he gives it, that he would stand for no such abuse in the future.  He knows the details of the case I have in mind, and I believe there are other similar cases.  I have no reason to believe that effective measures have been taken to abate the scandal which I brought under his attention, and I think he ought to take this opportunity to tell the House he has broken that ring, and will not permit it to continue to squeeze citizens of this country out of the modest livelihood which they enjoyed before the Government took it on itself to interfere with this trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that my knowledge of the millinery business is not quite as intimate as that of Deputy Dillon.  Certainly, having accepted the shackles of matrimony I should not dare to discuss ladies' hats so emphatically as he does, but I have no reason to believe that the qualify, design and taste of the hat turned out by the Galway factory are at all discreditable to this country, or to the policy which has resulted in the establishment of that factory.  It is not true either to say that, because certain influential persons approached Ministers, hats above a certain value were exempted from the quota.  The fact of the matter is that it may be of greater advantage to the community as a whole to be able to collect the tax on a hat which is brought in here and sold for four or five guineas, or even for seven or eight guineas as the Deputy has suggested, than to exclude that hat altogether, because <Col N="360" /> unfortunately we cannot draw up customs regulations so tightly, nor can we enforce customs laws so rigidly, that there would not be a possibility of evasion if one were completely to prohibit the importation of such hats when people are prepared to pay so much to get a particular article of that description.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other point&mdash;the main point, really; I think it was the only point which is really germane to this discussion&mdash;that is, that a number of people had taken advantage of the quota restriction, and the peculiar situation which had arisen in this country by reason of the fact that there was only one supplier of hats, to try to establish a wholesale ring which would secure a monopoly of the wholesale distribution.  As I indicated in this House I certainly am very strongly opposed to the utilisation by any group of persons in this country of measures which have been designed for the general national interest, to establish rings or monopolies, and to exploit, without regard to any considerations except their own personal interest, the situation which has been created.</P>
      <P>I did approach people whom, I thought, to be attempting that, and I did say quite frankly that I would not stand for it, and if necessary would come to the House here and ask for powers which would enable me to deal with the situation they were trying to create, unless they deferred to what I believe to be the policy of the Government and the policy of the House as a whole.  I think that the particular incident which the Deputy brought to my notice has been satisfactorily dealt with.  I understood it to have been so dealt with, and I have no reason to believe that I was misinformed.</P>

      <P>I should not like to give a pledge of that sort without certain practical reservations.  I gather that, in regard to the ordinary trade, there is something to be said against allowing men of straw, or women of straw, perhaps, to get into this business, and to start out, say, upon a price-cutting campaign of one sort or another, which might completely break up the normal methods of distribution, but I have reason to anticipate that where reasonably substantial people wish to engage in the business no attempt will be made to debar them. If there is such an attempt made, I will endeavour to see that at any rate there is no undue limitation of the supply to any person of good credit, of good standing and who is competent to handle the article satisfactorily, I will endeavour to see that no such person be debarred from engaging in the business.  Subject to that, I think there is nothing else I can say in the matter.</P>

      <P>The House will perhaps remember that under the London Agreement of 1938 it was provided that the question of protection accorded to some of our home manufactures might be referred to the Prices Commission at the instance of the manufacturers in the United Kingdom.  A request for such a reference was duly made in respect of cotton goods, but as a result of the discussions which took place between our cotton manufacturers and the British cotton manufacturers it was decided not to proceed with this reference if a certain proportion of our market here might be reserved by quota to the British manufacturers, and as a result of discussions which took place between the two groups of manufacturers the details of the Quota Orders which it is now proposed to confirm were laid down.  An important consideration which weighed <Col N="363" /> with the Government in accepting the proposals of the two bodies of manufacturers and allowing the reference to the Prices Commission to be withdrawn was the fact that under the agreement which had been reached a supply of raw material, of cotton yarns would be assured to our native manufacturers and that in view of this assurance, the supply of cotton goods for our people would be likewise assured to the extent to which our mills were able to supply.</P>
      <P>The articles covered by the quota orders are briefly:&mdash;Quota Order No. 39 covers woven piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. by weight of cotton not exceeding 10 ounces in weight per square yard, comprising (a) cloths used in the manufacture of (1) bed sheets of a width not less than 45 inches; (2) bed ticks and (3) bed mattresses; (b) cloths other than terry not less than four ounces per square yard, used in the manufacture of (1) shirts and pyjamas without pattern; (2) dungarees or similar protective garments.  These are all, as I have said, covered by Quota Order No. 39.  The agreement which provided for the regulation of the imports of these cloths by quota also provided that the duties which were in force prior to the 26th June, 1940, should be reduced in some cases and in all cases that a preferential rate should apply to the imports from the United Kingdom and Canada.</P>
      <P>In respect of the goods covered by Quota Order No. 39 the duties in force prior to the 26th June, 1940, were at the rate of 40 per cent. or 4d. per square yard, whichever was the higher. That is in respect of all countries. Under the amended duties which came into force as from the 26th June, 1940, the full rate of 40 per cent. still applied, with a preferential rate of 20 per cent. in the case of imports from the United Kingdom and Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quota Order No. 40 covers terry cloths.  In the case of these cloths the duties in force prior to the 26th June, 1940, were, as in the case of the goods covered by Quota Order No. 39, 40 per cent., or 4d. per square yard, and the duties on these cloths have been similarly amended so that they are <Col N="364" /> now as the full rate, 40 per cent., and as the preferential rate on manufactures from the United Kingdom and Canada of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Quota Order No. 41 covers cloths not less than four ounces per square yard with a pattern woven therein and used in the manufacture of shirt and pyjamas.  In this case the duty was 40 per cent., and the full rate since the 26th June still stands at 40 per cent., with a preferential rate of 20 per cent. in favour of imports from the United Kingdom and Canada.</P>
    <P>Quota Order No. 42 covers cloths containing more than 60 per cent. by weight of cotton and not exceeding ten ounces in weight per square yard which are not covered by Quota Orders Nos. 39, 40 or 41.  On these there was a duty in force prior to the 26th June, 1940, of 40 per cent.  The full rate in the case of these cloths has been increased to 45 per cent., with a preferential rate to the United Kingdom of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the case of cloths not subject to quota, that is cotton and union cloths other than any of those that are covered by Quota Orders Nos. 39, 40, 41 and 42, the duties in force prior to the 26th June were 40 per cent.  The preferential rate remains at 40 per cent. with a full rate at 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I can say except perhaps to give the House some information as to the quantities licensed for importation under each quota order and the extent to which imports have been restricted.</P>
    <P>Under Quota Order No. 39, the quota for the period from the 27th August to the 31st October was fixed at 50,000 yards, of which 49,720 yards were licensed for importation. The quota for the succeeding three months, the current quarter, from the 1st November to the 31st January next, is a further 50,000 yards.  In the case of Quota Order No. 40, the first quota, covering the period from 7th August to the 31st October, 1940, was fixed at 90,000 yards, of which 74,715 were licensed for importation.  For the current quarter the quota has been fixed at 90,000 yards.  In the case of Quota Order No. 41, the quota from 7th <Col N="365" /> August to 31st October was 200,000 yards, of which 186,948 were licensed for importation.  For the current quarter the quota has also been fixed at 200,000 yards.  In respect of Quota Order No. 42, the quota for the period 7th August to 31st October was 9,000,000 yards and the quantity licensed for importation was 8,563,000 yards.  In the current quarter for this year the quota has similarly been fixed at 9,000,000 yards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some day this House will have to face the question of whether we will go on with the quota racket or not.  I am as certain as that I am standing here that if this quota racket is allowed to continue this country will go the way of the Third Republic of France and the way of other countries that eventually became overwhelmed by corruption, by permitting this system to weigh down the Government and everybody else in the country.  There is no use in the Minister telling this House that he has made provision for the admission of immense quantities of stuff under these quota orders.  Quota orders beget rings&mdash; they cannot do anything else.  God knows it is nearly time the Labour Party, who protest so much about the robbing of the poor consumer in this country, should wake up to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every quota order that comes into this House is the foundation, upon which is built a new machine for squeezing the blood out of the poorest elements of this community.  The Labour Party have voted for them time and time again, and have stood for quotas and high protection.  Eyery quota adopted by the House has been used for the purpose of robbing the people of this country.  There you have the situation in front of you; you know what is going on and you know what is going to happen, and still these orders are brought before the House for ratification and extension.  Some of the men responsible for them may approach the matter in the best of good faith, not realising whither they are going, but the result of the whole thing is that flannelette, sheeting, ticken, shirting, terry towelling and all the current goods that the pour normally <Col N="366" /> buy, are going to be handed over as a complete monopoly to a tiny group of industrialists and a microscopic group of wholesalers, and nothing is going to happen for at least six months.  Everything will go on like a wedding bell, and a most conservative course will be pursued; but, at the end of six months, somebody responsible for the manufacturing costs will be making up the price of a new fabric and will probably say: &ldquo;Seven-sixteenths of a penny is all we can take on that.&rdquo; Someone else will ask: &ldquo;Why do you say that is all we can take on it?&rdquo;  The reply will be: &ldquo;Competition will knock us out if we put on any more.&rdquo;  Then will come the statement: &ldquo;There is not any competition in this country any longer; that is the old fashioned way to do business.  You do not make competitive price now; you put on a mark up that will give you a decent profit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The trade union organiser comes round and the demands of the trade unions have to be dealt with.  Put it on the calico; who the hell cares?  The poor fools in the country will have to pay it; they cannot go out naked, and so we stick it on.  Put on a penny and seven-sixteenths of a penny, and if anyone criticises it, call him a West Briton.  In all probability Deputy Childers will write a letter to the papers about the persistent persecution of Irish industry by the dastardly Deputy Dillon.  That will go down well. Give a banquet, and for God's sake do not forget to play the Soldier's Song at the end of it.  That is always worth three-farthings a yard if you are able to do it.  How long is this thing going to go on?  It will have to stop some day, and if it does not stop soon the people will make it stop.  And the worst of it is that when they rise up in protest against this kind of exploitation they will have grounds for rising that no honest man will be in a position to resist.  This quota system is designed for the persecution of the defenceless elements in our community.</P>

      <P>On many previous occasions, when quota orders were before the House for approval, the Deputy was informed that he must <Col N="367" /> confine himself to the actual quota order before the House and not range over the whole field of the quota system.  The debate is limited to the proposals submitted for approval or disapproval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not sneer at them, but I deplore the use of such methods as have been adopted.  They were unworthy of people of excellent national record in this country.  Let such records never be quoted in defence of the type of thing that is done to-day. Many people who suffered in the past gave everything and got nothing. Many people who boast to-day that they are patriots get everything and give nothing.  It sickens me to hear decent national records claimed as a justification for the disreputable transactions that are going on to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come down to these quota orders.  The Minister is a bit disingenuous when he thinks he has nothing to tell us in regard to these matters.  What is the history of the factory in Athlone?  Are not these orders designed to rescue the rotten hulk of that wrecked enterprise in Athlone?  Is it not true that the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave his consent to the putting there of a bankrupt Belgian company&mdash;consented to the establishment of a semi-fraudulent concern that was largely equipped with second-hand machinery and that then proceeded to turn out terry cloth and certain other products which no fish and chip shop would have attempted to offer to the public if it was not protected by a quota order?  And, despite the unsatisfactory nature of its products, and the scandalous prices asked for them, that company was on the verge of bankruptcy.  Is that not a fact, and is it not so that in that state of affairs the company had either to be allowed to close down or had to be rescued by a kind of reorganisation of the cotton industry whereunder the bankrupt Athlone concern was to be taken over by a solvent concern?  All <Col N="368" /> that is to be glossed over and hidden. All that is to be forgotten once these four quota orders are passed, but it will not be forgotten so long as I am here.  I say now that if transactions of this kind are to go on, they will lead our country into misunderstandings and difficulties far greater than those immediately concerned with the trifling industries affected by these orders.</P>
    <P>It is very easy, when you are speaking from the Olympian heights of Government, to forget the detailed application of orders of this kind. The Minister does not reflect when he puts a quota on flannelette that when I stand behind my counter in Ballaghaderreen every person who comes in to buy a garment of flannelette&mdash; and it is the poor who buy it&mdash;pays me a tax of from 7d. to 10d. a garment which goes into the coffers of the cotton millers of the country.  There is no escaping from it; nobody challenges it.  Nobody pretends that flannelette manufactured in this country, quality for quality, can compete in price with flannelette manufactured in Manchester. The differential, in my judgment, is about 2d. a yard.  That is a matter we could argue about for ever, because you have to consider the quality of the cloth and a variety of other surrounding circumstances, in addition to the actual price demanded for it.  I put the differential about 2d. a yard on the 1/- flannelette, going up to nearly 3d. on the 1/6 flannelette. That means that a person who buys 3½ yards pays me a tax of between 10½d. and 1/6 a garment.  As a matter of fact, I have seen good flannelette produced in this country but it is the price, the differential, upon which I am dwelling.</P>
    <P>The same applies to sheeting.  Say that a woman comes in to buy a pair of sheets.  Whatever approach the Irish manufacturers can make with regard to equality of price in the higher-grade sheeting, so far as the lower grades are concerned, they cannot compete at all.  I think it is no exaggeration to say that for a pair of sheets which a poor person buys&mdash;that is, the 54 inch sheeting; I am not referring to the 63 inch or the 72 inch&mdash;that person pays a tax of nearly 2/-.  In <Col N="369" /> regard to ticken, there is good ticken made in this country.  There was always Irish linen ticken sold in competition with ticken from any other part of the world, but here again it is the cheap cotton ticken that the poor must buy, which is going to bear the brunt of this burden.  That is not produced in this country at all, and the parson who buys two-and-a-half yards of double-width ticken, or five yards of single width ticken, to make a feather-bed or a tick, is going to pay a tax approximately of 4/- or 5/- more than if he could have bought it from England.</P>
    <P>Terry towelling is a quality of fabric you do not see in the houses of aristocrats. It is very largely used in the small country houses for the roller towel or for the coloured terry towel or the white terry towel.  The towels the Athlone Mills were asking 8/11 a dozen for were not worth 4/11 a dozen. I could have bought better towels in Great Britain for 4/11 than Athlone is asking 8/11 for.  I cannot carry the figures for all these products in my mind, but I remember that one.  We are going to have a Quota Order now to prevent us from getting the extern product at all and to force us to take the home product.  I think it is only right to sound this note of warning, that if you go too far in that direction the people will cease using terry towelling altogether; they will use bits of flour bags instead.  They will stand exploitation up to a point but, if you go too far, they will cease using it altogether.</P>
    <P>Then, printed shirting used in the manufacture of tunic shirts and sateen and woven shirting used in the manufacture of working shirts, are going to be made the subject of a Quota Order. Does the Minister understand what the quota on sateen shirting has meant in the price of a shirt?  It has increased the price of the average man's working shirt by about 10d. or 1/3 each.  I have sold shirts, quite good shirts, for 2/-, and the increase resulting from the quota is about 1/3 per shirt.  Is the House daft?  We are supposed to represent the people.  We spend the greater part of our time providing limited groups of individuals in this country with opportunities to plunder the <Col N="370" /> people and the rest of the time stumping the country telling the people they ought to like it and that, if they do not like being plundered by these small groups of individuals, they are not patriots, that they are frauds and traitors.  I am asking the Minister will he justify the further extension of quotas on cotton goods such as is suggested in these four orders, for I have heard nobody so far try to do it. There is one argument put forward, that it is vital to secure supplies of cotton yarn and that we might not have been supplied with them, were it not for the quota scheme.  I deny that.</P>
    <P>I say it is a perfectly rational thing to say to Britain: &ldquo;Very well; we will give you a preferential rate if you give us cotton yarns.&rdquo;  Some Deputies in this House will say: &ldquo;What is the difference between a tariff and a quota?  Why are you so vehement on the subject of quotas while you are prepared to tolerate a tariff?&rdquo;  There is this difference; that the tariff can never bring about the hide-bound ring and the ruthless exploitation that the quota invites.  Once a quota is got going, you have absolutely no remedy whatever against the quota racketeer. A lot of people imagine that if you make a quota which provides for the importation of goods far in excess of the nation's probable consumption, anybody can go in and import goods, and that so long as the quota is not exceeded the goods will come in.  That is not so.  If you want to import quotaed goods you first get your name inserted on the register.  Let us suppose that the Department adopts a liberal attitude in regard to such applications. Then you get a licence.  Suppose you buy a parcel of goods, your parcel of goods comes to the port and you then have got to dispatch your licence and the goods are then checked off from the licence.  The licence is then returned to you and your goods are subsequently released.  Now, if you are in a large way of business with a considerable clerical staff experienced in the handling of such documents, that really presents no serious difficulty.  But 90 per cent. of the merchants of this country are not in a large way of business; 90 per cent. of them have not got a large clerical staff; 90 <Col N="371" /> per cent. of them would simply give up importing altogether if they have to go through the elaborate machinery of dealing with the import quota system. I admit freely that once you get accustomed to it and know the run of it, it is comparatively easy to deal with.  But 90 per cent. of the people are not so accustomed, and the result is that you get a limited group of persons who make it their business to become accustomed to do it and who avail of the privilege they get as a result of exercising the quota freely to plunder the rest of the country who do not know how to go about it or who cannot take advantage of the licensing system.</P>
    <P>I am telling you now again that quotas beget racketeering in every industry to which they apply.  I am telling you that this quota should not be imposed.  The Chair limits our discussion to the particular quota here contemplated. But I oppose this quota, not only on the merits but as part of a rotten system, and I am certain that this quota and all those analogous to it will ultimately wreak havoc with our public life if they are continued.  I understood the Minister himself to say, about a year ago, that he himself had no love for quotas, that he shared my apprehension and dislike of the quota system and that, whatever our differences might be as to the expediency of using tariffs, we were probably much nearer one another on the subject of quotas.  This does not seem to look like it.  If this is a herald of what he is going to embark upon in the immediate future, it augurs ill for the future of the country.  So far as I am concerned, in any case, I want to make this clear: that so long as I can get a sufficient number of thousands of people to return me here I will attack quotas whenever they put their head up.  I will expose the combinations and organisations designed to foist them on the community, and wherever and whenever I can I shall take such steps as may be available to me to oppose them, to abolish them, no matter what the consequences to individuals may be, because they are the cruellest instrument of exploitation that could possibly be devised by Parliament, <Col N="372" /> they are the surest and broadest path down to corruption in public life and general demoralisation of the kind which undid and ultimately destroyed public affairs in France.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would have been more helpful if he put these particular orders in a clearer perspective, because, so far as I understand what is being done here in connection with cotton imports, something is being done which is a very considerable improvement on anything that has been done by quotas in the past; that it represents a piece of work for industrial development in the country and whatever is right, or whatever is wrong with it, deserves to be <Col N="373" /> put in proper perspective.  As I understand, this is the result of an agreement come to before the outbreak of the war, that is, that in the circumstances mentioned by the Minister discussions went on between the cotton manufacturers in this country and cotton manufacturers in Great Britain. There was a complete review of the situation and, as a result of a complete review of the situation by consultations between the manufacturers on both sides and the Department of Industry and Commerce, a certain view of the situation was taken and certain actions were proposed arising out of that.  An agreement was come to which, I understand, arranged for the reduction of tariffs on certain cotton goods; that is, that tariffs which had been put on cotton goods coming into the country were to be reduced and that a quota system was to be introduced entirely of a directional nature intended to improve the amount of trade the British manufacturers were getting in this country; and that the Department approved of that on the merits before ever the war came about.  It was recognised that there were over 3,000 persons living out of the cotton and linen industry in this country, that about £308,000 was paid in wages, and that under the system which was being adopted the industry was being reviewed here in order to see in what way, in fairness to the workers and in fairness to the general public here, an arrangement could be come to that would secure the retention, development and perfection of the industry here, retain the workers, reduce the price to the purchasers of even home manufactures, and give a better opening in our market to the British producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be a fair and reasonable approach to the situation, whatever may have been the circumstances or the complaints about building up the industry or the development of it, or whatever complaints there may have been previously with regard to tariffs or quotas.  I understand that there were no quotas applied to these goods before.  But, as I say, the scheme appears to me to reduce some of the tariffs, to apply quotas for a purpose for which quotas <Col N="374" /> have not been applied before, simply for a directional purpose, and that, arising out of that, when the war situation came, we found that even the making of an agreement which has not been completely implemented had so improved relations in trading between ourselves and Great Britain that we were able in very difficult times to secure for this country, as you might say, any yarn supplies that were necessary and to secure them at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that it would be a pity, in discussing this proposal here, not to recognise it for what it is, that is, a facing up to the situation that existed pre-September, 1939, a reduction in tariffs, establishing satisfactory arrangements for trading between ourselves and Great Britain, arising out of which, when the war came, we were able to secure yarn supplies for the country at a fairly favourable price. When in our present situation, we consider that there are, in fact, 3,590 persons employed in the industry, and that a sum of £308,000 is paid in salaries and wages, whatever complaints we may have had about the Government and, their industrial policy and the way they handled things, we ought not to pile on them more than they can bear.  We ought to try to look clearly at what exactly is being done in this case, and to feel that something is being done which is useful and which can be looked at from other points some other time, but from my point of view it is satisfactory to see the Government reducing tariffs, to see it establishing better trading relations between ourselves and Great Britain, to see it securing supplies of raw material, and to see that being done in circumstances in which the prices would be fairly reasonable and the supplies fairly secure.  As I say, it is satisfactory to see these things being done, and if there are 3,500 people depending on that industry in this country at the present moment, it is satisfactory for these people, at least, to see that they have some hope of continuity and fair conditions in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather disagree with the whole system of quotas, because, <Col N="375" /> after all, if it is necessary to have protection, a reasonable tariff is certainly something that can be defended, but then a quota, after that, is for nothing else except to increase the price of the home-manufactured article still more.  I cannot see any other purpose, because by raising the tariff or by lowering it you can regulate the inflow of goods into this country, and if a reasonable tariff is not able to keep these competitive goods from being imported here, then it is plain that there must be profiteering. If the unfortunate consumer were able to bear this increased cost, I would not complain, but what is the position?  I wish that this House would only examine the position and see how the people who are producing down the country are handicapped as compared with the people who are manufacturing these goods.  The people who are purchasing these articles, that are paying 100 per cent. over their world value, are selling their own produce at 50 per cent. under world value, and you may take the prices upon the open market in Great Britain as being the world value.</P>
      <P>These people are hit in two ways, and, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, it is all part of the system, and of the settled policy of differentiating in favour of one section of the people as against the other section, protecting one section of the people and keeping them at the top whilst treating others as inferior&mdash;treating as inferior the people who are the backbone of the country.  It is time that that distinction should be stopped, and it is time that the thing should be considered from a broad, national point of view and that the different classes in one part of the country should be treated as similar classes in other parts are treated.  It is time that there should be fair consideration and that this whole thing should be looked into.  I do not want to go into details, because I am becoming disgusted with details, but I want the whole system to be debated in this House, and I have a motion on the order paper for two years asking the Government and the House to deal with this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make it clear at the outset that the position of General Textiles, Limited, had nothing whatsoever to do with the making of this quota order.  As I explained&mdash;perhaps not too lucidly&mdash;in introducing these quota orders the decision to make cotton imports subject to quota restrictions was arrived at as a result of an agreement made between the British and Irish cotton manufacturers, somewhere, I think, in July of 1939.  In the making of that agreement, all the cotton manufacturers in this country participated, including, of course, General Textiles, Limited, Athlone.  I think it was very unwise, very unfair, and very injudicious of Deputy Dillon to take this occasion to attack an undertaking which is, at any rate, giving considerable employment in the town of Athlone, and which is now meeting the Irish market with products which, whether they are as good as they should be or not, at any rate are the only products available. To hear Deputy McGovern and Deputy Dillon talking one would imagine that the people of this country had the whole wide world to choose from when they wanted to buy flannelette or any cotton commodity whatever.  The fact of the matter is that for a large proportion of our requirements in these lines we are dependent upon the mills that are at present operating in this country and these mills, in turn, are dependent on the cotton supplies they are able to secure from Great Britain, and if we had not these mills and these supplies the people would have to go out and use flour bags, not merely, as Deputy Dillon suggested, for towels, but possibly for shirts as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was because of my recognition that it was essential that we should have some source of supply for these articles that I consented to give effect to this agreement.  Indeed the main consideration which weighed with me in giving effect to the agreement and in asking the Government to make these goods subject to quota restrictions was that, under the agreement, the supplies of raw materials would be reasonably assured for cotton mills and that 3,500 people would be maintained in employment.  In that connection I think that, from the point of view of the farming community with which <Col N="377" /> Deputy McGovern professes to be so concerned, it is a very important thing that 3,500 people should be kept in employment in towns like Athlone, towns like Dundalk and, of course, the City of Dublin, because these 3,500 people and their families are affording a very much bettor market for Deputy McGovern's constituents than can be got anywhere else in the world at the present time.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that we should think of these problems as a whole.  There is no use in coming along and crying down one sector of our industrial activity and starting to talk about how unfair it is to the country people that they should have to pay so much for the products of the townspeople, when the townsman could easily turn around and say how unfair it is to him to have to pay so much for the products of the country people.  That is not the way this country will win through the present world situation.  We have got to be fair to one another, and no Deputy in this House is capable of carrying the responsibilities of membership who, in present circumstances, simply for the sake of making a petty point in a debate like this, would try to get some section of the community against another.</P>

That is the sort of thing that brought down France, because you had one man trying to play off the peasants in the South of France against industrial workers in Paris and other large cities.

      <P>The 1928 Act provides that any scheme made thereunder may not come into force until it has been approved by resolution of both Houses.  Clause 2 of the scheme, as presented to the Dáil at its meeting on the 16th of last month, provided that the scheme should come into operation on the 31st day of October, 1940.  The Dáil did not pass the necessary motion of approval before it adjourned until to-day. It is, therefore, necessary to advance the date upon which the scheme will come into operation to the 30th of this month in the hope that the Dáil and Seanad will have approved of it before that date.</P>
      <P>As the date upon which the scheme comes into force is provided in the scheme, the changing of the date technically constitutes a new scheme.  This is the only change in the scheme which was before the House on the occasion of its last meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained the object of the scheme and the clauses it contained on the last occasion that the House met. Deputies will remember that the chief object was to give pensions to three <Col N="380" /> teachers who are at present exclude but for whom there seems to be a very good case.  The operative section is really confined to the case of three teachers specifically.  I am not aware of any other cases that the section would cover.  The other paragraphs are really of a technical nature.  This scheme covers circumstances which may not arise, but in matters affecting superannuation it is very necessary that we should be as precise as possible, and in order, to avoid possible trouble in the construction of certain articles in the existing scheme we have introduced this amendment.  There is no change of a substantial or fundamental nature in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this scheme, but I wish to remind the Minister that there is a small number of teachers, some of them with over 40 years service to the community, who did not get pensions under the original scheme of 1934.  When that scheme was being discussed with the Minister by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation I was one of those who took part in the discussion, and at that time I reminded the Minister and the Departmental officials that these teachers did not come under the scheme then being introduced, by reason of the fact that they had retired from the service some time previously. It may be said that these teachers had hardly not any claim, but a similar scheme to bring junior assistant mistresses and convent teachers, to which I am referring, was introduced in the Northern Parliament.  A similar scheme was to be introduced in this part of Ireland, but unfortunately delays occurred and some of the teachers to whom the scheme would apply if they were in the service were then ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the conference I reminded the Minister and the officials that these teachers were still unprovided for. There is no doubt that many of them, especially the convent teachers, were debarred from pension rights by a penal clause that the British Government, which was the educational authority at the time, had, because they taught in convent schools.  These teachers did the same work as teachers in ordinary day schools, and many of <Col N="381" /> them were very highly qualified.  When introducing the scheme on October 16, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cases of the small number of teachers to whom this amending scheme will apply are deserving of special consideration in view of the essentially national character of their work in fostering the Irish language and culture under difficult circumstances and at considerable personal financial loss.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree when I say that the very same case could be made for those convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses who were debarred from the provisions of the 1934 scheme, by reason of the fact that they had retired from the service. Now I want to emphasize one point: if the scheme in which it was intended to bring these teachers under pension rights had not been held up and delayed, they would have that right.  They had the years of service, but unfortunately through this delay they were debarred.  When this was pointed out to the Minister and his Department officials at the conference, we were promised tacitly that they would be considered if the number was not too great.  I was not in a position at the time, neither was the I.N.T.O., to say exactly what the number was, but we knew that it could not be very large.  The convent teachers who were concerned were confined principally to the cities and that would not mean very many, and we were told that if the number was not large there was a possibility that they would be brought in.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced and passed and they were not brought in, and some time afterwards, when I met the Minister on a deputation, I inquired as to the fate of those teachers and he said that the number was so small that it was not worth bothering about it.  But now it is worth bothering about three.  As I said at the outset, I have no objection to that, but I would like that the Minister would consider even now the claims of this very small number of very deserving teachers who have given very long and faithful service to the community.  I have said that the reason they had not <Col N="382" /> pension rights was that there was a certain penal enactment against them, that because they were in convent schools which were run by religious orders they were thereby debarred from having pension rights.</P>
    <P>I tried to amend this scheme in some way, to bring these in, but unfortunately the Rules of the House did not allow me to mention the particular case in the scheme.  I would appeal to the Minister very strongly to recognise that their cases are equally deserving of consideration as the cases that are under consideration at the moment.  I would appeal to him to make provision for them&mdash;and that can be done easily and quickly&mdash;whereby these teachers will have pension rights for the few remaining years of their lives.  Another argument that can be put forward is that when these teachers gave their services they received very small salaries and were not able to make any provi&amp;ion for old age, on account of the meagre salaries they received from the then Government, and in that way I am afraid that many of them are in destitute circumstances.  They have a case equally as strong as that of the three who are being considered under this scheme.  They have given service to the nation; they had to exist on small salaries; many of them are now in destitute circumstances, and they were hopeful, when this amended scheme was announced in the Press, that their cases would be considered and provision made for them.  I do not think it is too late to appeal to the Minister to take their cases into consideration. Of course, in 1934 and 1935 the number was between 50 and 60, but death has taken away many of them, and the number is now very small, and the cost would not be great.  In any case, the justice of the matter should outweigh the consideration of the cost, and I would appeal to the Minister to take them into consideration and see if he could not, either under this scheme or under some other scheme, bring them in and give them the pension rights that they would have now but for the delay in the original scheme in 1934.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Hurley was raised in 1934 when, <Col N="383" /> as he has just stated, he made an unsuccessful attempt to amend the superannuation scheme which was then introduced.  The position then was that we gave a promise to consider these cases, bat were not able to include the cases of teachers who had already left the service.  I have no power at present to include in any scheme teachers who have already left the service: I have only power to include teachers who are still teaching.  If the principle is going to be admitted&mdash;which we were not able to accept then&mdash;that we should give pensions retrospectively to people who had already left the service before the scheme was introduced, it means, in the first place, that the 1928 Act would have to be amended to enable the Minister to get these powers, and secondly, there would be an inevitable question as to where we are going to stop&mdash;if we are going to go back to 1923 or to 1916 or to 1905.</P>
      <P>The number of cases is small, certainly, but I do not think it is quite fair to argue that, because there was a number of cases of teachers whom we were not able to include in the 1934 scheme, by reason of the fact that we were not entitled to consider teachers who had already left the service, there is any basis of comparison whatever with the cases of the three teachers with whom we are now dealing.  The Deputy probably is not aware of the circumstances of the cases.  They are quite unusual and are not likely to recur.  The three teachers are highly qualified people who gave special service in connection with the Irish language and who have been serving for a very long period of years.  In respect of the added years for which they are to receive credit, because they were performing services similar to those which they are now carrying out, they will still have to pay their premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of the two cases to which Deputy Hurley refers&mdash;the untrained assistants&mdash;when they entered the service there was no question of their getting pensions at all: they entered the service on that basis, and the fact that a great many years subsequently a scheme was introduced which brought in a large number of teachers does not seem to me to give them any legal or <Col N="384" /> even, perhaps, moral claim to be included. The numbers were certainly rather small, but they were scattered over a long period of years from 1922 to 1934, and we would not be able to have them included, and I see no prospect of including at any time in any amended scheme the cases of teachers who have already left the service.  I can see great difficulties in getting acceptance of that principle if I should come into this House to ask for powers. I doubt if the Oireachtas would be prepared to give powers to a Minister to bring in teachers, or any class of public servant, under a scheme when they had already left their employment. It is a precedent, I think, that could not be accepted.  I regret I cannot hold out any hope, therefore, for reconsideration of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, in so far as its contributory provisions affect persons engaged in agricultural employment.</P>
      <P>Under the Act of 1935, which is the Principal Act, the normal contributions were fixed at 8d. per week for a man and 4d. per week for a woman, the employer paying half the contribution in respect of males and the whole of the contribution in respect of females.  In return for these contributions, contributory pensions are payable at the rate of 10/- a week for a widow, 5/- a week for the eldest dependent child of a widow, 3/- a week in respect of each other dependent child of a widow and 7/6 a week in respect of each orphan child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> The Principal Act, however, also provides that during the five years beginning on the second appointed day (which was the 6th January, 1936), these rates of contribution and benefit should be modified in their application to persons and the widows and orphans of persons engaged in agricultural employment. Instead of the full contribution of 8d. for a man and 4d. for a woman the contributions for agricultural workers' were fixed at 4d. per week for a man, of which half is payable by the employer and 2d. a week for a woman, paid in full by the employer. This provision is contained in Section 38 (1) (b) and Part II of the Sncond Schedule of the 1935 Act.  The effect of this provision is to require from persons employed in agriculture only half the rate of contributions applicable to persons engaged in nonagricultural employments.  The contributory pensions payable in return for these contributions are 8/- a week for a widow, 4/- a week for the eldest dependent child of a widow, 2/6 a week for each other dependent child of a widow and 6/- a week for an orphan child.  These provisions are contained in Section 10 (2) and 12 (2) of the 1935 Act.  It will be seen that whereas the agricultural rate of contribution is only half of the non-agricultural rats, the contributory pensions payable to the widows and orphans of insured persons engaged in agriculture are approximately 80 per cent. of those payable to the widows and orphans of other insured workers.</P>
    <P>These reduced rates of contribution and benefit were to remain in force only for a period of five years from 6th January, 1936, and under the law as it stands at present, the position is that on 6th January next, the full contributions of 8d. and 4d. will be payable in respect of all insured workers, including insured workers in agriculture.  On the other hand, the rates of contributory pension now applicable to the widows and orphans of insured persons employed in agriculture will become the rates at present applicable to the widows and orphans of insured persons who were not engaged in agricultural employment. In other words, if those sections of the 1935 Act which provide for reduced <Col N="386" /> rates of contribution and contributory pension in respect of agricultural employment, are allowd to lapse, the contributions of insured persons employed in agriculture will be doubled while the corresponding rates of contributory pension will be increased only by one-quarter approximately. The Government is of the opinion that, this is not desirable and the present Bill now before the House is designed to provide that these provisions will not lapse on the 6th January next.  In effect the Bill will merely preserve in the future the present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this proposal there are two matters which I wish to raise. It is true to say that, in the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary states the case, it appears at first glance as if the agricultural labourer has an advantage, but it is also right to bear in mind that the industrial worker, whose widow gets a contributory pension, is normally a person who has been working all his life under the Conditions of Employment Act which provides for him an eight-hour day, a weekly half-holiday and trade union rates of wages.  The agricultural labourer receives 30/- a week and works a 54-hour week with no half-day, and, at the end of a long life of hard work, when he comes to die, this House proclaims that the stomachs of his children can be filled on 4/- and on 2/6, whereas the stomachs of the children of the industrial worker require 5/- and 3/- to fill them.  Now, it is this House that, fixes the agricultural rate of wages, and God knows they did not break their hearts when they were doing it.  They did not break their hearts because, as we all know&mdash;I do not propose to go into the matter in detail now&mdash;this House had wrought such havoc on the agricultural industry that it was not able to pay more than 30/-, and hardly able to pay that.</P>

      <P>But we in this House empowered them to do it, and if we were fixing it we could not increase it <Col N="387" /> because of the havoc we had wrought in the agricultural industry, in which Deputy Pattison had a full part.  We ourselves created a situation in which the agricultural labourer is unable to get more than 30/- a week.  Let us not run away from that&mdash;that we can burn a house down and then pretend that we have no matches in our pockets, it was this House that did the job.  Now we announce that we are going to make it a permanent feature of Irish social life, that the widow of anyone who works on the land must do with less during her widowhood than the widow of anyone who works in a town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an inquiry set up to see why there is a flight from the land.  To live on the land in this country is to mark yourself out as a social pariah.  You get less wages, less social service, more burdens to carry, more insolence and more codology than any other section of the community, and then, to add insult to injury, you are told that you are better off than anybody else. Senator O Buachalla tells us, in one direction, that we are all thriving and prosperous, while the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government tells us that 2/6 is better than 3/-, if we look at it in the right way, and that no man would be so foolish as to take a pension of 10/- a week for his widow if he could get 8/-, and thinks that the House is proposing to confer an extraordinary benefit on the agricultural worker by the amendment here proposed.  I think that any such representation is fantastic.  I suggest to the House that, in view of the fact that we here in Dáil Eireann, have wrecked the agricultural industry and have constrained the labourers in that industry to accept 30/- a week, we should be prepared to give the widows of those men the same allowances as townspeople of 10/- for a widow, 5/- for the first child and 3/- for each succeeding child without increasing the weekly contributions of those labourers.  Is that an excessive claim to make on the Treasury?  I have not got actuarial calculations before me to guide me as to what that would cost, but I know it could not be a substantial sum.  The number of widows of agricultural <Col N="388" /> labourers who are in this country is comparatively small.  The number of orphans of agricultural labourers in this country is certainly very small.  Consequently, the burden of such a remission as I suggest would be trifling.  Is it unreasonable to ask it?  I think not.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that we should repeal the section which would automatically raise the contribution of the agricultural labourer to 8d. and 4d., and that we should allow to stand the section which brings the rate of benefit up to 10/-, 5/- and 3/-, because we are satisfied that the weekly wage of the agricultural labourer during his active period of life is manifestly insufficient to permit of his laying by any savings to meet the catastrophe of early death, at a time when his widow and children were solely dependent on his earnings. The second point I want to make is one which was raised by question and answer to-day at an earlier stage.  This Bill applies to agricultural workers. That term has a variety of interpretations in the several statutes passed by this House.  Sometimes it is taken to mean one class of person.  Then comes another Bill and the term &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; for the purpose of that Bill means another class of person.  In the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, the term &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; is deemed to exclude horticultural workers&mdash;the people who work in market gardens.  That exclusion was, apparently, decided upon because it was thought that, although agricultural and horticultural workers labour on the land, the circumstances surrounding the work they normally do are fundamentally different.  The horticultural workers largely work in market gardens and other sorts of gardens in and around urban areas.  Their general circumstances are more closely analogous to those of the industrial worker than they are to those of the rural worker living in the country with the amenities of the country available to him.  I want, that principle to be carried into the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Bill.  I want the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; in the Holidays (Employees) Act to be accepted for the purpose of the Principal Art in this case and the amending Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> In justification of that, I should like to give the House particulars of a case which recently came under my notice. A widow whose husband had been employed in a city nursery received 19/6 per week when her husband died because her husband was deemed to have been an agricultural labourer.  In the room next to her in the same tenement house was the widow of a man who was engaged in employment quite close to where her husband worked.  Her family circumstances were similar, and she was getting 24/- per week.  That is an obvious anachronism which ought to be corrected.  I think that the definition in the Holidays (Employees) Act is the better one.  However, if my original suggestion is accepted&mdash;that we grant to the agricultural labourer the benefit of the industrial worker's contributory pension without increasing his contribution&mdash;my second point will not arise.  Lest my bona fides in mentioning it be questioned, I think it would be quite legitimate to require the horticultural worker to be ranked as an industrial worker and to pay the industrial worker's contribution.  I think that he is living under industrial workers' conditions and that he is getting rates of pay approximating to those which industrial workers are getting.</P>

I do not remember any time in the last 20 years when the agricultural workers were receiving higher wages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the case Deputy Dillon has made.  I differ from him when he says that the harsh treatment of agricultural labourers began in the last few years.  In fact, native government has done nothing for the agricultural labourers since it was established.  Looking back over the years before 1922, the only achievement on behalf of the agricultural labourers must be credited to the British Government, who provided for the building of labourers' cottages. Many of the people who then manned the local authorities decided they would put the labourers' cottages in the most backward and most remote places. The agricultural labourer has not only been an outcast during the past few years, but as long as any of us remember, and there is a very good case for doing something for him in connection with this Bill.  I heartily support the proposal that the benefits to the widows of agricultural labourers should be increased without a corresponding increase in the contribution.  I hope it is permissible to say that, within the limited framework of the Act and with the manifold defects contained in it, those responsible for administering it have, to the knowledge of those of us who come in contact with that Department, done their work very satisfactorily.</P>

Some tribute is, I thihk, required from us for the manner in which the officials of the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Branch have handled the difficulties that confronted them and for the sympathy which they showed in interpreting the narrow provisions of the Act. The present proposal, if adopted, would be a great improvement and would be <Col N="392" /> some measure of recognition of the value of the most neglected class in our community.</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to whether the point I wish to raise is relevant, but it is a matter which would seem to have been overlooked in the previous Act, that is, where a husband who has been in insurable occupation for a number of years dies before the Act qualifies his widow for a contributory pension and the widow goes to work in insurable occupation and continues in such occupation up to and, in some cases, after the time the Act came into operation, the widow is debarred from a contributory pension. We have experience of cases of extreme hardship where these women, even though they were in insurable occupation after the death of the husband who had been in insurable occupation previous to the qualifying date set out in the original Act, are debarred from the benefits of contributory pensions, and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whether, at this stage, that matter could be dealt with in conjunction with these proposals, or, if not, that, at some future date, the whole matter could be reviewed in a manner which would enable the House to do justice to these people.  I admit that every case could not be covered, but these are outstanding cases.  There are very few of them in the country, so far as I am aware, but they are cases of extreme hardship.  It is strange that simply because a husband dies a short time prior to the date specified and his widow subsequently goes into insurable employment, she should lose out on both occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my disappointment with the action of the Government in bringing in this amending Bill, because if there is anything long overdue, it is an improvement in the position of the widows and orphans in this country.  Not alone is the amount they receive inadequate, but the means test which is applied is unworthy of the country.  I think the point which Deputy Flynn had in mind is that a man could be in insurable occupation for the last <Col N="393" /> 20 years and, because he is unemployed for the past two years and dies at the end of that period, his widow and orphans will not receive the contributory pension.  To he honest with myself and with the members opposite, I say that this amending Bill is unworthy and is not the occasion for paying tributes to anybody, because the whole thing is so meagre and insufficient. If there is one section in this country who require treatment and looking after, it is the widows and orphans.  I know widows who go out at 7 o'clock in the morning to wash offices, and the moment it is discovered that they are doing that, a certain amount is taken off their non-contributory as well as their contributory pensions.  It is time the means test was ended, and I think the introduction of an amending Bill of this character for the purpose of continuing the present benefits, unworthy of any Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals entirely with the particular scheme.  It seems to me that, under the present arrangement, which will lapse on 6th January next, if this Bill is not passed, the agricultural industry is faring rather well within the framework of the finances of the scheme.  Half contributions are paid in respect of persons engaged in agricultural employment&mdash; half the contribution paid in respect of industrial workers&mdash;and for that half contribution the widow becomes entitled to a pension of 8/- per week as compared with a pension of 10/- per week if the full contribution were paid. Most of the agricultural workers, as Deputies appreciate, live in rural Ireland, and I think it could reasonably be argued that 8/- per week in rural Ireland has as high a purchasing value as 10/- per week in cities or towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy's case is that the entire contributory pension scheme is inadequate, that is a diferent case altogether, but we are not dealing with that matter in this Bill. It is quite proper for the Deputy to draw the attention of the House and the Government to the desirability of making more generous provision for our widows and orphans as a whole, but that is a bigger question with which I do not propose to deal at present. I do submit, however, that, within the financial structure of the present Bill, the widows of agricultural workers are faring rather well.  I submit that 8/- per week in rural Ireland is as valuable as 10/- per week in a city, and perhaps a little more so, and for that 8/- they pay half of the contribution which the worker in industrial occupation pays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggests that the extra money necessary to bring the rate <Col N="395" /> of pension of the agricultural worker up to 10/- per week should be borne by the Exchequer.  I suppose that line of argument would be popular in certain circles.  The agricultural labourers would probably like it; but would it be fair?  Would we not have other sections of industry putting forward a similar claim?  Assuming for the sake of argument that the agricultural industry is at present in a depressed condition&mdash;and there are people who do not agree that it is&mdash;the Government will be called upon to subsidise the pension scheme to the extent of £60,000 per annum in order that the benefit should be increased from 8/- to 10/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the Parliamentary Secretary get that figure of £60,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the figure which it is estimated that the increase in the contribution would bring in; that is, if the agricultural workers went on to the normal contribution of 8d. and 4d. instead of 4d. and 2d., it would involve a sum of £60,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It amounts to a subsidy of £60,000 to the agricultural industry. If, in fact, other industries are depressed or become depressed, will the case be made that the Government should come along and pay the contributions towards the widows' and orphans' pensions fund?  If you do it for the agricultural industry, I see no logical reason why you should not do it for any industry which gets into a depressed condition.</P>

      <P>One of the great troubles in this country for a number of years&mdash;I am sure it has been brought to the notice of every Deputy in the House&mdash;is that type of road which serves anything from two to 22 families, and from which there is no exit at the other end.  The trouble is that that type of road has been left altogether to be done by the family or families who are using it.  Very often the road not only leads to a number of dwelling-houses or farmhouses but also leads to a bog, and in the summer time it is used by a large number of people from great distance away, with the result that the <Col N="399" /> road is badly cut up.  I understand that the local authority is not empowered to spend money out of the rates for the upkeep of roads such as that.  If that is so, I think the Minister would be excluding from the scope of the Unemployment (Relief Works) Bill a work which might very usefully be left there, because there is no doubt that very useful work might be done and useful employment given.  If you have five or ten families using that particular road, we all know what happens, what is everybody's business is nobody's business; one man is prepared to do the work and the others are not, with the result that the work is left undone.  I would ask the Minister to see whether anything can be done in this matter, and would suggest that it should he brought within the scope of a Bill such as this, which is a Bill to provide employment, and useful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Chief Baron Palles in the 19th century ruled that a road of public utility is a definition which includes this class of roads.  That would be more familiar to the Minister for Local Government than to me.  I agree heartily with the Deputy who has just spoken.  If the Minister is not pcepared to go the whole way to meet that situation I wonder would it be possible in a Bill of this kind to provide that the local authority might provide metal at a nominal rate, provided the persons who live on these roads would go and repair them themselves.  I find there is growing up in the country a very widespread idea that, if you want something, if you want the front doorstep swept, you leave it dirty until you can get some local authority to come and do it.  I think Deputy Morrissey will agree with me that when he and I were young if your road was not metalled you went out and metalled it yourself.  You got a few neighbours together and went out and metalled the roads, throwing a few loads this year and a few more the next, and so on, until you got it done.  But since we got the minor relief schemes and a variety of other schemes nobody seems to regard it as any part of his duty at <Col N="400" /> all to keep up his own street.  It used to be the way that if the landlord's man came upon your street when your rent was paid up, you turned the dog on him, with a certain pride.  Now any tramp can come up your road.  I suggest that metal should be given to people who undertake to repair these by-roads leading up to their houses or villages, as they often do at 6d. or 1/- a cart, and that wherever a stone-breaker was working any useful person who desired to provide a by-way of this kind should have a right to claim from the local authority's surveyor so much stones as the surveyor considered requisite for the proper repair of a road indicated to him by the applicant for stone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, before the Minister replies, what the position is?  It is all right for Deputy Dillon to talk about what used to happen. What we are concerned with is what is going to happen if this particular type of road is completely excluded. Under the recent scheme of the Department of Agriculture, providing grants for the improvement of farms and farmworks, a farmer can get up to 50 per cent. of the cost.  For what? For making his farmyard.  He can get 50 per cent. of the cost of making a road on his farm, but the repair of a road which may be serving anything from one to ten or 15 families, and which at a particular season of the year, if there happens to be a bog on that road, may be serving 40 or 50 families, is nobody's business, and the result is that those roads may become almost a danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for Deputy Dillon to say the people should do it themselves. I can agree with that but the fact is that if there are five or six families living on the road, one person may be very anxious to do it and may do his part but another may refuse to do anything at all about it.  That has happened in regard to drainage and everything else.  There is no use in one farmer getting his drains cleaned and deepened if the farmer on the next farm refuses to do anything at all.  I think, if we are out to do useful work and to do work which is going to give the highest amount of labour we ought <Col N="401" /> not to exclude that particular sort of work, particularly when another Government Department is prepared to give up to 50 per cent. of the cost to a farmer making a road on his own farm or actually making his farmyard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with Deputy Morrissey's point of view in this matter.  I think I had some difficulty some years ago about that particular Section 25 of the 1925 Act.  A local body cannot make a road unless it connects with two public roads, but I think a good deal of that complaint has disappeared since these minor relief schemes have been availed of, and while there may be difficulties here and there about those roads, in the main, I think, they have been able to be met out of the unemployment relief schemes.  There is no way, I think, in which you can provide the metal or the material which Deputy Dillon has in mind, that is to hand it over to local people to utilise.  I do not think there is any power in the local authority to do that, but in this Bill we are going on the powers that are there already in the local authority and I would not in this Bill propose to make any alteration in that Section 25 of the 1925 Act.  As I say, I believe that in the main they can be met out of the minor relief schemes that have been made available.  I know the difficulty may arise from time to time that the extent of unemployment might not justify that.  That is a difficulty undoubtedly but in the main the county surveyor is in touch with the administration of these minor relief schemes and where he finds himself in the position of having to deal with the case of such a road as Deputy Morrissey has in mind I think the county surveyor can avail himself of the unemployment relief schemes to try to get the work done in that way.</P>

      <P>I just wanted to make this point.  As a matter of fact, I quite agree with the Minister that to a large extent the problem has been met for the moment out of the minor relief schemes, but the trouble is going to arise again, because what happens is this: just like the Land Commission when they divide an estate, they make a road; it is left there; nobody is responsible for the maintenance; nobody puts a shovel of stones when a hole appears in it and in three or four years it is just as bad, or perhaps worse than it originally was and the money is, to a certain extent, wasted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point that works of this kind have been met out of minor relief schemes, there is the fact that in a good many areas minor relief schemes have been held up and often cancelled where grants have been made and expense incurred by the officials of the Board of Works because, perhaps, one of the persons whose land was affected objected.  If this Bill were applied to such work it would meet that difficulty.  Therefore, I think that this amendment should not be carried through unless the Minister would be prepared at a later stage to introduce some amendment in the Bill to make this Bill applicable to minor relief works so that the work could he carried out even though there might be some minor objection.</P>

    <P>(2) The local authority shall be deemed to be carrying out such work with all reasonable speed if the work is undertaken within the financial <Col N="404" /> year commencing after the date of the Minister's certificate and proceeded with without avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet the difficulty that I raised on the Committee Stage, the difficulty of a local authority receiving a certificate perhaps immediately after it had struck its rate.  The amendment is designed to overcome that by providing that if they start on the work within the next financial year it will satisfy the requirements of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy wants to have emphasised by this particular amendment is that after the local authority has made its estimate and struck its rate, it should not then be called upon to undertake work which was not provided for within the rate. One of the disadvantages of an institution such as this legislature is that it prides itself upon its immoral financial method of doing business.  The local authority is much more moral, much more exact.  It specifies the undertaking before it puts the liability on the citizen; it indicates what sum it is going to expend and, having done that, it strikes the rate and it cannot spend any more than what is definitely specified.  Here in the legislature one can spend anything at any time; all that is necessary is a vote.  The Deputy merely wants to bring the Minister back to the moral path and keep him in the same position as the local authority, fairly honest, if that be possible.</P>

I sympathise with Deputy Benson and Deputy Doyle in their view as to the position of the local authority, <Col N="405" /> but what about the unfortunate ratepayer? He usually gets some notice; he sees a headline in the paper about the rate that is about to be struck in his district.  He more or less strikes his own budget in order to meet that rate.  If, just a short time after that has appeared in the paper, another few shillings are added to the rates and the ratepayer has to provide for that increase, then I think we are heading for national bankruptcy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the amendment is that it creates too rigid a procedure.  If a corporation or other local body wants to undertake a work it can sometimes borrow for that work. In the case of works that I have in mind, practically all of them would be initiated by the local authorities themselves. They might want to undertake them at a certain time, but, on the other hand, you may have local authorities that might not be anxious, although it might be desirable to have certain works done, to go ahead with them.  If the House accepts the amendment the position will be that the Dublin Corporation, or any other local authority, could say that they would undertake certain work in January, but they might not carry out that work until the following March 12 months; that is, they would have more than the whole following financial year in which to defer carrying it out.  That would be the position if we accept the amendment as laid down here.  That would be something like 15 months, and you would be put in the position that you could not do anything.</P>

    <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Minister has consented to the borrowing of moneys by a local authority for the purpose of defraying the expenses of one or more certified works by means of the creation and issue of stock (in this sub-section, referred to as new stock), and</P>
    <P>(b)  moneys are held by such local authority in a redemption fund for the purpose of the redemption of any stock (in this sub-section referred to as existing stock) previously issued by such local authority,</P>
    <P>the Minister may by order authorise such local authority to exchange, by agreement with the holders, all or any of the existing stock which is required to be redeemed within a period not exceeding five years from the date of such order for new stock equal in nominal value to the nominal value of the existing stock so exchanged and to withdraw from the appropriate account or accounts in such redemption fund and expend for the purposes of such certified work or works and for the expenses (if any) of such exchange an amount equal to the nominal value of the existing stock so exchanged.</P>
    <P>(2)  Moneys borrowed by a local authority for the purposes of a certified work shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of such local authority for the purposes of any enactment limiting the amount which may be borrowed by such local authority or limiting the amount which may be borrowed by such local authority otherwise than in pursuance of a provisional order confirmed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to enable a local authority, if it wishes to borrow money to defray the expenses of certified works by means of the creation of stock, to exchange existing stock with the, consent of the holders of such stock, in cases where that stock is to be redeemed within five years.  If the holders of such stock consent, new stock will be issued to them and the <Col N="409" /> money for that purpose will be taken from the redemption fund of the existing stock.

      <P>The only portion of the amendment to which I would object is sub-section (2), which states that the money borrowed for the purposes of a certified work by a local authority shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of such local authority.  The point, I think, is that there was some object in appointing a statutory limit beyond which a local authority could not borrow.  It does not seem to me that there is any good reason for departing from that limit.  I think that in many cases there is far too much of a tendency to borrow for works which really should not be of a capital nature.  I think it is a pity that further power should be given to go outside the statutory limits.  The Minister, of course, will say that this is an emergency measure and that it is intended to deal with the emergency only, but I think that, as a limit has been imposed, it should be adhered to unless there is very good reason for not doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a similar provision in some other Acts.  As a general rule, the limit to the amount which can be borrowed is double the valuation.  As regards emergency works, I think it is probably unlikely that the amount borrowed would be very much because the contribution from the State would be fairly high, but this section here would enable something more to be done than is contemplated as emergency measures.  It would enable a local authority to borrow for the building of houses.  That is the object behind the amendment, that the corporation may be able to avail of certain moneys which they could apply to the building of houses.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the principle of the amendment is a good one.  I entirely agree with Deputy Benson that if borrowing is to be <Col N="410" /> undertaken by local authorities in the ordinary way&mdash;and this is in the ordinary way, although the money may be utilised for extraordinary purposes arising, as the Minister says, out of an emergency&mdash;and if the time for redemption is the normal time allowed, the amount borrowed should be reckoned as debt.  There is no use in pretending that we are not going into debt if we are going into debt.  Let us get a true picture of the situation.  If the Minister came in here and said: &ldquo;We will advise and permit local authorities to borrow money, but the redemption period will be of such short duration that we will not regard such moneys as public debt&rdquo;, one could understand this proposal.  But the Government does not prescribe any such conditions. The debt is going to be raised in the same way as on previous occasions and ft should be regarded as ordinary debt.</P>

    <P>In the course of the discussion on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, Deputy Cosgrave expressed the fear that the powers proposed to be given to the Land Commission under Section 59 might be utilised in some cases in such a way that any compensation that may be payable to a farmer who holds his land from the Land Commission might be applied towards a reduction of the capital still due by the tenant purchaser and thereafter toward a reduction of any arrears of the annuity which may have accumulated. The result would be that the tenant farmer would get no immediate benefit from the compensation awarded to him. This amendment has been introduced to meet that.  It will make it obligatory on the Land Commission to apply the compensation moneys in reduction of the arrears before any part of it is applied towards redemption of the annuity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last evening, when dealing with the Second Stage of this Bill, I intervened in the debate simply to point out, first of all, that I was very disappointed with the Minister's statement and with the report of the Electricity Supply Board in so far as there is no reference whatever made by the Minister, and no reference in any report of the Electricity Supply Board, to the consideration of rural electrification in this country.  I think it is an important aspect and it ought not be overlooked. The late Government had sufficient enterprise to initiate the electrification of the country, and at that time we were told by the then Minister that in order to make the scheme pay it was not necessary to include rural electrification and that neither was it necessary to include industrial electrification for the country; but very definitely, at that time, hopes were held out to our rural population that, at some future date, rural electrification of this country would be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what I want to point out is this.  We are continually stressing in this House and outside this House that our agriculturists are being licked in competition with other countries in the market in which we sell our produce. I read some time ago where Deputy Childers referred to New Zealand production and said that it was a red lamp of warning to our agriculturists in this country.  What is the position of New <Col N="423" /> Zealand agriculturists and Irish agriculturists? Even on this alone we are very seriously handicapped, because the New Zealand farmers have rural electrification there, and all their work, such as milking, sterilising, separating, churning, bottling, and all the other operations in a dairying country like New Zealand, are done by means of power on the farm supplied from a national scheme.  It is a matter that deserves serious consideration, that if we are going to compete with countries that are putting up very keen competition against us, we must keep in step with them at all events if we hope to compete with them, and we must equip our agriculturists as well as the agriculturists of other countries are equipped so that they can produce food at a minimum cost.</P>
    <P>There is not a doubt about it, electrification on the farm, and especially on the bigger farms, is going to be very helpful to our agriculturists.  As I have said, in the case of the dairy farmer you can do your milking, your sterilising, your separating, your churning, your bottling, and all the work of that sort on a dairy farm, by means of it. In the case of a mixed farm you can pulp turnips, bruise corn, run a small saw and do pumping when necessary, and that is essential on a good many farms, too, because you have not a proper water supply and you have no pressure supply, and if you had electricity on the farm you could have a proper water and pressure supply, especially on the bigger farms, and after all it is the bigger farms you must look to for the big output for our exports.</P>
    <P>That has been completely neglected. I was greatly disappointed that no reference whatever is made either in the report of the board or in the Minister's statement to that aspect of the case.  The Minister told us, in column 276, volume 81, of the Official Reports, that provision is also being made for a substantial sum for extensions to consumers and for the development of new areas.  In effect, what does that mean from a production point of view? It simply means nothing, because most <Col N="424" /> of the towns and villages of the country that have yet to be supplied with electricity are small rural towns and villages with no industry whatever and with no output from an industrial or productive point of view.  Accordingly, from the productive point of view, the extension of that scheme, according to the Minister's intention and the board's intention, is worthless.</P>
    <P>There is one consideration, in my opinion, that ought to weigh in all matters of this sort, especially where there is a big sum of money involved, and that is, what effect it is going to have on production and how it is going to be helpful in increasing production in this country.  The countries that were our competitors formerly and that, I suppose, are likely to be our competitors in normal times&mdash;countries such as Denmark and Holland&mdash;for breakfast commodities are countries that always believed in electricity. Denmark was a country that always believed in electricity and, prior to a national scheme there, they believed in generating electricity by running windmills all over the country, and they had a power supply to the farms by the old method of running a windmill to generate power.  They had that power there all the time before they had a national scheme.</P>
    <P>In the same way, in the case of Holland, they supplied current even on their poultry farms for the incubation of eggs, for brooders, and for all that sort of work that is necessary on a poultry farm and that requires current, whereas we still have the old obsolete method of the paraffin oil lamp.  Sweden has its rural electrification; Denmark and Holland have it, as I said, and Canada also.  A great many of the United States have it, notably Ontario, in the vicinity of Niagara Falls, where the great power station is.  This Province is intensely developed.</P>
    <P>New Zealand and all these countries with which we have to come into competition are far better equipped than we are.  They are infinitely better equipped in that way because they have rural electrification and we have not anything to approach it, and when we begin to talk about competition <Col N="425" /> from these far, distant countries it must be remembered that with modern transport all these countries are brought much closer to our market from the competition point of view. We can only restore prosperity in rural Ireland by adopting modern methods in agriculture, and from that point of view alone we are absolutely out of the picture.  As I said, there is no reference whatever made by the Minister or by the board to this matter.  Of course, the board are very conservative in that respect, because evidently the intention is to make money and give cheap current for lighting only, and, of course, for industrial work in industrial towns, but this is a problem that ought to be faced up to.  It is a national scheme and ought not to be looked at purely from the point of view of money.</P>
    <P>If it were necessary to subsidise rural development it should be done.  I admit that it is a difficult problem, but when it has been solved in other countries it should be possible to solve it here. I know that Canada has subsidised rural electrification.  Other countries have put up the network by relief grants.  Where network can be provided in rural Ireland the cost to the board would be reduced by making available relief grants for such a purpose. For distribution purposes in Sweden a group of farmers form a co-operative society to buy current from the board, and they are helped with technical advice and cheap materials by the board.</P>
    <P>These are details that the Minister and the Department are more capable of dealing with than I am.  In fact, I say to the House that it should not agree to this loan except on one condition, that at least 10 per cent. of the amount, or even £500,000, is earmarked for rural electrification.  There is no use in bemoaning the deplorable condition of agriculture here if some really courageous effort is not made to place the agricultural industry on a higher plane so that we will not be handicapped, as we are at present, compared with other countries with which we are in competition.  We could raise the plane of agricultural life from being a life of drudgery in the farmyard <Col N="426" /> to a higher level.  All the operations I referred to are included.  The lighting of out-offices, cattle sheds and barns would be of tremendous advantage as also the operation of machinery for pulping, grinding, the running of incubators and brooders, milking machines, sterilisers and churning. That should be possible here.  I have here a copy of the <i>Irish Builder and Engineer</i> for March 5th, 1938, containing an article entitled &ldquo;Electricity for the Countryside&rdquo; by an electrical engineer, read before the Irish Institute of Electrical Engineers, showing how Dumfries faced the problem. There they succeeded in an amazing way, without any extra cost to the urban areas, with a scheme of rural electrification.  Dumfrieshire is a county in Scotland about the size of County Limerick.  Population density there was something similar to the density of population in rural Ireland. Including towns, the average population density was about 55 inhabitants per square mile, but when mountainous districts were excluded the population density of the remaining area was about 100 per square mile.  The average population in rural Ireland is 80 to the square mile, and that figure can be modified to some extent by the elimination of mountainous districts. In his paper the county electrical engineer, Mr. J.S. Pickles, B.Sc., stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are in the area, 1,321 farms of 50 acres or over.  In May, 1937, 551 farms were taking supply, and it is expected the number will have increased to 650 in May, 1938. A few farms specialise in dairying, and a few in poultry, but the great majority are mixed farms, being principally devoted to the feeding of stock coupled in some cases with small dairies and a certain amount of tillage.  In practically every case, supply was taken initially for domestic use in the dwellinghouse and lighting of the outhouses.  The application of electricity gradually extends to such uses as grain bruising, turnip cutting, cake crushing, pumping, elevating, or a small saw bench, and on the dairy farm, to milking and sterilising, separating, <Col N="427" /> churning, bottling, etc.  Electricity finds a ready market in the poultry farm for incubating, brooding and for extended lighting of hen coops. Rapid progress has been made with these applications and on some poultry farms very high consumptions are recorded.  On the average mixed farm the consumption of electricity is about 2,000 units per annum, and the corresponding revenue about £15 per annum.  Cottages situated on the farms add on the average about £5 per annum to this figure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on big farms.  He says that the revenue from the large farms was £15, and that the cottages on these farms contributed £5, so that the net cost for electrification was £10 per annum.  It can be appreciated what an enormous advantage it would be on our farms to have an unlimited supply of current not alone for lighting but for power.  I would even go so far as to suggest that the House should only agree to this loan on one condition, that the Minister was prepared to promise to devote 10 per cent. of the amount in order to make a start with rural electrification.  It is some 13 years since the Electricity Supply Board was set up, after the beginning of the Ardnacrusha scheme, and one would expect that some reference would be made in the annual report, even if it were only by way of excuse, to the problem of electrification for rural Ireland.  Will we ever solve our economic problems by lighting towns and villages?  Is it not time to face up to this position, that what really matters is increased production in agriculture and industry?  The electrification of rural Ireland is one of the means towards that end.</P>
    <P>I have few words to say about the statement of the Minister generally, but I feel worried about the Clonsast proposal.  It appears to me to be a way out for the Turf Board when they failed to make a success of turf development, which we were told so much about at one time.  They are now going to produce electricity.  Are they going to put another £800,000 into another bog and bury it as was done at Carbury in <Col N="428" /> North Kildare?  A paragraph in the annual report of the Electricity Supply Board states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board has had under consideration the construction of a peat fired generating station, and the technical and economic aspects of the utilisation of this fuel have been investigated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to this matter on a previous occasion.  We are not opposed to the extension of the scheme at all-far from it.  As a matter of fact I am very keen on the extension of the scheme all over the country. We have no assurance from any expert engineer that it is going to be a success.  Until we have an assurance that the matter has been thoroughly investigated by experts, I think the House should not accept that statement as being sufficient.</P>
    <P>I will go further than that.  That has already been said by Mr. Cosgrave, but I will go further.  The report goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Industry and Commerce has assured the board that the production of the Clonsast Bog will be increased to meet the large demands of a generating station, and on the basis of these assurances a suitable site has been selected and steps are being taken to empower the board to proceed with this project.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce &ldquo;assured the board&rdquo;.  I wonder if the board is satisfied with that assurance.  Does the Department of Industry and Commerce guarantee the board that there will be a supply of turf if we have a particularly wet summer in any year?  Turf must be won in the summer and, of course, you cannot save it if you have a very bad summer.  In this climate of ours we know that that occurs fairly often.  Is there any guarantee that, if we have a particularly wet summer, there will be a sufficient supply of turf?  I am not satisfied with the word &ldquo;assured&rdquo; at all.  I have very grave doubts that in the particular kind of year that I visualise it will be possible to win a sufficient supply of turf under bad <Col N="429" /> weather conditions.  I think it is essential, in examining all the aspects of that case from the point of view of a supply of turf under difficult weather conditions in an abnormally wet year, that we have the assurance of an expert that this is going to be a success.  There may be years when it can be a success, if weather conditions are ideal for the saving of sufficient turf.  I forget the quantity that the Minister gave but it is enormous. Would he repeat it?</P>

      <P>120,000 tons a year.  I have not the slightest doubt that under bad weather conditions that 120,000 tons will dwindle to less than half, that is, to 60,000 tons.  Consequently, my interpretation of that paragraph in the board's report is that this whole scheme is being foisted upon the board by the Minister, that it has not been accepted wholeheartedly by the board.  If it were, that paragraph would be couched in very different language.  I believe it is being forced upon the board, to prove that our great turf scheme is going to be a success, that if we could not make a success of turf in one direction we will make electricity out of it now.  The other point is one that already has been made.  Are the people who normally get turf from that bog going to be denied that right?  From the Minister's reply one would infer that no one got turf out of the bog until the board went there and drained it.</P>

      <P>There is one matter I should like to raise and I hope it is in order.  It concerns the assessment of local rates.  I have here a letter from the Killarney Urban District Council asking me to raise it, in regard to whether it is possible to amend Section 11 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1930.  Under that Act certain assessments of local valuation are imposed and must be carried through by the local authority.  The Killarney Urban District Council finds itself in the position that on that basis they have to accept a commitment from the Electricity Supply Board carrying a valuation of £378, whereas under Section 11 of the previous Act they can only assess for a valuation of £118.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>I think that the point the Deputy wants to raise is where the Electricity Supply Board takes over an undertaking with a certain valuation and increases the value, the local authority cannot raise rates on the new valuation, but must adhere to the old one.  I am afraid that is not in order, though it applies to a good many towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his vision in introducing this measure.  Everybody realises that, with science advancing as it is, more and more the benefits of <Col N="431" /> science are brought home to countries sufficiently active to avail of them.  In the supplying of electricity, this national scheme was started originally by harnessing water, subsequently by harnessing coal, and now, as the Minister has explained in his statement, by harnessing turf.  I am quite in agreement with that: I think it is a very good scheme.  In this country we have enormous supplies of turf lying idle. The Minister now proposes to make use of those supplies.  That is an excellent idea, as the raw material is readily available.</P>
      <P>There should, however, be some qualification about this scheme.  I believe that the benefits conferred upon individuals in this country generally have been large through bringing into various districts adequate supplies of electricity.  So far the people who live in the rural districts, the people living on farms, who form the majority of our population, have been entirely overlooked. If any individual is enterprising enough to ask for a supply of electricity to a particular district which is not already being served he must of necessity pay heavily for his enterprise.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any doubt but that the electrification of the country has been run entirely for the benefit of those who live in urban areas or, possibly, in rural areas with a large conglomeration of houses or something like that.  If, under this measure, we are going to harness something which comes from the country districts we should, I think, at the same time see that the people living in those districts will get the benefit of that electrification.  Deputy Hughes has already pointed out that if farmers were in the same position as townspeople to get cheap electrical power it would be of enormous benefit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think the idea behind it is excellent.  I believe that no problem is capable of solution unless it is dealt with in a big way. The Minister is proposing to deal with this in a big way since he is asking for the sum of £4,000,000.  It is the only way to deal with our difficulties, <Col N="432" /> but what will the ordinary people in the country think when they learn from the newspapers that an additional £4,000,000 is to be provided towards the electrification of the country?  I represent a constituency in which there is practically no turf.  At the same time I want to say that, in my opinion, the money would be well spent if, by reason of this proposed development, electricity could be brought to my neighbours in the country and to my constituents&mdash;the farmers who live not on the main roads, but on the by-roads. The money would be well spent if electricity could be brought to them not as a luxury, but as something that they would get in the ordinary way&mdash; in the same way that the people in the towns get their supplies of water and electricity.  I venture to think that the Minister has something like that in view, although it is not mentioned in the Bill.  The people of the country are being asked to supply a very large sum of money.  I think it is right that they should do so, subject to this qualification, that hereafter, through whatever channel it comes, they will reap the benefit of having supplied the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister under this measure is going to increase the amount of electricity that will be available to consumers in the country.  I hope he will provide it for the people in the rural areas at as cheap a rate as that which obtains at the moment in towns and other centres with a big consumption. If he does not do that, then, from the point of view of the people in the rural districts, the scheme is not a good one. I feel that in the forefront of his mind is the desire to carry out a general electrification of the country and to provide our people, particularly those engaged in the agricultural industry, with the same facilities as their competitors&mdash;some for the moment temporarily wiped out&mdash;have enjoyed. The farmers in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and in North America produce the same commodities that we do. They are our competitors in the markets of the world.  Therefore, I say that if we are able to provide the people in the rural districts with electricity at the cheap rates enjoyed by <Col N="433" /> the farmers in those countries, this Bill will, in my opinion, be welcomed by every person in the country, no matter how remote the district he lives in.  I hope that is what the Minister has in mind.  If he has not that in mind, and if this is just a scheme for producing an additional number of units of electricity for the people who reside in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and other large towns, then I think the scheme will not commend itself to the people of the country.  I hope the Minister will say that his intention is to provide electricity at a reasonable rate for every home in the country.  If he is able to say that, then I think the scheme will have the approval of all the people who are being asked to contribute, directly or indirectly, towards the provision of this very large sum of £4,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four main points to which I should like to address myself in connection with this measure. The first is a general matter which has been introduced by the leave of the Chair, and that is the question of the provision of a pension fund for the staff of the board.  I must say that it came to me as a shock when I first heard members of the staff discuss this matter, and found that someone had given legal advice to the effect that the phrase in the original 1927 Act was not wide enough to cover provision for pensions.  The matter, unfortunately, was not discussed in the House at the time.  So far as I recollect, the only point raised on the section dealing with the employees of the board was on an amendment introduced by the then Deputy Johnson who tried to establish something by way of certain standards, something in the nature of minimum rates.  In the conflict of argument on that this special question of pensions was not dealt with.  If the view had been pressed that the phrase in the Act did not allow sufficient latitude to enable a pension fund to be established, and if any legal definition had been put to me leading to the conclusion which apparently the present Government have been driven to, I certainly would have considered the introduction of an amendment or of the enlargement of the phrase to enable the board at least to consider the question. <Col N="434" /> The terms and conditions might have to be further considered.  One would have to take into account the earlier years and the position the board was in in regard to revenue and in meeting its statutory liabilities. But, having regard to the position in which the board now finds itself, the importance it occupies in the life of the country, and how the scheme generally is regarded by the majority of the people, I think there are very few who would be found to object to the Minister introducing an amendment of the phrase in the section so as to enable the board at least to consider, in conjunction with the employees, a pension scheme.  Possibly, there might have to be some debate on it here. I do not say this House should control it.  This, I think, may be said, that if the Minister were now to move towards enabling the board to consider a pension scheme for the staff it would be welcomed by most people.  They have 2,328 people in their service.  The board is one of the biggest corporations we have in the country.  In the Banking Commission Report of 1938 it is referred to as one of our most successful bodies, and its work is growing apace.  At the moment it is providing a very big amount of this £4,000,000 for ordinary extensions and ordinary development.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be a matter which the public would welcome.  Although the public is not generally appreciative of pensions schemes, it would not find it easy to object to the board, situate as it now is, having some regard for those people who have given it loyal service and who have given the country loyal service, through the board, during the past 12 years or so.  The board is very well established now; it is no longer under the suspicion or doubt which newspapers engendered, and this forward step might easily be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has been regarded, I understand, sometimes as a model to be looked up to and sometimes as a thing to be derided and from which people shy away.  At all events, it is established and it stands here for criticism or praise.  Commissions which have been established are investigating. <Col N="435" /> the possibility of having other services run by some such institution as the board.  We have the usual objection by those who run commercial enterprises that this board has not to meet the ordinary commercial expenses. Not many enterprises have provided pension funds for their staff, but some have provided them and there is a growing tendency towards doing so. In France, the home of the family allowance, reputable industrial institutions have succeeded in establishing pension funds as well.  I think the time is ripe for doing this, and I ask the Minister to give consideration to the matter.  I understand that discussions have been going on between the board and its employees and that the board have even sent some of their schemes to the Ministry.  They discussed the matter in the belief that they had power to inaugurate these pension schemes.  They have, apparently, been disappointed to find that there is a legal impediment in the way and that the Ministry is not taking power to remove that impediment.</P>
    <P>It is worth while noting that this House has twice passed legislation dealing with railway servants.  The original Act of 1924 allowed for the possibility of a pension scheme being discussed between members of the staff and the company and being put forward. Later legislation, in 1932, was represented to this House as making a pension scheme compulsory.  Notwithstanding this supposed advance in 1932, no pension scheme has been made. In any event, this House, with a certain amount of acclamation, welcomed the suggestion thrown out in 1932 that the 1932 Bill was an improvement on the 1924 Act in that respect.  One does not want to institute odious comparisons, but electricity supply is as much on the up grade as rail transport is on the down grade.  It seems to me incontestable that this matter of pensions for the staff of the Electricity Supply Board should be considered, and considered immediately.  If it is considered now, it would be only justice that whatever scheme is established should have, at least, some retrospective effect, that the length of service <Col N="436" /> people have given to that board should be taken into account and that it should not start now just because the board finds itself in a happier financial position than it was at the beginning. It was the efforts of those people who had no pension fund which made the scheme the success it has been.</P>
    <P>The second general question is that of extensions and the provision of money for these extensions.  In 1938, the Banking Commission reported on various matters which they found proper for investigation in connection with the provision of capital for industry. In that connection, they dealt with the Electricity Supply Board. They gave a rather brief statement on the whole electricity development of the country, extending from paragraphs 462 to 464.  In the report, it is stated that the chairman of the board estimated that the ordinary capital requirements of the undertaking for the next ten years would amount to about £500,000 a year and the Banking Commission recorded that they believed that figure might be regarded as conservative.  The report continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is evident that for many years to come the board's transactions will form an important element in public finance and will need to be kept under careful scrutiny in this connection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They opened a new paragraph in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is convenient at this point to mention that we think it important that, before adopting any policy which contemplates fresh capital in the future, however remote, the board should possess the statutory authority for raising such capital. Otherwise, it might happen that, when the Legislature is eventually asked to grant the requisite authority, its discretion would already be prejudiced by the action of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to know to what degree that phrase of the Banking Commission applies to this sum of £4,000,000. Of what fraction of the £4,000,000 is it possible to say that the discretion of the Legislature has been prejudiced by <Col N="437" /> the preliminary activities of the board. As I read the Minister's speech made on the 16th October, he divided the sum of £4,000,000 into three lots.  A sum of over £500,000 has to do with the Liffey scheme.  The sum of £800,000 is concerned with Portarlington station and the rest refers to extensions or something like extensions.  As to the rest&mdash;that is, £2,750,000&mdash;the Minister spoke in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The remaining capital items of importance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Remaining&rdquo;, in the Minister's text, means everything else but the Liffey portion of the expenditure; that was all he had dealt with up to that moment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;included in the financial provision which the Bill proposes cover an additional 20 M.W. set at the Pigeon House, an increase in transformer capacity at Ardnacrusha, new 110 K.B. lines between Dublin and Cork...together with new 110 K.B. stations....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then uses the phrase &ldquo;the bulk of this work has already been completed&rdquo;&mdash;so that we are paying after. The House is being asked to sanction not alone something already projected but something already carried forward to completion.  The only thing to do is to pay the bill.  The Minister continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Expenditure has also been incurred on the 38 K.B. and the 10 K.B. system, strengthening mains and extending stations to handle the increase in load and undue high tension sub-stations and mains.  Owing to the continued growth in the number of consumers, provision is also being made for a substantial sum for extensions to consumers and for the development of new areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the first page of the White Paper which the Minister circulated, items amounting to £2,888,000 were set out. It was explained that £800,000 was being asked for the Portarlington station, leaving £2,000,000 odd.  Is that what the Minister spoke of when he used the phrase &ldquo;the bulk of this work has already been completed&rdquo;?  As I tot the items, they almost come to £2,000,000.  Is that the situation&mdash;that <Col N="438" /> we are being asked to foot the bill for work to the extent of £2,000,000, out of £4,000,000, which has already been completed?  If so, the Minister must admit, that he has not paid much attention to the recommendation contained in the report of the Banking Commission&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;before adopting any policy which contemplates fresh capital expenditure in the future, however remote, the board should possess the statutory authority for raising such capital. Otherwise it might happen that, when the Legislature is eventually asked to grant the requisite authority, its discretion would already be prejudiced by the action of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not easy to get these calculations mode from the general terms used by the Minister but, having in a particular part of the speech stated that &ldquo;the bulk of this work has already been completed&rdquo;, he said that &ldquo;expenditure has also been incurred&rdquo;&mdash;and he went on with nearly all the other matters on page one of the White Paper.  It is, I think, right that the House should get some understanding as to what is the position between the Government and the board on this matter.</P>
    <P>As this whole matter was originally determined&mdash;this is the view, I think, accepted by the present Government&mdash; the position was: It was recognised that the board would have to get the aid of the credit of this State from time to time for its development, and it was recognised that once the preliminary stage had been got over, it would likely emerge that the board was going to pay its way.  Of course, the natural consequence of these two thoughts would be that the board would find it easy to get allowances from this House when development was on, that it would get almost into the position of the telephone service.  The House is accustomed to requests being made from time to time, with very little discussion about them, for the advance of certain moneys for telephone development, but the consideration that the board was asked to give to the public in return for the placing of <Col N="439" /> the public credit at its disposal was that there should be full publicity as to what their plans were.  It can certainly not be considered acting up to the bargain that was, so to speak, struck between the Legislature and the board originally, if what happens is that the board is allowed to spend, or to have entered on commitments which will lead to the spending of, a couple of million pounds before the House hears anything about it.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much of the material carried on the other pages is really for extensions, is really for future development at all.  I do understand one part of the Minister's statement with regard to the Liffey, that, in as much as part of this money now asked, is for the extra capacity at the Liffey, it undoubtedly can be put under the heading of future development, but possibly the Minister could answer that question eventually.  Other than the £800,000 for the Portarlington station, what part of the £4,000,000 can really be said to be for future development and what is there really mortgaged at the moment?  If it is the situation that the House is simply to meet and to have it represented to it that a sum of £2,000,000 has either been expended, or that we are committed to its expenditure, one will have to ask the further question: how far the Minister, without telling the House anything about it, was made cognisant of the plans and schemes that involve the expenditure of these couple of million pounds?</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I understand correctly what the Minister said about the Liffey, but I make this guess at what has happened.  In column 275 the Minister made the statement that the cost of the Liffey hydro-electric scheme is now £784,000, as against the £503,000 originally estimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to call the attention of the House to those figures.  Instead of being £784,000 as against £503,000, the figures should be £1,041,000 as against £760,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, we <Col N="440" /> have to add the original £503,000 to the £283,000, plus £280,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the £503,000 mentioned did not include housing for the operations staff, cost of land purchase and sundry compensations. The total cost of the scheme, in fact, on either side, is £256,650 more than the figures I gave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it must be somewhere around the £1,000,000 mark, but I am not sure that I arrived at the calculation by the same road as the Minister.  I thought that what we really had to consider was that there was an original scheme, or a scheme stated to be original, of £503,000, and, on the Minister's White Paper, we have two items, one at figure 19 and the other at figure 20, the former being £283,000 extra and the latter being £280,000 extra.  We may assume that the Liffey scheme has been raised from a £500,000 scheme to a scheme of somewhere over £1,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>Whatever it should be, the White Paper, in dividing out the £4,000,000, has two items, one of which is the sum of £283,000, which is described in this way: &ldquo;Estimated increased expenditure over the estimated amount provided for under the Liffey Reservoir Act&rdquo;; and the other, the Liffey hydro-electric scheme, £280,000, with the side note: &ldquo;Due to an increase in the size of the generating plant.&rdquo;  Whatever was the original sum, we have now two items of £280,000 each.  We are asked to provide <Col N="441" /> an additional almost £600,000, of which half is due to increased cost in the scheme as originally planned and the other to give additional capacity. I think that that is roughly what it comes to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not be confusing ourselves further.  Item 19 is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Estimated increased expenditure over estimated amount provided for under the Liffey Reservoir Act.  The excess was mainly due to the rise in prices of materials required for the transmission and distribution programme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The other item is the one which relates to the Liffey hydro-electric scheme proper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am correct in what I said.  The £280,000 is due to the fact that there is going to be icreased capacity from the Liffey, and the £283,000 to the fact that the original estimates in connection with development there have gone up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but I am going on the remarks on the side of the white sheet which has been issued. Item 19 refers to £283,000 and the remarks on it are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The excess was mainly due to the rise in prices of materials required for the transmission and distribution programme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And it does not make any reference to the Liffey at all, except where it refers to what was provided in the Liffey Reservoir Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that there is a sum of £283,000 due to increases arising <Col N="442" /> from the international situation which has driven the prices of materials up, and a sum of £280,000 for increased capacity.  Out of it all, am I not right in saying that the only figure which we have to carry in our minds in connection with now development is £280,000?  That is the only sum which we can say, as from the Liffey or thereabouts, has to do with future extensions. If that is so, I feel that what I already said about £2,000,000 out of £4,000,000 having been already either spent, or its expenditure undertaken, would apply possibly to £2,500,000 and to possibly something nearer £3,000,000, out of this £4,000,000.  The Minister, however, can clear that up. He has the figures and he will be able to tell us exactly what is the amount out of this £4,000,000, and, if we leave Portarlington out of our consideration for the moment, what part of the remaining £3,200,000 is in hands for future development.  I suggest that it is a small sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what there is in hands for future development, the other matter arises at this point.  I do not know if the board have given any consideration even to a demonstration of either the possibility or impossibility of having rural electrification done in any cheap way in this country.  I know it was a project which was very much thought of at one time by the people who are now in control of that scheme, people who are now in an official position on the board.  I know there were expeditions arranged to other countries in which rural electrification has been carried out to some recognisable extent, and I did understand that the board had really taken a stand on this matter. I thought they had definitely got it into their heads that they were not tied merely to, give electricity to the urban centres, and to get sufficient revenue to pay off their liabilities.  I thought they had read the 1927 Act, and knew that there they were given wide powers with regard to the development of electricity in the country, in the whole of Ireland, not distinguishing the rural areas from the urban areas.  They must know very well&mdash;it was certainly noised abroad at the time of the inception of this board <Col N="443" />&mdash;that they were being, it was stated, upheld by the credit of the State, and the credit of the State depends to a great extent upon the rural communities.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong to create any impression in this country that rural electrification on a big scale is immediately possible, but I think there are people who are interested in this, and interested in it not entirely on the plane of simply seeing brighter homes in the countryside.  They do believe there might be some little effect, something, no matter how small, produced by the, activities of the board in trying to prevent the drift towards the towns, which is supposed to be the evil feature of our life at this moment.  At the moment, the board, through this House, faces a certain parting of the ways.  It has made good to the satisfaction of the people.  It has entered on a period in which it is going to get moneys easily provided here for the ordinary developments.  They have their accounts published, and they show a fairly good picture&mdash;not so good a picture in this last year as it was the year before, but a fairly good picture.  They are now having a big sum of money put at their disposal, and it is certainly presented here&mdash;it may be a wrong impression&mdash;as if the board recognises that there is a feeling id the country that something, even if it is only a demonstration, ought to be done for rural electrification, but they turn that aside without even writing a paragraph in their annual report about it, and have instead adopted this scheme for the utilisation of peat fuel. I do not believe that the board are back of this scheme for the utilisation of peat fuel at all.  We must know whether they are or not.  We have given them considerable powers, and the only thing we have asked of them in return is that they will give publicity annually to their various plans and projects, and to their accounts over the year.</P>
    <P>I cannot say I have searched back through all their accounts, but certainly in the accounts presented for the last seven or eight years the question of peat fuel has only crept in once; it crept into the accounts that we have <Col N="444" /> this year.  The phrase used has been analysed here by Deputies Cosgravc and Cosiello, and to-day by Deputy Hughes.  That phrase which the board used must be considered chilly.  Here is what it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board has had under consideration the construction of a peat-fired genefatLig station, and the technical and economic aspects of the utilisation of this fuel have been investigated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two points came before the board, technical considerations, and economic considerations.  The second sentence is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The availability of adequate supplies of peat will be an important factor in the economic operation of the station.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It does not say it is the only thing to be considered.  It does not even say it is the only point to be considered on, the economic side.  It simply says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The availability of adequate supplies of peat will be an important factor in the economic operation of the station.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After that they very carefully push aside from themselves all responsibility for this matter.  They say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Industry and Commerce has assured the board that the production of the Clonsast bog will be increased to meet the large demands of a generating station.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a definite hand-off.  They do not accept responsibility.  I should say they ask the public to read into that a big note of interrogation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Industry and Commerce has assured the board that the production of Clonsast bog will be increased to meet the large demands of a generating station.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the interrogation mark gets bigger in the end of that sentence:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;and on the basis of these assurances a suitable site has been selected, and steps are being taken to empower the hoard to proceed with this project.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> There never has been a more impersonal paragraph than that written in any report of the board. They have got assurances from the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash;they do not say whether they believe them or not&mdash;and &ldquo;on the basis of these assurances&rdquo;, that is fixing the responsibility, &ldquo;a site has been selected&rdquo;.  We do not know by whom; we do know that &ldquo;steps are being taken to empower the board to proceed with this project&rdquo;.  I think it is a fair conclusion from that paragraph that the board do not want this scheme at all.  They certainly give no indication here that they believe in the assurances of the Department of Industry and Commerce, or that they are pinning their fate to, or basing their reputation on the development of a peat-fired station.  I wondered if the Minister would have given in his speech any indication as to where the decision in this matter came from.  I read this account of his very carefully. I find he dealt with certain of the objections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The economy of large scale winning of turf by machinery depends on getting two crops of turf each year on the bog.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is at column 280.  At column 281 he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As far as expert advice and reasonable anticipation, coupled with a degree of experience, can estimate, turf of a suitable moisture content for a generating station will be available at Clonsast to the full extent required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only experience that has been spoken of earlier than that has been the experience of the Turf Development Board.  The second matter was the efficiency of the turf-winning plant.</P>
    <P>Two columns later we come to the difficulty of transport, and eventually we get this summing up from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact must not be lost sight of, however, that the ultimate value of the investment of £800,000, which it is proposed to make in the Portarlington station, depends upon the measure of success which attends the <Col N="446" /> endeavours of the Turf Development Board to solve the very difficult engineering and other problems involved in the winning and harvesting of at luast 120,000 tons of suitable peat fuel from the Clonsast Bog every year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, at column 285, we get the question uf price emerging:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The operation costs are not yet as low as they should be, and as they must be, if this investment of £1,000,000 in the bog and this generating station is to justify itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, I think, we get the expert advice coming out, and we get a revelation as to who the expert is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nevertheless, the Turf Board feel that when a power station is erected, they will be able to sell turf to the Electricity Supply Board at a price comparable to the price of coal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a phrase common in American life, &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo;.  The board passed it on, through this report, to the Government.  The Minister here, representing the Government, passed it generously to the Turf Development Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I read into it.  We will get the Minister to pin himself to whether the board are in favour of this or not.  If they are in favour of it, or if that paragraph which has been so much read here represents their view, then nobody can say they are enthusiastic about it.  How could anybody be enthusiastic about this?  I have already referred to what the Banking Commission report said about the Electricity Supply Board.  They moved on some time after that to discuss the electricity supply matter and the Turf Development Board, paragraph 471.  They talk about how it had arisen, and they sum it up this way:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;While organised in form as a commercial enterprise, the board in fact operates largely as a channel for the distribution of State subsidy outside the normal mechanism of Parliamentary control.  In the absence of <Col N="447" /> published accounts the extent to which the advances can be regarded as a satisfactory asset must remain a matter of surmise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They published their report in the year 1938.  Presumably the last accounts of the Turf Board they had seen were those for 1937.  Earlier, they said that the advances to the Turf Board amounted to £103,000 and the grants to £71,000, and they say that they cannot make up their minds as to whether the advances can be regarded as satisfactory assets.  It has been said here of a notorious ear-biter in this town that often it was more blessed to give than to lend and it generally cost the same.  That is a phrase that can be applied to the Turf Development Board.  The difference between an advance and a grant to them does not appear to matter very much.  As far as the Banking Commission were concerned they could not see any difference between the two, and they could not know how far the operations of this particular Turf Development Board were simply this, to continue as a channel for the distribution of a State subsidy&mdash;a State subsidy of a good type&mdash;outside the normal mechanism of Parliamentary control. I should add that they dealt with the Turf Development Board in good company. They moved on in the next paragraph to the Peat Fuel Company, and they proved that it had got the assistance of the State in connection with the provision of capital.  I think it was three advances&mdash;£90,000, £20,000 and £35,000&mdash;£145,000&mdash;and of both these boards&mdash;certainly of the Turf Development Board&mdash;they said that no provision had been made for the publication of the accounts.  Nobody had yet seen an account from the Turf Development Board.  And it is on the operations of that board, criticised in that way, certainly an unsatisfactory performance as far as the majority of the State can understand its operations &mdash;it is more or less on the reputation of that board that the Minister places this whole development.  The only people made responsible for any real decision on this were the Turf Development Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The Minister said that they believe that when the power station is erected they will be able to sell the turf to the Electricity Supply Board at a price comparable to the price of coal, certain relative matters being taken into consideration. Is that good enough for the provision of £800,000?  I do not believe much in this talk about experts, if experts means that you must get somebody to tell you the thing is right and somebody else, preferably a foreigner, to say that what a native said was right and probably a commission to investigate.  That is the sort of talk that was heard when the original Shannon scheme was mooted. Everyone wanted his own expert brought in in the matter.  Why should this matter remain anonymous?  Have we been told that the Electricity Supply Board favour this and why they favour it?  If they have got reports in favour of it, who drew up those reports? Are their names affixed to them?  Are they names that will carry weight with the community?  If it was the Turf Development Board, will we be told who is the expert on the board or have they called in anyone from outside? Let us have a name affixed to the whole of the literature on this subject and then we will know whether the provision of £800,000 is likely to be just the casting of more good money after bad.</P>
    <P>The Minister will realise, I think, that we are entitled to criticise this particular part of this extension here and now.  It is the only opportunity we will get for doing it, and the Minister must know that the Turf Development Board has not a good record in the country.  It may be unfortunate in the way in which it has presented itself to the people.  It may be it was given an impossible task to discharge and that it has failed, but failed gallantly. It may be that the task was simply thrown on them to try to work out something that was a pet scheme of somebody's and they took it up, to their cost and to the cost of the nation, but anything associated with the Turf Development Board at this moment must he regarded with suspicion.  We are entitled certainly to ask the Minister to stop and tell us a little bit more <Col N="449" /> about this.  I personally cannot see that there is very much good to be said for this.  The Minister is driven in his introduction to this matter back to a Peat Resources Committee of 1914-18 and to a Dáil Éireann Commission set up in the far-off days of 1919.  Those are the two main things upon which the Minister founds the case for giving this money other than the phrase that the Turf Development Board believe they will be able to do something or another.</P>
    <P>There have been comparisons made with what happens in Germany and Russia.  These comparisons are made, I think, in the ibody of the report drawn up by the late Hugh Ryan.  I think they also occur somewhere in the reports drawn up in 1914-18, but these reports, I think, were careful to point out that the word &ldquo;peat&rdquo; may be applied to a great many substances and that, in fact, the peat from which electricity is found to be generated either in Russia or in Germany is not comparable with the peat we have here.  It is more in the nature of lignite.  I certainly am a little bit disquieted by comparisons that are made here with Russia and Germany and hark back to reports that were written in the years 1918 and 1919 and I get more disquieted still when I see the only body brought in to try and bring this thing a little bit more up to date is the Turf Development Board.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister would at least have no objection to doing this, if this scheme goes through.  In the Shannon Fisheries Act provision was made for having separate accounts kept of the fisheries business and the reports that have come out since have always presented the Shannon fisheries account under a separate heading. Would it be possible to keep the Portarlington station apart from all the other operations of the board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be some saving but, of course, the only criticism that can be passed upon that suggestion of mine is that it will only reveal after the event what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to my original point, that we should here and now get some better information about this peat station and on what and on whose advice it has been adopted.  I said earlier that I would like to approach the position of the Electricity Supply Board from a different angle from that about which I was speaking at the particular moment.  I had there adverted to the point that the Banking Commission were rather, afraid of a habit that might grow up with the Electricity Supply Board of running in advance by commitments of the actual moneys at its disposal.  I do not know how that is going to be checked if there is such a tendency.  The only power that the Minister has, if the Act of 1927 is being operated as it was intended, is that at a certain point he comes in with a resolution to this House asking for the dismissal of certain members of the board, and that Act was certainly so framed as to prevent the Minister having his eye on the board continually or interfering with the operations of the board to any great extent. I get an uneasy suspicion from this whole Portarlington bog project that the Ministry are interfering with the board and that the board are not in the <Col N="451" /> same independent position as they used to be.  They are certainly not in the same independent position in which it was sought to put them, if they are having schemes of which they do not approve put before them and told that if they do not agree to carry on with a certain scheme they may find themselves short of capital for other development.  I wonder would the Minister be able to give an assurance to this House that if the board like to say even yet that they are not sufficiently convinced by expert examination and their own investigations that this scheme is one that should be gone on with, it will be dropped or, alternatively, are they going to see a Government demand if they are providing capital they should have some say in the schemes to which that capital is to be applied?  If the first position is the one that is sustained at the moment, then the board is still independent. If the second is the position, then the board's independence has been shattered.  The House here always had control of their finance. The country always had control of their finance, and the Government had the power to say to the board that they would not allow them money for certain developments, and it is for the board to make the case that the country are clamouring for something the board cannot render, but certainly it is a complete reversion of what was supposed if the Government forces the board to indulge in experiments simply because the Government want the experiments carried on even though the board, well advised, does not approve of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The particular disquiet I speak of is not confined to myself.  I think it is a pity that there should be any uneasiness about the position of the board. There are commissions investigating ways and means of getting the economic life of our country run along different lines from what has prevailed heretofore.  We are supposed to have come to a conclusion that the old system is not completely good in its working and we are trying to find ways of alleviating some of the disadvantages of that old system.  One of the <Col N="452" /> institutions that has been under definite consideration is the board. The position of the board is that it is free from Civil Service control, and very free from Ministerial control, but at some stated periods it is subject to criticism in this House and, therefore, to criticism by the nation.  That is a system that has been approved of and, if there is any suggestion, it is that the board is not independent enough, and its dependence on the Government for the provision of capital makes it a little bit more dependent than it should be.</P>
    <P>Whatever be the situation at the moment, it should be explained.  It may be there are certain temporary causes which led to more interference with the board than would be considered ideal.  It may be that a new view is taken of the position of the board.  But there definitely has been engendered a public uneasiness.  Perhaps it only sprang from the Clonsast bog affair, but there is the feeling that the board is no longer complete master in its own house, as the legislation intended it to be.  People will accept either of two contentions in this matter, that the board has weakly given in to the running of a scheme in which it does not believe&mdash;and, therefore, its reputation is down&mdash;or that the members of the board have come to the conclusion that the Clonsast scheme has been pushed over on them and that they must accept it.  They are, in that respect, happy in their reputation&mdash;if they are not as powerful as they used to be, they have suffered from the junction of the Clonsast matter with their ordinary activities.</P>
    <P>The whole position can be rectified by the Minister stating that this is a matter of which the board have definitely approved, that they think electricity can be generated from the peat won at Clonsast.  There will be every allowance made for them, even if the accidental circumstances that Deputy Hughes talked about come to pass, of a very wet or rainy period coming along.  At any rate, we are entitled to know whether the board backed this scheme with their reputation.  If the Minister does not give us the answer now, we will get it eventually, because <Col N="453" /> the board must be conscious that there is a public feeling of disquiet.  They will have to advert to it in their next report.  If they are quiet, the public will say that they do back it.  The Minister, I am sure, is fully in the confidence of the board and he can tell us what the situation is.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Portarlington scheme must necessarily fail; I am not even saying that because the Turf Development Board is allowed in the venture that it must necessarily fail; but there is something that should be cleared up, and it can be cleared up by some sort of statement.  We cannot continue to carry on in this anonymous way.  We must have some statement backed by a responsible person, and then the House and the country can properly place the responsibility.</P>
    <P>This may seem a small matter, but it is pivotal in relation to the whole conception of the Electricity Supply Board.  They got immense grants, public credit, and they were asked to utilise it along certain lines.  It was thought that they would do two things, that they would bring to their task technical capacity, that there would be an appreciation that public credit was given to them, and that they would not misuse their position.  There is a big question of responsibility.  The board must adopt it, or definitely detach themselves from it.  There may be some intermediate stage where the board will say: &ldquo;We do not approve of this and are not happy about it,&rdquo; but the House is entitled to know everything that the board knows in connection with this scheme.  It is entitled to know whether the board approve of the scheme or not.  The House must know from the Minister if the position is that he does not care whether the board approve or not, that it is a Government scheme and that it must go through.  Let us have some clarity about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Clonsast scheme is concerned, I believe that whether or not it is sound from a financial or commercial point of view, it is unsound nationally, because it is definitely wrong to divert fuel, particularly peat, for the purpose of generating electricity.  Everybody <Col N="454" /> knows that one of the weaknesses in our economic position is that we are to a very large extent dependent upon external sources for our supply of fuel. Peat is our chief native fuel, and for that reason it should be conserved only for fuel purposes.  To divert thousands of tons of a commodity which is very limited for the purpose of generating electricity is unsound and unjustifiable. For that reason I think the House should be very slow to adopt a scheme of this nature, even if it were considered sound from a technical or a business aspect.</P>
      <P>Before we divsrt a large portion of our limited quantity of fuel for the purpose of generating electricity, every other source of power should be exhausted. I do not believe that every possible source has been exhausted. We know that one or two rivers have been harnessed, but it is quite possible that there are other sources of generating electricity.  For instance, on a great number of farms wind power is being successfully utilised in generating electricity for lighting purposes. Have the Government ever given thought to the question whether wind power could not be developed to a much greater extent?  I think they should consider that matter seriously. The development of other sources of power should be the main consideration of the Government from a national and economic point of view. The fact that we have to depend on imported fuel puts us in a weak economic position when dealing with other nations and making trade agreements with them.  We are forced to a great extent to depend upon one market and accept whatever prices are oflered there, whereas if we were self-sufficient in this matter we would be in a stronger position to bargain for better prices for our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support what Deputy Hughes said with regard to the electrification of farmsteads.  At least there is room for an experiment in this direction.  I have no doubt that in certain parts of the country the experiment would be successful and would be commercially sound.  We all know the enormous amount of work which has to be carried on in farms, <Col N="455" /> such as the grinding of corn, the pulping of roots, threshing and other farm operations for which electric power could be used very extensively.  I believe that if the idea were tried out, at least in certain counties, particularly extensive tillage and stall-feeding counties, it would prove successful.</P>
    <P>Another matter which seems to have been completely neglected is the extension of the scheme to our smaller towns.  A great number of our small towns and villages have been completely neglected notwithstanding the fact that they all contribute directly and indirectly to this scheme and to national taxation, which helps to finance this scheme.  There is no reason whatever why any of our small towns and villages should be neglected as they are at present.  I think these are considerations which the Minister should weigh well.  I would particularly stress the fact that we are acting against the best national interests if we allow our peat resources to be exhausted for the purpose of creating electric power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan's fears of our consuming turf and allowing our supplies to run out do not worry me for a moment, because I think competent authorities from time to time have assured us that there are some 300 years of peat stocks in the country. I do think that there is much in what Deputy McGilligan has stated. We are all agreed upon the desirability of providing electric power in the rural districts of Ireland.  I think that in the beginning that, in fact, was the idea behind the whole Shannon scheme.  Throughout the country at that time there was a number of small power houses.  There was a very considerable power house in Dublin, the Pigeon House, which was taken over from the Dublin ratepayers and for which the Dublin ratepayers have to pay through the nose.  There are times during the year when it is still largely availed of.  Of course, it has been supplemented since the board took it over.  New machinery has been installed to the tune of some thousands of pounds but, nevertheless, it carries practically the whole of the load in <Col N="456" /> the city at some periods of the year. As I said, there was a number of old power houses in the towns which might have been utilised for supplying urban needs, but the real idea behind the Shannon scheme, as I saw it in the first instance at any rate, was to supply electricity for rural purposes.  I think that we should have from the board a clear statement as to what they intend to do in connection with the supply of electricity for rural areas.  I do not want to dilate on the matter, but I think when the Shannon scheme was mooted in the first instance we visualised a return to the cottage industries. If our smaller towns and the farms throughout the country had electricity going by the door, so to speak, it would have done much to stop the so-called flight from the land.  I believe we would have got back to that system of cottage industries whereby much of the influx into the towns would have been stopped.  Above all else, I do think as Deputy McGilligan has stated, that we should get clear and precise statements from the board about their every intention.</P>

      <P>I intervene to correct a statement made by the last speaker when he said that the citizens of Dublin are paying through the nose for the plant taken over by the board.  The citizens of Dublin are getting electricity at a cheaper rate at present than ever before&mdash;that is since the board took over control.  The Deputy's statement, therefore, is not accurate.</P>

      <P>I should hate that a Bill with a very practical object such as this Bill has, should create partisan feelings in the House and the country, about Clonsast, about the Erne, about wind power, or for or against the Electricity Supply Board or the Government.  We can all have our own opinions as to what is the best metliod of approach to this problem. It is a very concrete one&mdash;what is the best way to enable the Electricity Supply Board to fulfil its obligations, particularly those obligations which were laid down in the original Act of 1927.  In Section 19 of that Act it was laid down that: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board to produce and generate electricity in the Shannon, works <Col N="457" /> so soon as the works or a sufficient portion thereof for the purpose, are handed over to the board by the Minister, and to transmit through the transmission system of the Shannon works and any extension of that system, the electricity so generated; to control, co-ordinate and improve the supply, distribution and sale of electricity generally in Saoratát Eireann and for the purposes of such control, co-ordination and improvement to exercise and employ the powers conferred on the board by this Act&rdquo;. The Oireachtas has laid a statutory duty on the board in regard to this matter.  The board will be unable to fulfil that statutory duty satisfactorily unless we provide it with additional finances and with additional plant.  In view of the fact that one or two Deputies who spoke in the discussion have suggested that the best way to deal with the problem now before us is to refuse to the Electricity Supply Board the financial provision which is necessary to enable it to fulfil that duty, I should like to emphasise that I hope, whatever opinions we may have as to the merits of the proposals envisaged by the Bill, that we shall not adopt that attitude in regard to the matter, at any rate.</P>
      <P>Although I have already, with the permission of Deputy McGilligan, intervened during his speech to correct two figures which I gave in my statement introducing this Bill, I should like again, more formally, to correct the figures which I gave originally and which were erroneous.  I mentioned that the original cost of the Liffey scheme was estimated at £503,350.  In fact, the original estimate for the scheme was £760,000.  In the course of the statement I also said that, the revised figure was £784,690.  In fact, the revised estimate was £1,041,340. I misquoted these figures as I was not able to make the summation correctly when I was speaking on the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer to a couple of matters which were raised by Deputy McGilligan before I come to the more general discussion.  Perhaps it is not of very much moment, but I do not think it would he correct to say that when the Electricity Supply Act <Col N="458" /> of 1927 was going through the House it was the general intention under that Act to make provision for pensions. In fact I am advised that the attitude then taken was that the House would rather wait for some time until some headway had been made with the undertaking before this question of pensions was considered at all, and I think we may take that attitude as indicating that, in the view of the Government of the day, the statute was not wide enough to permit the board to proceed with the formulation of a pensions scheme without at any rate having further recourse to the House. The Deputy is quite correct when he states that he understands that discussions have been going on between the board and my Department and the Department of Finance with a view to introducing legislation to enable the board to formulate a pensions scheme for its staff.  Had it not been for the somewhat abnormal circumstances of last year we think that we should have been able to bring before the Oireachtas definite proposals to grant the board such enabling powers.</P>
    <P>Another point Deputy McGilligan referred to was the doubt which my statement had created in his mind as to whether the board in fact had been disregarding the recommendations of the Banking Commission and had been disregarding the spirit, if not the letter, of the statute in proceeding to enter into commitments without having the previous authority of the House. Again, in that connection, I should perhaps explain that we had hoped to introduce the Bill which is now before the House at a much earlier date.  We had hoped that it would have been introduced about a year ago rather than now.  Notwithstanding that fact, I think we could hold, on a strict interpretation of the statutes, that the board has not in fact exceeded its statutory authority.  Under the various statutes which have been passed by the House from time to time, advances up to a sum of £9,289,000 have been authorised, and the sum actually advanced totalled £7,043,000; so that it would appear, even from these figures, that the board had unutilised authority to the extent of over £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> However, we are not relying on that argument but rather on this one, that the board has been able to proceed with and carry out a number of important extensions and developments very largely by utilising its reserves and that, in regard to commitments which have been entered into, it has been made clear to the board that no advance from the Central Fund on account of such expenditure can be contemplated in the absence of legislation extendihg the existing powers of the Government in this connection and that it would be necessary for the board to have regard to these limitations before embarking on any expenditure provisionally authorised.  I think the board have had that fact in mind in relation to the matter of financial authority and, as I have said, any of the extensions and any of the works which are urgently required have been financed up to the present out of the reserves.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to item No. 19 as described in the statement which I circulated.  I grant him at once the description was somewhat misleading in its terms, at least it would mislead if the provisions of the Liffey Reservoir Act were not adverted to.  Item No. 19 is described as, &ldquo;Estimated increased expenditure over estimated amount provided for in the Liffey Reservoir Act &mdash;£283,000.&rdquo;  It might have been assumed from the wording, and in fact I think the Deputy was inclined to assume from it, that that represented an increase of £283,000 in respect of the Liffey Hydro-Electric scheme over and above the £280,000 set against item No. 20.  In fact, the Liffey Reservoir Act increased the advances which might be made to the board by £3,000,000, and was intended not merely to cover the cost of the Liffey Hydro-Electric scheme but also the general purposes of the board as well.</P>
    <P>I now come to some other points which have been made in the course of the debate.  Two matters have been the subject of much criticism.  First of all, the fact that the board was assumed not to have given any attention to this question of rural electrification. I can, of course, say at once <Col N="460" /> that that by no means represents the attitude of the board in regard to the matter.  As I pointed out, the board under the Act of 1927 had imposed upon it certain obligations, and I think it will be conceded that in the short period it has been in existence it has certainly fulfilled those obligations. There is no reason, I suggest, to believe that, having developed this undertaking on the scale at which it now stands, the board is going to be content with what it has already dons and is henceforward going to rest on its oars.  I do not know whether the accounts of the board over a period of years have been studied by Deputies. If so, I think that they will have been, as I have been&mdash;and I used to know something about this problem &mdash; astonished at the progress which the electrical industry under the guidance of the board has made in this country. In the four years from 1st April, 1936, to 31st March, 1940, the consumption of electricity here has increased by 131,000,000 units, representing 70 per cent. of the consumption for the year whicn ended on the 31st March, 1936.  In the same four years the number of new consumers has increased by 50 per cent.; the additions for the year to the 31st March, 1937, being 13,779; for the year to the 31st March, 1938, 14,747; for the year to 31st March, 1939, 15,152; and for the year to the 31st March, 1940, 12,163; making 55,841 new consumers secured, in all, in four years&mdash;as I said, an increase of almost 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>What I have said in regard to the consumption of electricity applies, of course, to the increased extent to which industrial power has been utilised in the country.  The industrial power load connected increased from 71,000 H.P. on 1st April, 1936, to 115,703 H.P. on the 31st October, 1940.  For the four years to the 31st March, 1940, the board has opened up 95 areas of new supply and at that date was supplying, in all, 323 district areas.  Now, it is not right to assume, as has been assumed here, that these 323 district areas represent only the cities and towns.  There are, as a matter of fact, many rural districts included in these 323 areas.  They include 54 rural areas, including <Col N="461" /> very small villages&mdash;53 with a population of 100 to 300, 43 wlth a population of 300 to 500, and 64 with a population of 500 to 1,000; that is to say, over 200 areas of supply inhabited by people who live in villages or towns of 1,000 inhabitants and under.  I think that when we are talking about the progress rural electricity supply has made elsewhere, we ought to realise that the bulk of supply to rural consumers in other countries is given to people who live in such towns and villages and only rarely to isolated farms at all.  In the same way here, we are supplying a considerable number of farms that happen to be convenient to the source of supply, and in this respect are probably in advance of most countries.  In regard to this question of general rural electrification moreover the board has an obligation to develop its undertaking in an orderly way.  It is bound to make ends meet and, in fixing its rates of charge, to ensure that these rates will be sufficient to enable it to meet all its obligations as laid down in Section 29, I think, of the Act of 1927.  I forget the relevant section, whether it is Section 21 or Section 29, but it is laid down there, and the board cannot meet its obligations if it rushes into expenditure which, in the circumstances, will be unremunerative and uneconomic.</P>
    <P>In that connection we again have to revert to the fact that when the electricity supply undertaking was established it was intended to be run as a business concern, and accordingly, whether the amount of progress in relation to rural electrification has been satisfactory or not, if it has not been more rapid up to this, the fault does not lie with the board&mdash;and I am not going to admit that the fault lies with the Government&mdash;it is merely the expression of a principle which was assumed to be basic when the undertaking was set on foot: that it would have to carry on and develop without any subsidy or without any assistance from the Government other than that which an ordinary commercial concern would be entitled to get.  We took the responsibility of financing it and, in assuming that responsibility, we were <Col N="462" /> also careful to lay upon the board the obligation of remunerating the State, in the form of interest, for any advances which the State made.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to emphasise that, in view of the statements that have been made here, during the course of the debate, to the effect that the farmers and the country are getting nothing out of it.  The farmers and the citizens of this country&mdash;and the bulk of the citizens of this country happen to be farmers&mdash;secure a reasonable revenue out of this undertaking in the form of interest upon the advances&mdash; interest which is fixed at a rate which allows a small profit to the Exchequer, and that profit, of course, inures to the taxpayer, and it is provided, of course, by the electricity consumers of the country; but so far as the general people of the country are concerned, whether they be farmers, workers, or shopkeepers, this undertaking, at the stage at which it now is, imposes no burden whatsoever on them.</P>

I was going on to point out that this electricity undertaking, at the present stage of development, has imposed no burden on the community as a whole; that farmers do not have to pay anything for electricity, and neither do shopkeepers in those districts where the supply is not yet available.  None of the non-users of electricity have to contribute in any way towards the maintenance of this undertaking.  It is supported entirely by those who take a supply of electricity.</P>

      <P>Before I leave the question of rural electrification I should like to emphasise that the matter has been receiving the attention of the Board and of the Government for the last two years, but because of the situation and the problems created by the outbreak of the European war, it had naturally to be laid aside for some time, but it is again being taken up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I am not going to commit myself in relation to that matter.  I have indicated to the <Col N="464" /> House that it is engaging the active attention of the E.S.B., and has already engaged the attention of the Government, and when the results of their deliberations are before us we may have to come to the House again, and ask it to facilitate the board in executing whatever plans are formed in regard to it.  It is not true to allege, as Deputy Cosgrave alleged, that the E.S.B. had failed as a great national undertaking, and that it was compelled to lose sight of the interests of the farming community.  Nothing of the sort.</P>
      <P>We come now to the question of the Portarlington station.  I do not know whether I could possibly discuss here with any lucidity the complex considerations which have to be taken account of in deciding to proceed with hydro-electrical development, but the figures which I gave to the House in my opening statement should bring home very clearly that the full utilisation of our water power resources can only be secured if we are careful to maintain a proper balance between our steam-driven plant and our water power plant.  I instanced the record of the Shannon river over the past ten years. It has always been the policy of the Board to secure the maximum output from the Shannon, and to utilise for the production of electrical power, as far as it possibly can, every drop of water going down the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though that is the policy of the Board, it can only give effect to that policy with reservations.  It has no control whatever over the quantity of water that the heavens may send down the Shannon in any one year.  In 1934 the season was a very dry one and, as I have already indicated, the output which the board was able to secure from the river was only 108,000,000 units.  In fact, it is no harm to say it now, in the middle of December, 1934, the situation with regard to water was such that the Board was actually considering whether it would not have to try to ration the use of electricity in this country.  The middle of December was almost the very height of the peak load.  Fortunately rain came and the situation was saved.  In the year 1937-38, however, the inflow conditions at the catchment area were such <Col N="465" /> that the board was able to generate 282,000,000 units, and to reduce very largely the output generated by the steam-driven station.</P>
    <P>The House must remember that when a consumer is connected to the electricity supply network, whether he wants the current for lighting, power or for cooking purposes there is an obligation to give him all the electricity he wants at any hour of the day or night, and, therefore, the plant of the Electricity Supply Board, as suppliers, must be always sufficient to meet the maximum demands made on the system at any hour during the 24 hours.  If you have an hydro-electric development such as the Shannon, where storage facilities are small in relation to the possible demand, you must be faced with the situation which the Electricity Supply Board actually had to face in 1934, when the capacity of the generating plant fell to almost one-third of what it might be in a year which was a little wetter than the average.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if you want to ensure that you will be able to get the utmost benefit out of the supply of water which may be available in a normal year, or in a better than a normal year, you have to instal steam plant of practically equivalent capacity to the normal capacity of your water power plant in any one year.  That has been shown by the actual experience in the operation of the Shannon scheme.  The figures, which I gave in the course of the Second Reading speech, and which I gave again to-day in answer to Deputy Dockrell's question, show that the total capacity, in certain circumstances, of the Ardnacrusha plant is about 96,000 kw. and the capacity of the steam plant at the Pigeon House 95,000 kw.  We can take it that the Electricity Supply Board has a natural desire to make the best showing possible, and would not have burdened itself with the capital charges which, naturally, the installation of the steam plant necessitates if it had not been absolutely essential to undertake the development at the Pigeon House. Originally, it was anticipated that the <Col N="466" /> plant at the Pigeon House would remain comparatively small, but, as the situation has developed over the past ten years, it has been found that the capacity of the plant at the Pigeon House must, as I have already indicated to the House, be of the same order as the plant at Ardnacrusha.  That does not apply, perhaps, with the same force to the Poulaphouca scheme, because, though the storage capacity on the Shannon hydro-electric development represents only about 6 per cent. of the normal electrical output from the river, the situation is different in relation to the Poulaphouca development where the storage capacity is equivalent to at least 50 per cent. of the estimated maximum economic output from the river.  If all our rivers were like the Liffey, and capable of being developed to give the same high storage capacity, the ratio between our steam plant and our water-power plant might be very different.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to the Erne is very similar to that in relation to the Shannon.  I gather, from the investigations which have been made, that, like the Shannon, the storage facilities on the Erne are only about 5 or 6 per cent. of the possible output from the river in any one year, and that the same wide variations in inflow from the catchment into the river are to be expected and have, in fact, been found, in the Erne as in the Shannon. Accordingly, it is the view of the Board&mdash;and I think that their judgment in this matter, bearing in mind their experience, could not be contested&mdash;that the next extension of plant must take the form of steam-driven plant.</P>
    <P>The question then arises: where is this plant to be situated? Before we come to that, I should like to say this: the Board was asked to investigate the economics of a peat fuel station, and the technical and economic aspects of such a generating station were the subject of investigation by the Board's staff. For the purpose of informing himself fully on the problem, one of the senior members of the staff has visited stations in Germany and Russia and is <Col N="467" /> satisfied&mdash;as indeed every engineer is satisfied&mdash;that as far as the utilisation of peat as a fuel in an electrical generating station is concerned, the problem has been solved and there is no technical difficulty of any importance to be overcome in that matter. There is no question about it: provided the other conditions are suitable, electricity can be generated as economically from turf as from coal&mdash;in fact, it is being so generated in other countries. That is the opinion and that is the report of, I think, as competent a technical expert as can be found anywhere. I am not going to say for a moment that in the case of our engineers, who have had experience now of electrical generation for the last 14 or 15 years, their opinion on a matter of this sort is likely to be any less reliable or less valuable than an opinion which could be got from any other engineer, no matter how eminent or how wide his reputation.  Accordingly, so far as the utilisation of peat as a fuel in an electrical generating station is concerned, we have no fears&mdash;I have no fears, the board have no fears and I do not think the House need have any fears.  It is a practical proposition and, what is more, according to figures which have been supplied to me by the Electricity Supply Board, provided the fuel can be got at a reasonable cost in relation to coal&mdash;and we have no reason to believe that it cannot be so obtained&mdash;so far as the economics are concerned the advantage, if any&mdash;and I do not want to put it more than that &mdash;rests with peat against bituminous coal.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that, if we can get the fuel at a reasonable price as compared with coal, the economic advantage&mdash;though it is not a very great one&mdash;is on the side of peat.  These arc the figures on the basis of the latest information. The cost per unit generated for peat is .453d., with peat at 10/6 per ton, as against .467d. for coal, with coal at 30/- a ton.  Our experience of turf development is that we should be able in normal circumstances to get peat at 10/6 per ton, and that we shall be able to get it in the quantitles required.  As I indicated, there may be in the minds of some of us a doubt as to whether we shall be able to get the 120,000 tons of peat per year from Clonsast.  I do not wish to minimise ths difficulties in that regard.  I must say that Clonsast is a big undertaking, but I know this&mdash;that the men who have been working the bog, in a preliminary way in 1939 and in a more extended way last summer, have no doubt whatever that they will be able to deliver 120,000 tons of turf year after year to the Portarlington station.</P>

      <P>This is a serious problem, and I am not putting the proposition to the House exactly in the way the Deputy is ascribing to me.  It <Col N="469" /> is true that there have been mistakes in regard to peat development, but it is not fair to ascribe those mistakes to the Turf Development Board.  In fact, the Turf Development Board had nothing whatever to do either with the briquetting proposition or with the proposition for the development of the hand won turf.  Indeed, a Government scheme to try and develop hand won turf had been initiated before the Turf Development Board was established at all.  The Turf Development Board was established to undertake a large scale development of our bogs.  It has made a thorough survey of our bogs&mdash;this is something of a digression, a digression evoked by Deputy Morrissey&mdash;but it has made, as I say, a thorough survey of our bogs.  It has three of them already in production.  It has done an amount of preliminary draining work on ten or eleven others, and it has taken over, and I hope will be able to operate next year, the Lorrymore bog on which the peat briquetting experiment was carried out.  But the Turf Development Board has no responsibility for anything which was done by the Peat Fuel Company of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I think that the non-nationals have returned to their own countries.  The Turf Board had the benefit of their advice and experience for the past four years.  They had also a very competent engineering staff, as the Electricity Supply Board have.  I am afraid that this procedure of question and answer is taking me off the track, but I want to make clear that, so far as the responsibility of the Electriccity Supply Board for the design and investigation of the electrical aspects of the proposition is concerned, they are satisfied that there is no difficulty in erecting a peat fuel station which will be an economic proposition, provided, as I have been careful to stats, that they get the requisite supply of turf from the Turf Development Board.  On their side, the Turf Development Board are satisfied that they can deliver the turf. On the basis of that assurance and because of their experience and the work they have done, I am prepared to put this proposition before the House and before the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider another aspect of this matter which has been referred to in the House by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan. We have been told that we are denuding the country of a very useful asset. We are told simultaneously that we ought to extend the supply of electricity into all the rural areas.  As a development of that idea, we were told that we were robbing the country in some way, that we ought to preserve this turf for future generations, that, in fact, we ought to constitute the Clonsast bog a national monument. We were told that, if we cut the bog now, all the poor people who have been drawing turf from that bog will be deprived of something which was their natural birthright.  The fact is that, until the Turf Development Board <Col N="477" /> began these operations, Clonsast bog was a useless swamp of 4,000 acres. Practically no turf was taken from it&mdash; save from the fringes.</P>
      <P>It was so little regarded by its owners, in fact, that it was acquired at 4/5 per acre, and that is the kind of thing that Deputy Cogan wants us to keep, presumably to make it a sort of national park, something for posterity to wonder at and to make it curse us for our lost opportunities. But when this bog has been reclaimed, and when it has been worked out, instead of having 4,000 acres of useless swamp, as I said, you will have 4,000 acres of reclaimed and, we hope, good fertile land.  Which do Deputies think the people around Portarlington and Clonsast bog would rather have&mdash;4,500 acres of useless swamp or 4,500 acres of reclaimed land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 7,000 acres of the best land in Wicklow under water?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And because the land in Wicklow has been put under water, Deputy Cogan wants the land in Laoighis and Offaly to be retained under water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not talk in these terms of a proposition like this. We have been urged, we have been driven, we have been scourged because we have not drained the bogs, cut them and reclaimed them, and the moment we proceed to do it, we get all sorts of opposition from farmer Deputies here.  The only reason we have that opposition, I feel, is that they have not seriously considered the proposition. They have not realised the benefit and advantage which it will be to the country as a whole if our experiment succeeds.  I think we are going to succeed with it, and, whether we do or not, I think it is worth the risk, and for whatever the risk may be in this matter, I am putting the proposition to the House, and I am certain that when the proposition is considered coolly and calmly, it will meet with universal acceptance.</P>

The question has never been raised, but I have said here in the House that if, for reasons which are completely outside our control and the control of the Turf Development Board, the assurance given to the E.S.B. were not fulfilled, we should probably have to make good to the Electricity Supply Board whatever the rusultant deficiency on Portarlington might be.

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Migration from the Land&mdash;Motion (resumed).</Title>
    <P>That the Dáil deplores the migration of the people from the land, and, being of opinion that one of the causes of this migration is the policy in operation over a number of years which finds expression in various statutes providing for differentiation in the treatment of similar classes of the population according as to whether they are resident in rural or non-rural areas, it hereby records its conviction that it is necessary, if the exodus from the land is to be slowed down, that every such statute, <Col N="483" /> that so differentiates either directly or indirectly against the rural population, be amended at once.&mdash;(Deputies McGovern and Nally.)</P>

      <P>In connection with this matter, the Chair would like to point out that agreement has been arrived at to conclude this motion to-night.  Therefore, I will call on Deputy McGovern, as the mover of the motion, to wind up the debate at 10.10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying when this matter was last under discussion, the legislation passed through this House since the inception of this State has been mainly directed towards improving the standard of living in the towns and cities to the detriment of the standard of living and the general remuneration of producers engaged in rural Ireland.  I was pointing put that, in connection with local taxation, for example, the effect of legislation in this House has been to compel the rural population to bear an excessive proportion of the cost of local government. Various Bills have been passed for the alleged purpose of relieving destitution, relieving unemployment, improving housing, improving sewerage, and so on, and under all those Bills an inequitable portion of the cost has had to be borne by the agricultural section of the community.  We have had an example of this legislation even as late as to-day, where the cost of relieving unemployment has been transferred to a very large extent to the people engaged In the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of legislation which has been going through this House for the past 18 years.  It is legislation designed to continue the abnormal situation, which existed when this State was established.  We know that at the time when this State was established the economic condition of the country was abnormal.  During the years of the last great war the prices of agricultural produce were increased threefold.  As a result of that increase in agricultural prices, all costs&mdash;including the cost of Government, the cost of transport, wages in most industries, and salaries of State officials&mdash;were increased threefold, <Col N="484" /> in the same proportion as agricultural prices were increased.  But in 1921 agricultural prices came down to what they were before the last great war, while the costs were not brought down.  The cost, of Government and the cost of public services, national and local, were at a figure which was three times the pre-war figure.  Since 1922 we have been passing legislation which has had the effect, of stabilising that very unsatisfactory condition of affairs. Every Bill which has been brought to this House, whether it was for the purpose of fixing salaries or fixing costs of any kind, has been on the basis that it is just and equitable that the disparity which existed in 1922 between the price of agricultural produce and the cost of Government should continue.</P>
    <P>That is a state of affairs which must be brought to an end by legislation. We must seek by legislation either to raise the standard of living in rural Ireland by raising the remuneration and the profits of those engaged in rural occupations, or alternatively we must force the cost of Government, the cost of transport and the cost of all public services down to the low level of agricultural profits.  That is the purpose, I think, of this motion, to point out that our legislation has been altogether on an unsound and uneconomic basis.  We hear various explanations given for the migration of our rural population to the cities and towns. We are told by learned people that, if the farmers were left alone, if there-were no agitators&mdash;whatever kind of people they are&mdash;to tell the farmers that they are not well off, the farmers would believe that they are well off. Now, it is hard to believe that any gentleman who is supposed to regard himself as serious can make such a statement as that when we realise the uneconomic conditions under which the agricultural industry is being run at the present time; when we realise that emergency legislation was passed through this House last year to compel the farmers to engage in increased tillage; to compel them to engage in that increased tillage under very drastic penalties should they fail to do so, and that, after the farmers had engaged <Col N="485" /> in that increased tillage and had increased their production, they found at the end of the year, after enormous expenses, that their produce was unsaleable, and is unsaleable still.</P>
    <P>Surely it is our duty as a Legislative Assembly to set about remedying that state of affairs.  If we pass legislation in this House compelling the farmer to increase production, to increase the acreage of land under tillage, we must at least take the very elementary step of ensuring that the farmer will get a decent wage for his work.  That is not too much to demand.  As our time is limited, I will not go over the various ways in which this House has failed to legislate equitably for the rural population, but I think the few instances which I have given will be sufficient to show that the position is not normal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene merely to refer to another aspect that might be dealt with on this motion.  The motion is dealing with the exodus from the land and suggests that it might be dealt with by amending legislation.  I think in the opinion of most people the exodus from the land is a social problem as well as an economic one, and I want to refer to one particular social aspect of it.  This House, in its wisdom, in 1935 passed an Act to regulate entertainment in the country, that is, ths Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, which set out under what conditions both in the cities and in rural Ireland public dance halls were to be licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main heads of these conditional were that the character of the applicant should be proper, that the hall should be suitable, that the Guards would be notified, that the public health authorities would be notified and, if they were satisfied with the fitness of the applicant and the suitability of his premises, he would then receive a licence subject to certain conditions which the district justice might impose.  Certain district justices in this country, acting on legislation passed by this House, have taken it upon themselves to act as moral censors of the people of this country and to differentiate very stronaly between <Col N="486" /> the morals of the people of the city and the morals of the people of the country.  That is the reason I make this point on this motion, because it deals with legislation of this sort.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy in tills House is aware that in the cities of Dublin and Cork, and in any town of any substantial size in this country, public dance halls will be licensed for all night dancing and are sometimes granted an occasional licence with a bar attached, but apparently there are people who, by their privileged position as justices in this State, can talk about individuals in country areas and decide for themselves that the country people are not fit to get the concessions that the city people get.  There are justices in this country who, quite recently, have taken it upon themselves to tell applicants in the District Court, when neither the Guards nor the State solicitor had any objection to their applications, that they could not dance certain hours, that they could not dance certain types of dances, that they could not have a bar or anything like that. I would suggest to the Minister, who is present in the House, that if this House passes an Act of Parliament which sets down certain defined regulations for the issuing of licences for any type of premises, amusements or anything else, people should not be allowed to use a privileged position to comment upon the character of the people in the district.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputies from my constituency will agree with me that we are very fortunate in our area in that respect, that We could not say one word against the attitude of any justice in our area, but it is perfectly plain that in other areas in this country justices take upon themselves to pontificate about what the young people of the country may do and what the young people of the country may not do.  I suggest to ths Minister who is dealing with this that the question should be looked into. Is any justice, simply because he is in a privileged position, entitled to get up and say in public court that the young people of any area in tins country, whether town or city, are not fit to dance after a certain hour, are not fit to be considered proper people because <Col N="487" /> they want to dance a certain type of dance?  When people do that sort of thing, they are using legislation to shove their private opinions down other people's throats.  The only result of their attitude is that the unfortunate applicant who goes before that district justice and has his licence refused is compelled to appeal to the circuit judge for his licence to get the restrictions removed, which the circuit court judge, strangely enough, in that particular case, always does, at a cost&mdash;Deputy Corry will be sorry to hear&mdash;of ten guineas to the applicant.  I am sure Deputy Corry will agree with me that it is very wrong for any district justice to put any applicant for a licence in the position of having to pay ten guineas to a solicitor.</P>

Are district justices going to be allowed to air their private views upon every subject that comes up before them?  They are there to do, one job only&mdash;to carry out the law and administer the law as passed by this House and, simply because they have a bee in their bonnet about one particular subject, the type of dances or, hours of dancing, they should not be allowed to get up in the District Court and use that as a platform for airing their own pet grievances about any particular subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Kelly, if he reads the motion, will find that legislation in this country is being accused in this motion of affecting the flight from the land.  I am suggesting that legislation that was passed by this House, when Deputy Kelly was a member of it, is being used in such a way as to suggest that the people in the country are not as good or as moral as the citizens of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say there are district justices in the country who are doing that.  Deputy Kelly may not agree with that view.  I would be sorry to hear it suggested that the people in the country were only as good or as moral as the citizens of Dublin.  I suggest that, if it is possible, the Minister present should intimate to the Minister for Justice that in the interests of the law in this country, in the interests of carrying out the legislation it is supposed to carry out, it would be at least hinted to these gentlemen that they were appointed to deal with the applications before them according to the law they had to administer, according to the merits of the application and that in those particular cases the local Gárda superintendent and the local State solicitor are perfectly good judges of the character of the applicant and the applicant's premises.  These justices ought not to be allowed, merely because they have a bee in their bonnet; to put people to the expense of an appeal and to utilise the law in a way it was never intended to be used.  It is wrong, it is disgraceful that a district justice, just because he does not like to give them the licence, puts unfortunate individuals who appear before him to the trouble and expense of appealing to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>There is just one other subject I would like to refer to on this motion. I think it is quite possible, as far as housing is concerned in this country and as far as money is being expended under legislation by this House, that very soon the Government will seriously have to take stock of the position of housing.  There is no question or doubt&mdash;and I think most country Deputies will agree with me&mdash;that if houses are to be built for people who are classified as labourers in the country those houses should be spread out over the countryside and not attached to towns.  There is certainly a differentiation between the towns and the rural areas in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urban building in certain towns in this country has been carried to extremes. It has been carried to extremes <Col N="489" /> for this reason, that the cost of the buildings that are put up is so high that very often the rents are so excessive that they are useless to the type of people who want them or else entirely uneconomic for the local authority.  A system has developed in this country, even as regards the ordinary labourers' cottages, to build ten or 12 together right up to the very edge of the town, instead of having those eight or ten labourers' cottages spread all over the rural area.  I believe that if houses are available near a town at the rent of labourers' cottages, it is a definite attraction to people to come and occupy those houses and to try to get employment in the town rather than stay in the country and work as they would normally for farmers or anybody else there.</P>
    <P>There is no question that if 12 houses are built near any town or village and offered by the board of health for tenancy, the people who will go into them will be agricultural labourers; but, once they go into the houses, if it is at all possible they will cease to be agricultural labourers because they will attempt to get employment with a building contractor or they will obtain casual employment on the roads or in the adjacent town.</P>
    <P>While we have been doing a lot in the way of urban building, rural building has been more or less neglected.  In almost every area there has been some progress in the erection of labourers' cottages, but it is more or less the practice that if they build five cottages in a rural area, they build ten or 12 right outside a town or village.  In most cases where people go into these cottagas they no longer remain agricultural labourers, in the sense that they are working on farms.  No doubt at the time they take over the cottages they are agricultural labourers within the meaning of the Act.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with legislation such as would apply to people in the rural areas as compared with the urban areas, I suggest that something should be done in the way of a definition of an agricultural labourer.  At present almost anybody in a rural area comes <Col N="490" /> within the definition of an agricultural labourer.  On one famous occasion I was informed that an agricultural labourer was a person who did work for farmers.  I suggest that there are certain Deputies who might qualify for the occupancy of a labourer's cottage under the existing definition.  It might also be suggested that a solicitor living in a country town could, under the present definition, become the tenant of a cottage, because undoubtedly he is a person who does work for farmers. Of course, Deputy Corry may not agree with that.  The only difference is that when a solicitor does work for a farmer, and from that point of view qualifies himself as an agricultural labourer, he would probably be better paid by a man like Deputy Corry, for instance, than a genuine agricultural labourer, and perhaps he would be more sure of his money.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the existing definition of an agricultural labourer is extraordinarily vague.  Apparently, anybody who can show the local authority that he is living within a certain income is entitled to become the tenant of a cottage, very often to the exclusion of a <i>bona fide</i> agricultural labourer.  I think Deputies from my area will agree that, if 500 cottages were built there, it would be more satisfactory to see those cottages spread out more instead of being built in a row; it is much more desirable to have them dotted around the countryside.  I do not know how Deputy Corry regards the definition of an agricultural labourer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has been referring to is the building of houses near villages and towns.  I suggest that Deputy Linehan, having a nine-tenths majority on the board of health, ought to be able, through his organisation, to control them and he ought not to be bringing it up here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main difference between Deputy Corry and myself is that, even though I may have a nine-tenths majority on the board of health, and can make the board do certain things, I am not afraid of criticising that board of health.  I will criticise the North Cork Board of Health, no matter who has the majority on it, if it does not do the things it ought to do.  I will criticise the members of that board and every other board of health in Eire if I think they are giving cottages to people who are not <i>bona fide</i> agricultural labourers, over the heads of those who are.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil deplores the migration of the people from the land, and, being of opinion that one of the causes of this migration is the policy in operation over a number of years which finds expression in various statutes providing for differentiation in the treatment of similar classes of the population according as to whether they are resident in rural or non-rural areas, it hereby records its conviction that it is necessary, if the exodus from the land is to be slowed down, that every such statute, that so differentiates either directly or indirectly against the rural population, be amended at once.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make suggestions which, if <Col N="492" /> put into operation, might bring about some measure of relief.  First of all, we have the Department of Agriculture. I think that Department should make some arrangement to give loans to farmers for the purchase of artificial manure, live stock and farm implements at a low rate of interest.  With the co-operation of the Department of Local Government, immediate steps should be taken to derate all agricultural land.  I believe that if these suggestions were given effect to, it would help considerably towards keeping the people on the land.</P>
    <P>Another important Government, institution is the Department of Lands. They should immediately proceed to divide all the lands now held by the Land Commission and they should acquire all the large grazing ranches. They should also migrate the holders of uneconomic holdings from the congested districts, especially those who have families.  Many Deputies are aware of the amount of land available in Meath, Westmeath and the Midlands. There is no reason why the poor unfortunate congests from the West should not get some opportunity of being transferred there.  They were promised a scheme of migration long ago, and if that scheme were carried out it would help to remedy the flight of the young people from the land.</P>
    <P>The Public Works Department should be asked to carry out certain drainage works.  So far as the County Mayo is concerned, they should deal with the drainage of the Moy and its tributaries, the Gweston, Pollock and Yellow rivers, partly in North Mayo and partly in South Mayo; and they should also deal with the Clare-Dalgan river in South Mayo.  That would provide remunerative employment for 1,500 men for at least three years. These are some of the remedies I suggest and I do not believe they would cost the Government very much.  They would be productive works and they would help to relieve some of the existing unemployment.</P>
    <P>The cost of living in this country has gone up since Fianna Fáil got into power.  The price of flour has been practically doubled.  We have to pay 23/6 a cwt. for flour, whereas a sack <Col N="493" /> of flour in Liverpool is selling for 25/- That is double the price&mdash;we have to pay double what they are paying in England although England is supposed to be one of the richest countries in the world.  Everybody knows how rates have risen in the country in the last few years, especially since Fianna Fáil got into power.  We have seen industries that were once flourishing and able to pay dividends, driven into such a state that they are no longer able to pay such dividends.  Take the railways, for instance.  Up to 1932 they were paying dividends on certain classes of their stock.  Since then, they have been unable to pay dividends either on their preference or ordinary stocks.  I suppose they must be on the verge of bankruptcy.  I only mention that as one instance of the decay of former prosperous concerns for which Fianna Fáil policy was responsible.  I do not wish to labour the point at this stage as I understand that the arrangement was that the debate should conclude at 10.10 p.m. and it is just that time now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I do not agree with Deputy Linehan that the discontent of the agricultural community is altogether due to the absence of facilities for indulging in certain pastimes.  The exodus from the land is a purely economic problem. There is no doubt that there is a social aspect connected with it, too, because quite recently I travelled to West Cork and I saw about 250 persons on the side of the road dancing there.  It happened to be a fine evening, but I can well picture the plight of these boys and girls if the evening were wet. Where would these boys and girls meet to pass their leisure hours?  There should be some kind of a parochial hall where social contact would be provided. I do not think, however, that difficulties of that kind trouble the people very much.  The whole question, <Col N="494" /> as I understand it, is a purely economic one.  If the farming community were able to make ends meet and enjoy a decent standard of comfort, we would not have so many people leaving the land.  A few weeks ago I heard An Taoisrach stating that if we were to build up an economy on the land in this country, we must base it on frugal comfort.  I think I can claim to have a good knowledge of the kind of life led by farmers and agricultural labourers, and I think it is entirely below a decent standard of living.  A boy or girl, the son or daughter of a farmer or an agricultural labourer, will not continue to live in rural districts on ths poor standard of wages at present afforded when he or she can get better wages in more congenial surroundings, and I do not think that anybody can criticise such boys or girls for leaving the country under present conditions.</P>
      <P>A professor recently told us that it was not a question of money, that if the farmers had more money there would be more dance halls and a lot more dogs.  I think a statement of that kind is an insult to the intelligence of the farming community.  Somebody else stated that farmers' wives should learn how to work as farmers' wives. That is another insult to the farming community.  The Taoiscach mentioned here recently that if we are going to have an economy based on frugal comfort many of our people will have to shed some of their present sense of values in life.  I am entirely in agreement with him, but I am wondering why he does not do something to bring these things about instead of talking about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will deny that the standard of life among the farming community, and indeed amongst the poor people as a whole, is anything but an enviable one? Notwithstandins all the complaints about the conditions of these people, we have still 2,500 persons who have an annual income, after paying income-tax and surtax, of over £8,500,000 between them.  There could be a good deal of frugal comfort provided for people in rural districts if some of that excessive wealth of the leisured classes were taken from these people, and I would <Col N="495" /> suggest to the Taoiscach when he talks about frugal comfort, the sooner he takes some action of that kind, the better for the country.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I am to regard the silence of the Parliamentary Secretary as indicating that he is prepared to accept the motion on behalf of the Government, but I cannot take any other meaning out of his silence.  I have not heard a single word from the opposite benches; probably they agree with the motion.  I challenge them if they do not agree with it to get up and explain why.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary represents a rural constituency which is similar in many respects to my own.  I do not think there is any part of it which could not be described as a rural constituency.  I take his silence to-night as an indication of sympathy with the motion and as an implied promise that something is going to be done to bring about more equitable relations between the different sections of our people.  Sooner or later that must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day is coming when the people in the rural districts, who number three-fourths of our total population, who are not any more lacking in intelligence than the people of our cities and towns, will wake up.  They in turn will wake <Col N="496" /> up the powers that be and will see that justice is done to them.  That day would have come long ago were it not that they were kept divided over other little matters which distracted their attention from the real problem and the system by which they have been treated as slaves.  For my own part I would much prefer to see the Government, with the co-operation of all Parties in this House, dealing with this problem before the day comes when the country will compel them to do so.</P>
    <P>It is not merely in the interests of equity, although that is a very important aspect, but in the interests of the nation as a whole, that some attempt should be made to solve this problem, because it will be impossible to keep our people from leaving the land and going into the cities if the standard of living for every particular class is three times as high in the cities as it is in the country.  It is only humbug, and everybody knows it is humbug, for educated people to try to explain the flight from the land by saying that it is due to lack of facilities for enjoyment in the country.  The people in the country can enjoy themselves as far as they want to.  They are not in the least handicapped in that respect.  Their discontent arises from the economic position.  The people in the country are no fools, and the Parliamentary Secretary knows that perfectly well. He knows what the income of the agricultural labourer and the people in the small towns in County Monaghan is. The trouble is that the members of the agricultural community are scattered far and wide over plain and mountain.  A well-organised Party, which has other interests, finds no trouble at all in keeping these people at one another's throats, keeping them divided over petty things and drawing them away from their own best interests.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputies on all sides realise that the day is coming when the people in the rural districts will come together, and the sooner they come together the better.  I hope when they do come together they will not waste their time talking about nonsensical things which do not affect them.  I hope that they will come down to the root of the problem <Col N="497" /> and that they will deal with the disease itself rather than with the symptoms.  I hope that they will not confine themselves to petty points, such as quotas and things like that, but deal with the real policy that has been in operation, which is to protect one section of the people and keep them in a superior position and to use the other section, comprising three-fourths of the people, as slaves to produce and sell their produce at less than the cost of production.</P>
    <P>In an English newspaper to-day I saw that the English Government are going to take more bacon from Ireland because the Irish people are selling it cheaper than it can be produced on the other side.  Is not that a lesson for the Parliamentary Secretary and for every one of us?  What does it mean?  It means that we are selling pigs at less than the cost of production. We have not only to produce these pigs but we have to pay the freight upon them to England and the high insurance in wartime and still undersell the producers on the other side.  They would be losing money even though they would not have to pay the freight, insurance and the middleman's profit; they could not produce them at the price.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the other side of the picture.  There is another section of producers in this country who are not satisfied to produce at world prices plus the freight charges which their competitors would have to pay.  Even with the advantage of from 40 per cent. to 75 per cent. added, they must still be protected more and more by quotas, and all this at the expense of the unfortunate people who are producing at so much below the world price.  I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to tell us about the principal industry in his county.  He was very wise not to speak to-night and I congratulate him on his wisdom.  He knows that the principal industry and the most thriving industry in County Monaghan, and I challenge him to deny it, is smuggling eggs across the Border, where they are 9d. per dozen higher than in County Monaghan, where they have to pay <Col N="498" /> higher for feeding stuffs than at the other side and where they have to pay 60 per rent. higher for many of the articles they have to buy.  Yet these people have to sell their own produce almost 50 per cent. below the cost ot production.  In order to do that, of course, they must adopt a standard of living below that of any other class. The only remedy for them is to fly from the land and take any position that is going.  Anyone who is connected with a local body knows that even for the job of porter, street sweeper, or road-maker there would be as many as 150 applicants.  These people would take anything at all to get off the land.  Then the Parliamentary Secretary and everybody know that labour is organised against the poor people who are reared on small farms because they are competing with labour and would do the work at half the money.  They are driven to such a state that they would undercut labour in order to live; but the fact is that they are hardly allowed to live at all.</P>
    <P>The present position certainly calls for a remedy.  Everybody knows perfectly well what the position is in every county, certainly in a good many of the western, north-western and southern counties.  They know that the people on the land are being crushed. Instead of doing anything to assist these people the Government have applied the goad.  They make an order requiring increased production.  Although they are only giving about half or two-thirds of the cost of production, they make the farmers produce more and more, lose more and more money, and slave harder and harder.  Even then they are leaving the produce on the farmers' hands.  At the same time, these &ldquo;cushy&rdquo; people who have little factories are making 12½ and 15 per cent. upon the money they put into these factories, and are paying their workers at least three times the wages of agricultural labourers for much less work.  As I say, the Parliamentary Secretary was wise in not replying to this debate.  In my own halting way I have made a case for this motion. Indeed, I must say, that the case was worthy of a better advocate.  But in my own stumbling way I have put <Col N="499" /> facts before the Parliamentary Secretary to which he could not reply.</P>

      <P>When you turn to another aspect of this question you find the same thing running through and through it.  When any other little industry wants money the Government throws money at it.  Hundreds of thousands of pounds are being sunk every day in industries that are going down.  On the other hand, the farmer has to pay 5½ and 6 per cent. and give the best security before he can get a shilling.  I am glad to see that all Parties in the House agree with the motion, that there is not a single Deputy who could say a word against it.  I am prepared to leave it at that. I do not want at this time to divide the House upon a rather delicate question. I know that it would not be very pleasant for any of the Parties. I prefer to leave it at that.  I hope that this matter will be remedied by the goodwill and co-operation of all Parties in the House.  That would be better than waiting until the pressure from the country will compel them to do it.</P>
