      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the number of occasions since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 25th April, 1938, on which there was direct personal discussion between Irish and British Ministers on matters of mutual trade, and if he will say in respect of each such occasion the date, the various Ministers who took direct part in the discussion, and the matters discussed.</P>

      <P>There have been no direct discussions between Irish and British Ministers since April, 1938.  Questions connected with the trade between the two countries have, of course, been discussed from time to time through the High Commissioner and the British representative here, and within the last few months officials of the Department of Supplies and the Department of Agriculture, acting on behalf of their respective Ministers, have had direct discussions with officials of the corresponding Departments in Great Britain. I may add that, following these latter discussions, the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture will go to London next week for conversations on certain outstanding points with the British Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>The instructions issued to all Departments some years ago in connection with the presentation of papers to the Oireachtas expressly stated that papers intended for presentation must be presented before being published.  With the lapse of time, this requirement may not always be observed; but I am not aware that frequent infractions occur, accompanied by serious delays in circulation to Deputies.  If, however, the Deputy will give me particulars of the cases he has in mind, I shall be able to see whether it is necessary to issue a reminder on the point generally or only to one or two Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, Sir, on this Defence Estimate I got around to the question of A.R.P. and I was certainly surprised that some of the matters with which I had dealt about six weeks ago were raised again during this debate.  I was particularly surprised because I found on the last occasion, to my surprise then also, that the Opposition seemed rather satisfied with the replies I gave them, and I did not think it would be necessary so soon again to explain what Government policy on the matter of A.R.P. was.  Yesterday, in saying a few words on the general defence policy, I pointed out to the Dáil that I thought that, in the question of defence, military planning and policy was so interwoven that it was very difficult to go into any kind of detail without disclosing facts which it would not be wise from a military point of view to disclose, and I did suggest that it should be recognised that a wise reticence was necessary in such a matter as defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with this particular portion of the defence policy&mdash;A.R.P.&mdash;the opposite idea holds.  A.R.P. cannot be any kind of success and cannot carry out the work they are intended to do except everybody concerned and affected has the fullest knowledge of what the proposals of A.R.P. are, why these proposals are made, and what is being done and is necessary to do in the matter.  Now, I think it was Deputy Esmonde who said that the general public had not been informed as to what their duties were or what was their best mode of procedure in any particular emergency of this sort. I should like to point out to the Deputy that as long ago as, I think, last September, a booklet of instructions was issued all over this country, in any particular place which we called a scheduled area, which was a place that might be considered at least likely to be attacked.  I do think that from that point of view a good deal of knowledge was given to the general public.  The whole difficulty with A.R.P. is that nobody believes in their necessity.  Possibly, that belief is correct, and I hope it is correct, but I <Col N="1803" /> do not think we are justified in sitting idly by, in view of the tremendous dangers that exist in the world to-day, or that we are justified in doing nothing to protect ourselves against such a possibility.  In the eventuality which Deputy Hughes visualises as being possible, and in other eventualities which have been discussed by various members of the Opposition, I think it would be criminal folly on our part if we did not make such preparations as we could possibly make, consistent with utilising the greatest economy.</P>
    <P>Last September I came along here into the Department of Defence to look after this particular matter, and I do confess that, when I was directed to take charge of the particular matter of A.R.P., I came to the Department of Defence as a scoffer: I came, I saw, but I did not concur.  However, when I had talked with the various military officers and those who had been concerned in the matter of preparations, I began to get an altogether different slant on the subject of A.R.P., and I did consider that there was a grave necessity for our embarking on such a scheme.  Now, as long ago as 1937, I think, Deputy O'Higgins, by question, raised this matter in the House, which showed that at that time the alert minds of the Opposition at least were thinking of the possibility of the need for such a scheme.  At that time, Deputy O'Higgins was informed that the matter was under consideration and a scheme being formulated, and in 1937 and 1938 a sum of £1,000 was set aside in the Estimate for the purpose of initiating a scheme of A.R.P.  Of that sum, in that year, only £85 17s. 4d. was spent.  In the following year the amount set aside was £101,000, of which £48,921 was spent.  In 1939-40, £94,594 was set aside and £90,635 was spent.  The total amount spent was £139,641 17s. 4d.  This year we are asking you to vote for us the sum of £116,855.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies here have suggested that the Government acted in a panicky fashion in September, 1939. As far as we were concerned there was no panic but there was a good deal of <Col N="1804" /> anxiety throughout the country which was mirrored in the correspondence we received at our headquarters. There was quite a lot of anxiety in regard to air raids and in regard to gas attacks and I think our actions tended very much towards allaying that panic and quietening the nerves of the people.  I have so little to say on this matter, having said it all before six weeks ago, that I find it very difficult to discuss it in the way I would like.</P>
    <P>We will take the question of shelters, particularly trench shelters.  I do not like trenches.  I never liked them but I did not see any way of avoiding the making of trenches.  A couple of years ago, about 1938, a military critic giving a lecture in London said that military science before a war seemed to be an exact science, like astronomy, but after the war it looked like astrology.  Captain Liddel-Hart, a very famous critic, commented on that that it was very hard on astrology.  That is true.  No matter how well you plan, how much you think, how interested you are, conditions that obtain when a war starts may make a complete change of plan necessary and may make obsolete the things that you have been thinking and doing before the emergency arose.  As I say, I never did like trenches and do not like them now, but it was necessary that trench shelters should be made in the areas where housing conditions were such as to create serious danger to the inhabitants of those areas in the event of attack.  I want to insist that I do not consider the trench shelter as an ideal air-raid shelter at all.  I do not think that we should proceed any further with the system of trench shelters and we have decided that we will not so proceed.  I had a talk with Deputy Alderman Byrne a few months ago and he pointed out to me that, if possible, the various parks where trenches had been dug should be put into such a condition that they could be utilised as far as possible as children's playgrounds, etc.  I agree with Deputy Alderman Byrne.  The carrying out of that work was very much delayed by the timber strike and also by the corporation employees' strike but now we are getting that <Col N="1805" /> work under way and I think the whole thing will be cleared up immediately.</P>
    <P>As against trench shelters there is also the question of basement shelters. There is quite a lot of basement shelter that could be made available here in Dublin and I think it is a much more satisfactory type of shelter than the trench shelter.  This whole scheme of A.R.P. was entered into after a study of what had been done in any other country, after a reading of practically every manual that bore on the question and after watching what the effects of air raids were in any of the wars that have been fought recently.  I think there is sufficient basement shelter in Dublin to supply whatever we need in the way of shelter.  Speaking of this some time ago here Deputy Dillon asked how did we propose to do any proppings and strutting in the basements and I pointed out that any such thing would have to be done in a very rough fashion.  But even at that, weighing up the likelihood of an air-raid here against the cost of a completely or almost completely perfect system of shelters, I came to the conclusion that in view of what had happened in air-raids elsewhere we might take a gamble even against turning basements into air-raid shelters by way of struttings and proppings because my understanding of the results of air-raids&mdash;and heavy air-raids&mdash;in towns of the type of Dublin has been that 90 per cent. of the casualties have been of those caught in the open and only 10 per cent. of the casualties have occurred to people who have had any kind of shelter.  Even at that, the making of the trench shelters is defensible in the areas where they have been made.  The first was made in Mountjoy Square.  The houses there are fourstorey houses and old houses.  The load of the population in those houses is heavy and I do think that the concussion and suction caused by a H.E. bomb would shake all those buildings like a house of cards.  In the ordinary houses around the town I think the same necessity does not arise.  Of course, Deputy Mulcahy mentioned Merrion Square.  There is quite a number of faulty houses, not exactly in the square, but in the streets and lanes <Col N="1806" /> around the square and I do think that it was necessary to do in relation to trench shelter the things we have done and I do not think we would be justified in going further than completing those trenches.</P>
    <P>With regard to basements, it is necessary, according to the Act, to serve a designation notice on any person whose premises it is proposed to take over for the purpose of the scheme.  We have refrained from designating any place, no matter how suitable, because such designation is an interference with business and might possibly depreciate the property so designated; but I think that in the case of an air-raid, or an emergency position, we ought to be entitled to ask every householder to place his house as a shelter at our disposal for those people caught in the open.  I do not know whether this could best be done by way of an appeal to citizens or by way of an order&mdash;I prefer the appeal&mdash; but I know that the response to such an appeal, in the event of an air-raid, might result in undesirable happenings. An air-raid in itself, however, is an undesirable happening and I think we ought to be free to choose the least of any evils that may exist.</P>
    <P>I do not think an air-raid here is very probable, but it is not by any means an impossibility.  Things have happened, as Deputy Esmonde pointed out a few nights ago, which are incredible, and these could very easily happen to us.  We have to consider, as against that, the tremendous amount of money that would have to be spent in providing a proper service, and I do not think that, from any point of view, we would be justified in providing all the money needed to make a perfect service.  Also, if there is an air raid on Ireland, it is more than likely that the place where it will take place is Dublin, where all our centres of trade are and where our railway net-works and transport services are.  Practically 95 per cent. of our attention has been devoted to Dublin.  The Dublin area has been divided into nine districts, and services of the necessary kind have been organised inside those districts.  We have shelters, rescue and demolition services, medical services and fire-fighting <Col N="1807" /> services, including training and equipment.</P>
    <P>I pointed out here, before, that one of the most necessary services we could have is a fire-fighting service.  Money spent on such a service is money spent on something which has a permanent benefit and, therefore, there is every justification for a thorough organisation of a fire-fighting service.  We have spent quite a lot of money on pumps, equipment and training in this respect and, in the same way, we have spent a good deal of money on medical services.  With regard to our rescue and demolition service, I have to say that the building employers in Dublin have done more in that matter than we, ourselves, have done, and as well as the building trade employers, the employees in the building trade have very generously placed their services at our disposal.  Of the money spent last year, £90,635, a sum of £11,000 was given as a grant to the Dublin Corporation. That was not the full amount of the grant due to them, but the balance of the grant due will be paid whenever the audited accounts are ready.</P>
    <P>I have a note here with regard to respirators.  The question of the distribution of respirators was raised by Deputy Dillon.  These respirators are packed in sealed tins filled with nitrogen for the purpose of preservation. They are articles which could be damaged and until there is a possibility of their being needed, it is better to have them packed in the sealed tins in proper stores.  We have them in one of the barracks in Dublin, and I have arranged with the Dublin Corporation to set up assembly and distribution dépôts throughout the various city areas, so that, if necessary at any time, they can be rapidly distributed.  We have also carried out the training of a more than adequate staff, capable of assembling these quickly and instructing other people in their use.</P>
    <P>Here again is another debatable question: whether we were wise in purchasing gas-masks.  It looks good military practice, if you have to come a long distance with a plane, to bring with you the weapon which is most destructive, and our information is <Col N="1808" /> that, weight for weight, the high explosive shell is much more destructive than anything else.  Because of that, I think we are unlikely to have to deal with a gas attack; but one never knows, and the panic and nervousness of the people, as indicated by the correspondence in our files, would justify, even from the purely psychological point of view, the purchase of the gas-masks in order to allay that nervousness and to control the people's fears. We paid a sum of £35,000 this year for respirators.  I am against the purchase of any more respirators.  I think we have plenty for any purpose for which they are likely to be used. We paid this year £19,000 for additional fire-fighting apparatus.  We paid for special types of respirators used by fire-fighters in particular cases, such as demolition work, a sum of £1,500.  We paid £5,000 for steel helmets, £14,000 for protective clothing, and miscellaneous training cost £5,000.</P>
    <P>I believe we ought to observe the utmost economy financially in the matter of A.R.P. schemes.  When I entered the Department of Defence to look into this matter I came in as an unbeliever, but I was convinced from what I learned from military officers and others that there was really a need for putting these schemes into operation. I would like Deputies to examine the matter for themselves and try to satisfy themselves whether an A.R.P. scheme is necessary and how far it is necessary.  I should like Deputies on all sides of the House to give us their assistance in trying to educate the public to any possible danger there may be in this connection. The trouble with A.R.P. is that you cannot build up a scheme successfully if there are different sections out to boycott it and if the people generally do not take an interest in the matter of A.R.P.  I do not believe in spending a tremendous amount of money, but I do believe that some scheme is necessary and I would ask the support of the House in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House listened to the Parliamentary Secretary with very great interest in the <Col N="1809" /> hope that he would possibly tell us something.  So far as his contribution of last night is concerned, we did not get very much information; but on the subject of A.R.P. to-day the Parliamentary Secretary has told us a little. I think the chief criticism of the Department is that the money provided has been badly spent and the publicity is extremely bad.  As regards the second point, the most immediate thing that comes to my memory is that I saw a reference in the paper to the effect that the auxiliary fire service was out for training in the morning recently, pumping from the Liffey. There was just a small paragraph in the paper.  If arrangements had been made to have photographers there, it is possible, in consequence of the publicity, that additional recruits might be gained for a service which, to my mind, is an important one, as it can be advantageous in peace time just as in time of war.  As regards the bad spending of the money, my criticism is that a certain amount has been spent with certain results whereas, if a little more were spent in the same way, the results would be very much greater.</P>
      <P>There is one thing worthy of consideration at the moment and that is the provision of sirens.  Certain premises in the city were designated and sirens have been fitted to them&mdash; whether or not they have been connected, I do not know, but they have never been used.  Admittedly, there are certain difficulties in trying them out in time of war which do not arise in peace time because people may think that they are the genuine article.  If the sirens have been fitted but have not been tried and an emergency arises and they are put into operation and 50 per cent. of the people do not hear them, it is very largely a waste of money, whereas the expenditure of a little more money might mean that the system could be made perfect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point to which the Parliamentary Secretary might have referred and that is why the ratepayers of the City of Dublin in particular should have been put to considerable expense in the dimming <Col N="1810" /> of the street lighting and institutions like Grangegorman and the Dublin Board of Assistance should be carrying out certain lighting regulations while night after night the Neon signs are blazing forth from the tops of buildings.  These signs are as visible from a distance, and even more so, than the street lights.</P>
    <P>In his remarks to-day the Parliamentary Secretary's publicity was bad.  He gave no particulars as to the number of wardens who have volunteered for service in the City of Dublin.  He gave no particulars as to the numbers of people trained in fire fighting.  In fact, the whole thing, instead of being run as something in regard to which everybody ought to know something, is run as a hush-hush service.  There was, a little while ago, a certain conflict of opinion between the Department and the air-raid wardens and I think the Parliamentary Secretary might have enlightened us as to whether that conflict of opinion has been completely dealt with and whether the relations were now totally harmonious, because unless they are it is obvious the wardens will lose all enthusiasm for their work and the time and trouble and money which have been spent creating that service will have been just wasted.</P>
    <P>Another piece of information which we might have had relates to the number of private shelters which have been, or are about to be, constructed and we might have been told whether such shelters&mdash;I am referring now to those made by firms in the city&mdash;are purely for the use of the employees or whether any provision has been made for the public.  On the subject of shelters, the Parliamentary Secretary was very critical of trench shelters, but I can assure him, from practical experience, that the trench shelter can be at times a very comfortable place.  There is one great difficulty in this connection in Dublin and that is that the shelters have not been supplied with any system of drainage. I take it if anything does happen here that it is more likely to happen in the winter than in the summer and the lack of drainage may be a serious disability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> As regards the propping of basements to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, that is a thing which must be done with steel plates and staunchions, which are not things that can be got at a minute's notice in war time.  I wonder has consideration been given in the Department to the alternative of over-ground shelters.  I notice of late in England that there has been a considerable development of that kind and I noticed in the paper the other day that the number of people who are, during the day time, in the City of Westminster, has necessitated the Westminster City Council increasing the number of shelters. These are for the most part constructed of 14-inch brick with a 9-inch reinforced concrete roof.  Where the materials are all local there would not be the same difficulty as in securing the necessary steel propping for basements.  Admittedly, we do not know here if these things are going to be required.  We hope not, but it would be foolish not to make certain preparations.</P>
    <P>On the question of respirators, I am in entire agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary that they are much better kept in storage for the moment. We know that left luggage offices and so forth in Great Britain are full of respirators which have been left in trains and buses, and they are much safer where they are.  At the same time, I should like to suggest that the wardens could be usefully employed visiting all the houses in their areas and getting to know the people with whom they will have to deal if any emergency arises here and they could also discover approximately&mdash;it cannot be done definitely at the moment&mdash;the number of respirators that will be required and the different sizes that will be necessary for each person&mdash;I understand that they are made in different sizes.</P>
    <P>If an emergency suddenly arises and if information is not available, it will take a considerable time to get it and in the meantime people may be supplied with respirators that are no use to them.  This would also give the <Col N="1812" /> wardens the advantage of getting to know the people with whom they will have to do if anything arises.  There is just one other remark I wish to make&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary said that at the outbreak of hostilities, their one anxiety was to allay anxiety.  The action they took was to have a complete black-out, a peculiar way, surely, of allaying anxiety.</P>

      <P>I had not the advantage of listening to the Parliamentary Secretary last night.  However, I read what to my mind was the very disquieting speech he made as reported in this morning's papers.  If he has been correctly reported the Parliamentary Secretary raised very large issues in his speech last night. He raised the whole issue of how far the Army should be under the control of this House.  The Parliamentary Secretary to my mind advanced an astonishing and an entirely undemocratic proposition that if there was a question of discipline or questions of the failure of the Army to carry out its work effectively, that these were matters entirely for the Army authority and not matters that should be debated in this House at all.  If that is in any way a misrepresentation of what the Parliamentary Secretary said I will be very glad if he will put me right now.  As I have already said I did not have an opportunity of listening to him, but if the words I have quoted be not a misrepresentation of the Parliamentary Secretary's words then he has advanced a very strange proposition and I sincerely hope that before this debate closes, some member of the Executive Council and if necessary the Taoiseach himself will come into this House and state what the views of the Executive Council are with reference to the control of the Army by this House.  I say that because I consider this a public matter of very great importance. I do not think there should be any difficulty about the matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The army in a democratic country is entirely under the control and ought to be under the control of the elected representatives of the people and that should be worked out in this way, that <Col N="1813" /> the Army was responsible to the Minister and to the Executive Council and that the Executive Council and especially the Minister is responsible to this House for the condition of the Army, for its efficiency, for its zeal and for its loyalty.  If there is any grave failure in the way in which the Army carries out its work then the Minister is responsible to this House for the failure of the Army.  I can quite understand the reasons which lay behind the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks.  I can quite understand that when a very disturbing event, an event of great importance took place in this country, that a certain unit at any rate of the Army was found wanting.  The Parliamentary Secretary wished to shield the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  He wished to draw a screen in front of them.  He wished to make it appear that they were not responsible to the House.  He wished to make it clear that a matter of this nature was entirely an Army matter and that it must be dealt with by the punishment or removal of Army officers and not dealt with, as in my humble judgment at any rate, it should be dealt with, that is to say by the resignation of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and probably the Minister for Defence also.  That is the meaning of Parliamentary control over the Army.  It means that the Ministers who have got control over the Army should be responsible for the higher command, should be responsible for the way in which the higher command and also the lower command and the whole Army carries out its work.  If there has been grave failure, the Minister is responsible to this House, for the failure may be directly due to the action of those persons who are either actually or potentially his nominees&mdash; that if they were not efficient in their places the Minister should have changed them long before anything happened.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a serious position arose in the British Army.  I quote the British precedent because, after all, Great Britain is the country in which modern democratic ideas had their <Col N="1814" /> birth.  There was a mutiny or rather a threatened mutiny in the Curragh. Forthwith the Secretary of State for War had to resign.  After that catastrophe of the Magazine Fort in this country, my view is that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and the Minister for Defence should both have tendered their resignations and the resignations of both should have been accepted.  I believe that is what would have happened in any other democratic country except this.  Let us deal for a moment with the question of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  What is he supposed to do except to see that the defensive measures are adequate and proper?  And where is there a more vital spot, a spot more in need of defence than the spot where the ammunition for the Army has been collected and where it is stored away? What happened?  We discovered that there is a Fort in which, as far as I have been able to judge from the newspaper reports, when the commanding officer went out&mdash;and, of course, commanding officers must be out from time to time&mdash;the next in command appeared to be a corporal of three years' standing.  Here, a vital place, as I say, is not guarded by the very pick of the Army.  It was guarded by some of the new Volunteer force and a few of the regular soldiers.  The thing is very unpleasant.  There you have soldiers whose cry, when there is an attack made upon the Magazine Fort, is &ldquo;safety first&rdquo;.  There is no attempt made to defend that post. &ldquo;Safety first&rdquo; is a very poor war-cry on the lips of soldiers.</P>
    <P>There is nobody in this country who has a greater admiration for the regular troops of the National Army than I have, who recognises more clearly than I do the great debt this country owes to its National Army, or who has got a greater belief in the thorough efficiency of the old soldiers, and the regular soldiers, of our National Army than I have.  In the case of this Magazine, I find that it is not the old soldiers, or the picked men, of our Army who were placed to defend this most vital spot, but for the most <Col N="1815" /> part these new untrained and, one is forced to say it, not very courageous Volunteers.  That is precisely the kind of scheme which the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures should have first seen to. It was the very first place that he should have looked to.  The first inquiry he should have made from the general staff of the Army, and I presume he did make it, was this: what force have you got guarding this most vital spot&mdash;the Magazine?  Did he make inquiries, or did he, or did he not, see what methods were being adopted to guard it?  Either way proves that he is equally inefficient. If he did not, then what on earth sort of work is he doing?  If he did, then he was satisfied with what has been proved to be a most inadequate scheme of defence.</P>
    <P>I have often been puzzled to think how on earth the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures puts in his day.  He must have a very gloomy day, indeed.  I remember a Parliamentary Secretary on one occasion informing this House <i>apropos</i> of nothing that, either before he went to bed or when he was in bed, he read two detective stories every night.  Well, from the time that he goes down to his office until he leaves it, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures must, within the last few months, have had time to read every single detective story that has been published.  I am very sorry for him. He goes down to his office in the morning and he has nothing to do.  He can have nothing to do.  Nobody has ever explained to this House what he is even supposed to do.  This poor individual has to go down to his office every morning.  Let us suppose that he gets there about 11 o'clock.  He has to kick his heels from that hour until 4 or 4.30 in the afternoon with nothing to fill up his time.  I have often thought that the most unpleasant time I have gone through was when I arrived at a railway station and had to wait three-quarters of an hour or an hour, because of a breakdown in the train due to arrive.  I certainly have found those experiences <Col N="1816" /> most shockingly boring.  It seems to me that this poor Minister is all day long in a sort of perpetual railway station waiting for a train which never can come in, for the simple reason that it has never started.  He is there confined in a room with nothing on earth to do.  In the early days of his appointment he ought, at least, to have seen to it that the Magazine was properly guarded.  He either did not do that, or, if he did, then he did it in a most inefficient way. After failure following failure in his career, that Minister is at the moment in a post, the duties of which are absolutely nil.</P>
    <P>I would like to know, and I think the whole country would like to know, what is the reason for having a Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures at the present moment?  I fling out that challenge to that Minister who, on the Defence Vote, is not even in his place in the House.  That, in itself, shows how seriously he takes his work.  But if he is not in his place in the House on the Defence Vote, may I express the hope, possibly it is a vain hope, that when the Minister for Defence comes to close this debate he will explain to the House precisely what help the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures has been to him in discharging the duties of his post?</P>
    <P>In my opinion this Vote is altogether too high.  Although I have asked for the information in the House I have never been told, nor have the people in the country been told, for what purpose this Volunteer force was ever enrolled.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his speech last night, as reported in this morning's newspapers, said that the Army authorities think that it may be made a good force.  I would like to ask: made a good force for what purpose?  Modern history shows plainly that a small country, attacked by a large country, cannot defend itself, and that the main need of an Army in this country is one that we can rely on to keep internal peace.  The properly trained and, I would say, brilliantly officered national Army that we have is quite adequate for that purpose.  I challenge the Minister for Defence to tell us against <Col N="1817" /> what potential enemy this so-called Volunteer force has been enlisted.  If we had not this Volunteer force, and if our expenditure on defence was the same this year as it was a couple of years ago, there would have been no necessity for the higher taxation proposals which were submitted to the House last September, or for the extra taxes on sugar and tobacco.  We have been told that these taxes were put on for defence purposes, and yet we cannot be told against what potential enemy we are to defend ourselves. Those taxes were raised in order that this Volunteer force may be kept mobilised.  I want to know why the people of this country should have these extra taxes put on vital necessaries of life in order to keep this entirely valueless Volunteer force mobilised.  In my judgment, this Vote is altogether too high and it certainly should be referred back for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>I had not any intention of speaking in this debate, but it is quite possible that some misunderstanding may exist or may arise as a result of a statement made here last night by the Parliamentary Secretary. Firstly, he gave the House to understand that the position of a Parliamentary Secretary was an unenviable one, one that carried responsibility without his having any inside knowledge. Nevertheless, he immediately gave utterance to what might be described as a most extraordinary piece of inside information, if it were inside information.  At least it appeared to some Deputies as being something he knew when he stated in effect that, if we had no Army in this country, the morning that hostilities broke out between England and Germany we would have had an invasion of this country by British troops.  That statement was made in the House last night and the House is entitled to know whether there is any ground for that statement, or what was the meaning behind it.  Did the Parliamentary Secretary mean that Britain was coming here as an aggressor if we had no Army in this country, or was Britain coming here, as the Taoiseach pointed out some time ago, as an ally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> This may be very important and its effects may be very far-reaching.  We understood from the Minister for Defence that an order for munitions was placed by this country.  It seems that the order ran into millions of pounds, but, according to the Minister, we only got £700,000 worth of the order.  That order was placed with Britain&mdash;there is no need for hiding that fact.  If the impression is to be created by the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that we are enemies of Britain and that Britain is an enemy of ours and would invade our country, then we may not look forward to any further delivery of munitions; at least that is how the matter strikes me.</P>
    <P>As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we are not against providing money for defence.  I am not a military man, and I do not pretend to have any military knowledge.  But I think that we are entitled to know on what foot the Government is standing at the present time.  When the Taoiseach made his statement here on the Financial Agreement&mdash;I have it here, but there is no need to delay the House by reading it&mdash;he made what was considered at that time a very important statement with regard to the steps that should be taken by this country in future in planning its defence.  We are now doing that, or we are supposed to be doing it.  I do not want to ask the Minister at present whether the Taoiseach's ideas are being adhered to, because, as the Parliamentary Secretary said a while ago, there ought to be a wise reticence.  I agree with that.  But, when the Parliamentary Secretary makes the statement, as he did last night, that British troops would have been here on the very morning that Germany and England went to war, were it not for the fact that there was an Army here, that requires some explanation and we ought to be told exactly where we are. I hope the Minister will do that.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Minister to conclude, I hope it is understood that, when a motion to refer an Estimate back is tabled, the motion and the Vote are discussed together.  There may be two divisions <Col N="1819" /> but only one debate.  My reason for stating that is that some Deputies gave me to understand that they had a few minor points to raise on sub-heads. They have their opportunity now. When the Minister has concluded, if he is called upon to conclude now, two questions will be put but no further debate will be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the four days over which this debate has run the thought occurred to me that the ways of a Minister for Defence are hard ways.  I came in here believing that in presenting an itemised account of the expenditure of my Department I was doing something that Deputies desired should be done, and I was rather surprised when practically every Opposition speaker, taking the lead from Deputy O'Higgins, made it clear that what was required was not so much an itemised account of the expenditure, which they said they could find in the Book of Estimates if they required it, but a detailed statement of policy.  The rather extraordinary thing about that is that about 12 months ago my predecessor, the present Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, brought in a very detailed statement of policy and on that occasion what the Opposition said they required was an itemised account of expenditure. Now, it strikes me that the tactics of the Opposition are the tactics of &ldquo;heads we win and tails you lose&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that occurred to me during the course of the debate, and which made me wonder if I were supposed to take the debate seriously at all, was the great divergence of opinion which existed on the Opposition Benches.  On the front bench and on the back benches that divergence of opinion existed.  I will give one example of what occurred on the Front Bench.  Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of his speech, stated: &ldquo;I do not believe that it is tactful to go out of our way to give offence to any country.&rdquo; That is a statement with which I would thoroughly agree, with which every Deputy who possesses any common sense would throughly agree, <Col N="1820" /> and which Deputy Brennan just a moment ago reiterated.  We all agree with that type of statement.  None of us believes that it is tactful to go out of our way to give offence to any country.  The point I want to make is this.  Deputy Dillon, sitting beside his colleague, did not share that view because Deputy Dillon immediately began to belabour the heads of two of the most powerful States in Europe. He, no doubt, saw the possibility of outdoing and outvying the good old <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> because that is the only reason I could see why he should have gone out of his way to challenge the heads of these States or to use the violent language in respect of the heads of these States that he did use.  The position of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> is unshaken as a result of Deputy Dillon's assault but the position of &ldquo;the three tailors of Tooley Street&rdquo; is dangerous and they will have to look to their laurels.  Otherwise, they will be stolen from them by the bellicose Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>On the question of policy, I have a clear recollection of getting something in the nature of a White Paper.  I am certain that every Deputy who had an interest in the debate got it and studied it carefully.  If they did, they have very quickly forgotten the contents of the paper.  In this House last year, Mr. Aiken stated the policy in the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Our sovereignty over the Twenty-Six Counties is complete and is so recognised internationally;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The only authority which can commit us to war is the Assembly of the elected representatives of the people&mdash;the Dáil;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  It is not the policy of the Government to attack any nation and we have no commitment to join or to be involved in any war;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  It is the policy of the Government to repel any attack which might be made upon our territory.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These facts, I think, negative the possibility of our being at war with Britain unless we are attacked by her.  Therefore, the only other situation which we have to plan for is the maintenance of our neutrality or <Col N="1821" /> attack by a Power at war with Britain.  It is assumed that it is most unlikely we should be attacked by a Power not at war with Britain.  In all probability, such an attack would come only from a Power seeking to make our territory the cock-pit of its war with Britain or as a base from which to attack her.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards the functions of the Army, Mr. Aiken defined them thus in 1934 in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a petty point.  The Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, who was then Minister for Defence, said: &ldquo;The policy of the State as regards the Army is briefly to have a small, highly-trained, standing Army, which will serve as a pivot around which might be organised, developed and trained the entire reserve and volunteer forces, and, if necessary, the entire man-power of the State.  To that end, the Army is being, and will be, provided with the most intensive training, the most up-to-date arms and equipment, and the most scientific warlike weapons which the State can afford.&rdquo; In view of this statement and similar statement made from time to time by members of the Government, I thought it would have been unnecessary for me to deal with this question again.  We have absolutely no arrangements with any other Power, and like other neutral countries we cannot say whence attack may come.  Our policy is to be prepared for attack from any source.  Some Deputies suggested, during the course of the debate on this Estimate, that we should hold a secret session.  I do not know why we should hold a secret session.  I do not even know why we <Col N="1822" /> were asked to hold a secret session. We have no secrets to share, and the tone of the debate, as heard by me, showed so little restraint that I do not think it would, in fact, be a secret session, if held.</P>

      <P>Judging by the divergence of opinion on the benches opposite, I think that it would be a dangerous experiment to hand that responsibility over to a committee. Deputy Esmonde, Deputy Dillon and other Deputies referred to the position of the Army in the event of external attack.  It was, I think, suggested by some of the Deputies that it would be unfair to ask the Army to attempt to repel an attack.  Deputy Esmonde, citing what he considered to be the example of Denmark, seemed to think that the best way to deal with an invader would be to invite some prominent personage of this State to go out, meet him and welcome him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon did not go quite as far as Deputy Esmonde went.  He seems to think that the best way to rid ourselves of an invader's presence would be to make speeches, write letters and invoke propaganda from the Irish exiles abroad.  After about 700 years of that type of stuff, we would once again, I suppose, shake off the invader.  Happily, that is not Deputy Cosgrave's viewpoint.  Deputy Cosgrave made very clear what the position would be.  There, again, we have that divergence of opinion on the opposite benches which makes it almost impossible for Minister or <Col N="1823" /> Deputies on this side to know what the Opposition want or mean.  Deputy Cosgrave said in the course of the debate:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister wants to know what my view on the Army situation is, it is that, if we were faced with an invasion, the invasion should be resisted, and that there should be along with the Army the support of every citizen to resist that invasion. We should not follow the example of Denmark.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave's view is my view, and it is the view of every member of the Government.  It is the view, too, of every person who loves liberty and who wants to retain that liberty. Deputy Cosgrave's view is the view I am prepared to take as the view which will, in the long run, operate on the other side of the House if difficulties arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued that the Army would be of very little use against a powerful invader.  We have never pretended that it could keep out an invader, but we do hold that it can withstand the first shocks of such an invasion and thus prepare and stiffen the resistance, active and passive, of the country.  Without an Army, an aggressor could invade this country with impunity but, with the Army and with the stiffening of the people's resistance, an aggressor must think twice before acting.  In this connection, the point has been made that we are relying too much on ground troops, that we should concentrate on the training of air pilots and the building up of a large air force with adequate reserves of pilots and machines.  In point of fact, we are not neglecting the development of the Air Corps, which has already been considerably extended since 1932.  Moreover, we are training pilots up to the full capacity of the machines at our disposal and, as pointed out in my opening statement, we are providing in the present Estimate for a number of short-term commissions in the Air Corps.  The due development, or expansion, of the Air Corps is one thing and its substitution for ground troops is quite another thing.  Apart from technical questions of strategy and tactics, we <Col N="1824" /> must remember, on the one hand, that our financial resources are very limited and, on the other hand, that modern aircraft is very expensive, that it becomes obsolete rapidly, that its life is short and its upkeep and maintenance costly.  Apart, then, entirely from any question of strategy or tactics, the fact of the matter is that our financial resources would not permit us to have as large an air arm as we should like to have.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Hughes and Deputy O'Higgins referred to the Navy and its functions.  Briefly, the functions of the vessels of the coast watching service are to assist the Army in the defence of the country by patrolling its coasts, by reporting the movements of any foreign hostile craft and, if necessary, by engaging such craft.  They also perform the functions of protecting the fishing limits of the country.  In this respect, it might be useful for me to inform the House that, since our craft went out on patrol work, they have been in action against foreign trawlers on at least three occasions. They have captured one foreign craft and brought her into port.  They have fired at and very seriously damaged another foreign craft which refused to &ldquo;heave to&rdquo; when called upon to do so but, owing to the heavy seas, the vessel escaped outside territorial waters and got away by sacrificing her fishing gear while suffering damage to the extent of from £100 to £200 which, in its own way, is a heavy penalty.  The M.I., on her first day out, went into action against another foreign trawler and, in spite of the fact that very heavy seas were running, and that conditions were very bad, she challenged this craft, which also refused to stand by, and damaged her very considerably.  Again, owing to the high seas running, the foreign trawler got outside territorial waters and so escaped.  These instances will show, I hope, that these vessels will be a very great asset to our nation in the future.</P>

      <P>Several Deputies asked about the delay in the arrival of the <Col N="1825" /> M.T.I.  They seem to have certain suspicions.  They have suspicions about practically everything connected with defence and the Army in general.  The M.T.I. left the upper reaches of the Thames in what was, possibly, the most severe weather experienced in either England or Ireland for a long number of years.  My instructions to the officers and crew, when going over, was that they were to exercise every possible care, that the task which I wanted them to complete, and complete successfully, was the bringing home of the M.T.I.  The coast around the south of England requires very careful navigation and, during this very severe weather, they had to put into port on several occasions.  They did that because they wanted to ensure that the craft would arrive safely here and because they understood that the question of time was not to be allowed to prevent that safe arrival.  The thick plate-glass windows of the vessel were smashed through by the heavy seas. The bedding and other material on the boat were drenched, and they had to put into port.  It took several days to have these things dried.  It took a much longer period to have the plate-glass windows replaced.  From time to time, they put into port on the way around in order to ensure that their engines and everything else would be perfect, and to refuel.  They arrived in Portsmouth.  They were advised not to go on to Pembroke, which they were next to make, owing to the fact that there were mines about.  They had to make their course across from Portsmouth to the nearest possible point on the Irish coast.  The captain of the vessel decided to make Waterford his port of call rather than to risk making direct for Dublin. There, again, he was acting within his own discretion.  He arrived in Waterford and he spent, I understand, two or three days there.  During that time he refuelled and attended to some other necessary matters.  I am not aware that anything of an untoward nature took place while in Waterford. They left Waterford that morning and they arrived in Dun Laoghaire that evening.  The incident which took place in Dun Laoghaire was one of <Col N="1826" /> those things over which it is difficult to have control.  Suffice it to say, that there was no raid whatever on the boat, and the rating who gave the false alarm, which in turn gave rise to the false report, has been discharged from the service.</P>
      <P>A question was raised by several Deputies as to the delay in the delivery of stores.  In the course of recent debates on the Army Estimate, a number of false statements have been made regarding the equipment of the Army and the purchase of war material.  These statements are mischievous in that they are calculated not only to encourage a potential enemy but also to create misgivings in the minds of our people as to the ability of the Army to defend this country's neutrality.  In order to remove any such impression, it is essential that the facts be stated.  It has been said or suggested, for instance, that the troops are ill-equipped with fighting weapons or that the weapons which they possess are obsolete weapons.  There is no truth whatever in that suggestion.  Even if it had been true, the previous Government could not escape responsibility in that connection for it will be shown that they did not pay the attention which has been paid by us to the proper equipment of the Army.  We came into office in 1932, and the first Estimates we presented to this House were those framed by our predecessors.  In 1932-33 the Estimate for warlike stores was £51,983.  In the following year, our first in office, it was represented by a slightly increased figure, namely, £56,672.  After a very short time in office, my predecessor realised that the position regarding the Army's equipment was not satisfactory and he therefore concentrated at once on achieving two immediate objects&mdash;(1) to build up sufficient reserve stores of munitions and primary weapons that the general staff considered essential for the defence of the country; (2) to investigate the suitability of certain new weapons of defence and to familiarise all ranks with those which were found suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as the Minister himself pointed out to the Dáil, he was circumscribed <Col N="1827" /> in his efforts by the financial resources of the country and he had to be content with gradual and systematic achievement spread over a number of years.  This is reflected by the Estimates for the succeeding years.  Thus, in 1935 the Estimate for warlike stores was increased to £104,380.  In 1936 it amounted to £71,475.  In 1937 the figure reached was £160,683.  In 1938 the sum was £137,125.  Towards the end of 1937, that twofold object had been achieved.  Sufficient reserve stocks of ammunition and of primary weapons had been accumulated in accordance with the plans.  The general staff after due investigation had been satisfied that the best modern weapons were the Bren gun, a CzechoSlovakian invention, the Bofors anti-aircraft gun, a Swedish product, the Brandt mortar, manufactured in France, and the Landsverk armoured car, also a Swedish product.  Meanwhile, sufficient quantities of these weapons had been ordered and delivered to familiarise instructors and, through them, the N.C.O.s and other ranks of the Army with their handling and operation.</P>
    <P>The problem of aircraft had been handled in a similar manner.  All the machines were of British origin.  Now, here it should be noted that, at that time, for Great Britain or any other country, there was no other source of supply than the countries mentioned, and that the problem had become further complicated by motorisation. Towards the end of 1937 the problem of fully equipping the Army with those other weapons was investigated in the light of previous achievement and actual demonstration, and it was decided to complete the equipment.  Inquiries were immediately set on foot to ascertain when deliveries could be made and where these inquiries showed that deliveries could be made at once, or that manufacture would be started on our behalf, immediate orders were placed for weapons.  Reasonable deliveries were made against orders, and the actual position of the Army is much better than the Opposition apparently thinks.  To see if deliveries could be expedited, personal contact was made <Col N="1828" /> by officials early in 1938 with the War Office.  Although they were sympathetic they could not promise immediate delivery as they had naturally to satisfy their own requirements first.  Certain inquiries were then made elsewhere by personal contact, but as these negotiations were not any more advantageous, firm orders were placed in England in the autumn of 1938.  Though deliveries have not been in accordance with our expectations, they have not, nevertheless, been unreasonable, seeing that the whole situation has been complicated by the war.</P>
    <P>Now, it is not correct to say that our stores are empty.  In point of fact, they have never been fuller.  It is not true to say that men were called up last September and that we had not sufficient primary weapons for them, and it is false to insinuate that the delay in delivery is due to our placing orders abroad.  In my opening statement, it was stated that £460,651 was devoted to war-like stores.  Deputy Mulcahy could not trace the figures making up that total, and said that we must have included clothing.  We did not include the cost of a single brass button.  Here is how the sum is made up:&mdash;Aircraft, sub-head O, £56,912; war-like stores, sub-head P, £121,267; fighting vessels, sub-head P (2), £279,972; and engineering stores, sub-head Q, £2,500, making a total of £460,651.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Supplementary Estimate, 1938-39, on the 16th February, 1939, the Taoiseach said that of the £5,500,000 to be spent on special capital expenditure, roughly £2,000,000 was to be devoted to protection against air attack.  &ldquo;I am talking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in round figures.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Nearly £1,000,000 is to be spent in regard to aircraft defence by means of aeroplanes and so on, and there is about another £1,000,000 on anti-aircraft guns and ammunition.&rdquo;  During recent debates it has been stated that the Taoiseach said that £1,000,000 would be spent on aeroplanes, but from the words which I have just quoted it is obvious that he <Col N="1829" /> was talking in round figures and that his actual words were: &ldquo;Nearly £1,000,000 is to be spent in regard to aircraft defence by means of aeroplanes, and so on.&rdquo;  For anti-aircraft defence it was proposed to spend £1,119,169, and on aircraft, etc., it was proposed to spend £780,074.  Those two figures added together come to a total of £1,899,243, which is roughly the £2,000,000 which the Taoiseach had in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister what was the second figure he gave?  Anti-aircraft defence, other than planes&mdash;what were the items in that?  The Taoiseach referred to anti-aircraft guns only.  The Parliamentary Secretary bulked quite a number of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Against the sum of £1,119,169 for anti-aircraft defences we have actually placed orders to the extent of £979,429.  As regards aeroplanes and so on, the figure of £780,074 included the sum of £300,000 for aerodromes. The latter project has not yet materialised, and, therefore, from the sum of £780,074 there must be deducted £300,000, leaving a balance of £480,074 to be spent on aircraft and accessory stores.  Against the proposals of £480,074 we have placed orders to the extent of £329,021, leaving a balance outstanding of £151,053 in respect to material which has not yet been ordered.  That material has not been ordered because we are awaiting deliveries against the orders which have already been placed.</P>
      <P>A question was also raised in respect to coastal defences and as to whether the forts are being properly maintained or not.  The equipment of the forts is being maintained at identically the same standard as the British maintained it, and sufficient men are at present stationed there&mdash;gun crews and so on&mdash;to meet any question of a state of emergency.  We have also arrangements regarding trained crews which are now on the reserve and, in case of emergency, they could also be called in to lend additional strength there.  The training of additional troops for the forts is always going on and is being continually reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Deputy MacEoin, in the course of his speech, referred to the fact that there was delay in payment for provisions purchased locally during the period of mobilisation, and delay in the payment of marriage allowances. The normal rule, and the ordinary practice of the Department, is to clear all contractors' accounts within a month of the date of supply, provided that the claims are presented at once by a duly certified receiving officer. If those conditions are not fulfilled, delay in payment is bound to occur. The onus, therefore, is on the contractor to see that the claims are verified and presented at once.  No general complaint has been made about delay in payment of claims for provisions, and any particular delay was found on investigation to be due mainly to non-compliance with the regulations which I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>As regards the marriage allowances, there were 1,983 on the marriage register prior to mobilisation.  No delay whatever took place in respect to that particular group of individuals, because those individuals were able, naturally, to comply with the requirements of the Army.  When we called up the Volunteers and the reserves a regulation was made that all Volunteers or reservists who were married men on the 1st September that year would be entitled to the marriage allowance.  Large numbers of those men, of course, failed to conform to the requirements, although those requirements were thoroughly explained to them.  For instance, a man had to produce a certificate of marriage and had to produce birth certificates for children for whom he was claiming, and, where those were not forthcoming, it was not possible to pay the allowance in full.  It was paid in part, in order to alleviate any likely hardships, but I understand that, on a former occasion, a vast sum of money was lost through dealing with the question of marriage allowances without taking due notice of the necessity to examine carefully the marriage certificates and birth certificates also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes mentioned the question of supplies of coal.  Of course, the <Col N="1831" /> Deputy will understand that when the emergency broke out we took over various outlying positions far removed from our ordinary barracks.  We had to get in large quantities of extra coal and we had to secure places where coal could be stored.  In some of those instances, it was, as the Deputy mentioned, in fields.  I went to the trouble of examining this question of coal being thrown on the ground in order to allow cars to get into a field easily, and I found that when that was done the coal was recovered and the amount of the coal used did not exceed from 4 to 6 cwts.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin, and also Deputy Hughes, referred to transport.  I think Deputy Hughes' worry was that learners were careering round the public highway. In actual fact, Army drivers must have had some civil experience and most of the men who were given control of a motor vehicle had such civil experience, but, even if they possessed that civil experience, they were always put through certain tests.  Those tests took place within the confines of the barracks, and when the officer carrying out the tests had satisfied himself that those men were, in his opinion, competent to take out a car the car was taken out on the public highway, accompanied by the instructor, which no doubt lent colour to the impression that the driver was learner.  In actual fact, the man should not be described as a learner, and I cannot quite understand that any of these men were driving in a manner that could be described as dangerous to the public.  As a matter of fact, the Army would not tolerate the system that operates in respect of civilians; that is, that if a civilian goes out and purchases a car, he can get a friend of his or somebody else to take him out on the road and show him how to drive the car.  That is the usual way in which the civilian learns to drive a car, but that would not be tolerated in the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As a matter of fact, motor cyclists are even more carefully <Col N="1832" /> supervised.  On the question of the difference in rates of pay for Army medical officers that was raised by Deputy O'Higgins, that whole question of the pay for Army medical officers has been discussed fully in this House already.  The apparent anomaly of two officers of the same rank receiving different rates of pay is a result of the new scheme and is simply due to a desire not to deprive the officers who were serving before the scheme came into operation of any of their existing rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister hold that they were not deprived of pre-existing rights?  What I mean is this: that, prior to the scheme, promotion carried so much pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Where these officers had a certain figure with regard to pay, that figure was not interfered with, but those coming in later on were subject to a lesser rate of pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem an anomaly, as the Deputy suggests, but I think this thing is operating fairly, and I think the existing rate of pay should be left with the officers while they are serving, even though the new men coming in may have a lesser amount.  That is the explanation for this matter of two officers, who may be serving side by side, having different rates of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but on a point of accuracy, might I ask the Minister this?  If a man had a certain rate of pay, and if a Government regulation entitled him to increased pay on promotion, and that right to increased pay on promotion were taken from him, has not that man been deprived of pre-existing rights?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Minister holds the position of Minister, and let us suppose that a Parliamentary Secretary has a salary of £1,000 a year and that it is stated, in a regulation, that he will get a salary of £1,750 if he should be promoted to the position of Minister; if another regulation is brought in afterwards to say that if he is promoted to the position of Minister he will still get his £1,000 a year, and his £1,000 a year only, does not that regulation deprive him of pre-existing rights?  That is all I am asking the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <P>Now, Deputy Brodrick raised the question of engineer stores, and he seemed to be in some difficulty about that particular sub-head.  I think he had the impression that we were spending less this year than we spent in former years and that there was a greater necessity in fact for spending more this year than last year.  That, however, is not the position.  The figure for this year, as compared with the figure for last year, shows an increase of £1,335.  The figure for 1939-40 includes the figure in the annual Estimate for that year of £5,650, plus £20,000 taken in the Supplementary Estimate last month.  The £20,000 was simply for reserve stocks, and it would not be repeated annually at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moran raised the question of the evacuation of Castlebar.  The evacuation of Castlebar was necessitated by the reduction in the strength of the Army and by the considered judgement of the General Staff, and that is a thing that has to be considered. Deputies McGilligan and Brodrick also asked what is the provision of £15,611, in sub-head AA, <Col N="1834" /> intended to cover.  Under that sub-head the following provisions are made:&mdash;pay and allowances to officials, £5,743; conveyance of prisoners, £300; food for prisoners, £8,668; clothing, blankets, etc., for prisoners, £900.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave could not find a particular figure under sub-head A. He saw that the sub-head showed a decrease of 72 in numbers, and an increase of £76,000 in money.  In actual fact, he quoted the net figures instead of the gross figures.  The numbers are based on averages and indicate that, over the whole year, we propose to maintain 72 men less than in 1939, and the gross figure shows that the cost is £5,000 less.  The gross figures show the cost of maintaining, over the whole year, an average strength of 11,939 men for 1939, and 11,867 for 1940.  The net figures show that, over the whole year, 1939, the average actually maintained was 10,351, and not 11,939, and that, for the whole year 1940, we expect to maintain an average of 11,801.  The annual and Supplementary Estimates for 1939 were based on the following averages:&mdash; 6,864, other ranks, for six months; 18,796 for one month; 14,169 for two months; and 12,003 for three months; giving an approximate average for the whole financial year of a figure of 10,351.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the question of pay and allowances for the personnel employed on the patrol and motor vessels.  Seven officers and 15 members of the crews of the Fort Rannoch and the Muirchú are paid the personal salaries and wages which they were in receipt of from the Fisheries Services, prior to their transfer to the defence force.  The remaining officers and men are in receipt of Army regimental rates of pay, together with certain additional rates of pay according to qualifications.  The latter are also entitled to the usual rates in respect of lodging, fuel and light, and ration allowances, in the case of officers, a marriage and ration allowance, and in the case of men where the conditions of entitlement are fulfilled.  The number of officers and men who were called up on permanent service is 464.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> Deputy Davin was anxious to secure these figures.  The number of men called upon permanent service was 11,706.  The number of officers exempted from permanent service, 137, and the number of men exempted from permanent service, 5,583.  He was also anxious to know if the rate payable in respect of ration allowance was increased since the outbreak of the European war.  The ration allowance for both officers and men is revised every six months in accordance with the contract price of rations and the allowance has been revised upwards since last September.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the fact that we had commandeered hay&mdash;I think it was during the farmers' strike &mdash;and brought it to feed elephants in the Zoo.  The actual position was this: The hay was the property of the authorities of the Zoological Gardens but they had no way of getting it in and they appealed to the Army authorities to bring the hay in in order to feed the elephants.  Otherwise, it was their opinion that the elephants would have to be destroyed.  I gave permission to have the hay transported in order to save the lives of the valuable elephants.  There was no question whatever of commandeering.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to an item in the Estimates for a magazine. He wanted to know was this a new magazine and where was it.  It is a new magazine and it is on the Curragh. It has been found necessary to have this new magazine constructed to hold the ammunition that the Opposition appear to think that we have not got.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne, Junior, asked some questions in respect of the annual training grants&mdash;Individual Proficiency Grant and Sluagh Proficiency Grant.  The annual training grant was paid at the conclusion of the annual training.  The disposal of the remaining two portions is still under consideration, and every effort is being made to expedite a decision.  Questions of proficiency arise there, questions of proficiency in respect both to the individual and the Sluagh, and these difficulties are being overcome as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I think I have answered most of the queries that have been put to me this time.  Perhaps when Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the fact that I made that remark on my Supplementary Estimate I should have told the Deputy that I thought I answered all the questions that it was necessary to answer.  That might have made it more clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in the course of his speech, referred to the fact of the Minister for Defence storming around the various barracks in the country.  I want to assure Deputy Dillon that while that is what he probably would do himself&mdash;because I think his tendency is towards storming everything&mdash; I did not storm any position.  I merely went round and made a careful inspection of certain barracks in the country in order to inform myself as to the conditions which existed in the Army.  I was accompanied on that inspection to every post by the Chief of Staff, and, in order to make certain that I would be properly informed, I asked him to bring some expert officers with him.  A careful inspection was made of a large number of posts, including the forts, and I very much wish that it would be <Col N="1837" /> possible for members of this House to have seen the high state of proficiency which was visible to me.  I am sure the members of the Army would be delighted if it were possible for members of this House to pay similar visits.</P>
    <P>In closing this debate, I want to say that another statement made by Deputy Dillon, in respect to my predecessor, is quite untrue.  My predecessor on no occasion ever released a man from custody who was guilty of insubordination.  As far as I am concerned, as long as I am in the position of Minister for Defence, I will see that discipline is carried out in the manner in which the Army authorities desire that it should be carried out, and in no circumstances will I ever interfere in matters of discipline between the persons who have to be disciplined and the Army authorities.</P>
    <P>Some of the statements which have been made in this House are damaging statements to the Army.  They are liable to make people who were desirous and who were anxious to overthrow the authority of the State believe that they have an easy task on hands.  On the other hand, they are equally liable, in my opinion, to have a deteriorating effect on the personnel of the Army.  A thing has only got to be said often enough and people will begin to think that there is something in it.  As far as I am concerned, and following the visits which I have paid to a large number of commands to which I have just referred, it is my opinion that the Army was never in a finer position, in a finer condition, or a better Army than it is to-day.  I hope that position will be maintained in the future, and it can only be maintained with the full co-operation of all the Deputies in this House.</P>

      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, despite the queries put by separate Deputies as to what are the functions of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, he has not indicated in the course of his summing-up to what extent he has been, is, or hopes to be assisted in his Departmental duties by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  I <Col N="1838" /> take it that that is an oversight on his part, and I am sure he has some observation to make on that particular point.</P>

I corresponded with practically every chamber of commerce in the country and I am glad to say that they all agreed to co-operate.  We also got into touch with certain large firms who also agreed to co-operate, but it is a fact that there are certain employers, not very large, who did not co-operate to the extent of giving these volunteers back their positions, and it may be necessary for me to bring in legislation <Col N="1839" /> to ensure that such men will get their positions back.</P>

Before we vote this money we are entitled to know what the money is intended for.  We are entitled to know the functions of the office and the services it is proposed to co-ordinate.

The Deputy knows also that the Minister is responsible for A.R.P., with the Parliamentary Secretary acting under him.  He is also, I understand, responsible for the organisation or the establishment of the Red Cross. These are works that he has undertaken. I cannot see why almost 50 per cent. of this debate was aimed directly at the Minister.  The debate, to my mind anyhow, took the form of a <Col N="1847" /> grossly personal attack on the Minister, for what particular reason I am not aware.</P>

      <P>Might I point this out to the Minister&mdash;the Minister has himself announced that half the debate on this Vote was a censure of the way in which the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures performed his duties and functions. The net result is that that Minister absents himself and cannot face the music.  He will not speak on it and his colleague, the Minister for Defence, will not answer for him until at the end of a series of questions he tells us that he has three functions.</P>
      <P>In reply to the question put by Deputy O'Higgins, we find that one of these functions has been withdrawn from the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  Does the Minister now realise the impression that is to be created in the public mind that this has been a job found for the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures when he&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, section 1, to delete the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to alter the title of this institute from that of Dublin Institute to Irish Institute. This matter was touched upon on the Committee Stage and, for reasons which I could not very well follow, the Taoiseach adhered to the view that the word Dublin should stand.  Frankly, I want this institute for advanced <Col N="1853" /> studies, in so far as it is concerned with Celtic studies, to command the sympathy and support of all our people all over the country.  But I think if you are looking for public goodwill you cannot afford to be too detached from the pardonable prejudices of our people, and anyone who has been brought up in rural Ireland knows that it is a constant cause of complaint that everything goes to Dublin and that, so far as this country is concerned, Dublin is the only part of it that is considered.  I think that well-known sentiment will be stirred by describing this institute as the Dublin Institute and that whatever opposition there is to it will be augmented by this description, whereas those who desire to criticise this institute&mdash;as indeed any well intentioned person could&mdash;if they are to criticise an Irish institute will be constrained to criticise the proposal on its merits, but if they are concerned to attack the Dublin Institute, inevitably their criticisms will gather to them the instinctive prejudice of rural Ireland against any establishment which is exclusively of Dublin, and nothing else.  The Taoiseach can say: &ldquo;Well, convince the people down the country that an institute described as the Dublin Institute is not in fact a city institution as opposed to a national one&rdquo;.  There are occasions when it is right to be indiscreet, and I know it is indiscreet of me to say that it may not be easy to bring home to the masses of our people the advantages which, I believe, will accrue to the nation as a result of the work this institute will do.  There may be many in the country who will take the view that the whole thing is a bit of a &ldquo;cod&rdquo;; that we cannot afford this kind of business; and, in any case, ask, who wants it?  I am quite prepared with arguments to combat that wherever it presents itself, but, as far as rural Ireland is concerned, the advocates of this institute will be materially embarrassed by the fact that it is to be described as the Dublin Institute as opposed to Irish Institute, with the results I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I repeat seriously and deliberately that Irish is an adjective which will never lose its meaning so long as the world continues, but Dublin is an adjective <Col N="1854" /> which might well lose its meaning, because there are many Dublins in the world.  It is quite possible to have a situation arising in a city like Lublin in Poland, where an institute might be established, and reference being made to the Lublin or Dublin Institutes, so that confusion might arise.  I do not say that is of grave importance, and that that consideration alone should control the style and the title of this institute, but it is something to consider.  In any case, if this institute is going to be something of which we might be proud&mdash;and I expect it will be&mdash;I would sooner gather that credit to Ireland rather than to Dublin.  I know that if this institute is going to do the best work, the bulk of the scholarship which will distinguish it will come from Ireland rather than from Dublin.  Why should those of us who glory in the fact that we were born in Mayo, God help us, be held up before the world as Dublin Jackeens, if we want to contribute to the labours of this institute of higher studies?  I certainly do not aim at occupying a high place in this institute. That is not my line.  But I imagine that there are many of my fellow-countrymen who will be glad to be known as Dons or research students of an Irish Institute, who would feel a certain measure of resentment if, in order to qualify for such a position they should be called upon to repudiate the counties from which they came.  I do not think that is a matter of grave concern, but it is one upon which they alone should be allowed to make up their minds, as to how the institute should be properly described. Taking all these things together, and setting them against the reasons advanced to justify the description of this institute as the Dublin Institute, I think the reasons I have given for describing it as the Irish Institute, just as the College de France is called the French College, should prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment for the reasons I stated on the last occasion.  It is usual to describe institutes of this sort by the place where they have their seat, and after giving fair consideration to the suggestion of the Deputy I still adhere <Col N="1855" /> to the original idea of having it called after the place where it is to be, that is here in Dublin.  Nobody is going to forget that Dublin is the capital of the country, and if it is in Dublin it is an Irish Institute also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Taoiseach say it is usual, when the only analogy is the College de France?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not analogous. When a positive statement is made like that, one would expect that there would be a mass of evidence to show that the statement was well founded. The College de France is not the same as this Institute.  The Deputy knows that quite well.  There are institutes at Copenhagen, at Princeton, and Kharkov.  The institute at Kharkov and the institute at Princeton are called after the cities.  The more definite the name the better and nobody is for a moment going to forget that Dublin is the capital of Ireland and that this is an Irish institute.  We considered carefully the arguments put forward by the Deputy on the last day, which did not differ much from the arguments he put forward to-day, and we have merely decided the matter in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a case of Sam Adams and John Adams.  The Prime Minister has heard of the institute but all other simple creatures have heard only of the university.  Why does the Taoiseach toss his head?  Surely my views are just as reasonable as his.  He has his view and I have mine.  It should not vex him that I should persist in my view after he has pontificated.  I do not toss my head when the Prime Minister differs from me and I might have better reason for doing so than the Prime Minister has.</P>
      <P>I have given examples to substantiate my case.  The Prime Minister has not given any to substantiate his case except in so far as he has named certain institutes.  But the institutions commonly associated with the names he used were universities.  It may be that, in the inquiries he made when examining this question, he discovered the existence of these institutes, but the vast bulk of mankind have not and, to the ordinary mind, Kharkov means university and Princeton means university.  That is certainly true in the United States and amongst the vast bulk of our people here.  If institutes of higher learning were established in America or in Russia, I should expect them to be described as the American Institute of Higher Learning, or the Russian Institute of Higher Leaning.  There is no suggestion here that this institute should be exclusively associated with University College, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it, from what the Prime Minister has told us, that Princeton Institute is expected to work in close collaboration with Princeton University, and that Kharkov Institute is expected to work in close collaboration with the University of Kharkov.  There has been no suggestion that that should be the scheme in respect of this institute.  Is it contemplated that the Universities of Galway and Cork shall have no association or contact with the institute of higher learning envisaged <Col N="1857" /> in this Bill?  I do not believe that that is the Prime Minister's intention. On the contrary, I understood that he desired to emphasise that this institute was not designed to take the place of any university or to usurp the functions of any university, but was designed to collaborate with all university institutions and institutions of learning in the country.  How can that be better effected than by making clear that this is not a Cork, Galway or Dublin institute, but an institute for the whole country, to which scholars from all parts of the country may come and whence scholars may go to all parts of the country.  I differ radically with the Prime Minister in the title he has chosen for the institute.  I think that it is a mistake.  I do not suggest that it is going to do the scheme irretrievable harm, but it is going to lose the sympathy of many people who would be emotionally enthusiastic for it while their intellectual assent had been, as yet, imperfectly compelled.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 6-8, Section 4 (1), to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This is a proposal to delete from the Bill provision for a school of theoretical physics.  A great many people are prepared to go the limit in the service of Celtic studies, and feel that, even in a time of acute stringency, it is justifiable to demand additional sacrifices from an overtaxed people to do work in Celtic studies which it might be too late to do if we waited for five years or ten years.  The very essence of our problem in connection with Celtic studies is speed in availing of the still-surviving material.  Few people who have not interested themselves in this branch of learning appreciate that in Celtic studies the seanchaidhe, the repository of old songs, the last surviving exponent of a perishing dialect may die, and that, when he dies, in our circumstances the chances are against anybody being found capable of supplying the knowledge that he carried with him to the grave.  It is for that reason I believe that this institute for advanced Celtic studies should be set on foot now.  No such argument can be advanced in regard to theoretical physics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education has said that the reason he wanted to incorporate theoretical physics in the <Col N="1859" /> original scheme was that there were three exceptionally distinguished men available at the moment and that if we did not avail of their services now we might never get them again.  Suppose this were a normal time and that we were not, as a country, struggling with very acute financial adversity, that argument might be used with great force but, when every penny counts and when you are trying to get the people to meet the difficulties with which they are confronted, I think that argument loses almost all its force because even the Minister for Education will not go so far as to say that the like of these three men will never be seen again.  If we were to wait for three or five years for the establishment of a school of theoretical physics, provided we were prepared to hold out sufficient inducement, I have no doubt we should find scholars of approximately equal distinction in this sphere of learning.</P>
    <P>I sent a message to the Taoiseach&mdash;I do not know whether he ever got it or not; I have no reason to believe he did and I have no reason to believe he did not, so that I do not want to commit him in any way&mdash;three months ago begging him to bring forward this Bill exclusively on the basis of Celtic studies so that its merits might be challenged on that basis alone, if challenged they were to be.  I pointed out to the person to whom I gave the message that the question of theoretical physics, undoubtedly, contains the suggestion that the Taoiseach, who is notoriously a person who has all his life taken an amateurish interest in mathematics, was seeking to hold himself out for the kudos which would accrue to him as patron of mathematical learning and as a kind of pedagogue amongst the proletariat.  I do not want to call anybody's pedagogy or scholarship into question at all, but if we were to provide a school of higher learning to accord with the qualifications of every member of this Dáil, we should have schools of higher learning filling every building in Dublin.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is to justify mathematical physics, I suppose we could invoke Senator Fitzgerald for a school of Thomistic philosophy, not to speak <Col N="1860" /> of the modest Deputy McGilligan for a school of international law.  I suppose we might even draw on Senator Magennis as our questionable justification for a school of metaphysics.  If we provide schools to please the special predilections of the Taoiseach, why should we not provide schools to please the special predilections of every Deputy in the House?  The Taoiseach says that Rowan Hamilton was a learned man and a distinguished light in mathematical physics.  No one will challenge that statement, but we have had great philosophers in this country, we have had great doctors in this country, and we have had good metaphysicians in this country.</P>
    <P>The name of Bishop Berkeley is not unknown; the name of Stokes is not unknown.  One could go through all branches of learning and find great names which might fittingly be commemorated in institutions of this kind. I see no objection to doing that in the years that lie ahead, as funds become available and as distinction and prosperity accrue to the institute as a whole.  I should be glad to see it expanding within limits, but why should we in this country, a predominantly agricultural country, suddenly pretend to feel an exclusive and commanding interest in mathematical physics, co-equal with our interest and zeal for Celtic studies?  There is just not any reason.  It is an irrational, temperamental kind of thing to do. It is creating prejudice against the institute.  It is presenting the opponents of the institute with an argument for which I can find no rational answer and it is confusing the public mind on the purposes to be served by this institute.  It is detracting from the hallmark of approval in the field of studies that this Oireachtas can give by the passing of the Bill.  I think it is a most deplorable feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think if the Minister for Education had the slightest desire to indicate his anxiety to draw sympathy and support to his proposal, the concession contained in this amendment was one that a reasonable man would have been glad to make, one in which he might have said: &ldquo;Well, it did occur to me that theoretical physics would be a <Col N="1861" /> good thing; I admit I have a predilection in that direction but I am not going to force it on the House.  We are getting a measure of unanimity in regard to the school of Celtic studies and I do not want to impose my views on the House.  We have power, on the advice of the council, to set up a school of mathematical physics at a later stage.  I am quite content with that.  Let us start with the school of Celtic studies and determine hereafter what we shall do about the other proposal.&rdquo;  That is not the kind of approach you get from the Minister for Education when we embark on the sterile path of seeking grounds of co-operation.  I think it is a pity.  I think, it is injurious to the project of which I had high hopes.  I am going to divide the House on the propriety of incorporating this ancillary school in the Principal Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I said on the last occasion if I can avoid doing so.  However, it is very difficult when the same speech is made as was made on that Stage. It would be a misrepresentation of the purposes of the institute if it were to be confined to Celtic studies.  It would be an attempt to put something over on the people on the plea that it was to be an institute for Celtic studies only, if some second school were not provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made a mistake when he said that the two schools were of equal rank.  The cost will be very different and the reason that theoretical physics was chosen is this. Firstly, Celtic studies will have a very much narrower interest for people outside the country than will theoretical physics.  Theoretical physics will get the institute known in circles where it would never be thought of, if it were to be confined to Celtic studies alone. First of all, therefore, to indicate that the institute is intended to have a special purpose other than merely advancing a knowledge of Celtic languages, the second school is necessary. If you look around you, when thinking of an institute of this type where one school is to be devoted to the study of languages, to find some other subject to which the institute <Col N="1862" /> might direct its attention, I think it will at once strike you that that other school should be devoted to some scientific subject.</P>
    <P>From one point of view, I would prefer to see a school of experimental physics established but the cost of such a school&mdash;I hope that some day it may be practicable&mdash;would be almost prohibitive at present.  The smaller countries in that particular field find it very difficult to compete with the richer and larger countries, particularly with the United States in recent years, so much so that in countries even like Britain, where they have considerable wealth and where a considerable amount of money is available for educational and scientific purposes, they are becoming more and more specialised and, while continuing on certain branches of experimental physics, they are leaving others to be pursued by wealthier countries. If you are thinking of any branch that would suit a small country you will inevitably be driven back to pure mathematics or to mathematical physics.  Apart from that general reasoning, there is the consideration that the school will cost relatively little.  The cost will not be one-third of the ultimate estimated cost of the school of Celtic studies.  You will find that there is an urge to go back on pure science in the knowledge that you get such good results from such small expenditure.  You merely want to pay the professors and to provide them with the necessary leisure for their work and with the necessary library and periodicals.</P>
    <P>Another reason that should influence us is that we had a reputation in the 19th century for mathematics and mathematical physics.  I think it is not too much to say that Hamilton was recognised as the greatest of Irish scientists.  His work was associated here with Dublin University and with Dunsink Observatory.  He was a lover of this country, and if anybody cares to look at any Lives that have been written of him, it will be found that one of the objects of his work was to try to enhance the prestige of his land. He loved his country, and in everything he did he was anxious that Ireland should get the credit for it.  Partly <Col N="1863" /> for that reason, and partly for other reasons, I was wondering at one time whether, as a tribute to him, this school should be called the Hamilton School of Theoretical Physics.  I had a particular interest in this, or otherwise I might have found it more difficult to arrive at this particular decision.  If you leave all that aside and consider this question calmly, you will see that if you want an institute with more than one school, you would naturally divide it between the language side and the science side; and, when you choose the science you almost inevitably come to mathematics or mathematical physics and, of the two, it is nearer to the practical side, in my opinion, to take mathematical physics.</P>
    <P>There was another point.  At the moment, by a curious chance, when this Bill was introduced, it was possible to get three outstanding men in that particular branch.  The Deputy is very sanguine when he says that, if you make the remuneration sufficient, you will attract scholars from other countries.  One of the peculiarities is that it is not so easy to attract them from where they have been working, if they get enough to live upon.  The average scholar is interested in his work and lives for his work, if he is worthy to be called a scholar at all. He has to live and has to get remuneration to enable him to live, but he is prepared to live sometimes on very, very little in order to be in the surroundings and conditions which enable him to do his work well.  Under normal circumstances, I would not hope to be able to attract, even by good salaries, real scholars from other places.  In this case it was possible to get three.</P>
    <P>I do not think that one of the three I have in mind will be available now, but I hope that the other two will be. The three of them were so distinguished that they were members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  I think there are only 70 such all over the world.  In Britain, some time ago, I think they had two in the whole country.  Here we would have had <Col N="1864" /> three as professors in this institute, and I believe it would be unique on that account.  I am afraid now that we will not directly have one of them, but we will be fortunate in being able to get his co-operation, as he happens to be here and has been here for a number of years.  He will not be available directly any longer&mdash;I am sorry to say, from the point of view of the institute &mdash;but only indirectly, by co-operation with it.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it would be a great mistake to delete the school of theoretical physics from this Bill.  That does not mean to say that, if there are other schools which ought to be added from time to time, that cannot be done. This city has a great reputation, for example, in medicine and the practice of medicine.  It may happen that in research in connection with medicine the conditions may be such as to make it desirable to include in this institute a scheme for medical research of one kind or another.  I do not think I can say anything more as to why we should retain the school of theoretical physics.</P>

It appears that the other man is a person who has been described as one who <Col N="1866" /> might have been available but for the war, who would have been able to co-operate more closely were it not for the war.  The position, as I read it, is this: The Taoiseach, in his statement before the House, said that, while we might have learned men here in connection with mathematics of different types, and while we might have had recognised also great names in our history in connection with other branches of learning, these particular types were taken in contradistinction because of the particular individuals who were available.  I understand that that opportunity is lessened now, and, to that extent, the case for this is somewhat weakened.  I will have to speak on another occasion in connection with another matter, because, as the Taoiseach has outlined the question it appears that this is only the thin end of the wedge to take one type of research away from the university and, to that extent, I am opposed determinedly to it; but that will arise on another occasion.</P>

      <P>Section 6, to which this amendment is moved, provides for the making of an order and in other parts of this Bill where orders are made it is provided that they shall lie upon the Table of the House and if not expressly disapproved within 21 days, shall have the force of law and, if disapproved, they shall be disapproved without prejudice to anything that may have been done under them prior to the recorded disapproval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think that is a very desirable safeguard to preserve not only from the point of view of this Bill itself, but from the point of view of the dangerous precedent that would be created if the well-established rule that orders of this character always lie upon the Table of the House and are liable to review by the Oireachtas were departed from in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will observe that, in another part of the Bill, which I propose to amend, a peculiarly vicious precedent that was recently established in another quite unrelated Bill <Col N="1871" /> to this, is being followed by the draftsman. An attempt is being made to make the Seal of the Council statutory evidence of all that the document contains.  It is a vicious principle, and it is brought in here because it is taken from another Act where that vicious principle is introduced.  I therefore object on the grounds of the institute itself to having these orders made without having them submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and also on the ground that to depart from the well established precedent that these orders always are subject to the approval of the Oireachtas is a dangerous departure which should not be countenanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point on it.  These establishment orders are to contain quite an amount of information. The details are set out in the next section.  Under the proposed substitute by the Taoiseach for what Deputy Dillon has suggested it is only possible to annul the order.  It is not possible to amend it.  Therefore, supposing <Col N="1872" /> there was something in the detailed points of the establishment order that the House objected to their only resource is to throw the whole thing out.  Would it not be better to include a power to annul or amend?  We have met this difficulty before in connection with rules of court, but surely in this case it is quite conceivable that there might be objection to some point in the constitution of the body, but the House might refrain from throwing out the whole order, although there was objection to a part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A subsequent amending order can be made.  If, for instance, Deputies in the House thought that the order should have been varied or should have been somewhat different from the form in which it was, if a case was made for amending it, it can be amended.  Suppose an order might be brought forward and that certain part of it was objectionable, if the Government said: &ldquo;We agree there are objections to that particular clause or that particular provision&rdquo;, the Government, unless it wanted to put it to a vote there and then, could say, &ldquo;Very well, we will bring in an amending order varying it to the extent that might be desired by a substantial section of the House.&rdquo;  In regard to the other method I do not know where it would lead us to.  I think, with ordinary reason and desire on the part of the Government to meet any reasonable expression of opinion from other parts of the House, it does provide a way of amending orders.  It is not as if it was final.  You can have an amending order.  I suggest that would probably meet any of the difficulties that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a small point of detail.  The answer to that is that if one looks at the section which contains as a sub-section this power to amend, that is to say, Section 6, sub-section (3), the power to amend depends upon the Government after consultation with the Governing Board of a Constituent School and with the council, I am thinking more of the occasion where it might be proposed to establish a new constituent school and there might be objection taken right <Col N="1873" /> at the beginning to, say, the method of selection of the governing authority. The suggestion given in answer to me is, let the order go through and let it be amended.  Supposing one is objecting to such a root matter as the method of selection of the governing authority, what we have to do is to let the thing go through, to let the objected-to governing body come into being, and then to let it rest with the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy goes back to Section 4, he will see that when a new constituent school is being established, under sub-section (2), the House has to approve of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that does not tie up with this at all.  The Bill itself sets out two schools and allows for the establishment of other schools. The other schools cannot be established until they are, so to speak, formally voted by the House approving the establishment of the new school, but that is all I think will be in that establishing order&mdash;simply a mere mark of approval of the idea of establishing the school.  The procedure, as I understand it, is that, under the rest of the Bill, an establishment order will be brought in, and that establishment order will detail such things as the Government think proper, but &ldquo;in particular shall provide for the following matters&rdquo;, and then follow all the paragraphs down to the letter (j).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of the circumstances in which somebody may possibly object to something in, say, (g) of the establishment order, and apparently the only resort the House has is to say: &ldquo;We will annul the whole order.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach says, in answer to that, that what we will do is to pass it with a guarantee from the Government that they will bring in an amendment, which they can do under Section 6.  I can see any number of circumstances in which it will work, but I can also see <Col N="1874" /> circumstances in which it will not work. It is a matter in respect of these orders which I have never understood&mdash;that where the House is given a certain amount of control, as it is by the scheme of having orders brought before it with capacity to annul them, it must always go the whole way of annulment, and that there is no half-way house.  We all seem to be afraid of giving the House power to amend, instead of providing solely for a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that it would be a very big question.  I take it that the reason why in most of these cases you have details in an order which you have not got in a Bill is that there are a number of things of an administrative type which have to be carefully examined and which are put in after the most careful examination from an administrative point of view.  I think we would have very little time for other work if we had all the possible amendments that might be proposed to us.  I think this is one of the reasons why it is a matter of all or none.  With regard to a fundamental matter such as the constitution of the governing body, I imagine that the House would not let the Government away with a proposal to establish a new school without trying to get some preliminary indication, at any rate, of what the governing body was to be like.  I imagine they would be asked to indicate that in advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But knowing what the order must, in general, contain, there will naturally be an effort made by members of the House to get from the Government, at the very start, information as to how this school is to be governed, as to its constitution, and so on, so that, before the first resolution is passed at all, I imagine that some sort of outline of the functions of the school, the mode of constitution of its governing body, and so on, will be elicited.</P>

Tell us how its governing body is going to be composed and things of that sort&rdquo;, and before the House would pass the original resolution, which they would have to do directly, the Minister in charge would have to indicate to the House what its constitution was, what were its functions and all these things that are to be specified in the order, and he would be asked how he proposed to carry these out.

      <P>The President is there, and it is proposed in the Bill that he should act on the advice of the Government in these matters.  My proposal is that he should act, in these matters, on the advice of the Council of State. I see, of course, the constitutional objection to giving the President the right to act independently of the Government's advice on any matter relating to the life and liberty of the subjects of this State, but it did seem to me that one could differentiate between an act done by the President in an academic institution and an act done by him, the ultimate effect of which would be to create law.  I do not know whether the constitutional lawyers would there distinguish.  It would be clearly unconstitutional to suggest that the President should take any legislative action independently of the advice of the Government elected by Dáil Eireann, but where you invite the President to act in an entirely different capacity, not in his capacity as a part of Oireachtas Eireann but merely as <Col N="1877" /> the ceremonial head of the State, I think there is a distinction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard that view advanced.  I have no doubt that in the preparation of Article 13 the Taoiseach spent a good deal of midnight oil.  He devoted a lot of care in drafting it and perhaps he will tell us does he not distinguish, or could not a legitimate distinction be made, between the President acting as a constituent part of Oireachtas Eireann and the President acting without any pretension to be part of Oireachtas Eireann?  There must be a distinction between the President acting in his capacity as part of Oireachtas Eireann and the President, let us say, opening a garden party.  Nobody would challenge the right of the President to open a garden party or a fancy fair in Balbriggan, independent of the advice of the Government.  Of course, it might be very indiscreet for him to go cantering off in that way, but there would not be anything unconstitutional about the President opening a fancy fair in Balbriggan.  The Taoiseach now talks about co-relating the appointment of a professor in this institute of studies with a legislative Act and the objection is there and I am drawing an analogy between this Act and the opening of a fancy fair in Balbriggan.  There surely is that distinction and I would be glad that constitutional lawyers would get rid of that difficulty.  There are certain things that the President may do without coming in conflict with his constitutional obligation to consult the Government.  Is it unreasonable to suggest that this might be one of them?</P>

      <P>There might be a distinction in relation to the President acting in a matter which is not clearly and definitely associated with the Oireachtas.  But this is associated with Parliamentary work.  State moneys have been or are being paid out and in relation to matters of this sort I do not think you can distinguish <Col N="1878" /> the President in one capacity from the President in another.  So far as the Constitution is concerned, I am advised, on the point of Article 31, which defines fairly definitely the functions of the Council of State, that you cannot add to these functions, and then you have Article 13 (11) which makes it clear that if any new powers are given to the President, other than those set out in the Constitution, he shall act in those matters always on the advice of the Government.</P>

I think you ought to give some independent body the right of veto on any proposal to alter the terms on which a professor of this institute has been originally appointed; otherwise you are continually going to have the difficulty that badly-informed public opinion may be stirred up by some interested parties to prejudice the position of the scholar who has the courage of his convictions and the Government may find themselves in the desperate position of wishing to vindicate the right of the scholar to stand over what he <Col N="1879" /> believes, although in actual fact the Government themselves profoundly differ from the expressed conviction of the scholar they want to protect.</P>
    <P>Suppose you had a scholar here who was solely concerned with philology and he made some foolish speech about divorce or contraception and a wild turmoil was started that a person of this kind should not be permitted to lecture on mathematical physics. Suppose the Government found themselves in the position that they were pressed to alter the terms of office of the individual in order to squeeze him out and, resisting that pressure, they found themselves arraigned with being the champions of the contraceptive law, with subsidising contraceptive publicity. The Government might say: &ldquo;We are not interested in the merits of what this man has said, but we are interested in this connection, that we do not propose to penalise a man in his professional capacity for an expression of his private views.  He may have been right or wrong, discreet or indiscreet.&rdquo;  That sounds pretty improbable, almost ludicrous, but at the present moment a contest is actually proceeding and there is a very furious effort being made to dislodge a gentleman I very much dislike and whose views I very strongly condemn, but whose position, nevertheless, I do not think ought to be jeopardised by the fact that he holds very unorthodox and, to me, very disgusting views on many matters of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>As regards the gentleman in question, I forget at the moment whether he is a philosopher or a mathematical physicist.  The point is that if a man is, let us say, dealing with ethics or pure mathematics, it seems undesirable that his private views in relation to other matters should be invoked for the purpose of driving him out of his job.  Unless a section of some kind, designed to have the same effect as my amendment, is inserted in this Bill, the Government may find themselves in the position that they are advocating wholly unacceptable views and finding it difficult to explain to the people that they detest and despise those views as much as the people do <Col N="1880" /> but that they will not stand for victimising a scholarly man because his views on wholly unrelated matter are wrong or unpopular at a given time.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy not trying to do something which can hardly be done?  If you find a Legislature feeling so strongly as that on a particular matter, would there not be strong pressure exercised to bring in an Act of Parliament to deal with the situation?  It would not be beyond the competence of a Parliament to remove a professor if it were considered desirable to do so.  I think what will happen is this, that there will be certain terms and conditions of service of one kind or another; some kind of contract will be made between the institute and the professors.  Under this contract the professors will have certain rights and these will be protected, in so far as they can be protected, by the courts.  It is questionable whether it would be a good principle to say that they cannot be changed.</P>

      <P>It may be right, as Deputy Dillon suggests, to bring in the Council of State.  No matter what has been said about the amendment, changing the salary of the professor does not require an order.  I think the Act would override the order; where there is a specific statement anything so vaguely put as an order would be overridden.  I think that once the school is established and the salary of the professor fixed, that an order should come before the House before that would be changed.  The section reads: &ldquo;The Government on the recommendation of the Minister.... shall from time to time determine either generally or in respect of any particular senior professor&rdquo; the salaries and so on.  Power is there distinctly given over to the Ministers to change from time to time in respect of the new professor his salary and emoluments, and I doubt very much if that was intended.</P>

      <P>If any court came to construe this afterwards, they would be bound to take the view that it was open to the Government, intermediate and in the course of the professor's period, to change his salary.  That may be desired.  It may be a good safeguard for the professors. I suggest that either of two things should happen&mdash;keep in Deputy Dillon's phrase and leave out this reference to the Council of State. Then the amendment would read: &ldquo;No salary of any professor shall be changed from the original scale fixed under sub-section (2) of this section.&rdquo; That would mean that once the salaries were fixed for the professors and occupiers of the posts you cannot change them.</P>

Now the person who will be most in contact with these things will be the Taoiseach, because he is the channel through which the President is made aware of the advice of the Government.  If there is any delay it is brought to his attention.  He will be aware also, as head of the Government, of what is being done.

      <P>I once said that such an institute should be surrounded by a certain amount of form and the Taoiseach stated that he took the view that the less form there was the better; that it would be more democratic with less form.  That view has been a good deal expressed in America.  I do not agree.  You have the Great Seal of the Council of State and that should be used, otherwise you bring it into contempt and the Seal is in fact abrogated. I entirely differ from the Taoiseach's view.  I believe in silk hats, and in form and dignity, whatever shape it may take, being associated with the procedure of this State.  I do not think it adds anything to its democratic character to conduct our affairs as if we were a parish council.  I regard the Great Seal as an essential part of the State machinery, and I think the more often that it is properly and, with dignity, used and brought to public attention the better it will be for the institutions that we control.  The Taoiseach will not use the Great Seal.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is not possible to give the President new functions in which he will be advised by the Council of State if these new functions are given him by law, but if it is possible to give functions, otherwise than by law, then there is nothing in the Constitution to say that he is precluded from taking advice from the Council of State.  Where functions are given to the President by law, he cannot have any other advice except that of the Government.  Sub-section (5) of Section 9, in relation to the first council of the institute, says that the council shall consist of one member who shall be the chairman appointed by the President.  Sub-section (3) of the section provides that the first council shall consist of a chairman and four other members, all of whom shall be appointed by the President.  In the one case it is distinctly stated that the President shall appoint, while in the other case it is more or less indirectly referred to that somebody shall be appointed by the President.  The first clearly gives the President new functions by law.  The second more or less assumes the power, but it does no give it to him.  I think that the section might be better phrased if the wording in sub-section (3) were followed.</P>

      <P>I think it would be more consistent with the whole scheme of things if the President, who makes the appointment, were to receive a resignation where a member wants to resign.

      <P>In the ordinary course the President makes an appointment. The person appointed, at some stage, wishes to resign.  We all know that very often letters of resignation are sent but are not persisted in if representations are made.  The idea is that the President, before he would accept the resignation, would communicate to the Government the fact that this resignation had come in.  That would give the Government an opportunity of getting in contact with that person, of asking him if he could not continue in office or if it was absolutely necessary that he should go, since his doing so would mean the loss of his particular ability and knowledge to the council.  In a case like that it would give the Government an opportunity of trying to get the person in question, if it was so desired, to reconsider his proposed resignation.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> In page 7, Section 15 (3), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;Institute&rdquo; where it occurs in line 38 to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    <P>It is sought to provide under sub-section (3) here that &ldquo;All courts of justice shall take judicial notice of the seal of the Institute&rdquo;.  I propose to stop the sub-section there, cutting out the proposal that.</P>
    <P>every document purporting to be sealed with the seal of the Institute and to be authenticated in accordance with this section shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been duly and lawfully so sealed and shall, unless as aforesaid, be received in evidence without further proof and, in particular, without proof of any signature (including a counter-signature) affixed to such document for the purpose of such authentication and without proof of the office or authority of the person whose signature such signature purports to be.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, it is open to litigants to call for proof of a document which purports to be signed, sealed, and delivered in a particular way.  If the statute under which the document is made requires certain formalities to be conformed to, it is open to the litigant on the other side from that in support of which the document is produced to call on the officer purporting to make the instrument, to prove that he had done so, thus affording the litigant an opportunity of raising such relevant matters with that witness as it may be expedient for the due prosecution of his suit to do.  These legislative proposals to exonerate officers of that character from the obligation of coming to court when the other side wants to bring them there, and going into the witness-box to prove their document and thus exposing themselves to cross-examination are, in my opinion, bad.  I do not suppose the bursar, or whoever the officer of the institute may be who is to sign, seal and deliver the document on behalf of the institute, will be called to court once in 50 years.  Therefore, we are not legislating to avoid a constantly recurring nuisance which would entrench <Col N="1889" /> on a busy man's time.  We are going to spare him the necessity of attending court once in half a century, and I think we ought not to do that. We are removing a well-established obligation from his shoulders by express law, and, unless very grave reason can be pleaded for adopting that course, I do not think it is a course that ought to be adopted.</P>

      <P>It is one of these poisonous provisions put in by Government Departments in order to spare themselves the necessity of facing a litigant in a court of law.  Very often they do not want to submit themselves to cross-examination because frequently, when put on oath, all sorts of inconvenient lapses on their part are brought to light through cross-examination. If you subpoena them, you may not get an opportunity of cross-examining them at all; you will only be able to examine in chief.  I imagine that if by law it is declared that a court will take judicial notice of a seal, that means that when a document is so sealed it is <i>prima facie</i> good; but that it is open to the other side to challenge its validity, whereupon the person presenting it must call the officer who has the statutory duty of executing it to satisfy the court that it was executed in accordance with law, and it is open to the other <Col N="1890" /> person to cross-examine.  I do not see that that is any hardship.  I do not see how you are going to inconvenience anyone materially if you accept the amendment and simply provide that the seal of the institute is to be added to the list of things which a judge is judicially to recognise.  I can see that the Taoiseach, with his cautious mind, is hatching plans to avoid giving way on this because he is afraid of putting his foot wrong, but he can look into it between now and the time when the Bill reaches the Seanad.</P>

That is the kind of case that arises.  If you give the institute that right, the court must assume that it was properly executed, unless you can prove that it was not.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is making a mountain out of a mole-hill.  What is in question is this: that a certain decision is taken by the proper authorities in the institute. That decision eventuates from some document, and that document, in order that it should be authentic, has to be sealed, and certain signatures are appended.  All you can find out is whether, in fact, a resolution has been passed, and whether the witnesses were present when the seal was being affixed.  It seems to me that in documents of that sort all corporate bodies take care to see that the seal is duly affixed, and that the signatures of witnesses are duly appended at the fixing of the seal.  If you are questioning as a matter of argument the power of the body, or the persons, the position is that all these things are open to question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is common form for courts of justice to take notice of this proceeding, but here you do not require proof of authentication to be given by the people who purported to have signed.  There is a considerable amount of difference between the position of this institute and the ordinary limited company.  These reasons have commended themselves to generations of people.  A limited company does prove that a certain document was sealed.  The only question that can be raised is whether the document was properly sealed, and the court may have to decide if it was done at the proper time, if it was witnessed by the proper people, the whether they are the people they profess to be.  Why is there any difference between the position of this institute and the <Col N="1892" /> ordinary company in that connection? If the institute was confined to running a college immediately its powers are lessened.  You might have a poor person up against this institute, and why should that person not have as against the institute all the rights of a court case, and the necessity of these people coming to prove who they are? There might be a whole lot in the background. The Taoiseach said that this phrase has been found very useful.  Of course it has.  In the Pigs and Bacon Act the courts are at the moment in a peculiar position.  The time has come when there is what is known in France as administrative law.  That is a system of law whereby there is a completely new court and new tribunal for any case in which a Department of State or the civil service, or an official of State is concerned.  In countries where they have administrative law they have courts and precedents and cases are decided before these administrative tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the position here that more or less there is the pretence of continuing the ordinary courts.  The Pigs and Bacon Act was a notorious example.  There were things that had to be considered before orders were made.  All that happened was that someone sent down an extract signed with the seal of the board, and it could not be questioned.  There was no way of probing into the matter to see whether what was before the board was investigated.  The owners were enabled to do a thing for which a public commission castigated them, putting money into private purses. The whole evil arose from the fact that the board was able to override a particular clause.  I have no doubt that the people who wanted the board to function in a way that turned out to be misbehaviour wanted that hidden. What Deputy Dillon is talking about will not occur once in a generation. There is no reason for putting this institute on any footing other than that of the ordinary company, particularly as it is given power in an earlier section to buy and sell land. In a later section we are introducing a completely new provision to lease property.  This institute may come before the courts as a landlord in respect <Col N="1893" /> of ordinary increase of rent cases.  Why should it be in a better position than the ordinary landlord?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether any further examination by me is likely to change my mind, but it seems in regard to the material part, that this does not affect it at all. Surely, if something <i>ultra vires</i> is done, or if a document is in any way inequitable, it can be questioned, and the only thing that could possibly be brought out was whether a revolutionary decision was arrived at by the council of the institute, and whether the seal put on indicated that that had been officially done, and the signatures properly appended.  In the case of a public body like this, if anything was not done correctly, there is not the slightest doubt that it would become immediately a matter for litigation, if the signatures were not properly appended or a resolution passed.  These are the only two things that matter.</P>

      <P>How would the ordinary litigant prove that?  The only chance the ordinary litigant has is to call and question these two people. They would have to parade themselves in court and say &ldquo;That is my signature.&rdquo; On the other side, they could be asked: &ldquo;Where is the resolution? Produce the terms.  Tell us when it was passed and the number voting.&rdquo; If the two officers did not attend the court, but simply sent down a document, and someone questioned it, is the answer to be: &ldquo;There is the document. You cannot question the signatures.&rdquo; What is the litigant to suspect in the background?  He is given the task of calling these people as witnesses.</P>

I am sure that if the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, who is sitting there with such a pained expression, had a claim for a pension he would want his case to be tried by a judge of the High Court.  I know when he has a dispute of that kind he will not be content that I should decide between him and the Government if I am in office as Minister for Finance. He would much prefer to go to a judge of the High Court because he would be afraid that I would put a blister on him.  If the Minister is afraid of that, what shall we say about a man whose name may be Skiliovitch?  It would give him some sense of security to know that he was going before a judge of the High Court whose position was impregnable and who could not be influenced by the Government of the day.

That is the point raised by the Taoiseach's colleague.  I do not see it covered in any section.  Most of the difficulty I had before this has been swept away, I am glad to say, by the Taoiseach.

      <P>I remember that something like this arose also in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, where the employment of a number of people was going to be disturbed by the legislation at that time, and it was suggested that they should be given some sort of an appeal there.  I think that the phrase suggested here would meet the case.  The argument was finally decided then to the effect that, if the matter could not be brought to agreement with the Minister, there <Col N="1910" /> should be provision for appeal to another source.  I know that a number of people were disturbed, and I do not believe that the arbitrator sat once. That, however, is what the cluttering up of cases comes to.</P>

      <P>Yes, but in this case here, is it not the fact that this can only arise if the council, which is an outside body, and on which a number of professors will be represented, were to take up an unfair attitude?  I do not think it is likely that they would take up an unfair attitude.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is so.  It is a long time since I looked at the Irish Universities Act&mdash;I think it was somewhere in 1926, in connection with another Bill&mdash;but, as I understood it, there is a peculiarly limiting phrase in regard to the accounts.  I am speaking from memory, of course, and I may be wrong, but I certainly understood that wherever accounts have to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General there is some phrase used such as &ldquo;for examination and audit in accordance with&rdquo;, and then there is a particular Act named&mdash;I think it was the Exchequer Act of somewhere in the &lsquo;70&rsquo;s.  At any rate my memory is that there is some definite limitation there.  I am certain that the clause in the 1908 Universities Act, which dealt with the sending of the accounts of the universities to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, did not send for audit in a particular phrase but in connection with a particular Act.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £389,060 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1941, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, and No. 15 of 1937), Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932 and No. 43 of 1934), Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936), and for sundry contributions and expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
      <P>The total amount, £583,590, required for the service of this Vote during the financial year 1940-41, may be roughly divided into the following categories of expenditure:&mdash;cost of administration, £19,912; incidental expenses, £4,882; cost of awards, £558,796; total: £583,590.</P>
      <P>The cost of administration borne on this Vote is shown as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Army Pensions Board (sub-heads A and B), £2,975; Military Service Registration Board (sub-heads C and D), £3,841; Reference and Advisory Committee (sub-heads E and F), £13,096; total: £19,912.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> The incidental expenses are:&mdash;surgical and medical appliances (sub-head I), £300; hospital treatment (sub-head J), £1,250; expenses of applicants (sub-head M), £2,600; other expenses (sub-head N and H), £732; total: £4,882.</P>
    <P>The main service of the Vote, the award of pensions, allowances and gratuities, is distributed over five sub-heads according as the service relates to:&mdash;(a) disability pensions and gratuities under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923-1937 (sub-head G); (b) allowances and gratuities under the same Acts (sub-head H); (c) service pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924-1934 (sub-head K); (d) pensions and gratuities under the Defence Forces Pensions Scheme, 1937 (sub-head L); (e) pensions and allowances under the Connaught Rangers Pensions Act, 1936 (sub-head C).</P>
    <P>The total statutory liability under those various Acts is estimated to cost £558,796 during the financial year, but in order to appreciate the significance of those figures it is necessary to distinguish between:&mdash;(a) awards actually under payment, (b) awards that may be made during the financial year, (c) the arrears of pensions inherent in some of the awards that may be made during the year, (d) non-recurring awards, such as gratuities.</P>
    <P>The awards actually under payment as provided in the Estimate in accordance with Statutes passed by the Oireachtas are:&mdash;(a) 423 pensions under the 1923 Act costing £24,362; (b) 120 allowances under the 1923 Act costing £5,822; (c) 115 pensions under the 1927 Act costing £11,400; (d) 88 allowances under the 1927 Act costing £2,846; (e) 443 pensions under the 1932 Act costing £42,516; (f) 167 allowances under the 1932 Act costing £5,841; (g) 105 pensions under the 1937 Act costing £6,495; (h) 28 allowances under the 1937 Act costing £2,990; (i) 3,172 pensions under the 1924 Act costing £151,725; (j) 6,735 pensions under the 1934 Act costing £206,214; (k) 30 pensions under the 1932 Act (Retired Pay) costing £1,620; (l) 38 pensions under the 1936 Act (Connaught Rangers) costing <Col N="1916" /> £1,156; Total: 11,464 awards under eight Acts costing £462,987.</P>
    <P>In addition to those 11,464 awards costing £462,987, the Estimate provides for new awards as follows: (a) 5 pensions under 1923-27 Acts costing £130; (b) 47 pensions under the 1932 Act costing £3,890; (c) 9 allowances under the 1932 Act costing £311; (d) 37 pensions under the 1937 Act costing £1,556; (e) 60 allowances under the 1937 Act costing £750; (f) 6 pensions under the 1924 Act costing £600; (g) 768 pensions under the 1934 Act costing £19,200; (h) 7 pensions under the 1932 Act (Retired Pay) costing £423; total: 939 awards under 8 Acts costing £26,860.</P>
    <P>Certain of the 939 awards carry, however, with them arrears of pensions, and the arrears for which the Estimate provides are:&mdash;under the 1932 Act, for pensions £11,600; under the 1932 Act, for allowances £880; under the 1937 Act, for pensions £1,134; under the 1937 Act, for allowances £2,125; under the 1934 Act, for pensions £91,988; total arrears: £107,727.</P>
    <P>This £107,727 is, of course, non-recurring. Another non-recurring item included in the Estimate is the award of gratuities as distinct from pensions or allowances, and the gratuities provided for are:&mdash;Under the 1937 Act, £1,140; under the 1927 Act, £90; under the 1932 Act, £325; under the 1932 Act (Retired Pay), £900; total: £2,455.</P>
    <P>The cost of the main service of the Vote, the cost of awards, is, therefore, briefly: awards under payment, £462,987; new awards, £26,860; arrears following new awards, £107,727, and gratuities, £2,455 a total of £600,029 It will thus be seen that of the total £600,029, no less than the sum of £110,182 is a non-recurring liability. From this sum of £600,029, there have to be made deductions in respect of deaths, and abatements under Section 8 of the 1924 Act, Section 20 of the 1934 Act and Section 15 (1) of the 1932 Act (retired pay) in respect of pensioners being in receipt of remuneration, other pensions or allowances payable out of public moneys.  On foot of such abatements, a sum of £36,709 is estimated to be saved and another sum of £4,524 is expected not to fall <Col N="1917" /> for payment owing to casualties during the year.  Hence from the £600,029, we deduct £41,233 and get, as the net cost of awards, the sum of £558,796, of which £448,614 may be regarded as a recurring item of annual expenditure.</P>
    <P>The work of the three statutory boards which are administering the various Acts is proceeding satisfactorily. The Military Service Registration Board has dealt with over 6,500 applications for service certificates under the Disability Acts, and on March 31st, there were only about 150 cases outstanding.  The work of this board on at least a full-time basis should, therefore, be completed within the near future.  The Army Pensions Board has practically completed its work on the 1932 Act proper, but has yet to deal with about 650 cases which are either proper to the 1937 Act itself, or fall under the Acts of 1923, 1927 and 1932 as amended or extended by the 1937 Act.  The end of the present financial year should see the most of these cases disposed of.</P>
    <P>As regards applications for service certificates under the 1934 Act, the referee had issued, on 31st March, 7,039 favourable reports qualifying for pensions and had confirmed 28,659 unfavourable reports by the advisory committee in respect of persons who <i>prima facie</i> were not likely to come within the scope of the Act.  In the case of all such persons allowance must be made for appeals, but it is anticipated that all reports, whether favourable or unfavourable, will be finally completed within a period of about three years.</P>

      <P>The Minister, except for the last few minutes, gave us pretty much the same information as we have in the Estimate.  There were very slight alterations in it.  The fact of the matter is that this service is costing about £20,000 to administer, and we got no information from the Minister as to the number of cases considered and decided last year.  If we are to take the Estimate as it stands as an indication of what the number is, we have, in connection with the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, about 984 cases decided.  It amounts to this, that this £20,000 institution is deciding approximately four cases a day, allowing for something under 300 days in the year. Taking the figures as the Minister has given them to us, they have passed 7,039 cases and they have rejected 28,000.  To take the average, they reject approximately 16 cases for every four cases that they admit.  It is not a very hard day's work, considering the £20,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point that is of interest in connection with this business is that we have now admitted 7,000 persons under the Act of 1934.  I presume that we might generally classify that particular lot as being men who were in arms against the first Government here.  If we look up the number of those who were in the National Army and who were dealt with under another <Col N="1919" /> Military Service Pensions Act, we find that number to be a little over 3,000. It will be seen from the figures given that the number of persons who are drawing pensions and who fought against the State are far more than twice the number of those who defended the State in its early years. My information about that particular period of our history is that the two classes were fairly well divided, so this expensive military service board must be taking another viewpoint on that matter.</P>
    <P>We have 7,000 already admitted, 19,000 to be considered, and there are appeals in at least 9,000 cases.  There is a considerable amount of speculation as to what number out of the 9,000 under appeal and the 19,000 yet to be considered will be passed, but on the figures as they stand, assuming we are to take the 19,000 on the same average and that one in every five qualifies for a pension, we will have 4,000 more on the 19,000.  Taking in connection with the 9,000 only one in every nine, we would then have another 1,000, and that would be 12,000 persons getting pensions in respect of that particular period.  That is being done at a cost of £20,000 annually to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the whole business will be completed inside the next three years.  What is the number that has to be passed in any particular year?  Can we get beyond 1,000 admissions and 4,000 rejections?  Maybe the Minister is a year out in his calculations, and let us take it that it will be four years before this will be discontinued. The whole thing has very little to commend it and the Minister must be aware of that fact when he did not tell us how many cases were dealt with last year, how many were passed, how many were rejected and how quickly he expected the 19,000 to be dealt with.  They are going to do them at the rate of 6,000 a year and at the same time settle the appeals.  The whole thing is not very creditable for the Minister.  The administrative costs are colossal.</P>
    <P>As regards the figures that have been given to us by the Minister, they differ <Col N="1920" /> very slightly but not very materially with the figures in the book.  We find that the sum paid in respect of this service in 1936-37, according to the published figures, was £439,000.  This year the sum is approximately £589,000&mdash; £588,000 is the correct figure, but there are some odd hundreds and I make a present of them to the Minister.  The increased cost of this particular service for a period of three years, from 1936-37, was £150,000, or £50,000 a year. That sum represents the awards that have been made, the gratuities that have been paid, the expenses that have been incurred, and it includes the cost of administration, which is approximately £20,000 a year.  It is quite true there have been a great many rejections, but the cost of the administration is colossal.</P>

      <P>Much of the information which the Minister gave us was conveyed in the published Estimates <Col N="1921" /> already in the possession of Deputies. It would have been much more informative if the Minister told us what these various boards did during the past year as compared with the preceeding year, so that we might get some idea as to the tempo of progress, if progress is not an inapplicable word to use in relation to the board which functions under this Vote.  The over-riding consideration which is forced upon me is that in 1934 we passed what might now be regarded as the main Pension Act extant, and under that Act approximately 55,000 applications were submitted for pensions.  Perhaps the figure might be as great as 59,000.</P>
      <P>During the last six years we have had a number of boards examining all these claims.  After six years' activity we are now told by the Minister that the various boards have issued favourable reports in approximately 7,000 cases and they have confirmed 28,000 unfavourable reports.  If that were the end of the matter one would say with a sigh of relief: &ldquo;Thank heaven that expenditure is over and we can now see the end of those Army Pension Boards and Army Registration Boards in sight.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister told us this evening that they have yet to deal with approximately 19,500 cases and we may expect appeals in approximately 9,000 of the 28,000 cases which have been rejected. The country has to face the position that there are still 19,000 applications to be considered <i>de novo</i> and there are 9,000 applications to be considered on appeal.  It seems to me that the Minister is unduly optimistic if he imagines that, with the number of cases to be dealt with, these registration boards are going to exterminate themselves at the end of three years, judging by the leisurely progress which they have made during the past six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot go to any area in the country without receiving widespread complaints of delay in dealing with pension cases.  Next to the Land Commission, probably the worst Department in the world to write to is the Department of Defence, if the complaint has got anything to do with an <Col N="1922" /> application for a military service pension or a disability pension.  Applicants merely get a printed acknowledgment, and there seems to be no limit to the number of these which the pensions boards are prepared to issue.  In the case of individual applications, if a Deputy writes urging special consideration because of the distressing circumstances connected with it, one in which the applicant is manifestly entitled to a pension, the Deputy merely gets a stereotyped reply that a child might write or issue.  If we are going to have a further 28,000 claims to be dealt with, it seems to me that on this day five years we will have some Minister for Defence telling this House that, owing to some unforeseen circumstances, the pensions boards are still functioning.  One hears nothing but complaint about the slothful manner in which these applications for pensions are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some rather unusual way of dealing with applications. I have had experience of some cases from my own constituency.  In one area you may find a little nest of people whose claims have been dealt with and pensions granted, while over the rest of the county you meet people who cannot get their applications heard at all.  In other cases I have received complaints from my own constituency and elsewhere concerning persons who were before the pensions board for examination two and three years ago and who have not yet received any decision on their claims.  Before the last general election, and the previous general election, quite a considerable number of people were invited to go before the pensions board for examination, but when the elections were over, and conveniently forgotten, many of them who thought, because of the elections, that they were sure to get a pension are still without pensions, notwithstanding their apparent temporary usefulness at the time to the Government. Will the Minister say if he intends to put any limit to the period of time which is going to be spent in the consideration of these claims?  Many of the applicants would prefer to know definitely where they stand.  They would prefer to be told definitely that <Col N="1923" /> they were not going to get pensions rather than be left in the position in which they do not know whether they will ever get one.  I had a blissfully innocent man coming to see me last week.  He felt that he had such a strong case for a pension that he was wondering whether with that prospect before him he could get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I think that even if he had a pension he would find it hard enough to get a loan from that body, but to imagine that he would be able to get a loan by mortgaging a prospective pension from the Department of Defence indicated that the man had more courage than sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and a simpleton, too.  Will the Minister say if there is going to be any greater expedition in dealing with these cases during the next 12 months than there has been during the past six years?  An examination of the Estimates would seem to indicate that there will be, but the Minister, when speaking, did not give much information on that aspect of the matter.  For instance, on page 339, one finds the number of persons with pensions in the year 1939-40, and the number with pensions in the year 1940-41, with this footnote at the bottom:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Add:&mdash;For probable additional charges: £109,514.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that figure is for additional charges under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, because it is directly under the portion of the Estimate relating to that Act.  Does that mean that during the year 1940-41 we are going to spend, on additional pensions, £109,000 odd?  If we are, it seems to me to be rather extraordinary, because at present, while 4,576 persons in grade E rank are only costing £80,045, out of the total of 6,735, it seems to be anticipated that during the coming year there will probably be additional charges amounting to £109,000 odd.  How much of that is in <Col N="1924" /> respect of annual pensions, and how much of it is in respect of arrears which may be due to successful applicants for pensions during the next year?  I should like the Minister to give the House that information when replying.</P>
    <P>With Deputy Cosgrave I agree that the cost of administering this service is unreasonably high.  Many of the pensions to which the Minister referred are being paid since 1923 and 1924. While the total Vote for pensions is considerable, the sum involved in the payment of additional pensions is not very great, yet the administration of these additional amounts, and such investigation as is given, is apparently costing the State £20,000 a year.  I do not know what the cost has been during the past six years, but assuming that it has been £20,000 a year, it means that we have expended £120,000 alone on the administration of these pension schemes.  If, during the next three years, we are going to spend another £60,000, that will bring the total cost for the administration of our Army Pensions Acts to close on £200,000. That seems to be an unreasonably high figure.  The body responsible for progress of that kind cannot congratulate itself on the efficiency or speed of the administrative machine.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when replying, will tell us at what rate it is intended to deal with the cases now on appeal, at what rate it is hoped to dispose of the 19,000 cases which have not yet been dealt with, and, above all, what is the explanation for the delay in giving a decision in the case of persons who were brought before the board for examination two and three years ago.  Surely at this time it ought to be possible to tell these people what the decision is in their cases.  That kind of delay is unreasonable and inexcusable.  As we have two Ministers looking after defence now, one being employed whole-time on purely defence work, the other surely ought to make an examination of the administration of these Acts and be asked to put some life into the pensions boards which are, apparently, dead, judging by the slow rate of progress which they have been making during the past six years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Vote, and what I have to say on it I am saying in the capacity of the mouthpiece for very many others, most of whom have been active and violent opponents of mine since I came into public life.  Together with my colleagues in the Labour Party and the Government Party, my main complaint for the past year is the greatly swollen post I have had from disappointed, weary, impatient applicants for pensions, who for five long weary years have been daily expecting to have a ruling on their claim, either giving them a pension or refusing them a pension.  I have attended meetings here and there in the two counties I represent, and the atmosphere at every meeting was, to say the least of it, heated.  If anyone were to come in here and enumerate the cases that are trotted out at such meetings and accept the statements made as being accurate, then I think all the Deputies in this House would join together in condemning the administration of these particular Acts.</P>
      <P>I asked the previous Minister for Defence some years ago how were cases selected, how was it decided what cases would be taken first and what cases would be taken last, and he replied to me that certain applicants automatically ruled themselves out or were doubtful cases, that others appeared straight away to have a <i>prima facie</i> case, and that the latter class were dealt with first.  That was a perfectly reasonable explanation if accurate. Since then I have moved around very much amongst applicants, applicants who live in the same parish or the same county, who made their applications on the same date many years ago, whose services were equal, engagement for engagement, and I found that one man got his assessment long ago and the other man can get nothing but the official card which Deputy Norton referred to.  The only difference between the two was that one was politically important or politically influential or had influential political friends, and the other was an humble soldier, equally as good as a soldier and equally active, participating in the same engagements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1926" /> I am making no charge against any individual.  We all know that in any Government service in the world the weight of influence can bring one case up earlier than another.  What is the point in saying that that is not so? The most impressive kind of statement I have listened to from people I believe to be truthful is the statement of the man who tells me: &ldquo;Here am I and there is my neighbour.  We filled up our papers together the same evening, engagement for engagement.  We were in the same company right along during the old Volunteer days and rendered the same active service.  The papers were passed to the brigade representative on the same day and they were passed by the brigade representative to the Department on the same day.  He got his pension some years ago; I have heard nothing since.&rdquo;  The same service, the same engagements, same official approaches made, applications made on the same day; one case adjudicated upon in 1936; nothing heard of the other case in 1940.  In practically every such case which I and others investigate we find a purely political importance attaching to one and the same political importance not attaching to the other.  We had an outstanding case before the High Court recently&mdash;rather an important case&mdash; and I would say a case that was a fair example of what is happening to thousands of humble individuals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I opposed the Act of 1934 when it was introduced.  I opposed, and still oppose, the principle of a State granting a pension to any individual for a period of activity against the State. We established a principle that will be the curse of this country in the future. The men who laid the mine in Dublin Castle last night are as much entitled to a pension from a subsequent Parliament as anybody, at any time, for activities against the Parliament elected by the people.  Like any reasonably-minded Deputy, since the day the Act became law in spite of my views, I have pleaded for the full entitlement of every applicant under the law, but I fear that there is discriminating attention being given.  We have read the list of people in our own <Col N="1927" /> constituencies who have pensions.  The names are given, as is customary, without addresses.  We can know the individuals in our own constituencies, even without the addresses, because of their political prominence.  But in each of these counties there are 3,000, 4,000, 6,000 or 7,000 applicants, be the number as it may, more humble, less prominent, and still waiting.</P>
    <P>I have been told that there are cases where the applications were filled in the same house on the same evening, forwarded the same day, similar engagements right along the line, similar length of service, similar hardships, where one man has got a pension and another has not.  I asked for details of that sort.  I was given them verbally.  I asked for them in writing and I asked if the person in receipt of a pension was agreeable to come along and make a statement confirming the story of the other that their services were similar.  I have been told verbally that such will be forthcoming. I do not want to refer to it further, but when I get the documents the Minister will get them.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that there is very little faith, confidence, or trust in Ministerial estimates.  Three years ago from this bench I listened to a Minister opposite telling me that the work would be finished in a few short years, that arrangements had been made for expediting the whole thing and that the rate of progress in future would be three times as great as the rate prior to that.</P>
    <P>Here we find that steady rate year after year.  Did it ever strike the Minister that, human nature being what it is, if a man is in a good job and has only that good job as long as he can stretch it out, the work is going to become very elastic?  If there is not some driving force behind it, the rate of progress is going to be very slow. That would not matter if applicants with good claims were not dying day after day in the ordinary course of events.  Delay would not matter if none of those who applied five or six years ago were destitute, but if even a percentage <Col N="1928" /> is destitute, and worse than that, destitute with families, then imagine what these six years' delay in giving them what they are justly entitled to in law means.</P>
    <P>You can do a lot of things retrospectively, but you cannot give a man a dinner retrospectively.  I remember a quarter-master in the army many years ago, who was so efficient in the red-tape sense that he turned up monthly to a post with the rations.  He served rations for 30 days to hungry troops, and when they swore at him, he looked quite mystified and puzzled.  He asked them what they had to complain about, and if they had not the 30 days rations.  He was going to feed them for 30 days back.  That cannot be done with food.  You cannot give a man last week's dinner to-day.  You can give it in kind or in cash, but the delay serves to be provocative.  The type of replies people I am referring to get is adding to the provocation.  Some serious attempt has got to be made to expedite the work.  We are told that about 28,000 cases have been provisionally refused, 7,039 cases granted, some 20,000 cases outstanding, and 9,000 appeals.  Of the 28,000 cases refused or provisionally rejected, I would be inclined to say, on a rough-and-ready estimate, that 50 per cent of these rule themselves out on their face, as people who had applied and were rejected under previous Acts, that never had the type of service referred to, and that any pay clerk would push on one side.</P>
    <P>When you make allowance for these, the number of claims dealt with is about half the gross figure given by the Minister.  That is five years' work, during which the Minister and his predecessor told us the staffs were working overtime.  We have still 20,000 cases outstanding, and something like 9,000 appeals.  If the rate of progress maintained so far continues, and if that satisfies the Minister year after year, we will have those cases dealt with, I reckon, in from 14 to 20 years after the men applied.  Say that a man has a genuine case, that he went through hardship, imprisonment and, perhaps, a hunger strike, 20 years after there is <Col N="1929" /> a ruling on his claim, but the decision can be written on his tombstone.</P>
    <P>I want to get the Minister and his mind away from figures and files.  I want him to think of the human living thing, that is watching the postman every morning for an answer to a claim lodged, we will say, in 1935, and to whom everybody he met periodically in the past five years said: &ldquo;Oh, we will ring up the Department and see that your case is seen to.&rdquo;  These individuals do their best, as promised, but the case still remains one of the 20,000 down the line, possibly to be dealt with within the next five, ten or twelve years.  Is that fair to old comrades of any of us?  Is it fair to a man who was with us or against us?  Is it fair to anybody entitled to have a ruling on a claim?  That is all these people want &mdash;a ruling.  I did not hear any big grouse from people whose claims were rejected, but I heard a very general grouse about not getting any reply.  I heard criticism, and I subscribe to it, of the interpretation put on the phrase, &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  I was told that &ldquo;active service&rdquo; was being boiled down to pulling the trigger of a gun. It was no military man made that ruling.  It was no man with a military mind that made that ruling.  Every man who had a half-an-hour's military experience knows that it is not for the soldier to select his job, that it is for the officer to allocate the job to the soldier, and that the job of the man standing by idle, waiting for a casualty, or carrying a casualty, might be more nerve-racking than the man in the heat of the fight; that the man who was a watch-out scout or a signaller or a stretcher-bearer has just as much an active service job as the fellow pulling the trigger of the rifle.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the interpretation is as narrow as I am putting it, that a man must actually have been a fighting man, and in a fight, and that nobody else is pensionable.  These were the statements made to me.  Will the Minister name an army pensions scheme applicable to any army in the civilised world, where the interpretation is so narrow, and shows such a lack of appreciation of military facts? Who made that interpretation?  That <Col N="1930" /> was not the interpretation put on the Act by Dáil Eireann; that was not the interpretation put on the same words in the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  Was there a change of interpreters? If so, who is the interpreter? If the interpretation is a just one, and if it is being uniformly applied, and has been consistently applied in a similar way in both Acts, then I have no grievance.  I am merely the mouthpiece for cases stated to me. I have not been close up to the machine, and have not been inside the machine administering these Acts. These were the points put to me.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I ask the Minister to consider.  I raised it repeatedly, and sometimes got a kind of half agreement that it would be looked into.  We have men under all our Pensions Acts, the Military Pensions Act, 1924, the Army Pensions scheme, and the Military Pensions Act, 1934, getting pensions as low as 3/- and 4/- a week&mdash;£5 a year, £6 a year or £8 a year.  These pensions are only a weight pulling these men down.  If the man is out of work, his unemployment assistance is reduced by the 3/- or 4/- a week; he gets nothing as a result of his service.  In other countries, men with very small pensions are allowed to commute them&mdash;to cash them at the Department of Defence. Men with larger pensions are allowed to commute down to a certain figure. We have a precedent in our own Department of Defence&mdash;a precedent that was raised at Geneva.  In the first Pensions Bill prepared in the Department of Defence and approved by the Dáil when everyone was young, keen and enthusiastic and when obstacles were there only to be removed, not to be shied at, the case of the small pension was dealt with.  You pensioned for a degree of disability down to 20 per cent.  For anything less than that a lump sum was given under that Act instead of contemptible pensions of 2/6 a week which are no good to anybody.</P>
    <P>That was the precedent established by the first Irish Department of Defence in its first pensions scheme. Why has that been departed from? Why have you people drawing pensions <Col N="1931" /> of 2/6 a week?  These pensions will neither break them nor make them. When out of work, these pensions merely mean a saving to the unemployment assistance funds.  If the men got a lump-sum instead&mdash;the price of a hackney car, sufficient to take a piece of land for a year or two, the price of a few pigs or calves&mdash;they might be able to launch themselves into something worth while.</P>
    <P>The legal facility for commuting pensions does not in any country confer the right to commute pensions.  Pensions can only be commuted in any country subject to the sanction of the Minister.  If he is dealing with a wastrel, with a man who will cash in his pension and leave his family in the ditch, sanction to commutation would never be forthcoming from any responsible Department.  But where the individual is able to go to the responsible Department and say: &ldquo;I have a chance of making good either at home or abroad if I can get a lump-sum amounting, say, to five years of my pension. I have a chance of going into partnership or buying a bit of land, or joining a brother in Australia&rdquo;&mdash;where a reasonable case is put up, and where a man is reported as reliable, we should provide legal machinery for commuting these pensions, the issue of which is merely causing administrative trouble, worry and cost.  It costs as much to send a pension to the fellow who is getting 2/- a week as it does to administer the pension of the man who is getting £300 a year.  Why not save at both ends?  Why not give the men a chance?  Why not follow the precedent established in a previous Pensions Act&mdash;a precedent established years ago in every other Defence Department dealing with military pensions?</P>

      <P>If the figures supplied to the House to-night, with the information given by the Minister in his statement, represent the facts, then, in my opinion, there is a very good case for the setting up of a court of inquiry or a select committee&mdash;if there were a free vote of the House&mdash;to investigate the administration of the Act of 1934.  The <Col N="1932" /> figures given by the Minister to-night, when related to similar figures supplied to me on the 8th November last, are very interesting.  On the 8th November, in reply to a question, I was informed that the number of applications for pensions under the 1934 Act was 59,780; that the number of applicants interviewed up to the 31st October, 1939, was 15,756; that the number of pensions sanctioned was 6,985; and the number of applications rejected, 3,790.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that, in the intervening five months the number of additional favourable reports made was as low as 54.  The number of pensions sanctioned up to the 31st October, 1939, was 6,985, and the figure supplied by the Minister to-night was 7,039, which shows that only 54 additional favourable reports were made in the intervening period.  The number of applications rejected within the same period was 24,819.  That will be very interesting information for the people who have been waiting five and a half years to hear the verdict of the board set up to deal with their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 24,819 applications rejected in the intervening period of five months, the Minister tells us that there will likely be about 9,000 appeals.  I ask the Minister for information as to the number of claims already heard by the Service Pensions Board and deferred, and which are still awaiting a decision. I am aware that some applicants attended before the Pensions Board in 1936, 1937 and 1938, and that they are still awaiting a decision consequent on their interview with the board. According to the figure supplied to me by the Minister on the 8th November, 1939, there were 4,981 cases of persons who had attended before the board since the coming into operation of the Act.  From the figures supplied by the Minister to-night, there must be a large additional number of deferred cases.  The case I would make for inquiry into the administration of this Act would mainly centre round the inability or unwillingness of the Service Pensions Board and the responsible Minister&mdash;I am not sure which Minister is responsible in this <Col N="1933" /> matter&mdash;to deal with the claims of genuine applicants called before them as far back as 1936, 1937 and 1938.  I do not want to go into individual cases in a discussion on the Estimate.  But if I cannot get in the near future definite replies to representations which I have made repeatedly in writing, I will decorate the Order Paper with questions, as I am entitled to do, regarding these cases.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to raise individual cases in this House, but I do not like doing so.  I have received assurances from the Minister's predecessor here in this House, and the assurances were confirmed in writing&mdash;Deputy Norton received the same assurances in reply to questions addressed to the previous Minister in the House&mdash;that the cases of needy, genuine applicants would receive preference, so far as the Pensions Board could give a preference, in deciding such cases.  I have repeatedly written to the Minister for Defence during the last three years about the case of a casual road worker who was interviewed by the board in 1937, a man who gets only a couple of months work in the year from the local authority in my constituency, a man with a wife and eight children.  It appears to be impossible for the powers that be to come to a decision in that man's case.  I have written to the Minister also about the case of a man who has admitted 1916 service and who had to leave this country to look for a living in another land.  He is there at the present time, but he cannot get a decision on his case although it was before the board in 1938.  He has a letter from a colleague of the Minister for Defence admitting that the service during 1916 period is in order.  Other service rendered subsequent to 1916 in another part of the country cannot be confirmed because the persons who were named in the application form have since died.  I press the Minister to say that even if the board cannot admit the service that man rendered in another part of the country at a particular period, simply because the witnesses are dead, surely they can decide the case on the evidence admitted and give the man the right to appeal?  He <Col N="1934" /> has a right of appeal, although I am informed that when that man interviewed a certain official he was told he had no such right.  At least he told me that he was informed that he had not that right, but I am not prepared to admit it.</P>
    <P>I have also written to the Department of Defence about the claim of a constituent of mine who died before he was called before the board and who, in the opinion of the local officers of the brigade with which he was associated, had a genuine claim for a military service pension.  His widow wrote to me from a sanatorium where she is at the present time.  There are 11 orphans.  I am not saying that they are all absolutely dependent on whatever income goes into that house.  Two or three of them are working at present but in any case it is an application that is deserving of consideration. Having regard to the fact that the dependants of the applicant are in needy circumstances, it is a case that should be decided before cases of applicants who are members of the Oireachtas.  I have information in my possession and other Deputies are also in possession of the same information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am referring to a list giving the names of members of the Oireachtas who are in receipt of military service or other pensions from the State.  There are 30 members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Oireachtas drawing fairly decent pensions.  Why should they decide to press their own claims for pensions before pressing the claims of deserving applicants such as I have mentioned and whose claims were promised prior consideration by the previous Minister?  As I say, I do not like going into individual cases but there are many sad cases that could be cited here.  Deputy O'Higgins has access to information of the same kind relating to applications from the constituency which he and I have the honour to represent.  I should be quite satisfied if these were disposed of one way or another.  The majority of the men <Col N="1935" /> who made applications under the 1934 Act were not supporters of mine, and for a good reason&mdash;because they were promised by other persons that if they voted for the Fianna Fáil Party they would get the pensions which they had applied for.</P>
      <P>Out of the 7,039 cases that have been already decided, about 130 are those of persons residing in the constituency which I have the honour to represent. Eighty-two of them have been granted pensions of less than 10/- and, as Deputy O'Higgins has stated, some of the pensions are as low as £5 16s. 8d. a year.  As Deputy O'Higgins stated, the fact that they are in receipt of such a pension is used against successful applicants who may have to look for work at some period of the year or in cases where they have to apply for unemployment assistance.  The small pensions which they are receiving are taken into account in connection with the means test and operates to reduce the sum that they would otherwise receive by way of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question some time ago, I was supplied with information as to the cost of administering this measure and I can say that the figure quoted by Deputy Norton, taken in conjunction with the statement made by the Minister, is approximately correct.  If it takes three years more to carry on the present &ldquo;codology&rdquo; which characterises the method of dealing with military service pensions, it will cost the State about £160,000 before these cases are finally disposed of.  That is a nice sum to look forward to finding. Deputies are constantly pressing the Government for grants for minor relief works and for grants for the provision of work for the unemployed and they find they cannot get any hearing simply because they are told that the burden would be too heavy if the grants for relief works were increased in the various areas.  I have frequently made applications for the carrying out of minor relief schemes.  I have been told that there is only a certain limited sum available for that very desirable purpose and that it cannot be exceeded <Col N="1936" /> but apparently there is no limit to the amount of money that can be squandered in connection with the administration of this Act, or apparently no time limit is fixed for the determination of applications made under the Act.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by Deputy O'Higgins that this Act has been administered in a partisan and Party-minded manner, because it is quite evident that the applications of those who receive prior consideration are applications of persons who are more closely associated with the Government and the Government Party in the country.  If there is any proof required in support of that statement it can be found in the return of the names of those who have been granted pensions, several of whom are members of the Dáil and Seanad. There are at present 36 persons, members of the Dáil and Seanad, receiving pensions.  Thirty of them are members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the other six are members of the Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say whether the change in the chairmanship of the board and in the membership of the board, inside the period of five and a half years, has anything to do with the dilatory manner in which these pension applications have been dealt with? The Minister knows better than anybody else that some of the people responsible for administering this Pensions Act were anything but sympathetic to the fight for independence which went on in this country in pre-Truce times.  I am saying no more than that, but that is a fact and the Minister cannot deny it.  Can that be taken as a reason for the dilatory manner in which these claims are being disposed of, and particularly for the manner in which the deferred cases are being still further deferred?</P>
    <P>Referring again to the cases which have been heard by the board and deferred over a long period, does it not stand to reason that the longer you defer a decision in connection with these cases the more difficult it becomes to come to a final decision? Some of the applicants who have appeared before the board as far back <Col N="1937" /> as 1936, 1937 and 1938 have in some cases, given as witnesses in support of their applications the names of persons who have died in recent times. The longer the delay in coming to a decision in connection with cases still outstanding, I suppose, the more witnesses will disappear from the face of this earth and the less chance there will be in the long run of the cases of these deferred applicants being finally disposed of to the satisfaction of the applicants.</P>
    <P>I have heard here during the past couple of weeks a good deal of comment and questions addressed to the Minister regarding the activities of the present Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures&mdash;and the co-ordination, I suppose, of everything else associated with the Government&mdash;does not appear to have a full-time job.  It was part of his job, at any rate, to introduce and pass through the House the measure we are now criticising, and I suggest that, if he has not got full-time employment, there is no better job which could be given to him than to set him aside fully, and for whatever period is required, to inquire into the dilatory and unsatisfactory administration of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934. If the Government is sincerely anxious to dispose of the claims made under that Act for the payment of pensions, inside a fairly reasonable period, they should get some person who understands the intentions of the Government in regard to this particular Act and who has some knowledge of its administration over a certain period, to hurry up the administration and speed up decisions on deferred and other outstanding cases.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in my constituency, when some applicants have spoken to some of my Fianna Fáil colleagues on recent occasions regarding this, they were told: &ldquo;If you had left your case to us, it would have been disposed of long ago.  Why did you hand it over to Davin and O'Higgins? That is making it almost certain that you are not going to have a pension decided in your favour.&rdquo;  I call upon <Col N="1938" /> the Minister to give decisions&mdash;favourable or otherwise&mdash;in these deferred cases, especially in the cases outstanding since 1936, 1937 and 1938, and let the credit for giving the pensions go to anybody he likes.</P>
    <P>My post-bag in recent times, like the post-bag of other Deputies&mdash;members of the Opposition, particularly&mdash;has been considerably increased on account of the dissatisfaction&mdash;genuine dissatisfaction&mdash;which exists throughout the country owing to the failure of the Department to give decisions within a reasonable period in connection with claims made under the 1934 Act.  As I said, I do not care who gets the credit for the decisions, so long as the decisions are given within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister will get up at the conclusion of this debate and say that he is fully satisfied, when&mdash;inside a period of five and a half years&mdash;less than half the applications have been dealt with?  He did not give the number of applicants who have appeared before the board up to the 31st March.  Would he please give that information in his reply?  He gave me information on the 8th November, 1939, to the effect that 15,756 persons out of 59,780 applicants had then appeared before the board.  From the figures given here this evening, it looks as if a number of persons whose claims have been turned down were not given an opportunity to appear and be heard before the board.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say, on that point, whether the applicant has a right to obtain an interview with the board, or whether the Minister and the board reserve power under the Act to decline to grant an interview to an applicant for any stated reason, or if it is a fact that an applicant who has appeared before the board and whose case has still to be decided upon, will not have the right to appeal in the future?  I contend that any applicant who has appeared before the board and received an unsatisfactory decision, even though it may have been a decision granting a certain amount, still has <Col N="1939" /> the right to appear before the board and appeal.</P>

      <P>A case has been brought to my notice recently of an unemployed man living in the city who received an award on the 13th December, 1937, stating that he was entitled to a pension on the basis of two and one-thirty-sixth years.  He appealed against that decision at the end of December, and has not been called before the board, nor has he heard a word other than the usual polite printed acknowledgment form which has been sent to such persons by the Military Service Pensions Board.  I made representations during the past couple of months to the Department about that case, as the man concerned is unemployed.  It cannot be denied that he is a genuine applicant, as he has already been granted service recognition for a certain period.  He is out of work and, therefore, can be regarded as a necessitous case.</P>
      <P>Why is it that persons of that type are not granted a re-hearing by the board, seeing that, in this case at any rate, the person concerned appealed against the previous decision as far back as December, 1937?  There is something radically wrong with the way these deferred claims are being disposed of.  There is there, if nowhere else, a case for inquiry by the Minister for Defence, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence&mdash;certainly, by somebody who is sincerely anxious to see that the wishes and intentions of the Government responsible for the passage of the 1934 Act are properly and legally administered.</P>

      <P>I would like that the long-drawn-out agony which a large number of people endure in this way for pensions could be shortened by some method.  I do not think that ought to be beyond the power of the Minister and the Department of Defence. Even if it involved extra cost, I think it would be worth it, to be able <Col N="1940" /> to indicate a date&mdash;within a reasonably short time&mdash;when most of the claims would be disposed of.  One ought to be struck by a statement made in the courts recently by a responsible member of the Judiciary that, at the present rate of progress, it is reasonable to think that decisions would be given in cases after the people had died, or, rather, that the death of a number of people would finally determine their claims.  I trust that the rather grim prophecy of Deputy O'Higgins, that the decisions will finally be inscribed on the tombstones of the applicants in a large number of cases, will not be realised.  I think it reasonable to suppose that, by the time the decisions are likely to materialise in a number of cases, the applicants will be actively pressing their claims for the old age pension.</P>
      <P>Judging by the ages of a number of people who, recently and for the last two or three years, have been making this pathetic trek to Dublin in order to urge their cases, one may well think that it is a very reasonable possibility. I have seen numbers of unfortunate men being summoned up from various parts of the country, even from the most remote parts of the country, in connection with these claims, and to anybody having any reasonable amount of common sense it is apparent that, in a large number of these cases, the hopes of securing a pension are extremely small.  Accordingly, one wonders why there should be all this raising of hopes which there is very little possibility of seeing realised when one knows the facts locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one sees all this raising of hopes that has been going on for the last few years in this connection, one is driven to give some consideration to the viewpoint that there is a method in all this business.  From the shadows of the past I can recall two or three astonishing coincidences having taken place&mdash;two in 1937 and 1938.  There was a very extraordinary coincidence on each occasion, and that was that gatherings to which I am now referring took place two or three weeks before the election.  I remember, in the town that I live in, seeing on one such occasion this trek from the hills and <Col N="1941" /> valleys into the town by people of all ages and different sexes, and in all kinds of conveyances, to a meeting that was called to take place in the town hall.</P>
    <P>A certain gentleman connected with a certain organisation, not connected with this House, and to which I do not wish to refer, went into long and detailed particulars of the claims of the various people, and these people were promised that, in a very short time after the election their cases would be decided.  I understand that at a final stage of the meeting there was a declaration that, of course, the meeting was entirely non-political but that the most effective way to secure satisfaction in connection with these military service pension claims was to vote and actively work for the Fianna Fáil candidates in the coming election. I know that most of the men concerned, and practically none of the women concerned, have heard very little about their claims since then, and I sincerely hope that it will not be necessary to recall this meeting or convention if we should have a general election before these cases are finally decided.</P>
    <P>There is a lot that seems to be suspicious and somewhat sordid in connection with this whole business.  We hear of the kind of sordid intrigue that has gone on through the country in connection with claims for rank&mdash; claims that are said to be fictitious in many cases, for a certain rank, when it is locally known that the decisions that have been come to in many cases of that kind could not be justified. However, I am not trying to arraign the Minister on that particular matter and I should like to make it perfectly clear that my own view about the Minister who is in charge of this Department at present, and the impression that he has made on me, and I believe, on my colleagues, is that he is an honest man trying to do his duty honestly.</P>
    <P>I acquit him entirely of anything of the sort to which I have referred, but I must certainly say that, in a good many cases, certain people have used this Act for political purposes and in <Col N="1942" /> order to propagate the view that people outside one particular Party ought to have no right to advocate the claims of people who are looking forward to military service pensions for services rendered according to the terms of this Act.  It is significant also that in large numbers of cases the applications of men who were officers in the past, or who claimed to be officers, have been decided, but the bulk of the outstanding claims consists of that humble but rather numerous section of the population who gave freely all that they had to give at a time when position did not count as much as sincerity of purpose and honesty of ideal.</P>
    <P>I trust that it is not beyond the power of the Minister to shorten this earthly purgatory for a large number of people.  I did not meet a case such as that suggested by Deputy Norton, but I know of a number of cases of people who have gone to the local bank manager to ask for an advance in the hope of hearing satisfying news about their pension claims coming along in a few weeks, and I am afraid that these people are going to be disillusioned.  I think there is very little hope of securing an advance on an asset of that doubtful kind, and very little hope, in some cases, of getting a pension at all.  I think that these people should be told definitely the position in regard to their cases, and I would urgently press on the Minister to take some steps to speed up the operation of this Act and to endeavour to have the whole matter finally disposed of at a very much earlier period than has been indicated here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">

      <P>I regretted to hear Deputy Murphy insinuating that pensions had been obtained under false pretences or, in other words, that men obtained military service pensions for a rank to which they were not entitled. As far as I am aware, the majority of the men&mdash;down our way, in any case&mdash; who claimed rank were entitled to that rank.  There may be claims made by men who did not hold rank in the first period, but who subsequently held rank, and that happened simply because <Col N="1943" /> men who were formerly in charge of units were interned, and I submit that men who were claiming rank in either case were entitled to make these claims under the terms of the Act. Accordingly, I regretted to hear Deputy Murphy making a sweeping statement suggesting that large numbers of men claimed rank under the present system who were not entitled to that rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have various grievances put forward in reference to the working of this Act and the working of the board in connection with their idea of active service, and I agree entirely and <Col N="1944" /> wholeheartedly with the statement of Deputy O'Higgins when he said that this interpretation of active service was not the interpretation intended or approved of by the Dáil when giving its approval to the Military Service Pensions Act of 1934.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again on Tuesday next.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Tuesday, 30th April, 1940, at 3 p.m.</P>
