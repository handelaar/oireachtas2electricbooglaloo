      <P>Section 6 of the Dáil Éireann Loans and Funds (Amendment) Act, 1933, fixed the 31st March, 1934, as the closing date for making claims for repayment of subscriptions to the Dáil Éireann Loan (Internal), 1919-20.  Some claims were received after that date and, as suggested in the question, there may still be subscribers who did not make any claims for repayment.  In view of the provisions of the Act, it is not open to me to entertain any claim presented after the 31st March, 1934.</P>

      <P>The producer's price of flour is fixed on a f.o.r. basis and includes a provision for cartage from mill to rail.  It would be contrary to established practice to disclose details of the items making up this price.  I am not aware that it is the general practice of millers to charge f.o.r. prices to purchasers taking delivery of flour at mill, but if particulars of any cases of this nature are forwarded to my Department, they will be investigated.  I am not prepared to adopt the suggestion in the last part of the question, but I am considering whether the price of this commodity should continue to be fixed on a f.o.r. basis.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £47,150 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1941, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí eile a bhaineann le Fóirleatha Nea-shrangach (Uimh. 45 de 1926).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £47,150 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will some in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1941, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of the Estimate for the Broadcasting Service for the financial <Col N="2114" /> year 1940-41 is £70,650.  There is an increase of £1,347 on the provision for last year.  The gross increase is £4,482, of which £1,722 is in respect of salaries, etc.  Sub-head A is due mainly to additional bonus payments arising out of the higher cost-of-living figure and to the fact that provision is made this year for payment of the director's salary, which in recent years has been paid out of the Vote for the Department of External Affairs.  In relation to the latter, I might explain that, when the Estimate was prepared several months ago, it was expected that the secondment of the present director would terminate early this year, and it was necessary to make specific provision in the Broadcasting Vote for the salary of his successor.  No date for the change has, however, so far been fixed.</P>
    <P>Programme costs (sub-head B) show an increase of £2,460, mainly due to additional provision for artists' fees and to increased payments in respect of performing right fees.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £300 under sub-head E in respect of expenditure on electric light, power, etc.</P>
    <P>Against these increases there are offsetting reductions under other subheads, mainly a decrease of £2,960 under sub-head F, due to less provision for apparatus being necessary.</P>
    <P>The revenue of the service for the financial year 1939-40 amounted to approximately £123,000.  The total expenditure out of all Votes is estimated at £90,250.  The revenue for the year thus shows a surplus over expenditure of approximately £32,750.  Over the entire period since the Irish Broadcasting Service was established there has, however, been a considerable net deficit on the service.</P>
    <P>Additional time up to a maximum of one hour a day was made available in October last for the broadcast of sponsored programmes confined to the advertisement of Irish enterprises. Two companies availed themselves at the outset of the opportunity to broadcast. Strong and unexpected opposition to the scheme, organised mainly <Col N="2115" /> by the Irish newspapers, who were apprehensive of possible adverse effects on their advertising revenue, manifested itself and, in consequence, I considered it advisable to give instructions that, pending further examination of the whole sponsored programme position by the Government, no further commitments should be entered into.  Contracts which had already been arranged could not, of course, be disturbed, and they will accordingly operate for at least their normal period.  Whether it will be possible to extend them will depend upon the Government's attitude upon the sponsored programme question generally.  A decision may not be taken for some months to come.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting revenue for the current year was originally estimated at £121,500, made up of £90,500 from licence fees and £31,000 from advertisements and miscellaneous receipts. This estimate assumed that the sponsored programmes of Irish Hospitals' Trust Limited would continue throughout the year and that the other advertisement programmes would operate until at least the 30th September next. The programmes of the Hospitals' Trust and of one of the other advertisers ceased, however, on the 31st March and, as a result, so far as can reasonably be judged at present, broadcasting revenue for the current year will amount to approximately £100,000, or £23,000 less than the receipts for last year.</P>
    <P>Licence holders continue to increase in number at a satisfactory rate. There were 169,697 licences in existence at the end of last month, the increase in the 12 months being approximately 15,600.  I regret, however, that special measures towards defaulters have still to be taken and that the Department is put to a good deal of unnecessary trouble and expense in this connection.  There were no less than 730 prosecutions last year, convictions being obtained in practically all cases and penalties in a very large number.  It is regrettable that threats of prosecution, and even actual proceedings should be necessary to compel <Col N="2116" /> owners of receiving sets to comply with a statutory obligation.  I would make a special appeal to persons who are now in default in this matter to take out or renew their licences without further delay.  By doing so, they will obviate material difficulty for the Department and needless expense for themselves.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Broadcasting Service is to provide listeners with entertaining and cultural programmes of high standard and variety consistent with the resources available.  Every possible effort is made in this direction and also to ensure that the programmes are competently presented. During the past few years important additions to staff and equipment have been made and, recently, dramatic control and amplifier apparatus of the most modern type has been installed. It has also been decided to acquire special receiving apparatus of powerful type which will enable musical programmes from European countries to be relayed.  Last year various features of special interest were introduced, e.g., competitions for original radio plays in Irish and in English, a new verse competition for which more than 2,000 entries were received, and problem plays to be solved by listeners.  Competition programmes, such as Question Time, in Irish and in English, are popular; and in last year's programmes the main aim of the Irish competitions was to demonstrate the phonetic beauty of the language and to train speakers in clear and correct pronunciation.</P>
    <P>A public symphony concert was given at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, in October last.  The concert, which was staged on a more ambitious scale than previously, was conducted by Sir Hamilton Harty and proved very successful. On account of the emergency it was not considered expedient to arrange for more than one such fixture in the 1939-40 season, but it is hoped that it may be feasible to give further symphony concerts in public during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Irish language is used to an increasing extent in the programmes.  In <Col N="2117" /> the plays, competition-adjudications, discussions and talks, native speakers are engaged as far as possible.  The nightly Irish News Bulletin is now given at a more suitable listening time &mdash;10 p.m.; and, in addition, a survey of the past week's news is broadcast in Irish every Sunday.  The extended use of Irish music is being encouraged and new arrangements of the collected melodies are being added to the music library.  The time, 10.30 p.m. to 11 p.m., each night is devoted mainly to the specially arranged broadcasts of Irish music.  There is a scarcity of Irish music, orchestrated and arranged, and I hope that Irish composers will extend their efforts to meet the demands of the Irish Broadcasting Service.</P>
    <P>The broadcasts to schools continue to develop and there are now about 750 schools taking these programmes as against 700 last year.</P>
    <P>Serious interference with the transmissions from Athlone has been experienced for some time past but, as a result of representations through diplomatic channels, the administration in control of the station principally offending has changed the wavelength and the position has materially improved in the last few months.  A degree of interference by another station or stations was, however, also being experienced until quite recently. The matter is being taken up by the responsible authorities.  As the outcome of an international broadcasting conference held at Montreux, Switzerland, last year, a new medium wavelength was allocated to Athlone which would have resulted in a minimum of interference, but, unfortunately, owing to the international situation, the bringing into operation of the wavelength plan decided upon at the conference has had to be postponed.</P>
    <P>Conditions arising out of the war have also seriously affected the transmissions from the short-wave station experimentally installed at Athlone last year.  Prior to the outbreak of hostilities the transmissions were reasonably up to expectations, as was evidenced by numerous reports <Col N="2118" /> received from abroad, and technical data of a very useful character, which would be of considerable value in connection with the setting up of a high-power short-wave station, if such were decided on, were being obtained. The situation has, however, seriously altered, and reports lately obtained show that the short-wave programmes from Athlone are not now being received at all reliably in distant parts. The question of possible remedies for the existing unsatisfactory condition of affairs as regards the short-wave transmissions is receiving special attention. As, however, short-wave stations of belligerent, and even non-belligerent countries have latterly been working, for news or propaganda purposes, at full strength and on many wavelengths, using highly directional aerial systems for different parts of the world, it will be appreciated that a solution of the difficulties experienced at Athlone is not likely to be readily forthcoming in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>With a view to ascertaining the tastes of listeners in regard to the various types of programmes broadcast, a questionnaire was issued in April last to about 2,700 licence holders in selected areas.  As, however, only about 11 per cent. of those who were circularised replied, the opinions expressed were not particularly helpful. Judging, however, from numerous communications received daily from listeners, both in Ireland and outside, the programmes of Radio Eireann are regarded generally as a source of considerable interest and enjoyment and the various new features which are incorporated from time to time are much appreciated.  Personally I regard the programmes, taken all round, as good and I may say that I am giving considerable attention to the service. There are, of course, weak spots, but this is inevitable in any broadcasting service.  The afternoon sponsored programmes are a case in point.  They seem to me at times to be framed on an unnecessarily poor level and while advertisers naturally desire to cater for the tastes, or what they believe to be the tastes, of those whose ears they are concerned to reach, I do think <Col N="2119" /> that, without going to the other extreme and becoming too highbrow, it should be possible to ensure a better standard throughout.  The director and I have recently had discussions with some of the advertisers in the afternoon sponsored hour and as a result I think I can say that there is likely to be improvement in the near future.  I can assure the House that it is my constant aim and aim of the directorate to raise the programmes all round to a high and yet popular standard consistent with our resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a few questions with regard to the staff.  I find that a sum of £31,000 is estimated for the current year in receipts from advertisements, etc. Would the Minister say if that sum corresponds to the amount that was received in former years from the Sweeps programme?  I would also like to hear from him what the prospects are for the coming year with regard to the taking out of additional licences. As regards staff, I find there is a musical director, a production manager, a studio control officer, a talks officer, three announcers, and one news correspondent.  That is, substantially, the body of staff that deals with the general public.  Would the Minister say if all, or any, of these officers, before appointment, were subjected to tests with regard to their knowledge of Irish?  Were certain members of this staff known to be experts in their knowledge of the Irish language prior to appointment, and, if so, are their duties confined to dealing with Irish programmes?  Is the musical director an English scholar as well as an Irish scholar?  I take it that the duties of the production manager are concerned with arranging the programmes that are broadcast each day.  Is the talks officer equally proficient in the Irish and English languages, and is he as competent to give talks in Irish as he is in English?  Are all, or any, of the three announcers expert Irish scholars? Generally, with regard to the personnel, does the Irish language get an equal opportunity with the English language?  I take it that the duty of <Col N="2120" /> the news correspondent is to edit the general news that comes into the station.  Is he equally competent in the Irish and the English languages, and is he qualified to give Irish news in the best form?  I observe that &ldquo;licence fees (cash)&rdquo; are estimated to bring in £90,500.  Does the word &ldquo;cash&rdquo; in brackets mean that a certain amount of the licences is not represented by cash receipts?  These are the only matters I desire to refer to. I realise, of course, that the closing down of the Sweeps will mean a serious decrease on the revenue side. What does the Minister think the effect of that will be on the general income of the station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot agree with the Minister in his eulogy of Radio Eireann.  Since the inception of wireless broadcasting in Ireland, the station authorities have, in my opinion, been labouring under difficulties that ought not to be there.  What I mean by that is that there must be a Civil Service mentality hovering around the activities of the various officers of Radio Éireann.  Nobody will dispute that the men behind the scenes are civil servants.  I have no fault to find with civil servants in certain respects, but I have fault to find when it comes to a question of showmanship.  I believe that behind wireless broadcasting we should have people who are adepts in showmanship, and we have not got that.  I am speaking from experience.  I have had contact with the station since its inception, and I think that what is really required is an inquiry into the whole position of radio in this country.  Broadcasting first operated under the 1926 Act and, to my mind, the Act was out of date a year later.  I do ask the Minister seriously to consider setting up such an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect in which I am particularly interested and that is the question of performing rights fees and copyright fees.  I see that there is an increase of £2,460 in the sum allowed for daily programmes.  I particularly appeal to the Minister in this connection to take into consideration the question of copyright fees or performing <Col N="2121" /> rights fees for playwrights' work. To use a colloquialism, playwrights have got a raw deal from the radio authorities here since the inception of the station.  Recently I believe there has been some little improvement. But can anybody here believe that an author has got as little from the station as 10/6 as a performing rights fee for a play lasting half an hour?  That is true.  Some of them get a guinea, I believe; some recently got three guineas.  I do not want to make comparisons between the service here and the B.B.C.  I know it is a hard thing to do, because the revenue of the B.B.C. is enormous. But, when one considers that the B.B.C. can pay a fee of ten guineas for half an hour's performance, I think the very least that an author should receive from our native broadcasting service is three guineas.  I put that down as a conservative figure, but I believe he is entitled to that.</P>
    <P>We have a surplus of £32,750 on the service.  Surely the Minister should see his way to allot more than £2,460 for programme fees during the coming year.  As I said, I do not consider that the licence holders are getting a square deal from the station.  Personally, I listen in regularly and I do not think programmes are at all up to standard. A suggestion was made some few years ago by people competent to speak on this matter that a proper advisory board should be set up.  I put it to the Minister that he should keep that suggestion in mind and consider the setting up of such an advisory board. I am sorry to have to say these things, but that is what I feel about the broadcasting service, and I hope the Minister will bear my remarks in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to refer again to the complaints I am continuously receiving about the bad reception from Radio Eireann in the Wexford area.  I drew the attention of the Minister to this matter in the last couple of months and he was good enough to send an inspector down there.  I met the inspector when he came there and he did admit to me that in some parts of the town, at any rate, the reception was very bad.  I have been speaking to the Minister since that and I think <Col N="2122" /> he suggested that the inspector said that it was bad wireless sets in a great many cases that were responsible for that.  I do not think that there is any degree of truth in that, because English stations and German and other foreign stations can be got quite clearly, but Athlone is definitely bad; so bad indeed that a good number of people are talking about not paying their wireless licence fee this year.  Nobody wants to encourage that, of course.  I ask the Minister to try to have something done so far as reception in the Wexford area is concerned.  I should like to have from him the report of the inspector who visited the area recently.  On Sunday nights especially the reception is very bad.  A great number of people down there are interested in Question Time which comes on about 8.15 p.m. and it is absolutely impossible at that particular time to hear anything from the Athlone Station except a continuous din.  I drew the attention of the Minister and also of the inspector to the fact that Sunday night was the worst night of all for reception.</P>
      <P>In connection with Question Time, so far as one can see the Dublin area has a monopoly.  On a couple of occasions question time was held in places like Roscrea and Sligo.  I should like to know from the Minister if it would be possible to have a Question Time held in different parts of the country, what representations have to be made with a view to having that done, and, if representations are made to him, will the Minister see that other areas get their opportunity so far as Question Time is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to protest against the bad time kept by Radio Eireann.  I have in mind one particular item on the programme in which I am rather interested on Sunday nights, namely, the talk by Seán O Ceallacháin on Gaelic sports throughout the country. Although that is advertised on the <i>Radio News</i> and in the Press to take place at 10.20 on Sunday nights, very often when the news is finished at 10.15 or 10.17 or 10.18 this gentleman starts off.  I think that is very undesirable because a person may lose a lot in two or three minutes.  I do <Col N="2123" /> not know whose fault that is, but it has happened repeatedly.  It is an important feature of news.  It is looked forward to by various people all over the country who are interested in Gaelic football and hurling, and I ask the Minister to see that when that particular feature is advertised for 10.20 p.m. it will take place at 10.20 and not before.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I think representations were made to the Minister and the Government generally with a view to preventing advertising by Radio Eireann.  I do not think there has been any extension of the advertising programme since, but the particular people who were advertising by radio are, I think, still permitted to do so. I submit that that is very unfair to newspapers and to the printing trade generally.  We all know that since the war many printers have lost their employment for various reasons arising out of war conditions.  For that reason I suggest to the Minister that that practice should be discontinued and that those people who served their apprenticeship as printers and who have been all their lives at that job should be permitted to earn their livelihood as hitherto.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann, to my mind, has made a very sensible suggestion, and that is, that there should be an advisory board or some kind of committee established with a view to going into this whole question of broadcasting. I am not at all satisfied that the people are getting proper programmes. I believe that people with right imagination can be found here to visualise what the country wants.  The talent is there.  I believe that good work could be done and that wireless could be used far more advantageously than is the case at present.  I urge the Minister to adopt the suggestion of Deputy McCann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in what the last speaker said regarding the interference with reception in County Wexford.  As far as my personal knowledge goes it is absolutely impossible, two nights out of three, to hear <Col N="2124" /> the Irish news at all.  Some station immediately adjoining the Irish station keeps coming in every minute.  There is not interference all the time but there are gaps in the programme.  The Minister knows what I mean.  That state of affairs has been going on for a considerable time.  I agree with what Deputy McCann said.  I pointed out on numerous occasions that I did not think licence holders were getting full value from the service.  The broadcasting service here pays for itself and, in addition, shows a substantial profit which goes to the general revenue. My contention is that as licence holders maintain this service they are entitled to get back the profits in the way of more entertainment.  In that way a number of musicians who are unemployed might be put into employment. For the last three years I have advocated that the policy should be changed in that respect, and that the surplus money should go towards providing better value.  One example would be to increase the number of performers in the orchestra, which very often puts across the air fine programmes. By employing more musicians the reputation of this country abroad would be enhanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter for comment is that the programme does not commence until 5.30 in the afternoon.  We should have an earlier programme or, at least, one occupying more time.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on certain improvements that have been carried out, notably the half-hour at night, to which he referred, during which Irish music is played.  There was a time in the evenings when one would imagine one was listening to some American or English broadcasts.  I am very glad to see that the Irish programme has been improved in that respect.  It is greatly appreciated in country districts. I do not think anyone in particular was to blame, but there seemed to be an inclination to copy the English broadcasting system at night, as one could get nothing but dance music, each tune being practically the same.  I consider it much better to have the Irish programmes we have now.  I congratulate the Minister on the change.  I do not think we get enough news at night.  If <Col N="2125" /> there was more news given, that should not interfere in any way with the newspapers, because the evening papers are not available in some country districts. As far as I understand, the news we get in the country at night is merely a repetition of B.B.C. broadcasts.  We do not get sufficient news about what is happening in this country.  There are many happenings of great interest to people who live in the country, and if they could get news about them it would be an advantage.  It would also take their minds off the international situation.  I intended to say something about the use of the wireless for propaganda purposes, but the Minister will appreciate the reasons why I will not say anything about that now.</P>

      <P>I consider that broadcasting could be used much more than it is.  I should like to hear important lectures dealing with social and economic questions broadcast more frequently.  When important lectures are announced people are anxious to hear them on the wireless.  I seldom listen to the news, but I am inclined to think we do not get sufficient news, particularly about events in this country.  I heard some comments about more Irish songs and stories and on a repetition of items to which some might take exception.  Broadcasts of important lectures are items that people are looking for rather than for too much music.  There has been much comment on the fact that such items are not broadcast more frequently.</P>

      <P>I am intervening to pay a tribute to the lectures of Mr. D.L. Kelleher that were broadcast on behalf of the Irish Tourist Development Association.  I am sure they attracted very considerable attention, not only at home but in other countries, having regard to the historical significance of the songs and traditions described by that very brilliant lecturer.  I think we should have more of them.  Tourism is an exceedingly important matter at present not only for the purpose of encouraging our people to visit places of interest in their own country but to <Col N="2126" /> attract tourists from other countries. The remarks of the last speaker remind me that lectures can be availed of to the benefit of our people.  There is no doubt that an increasing number of agriculturists in remote districts have installed wireless sets, and it is of the greatest interest to them if lectures on modern methods are given, because our farmers cannot know too much about a calling that is becoming more and more important to them, so that they may make the best use of their land.  If the Minister would direct the attention of the authorities at Radio Eireann to the importance of providing lectures by men who are, undoubtedly, competent to deal with their subjects, I believe we could not measure the economic advantages that would accrue to the country from the improved methods they advocate.  I wish to pay my testimony to programmes that have been broadcast and the good work that has been done in that direction.  While there may be a certain amount of reason for some of the criticism levelled at Radio Eireann, I believe it is doing useful work.  We have only to ask ourselves what would we do without it to realise that existence would be a little more drab by its absence.  I think this service is one that deserves well of the country.</P>

      <P>If the work of the broadcasting station is not as good as other stations, there may be excellent reasons for that.  It may be that the money available here is much less than is available in other countries.  The specific complaint I have to make is with regard to the news programme. For some months back, the time devoted to the transmission of news is almost entirely taken up by a re-hash of the war news transmitted by the British Broadcasting Company.  I do not object to our own station giving a summary of news similar to that of the British broadcasting station, but what I do object to is taking up the time almost entirely with the transmission of that news.  There are numerous items of local interest which could be broadcast with advantage.  It seems to me, too, that undue emphasis and stress is laid on, and too much time <Col N="2127" /> devoted to, statements made by Ministers from time to time, while too little attention is given to statements made by the Leaders of the Opposition Parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, the director and those associated with him are to be congratulated on the progress they are making, when one takes into consideration the restricted and limited facilities at their disposal in certain respects.  I am sure the Minister will not suggest to the House or the country that the studio is in the most suitable place that could be discovered in the capital city.  So far as I can ascertain&mdash;I believe it is true&mdash;the studio was established in a spare room in one of the most noisy centres of our city. It has been suggested to me that, when more money is available&mdash;money can be found for everything when the will is there to find it&mdash;a more suitable centre and a more suitable studio should be provided for the wireless broadcasting station.</P>
      <P>Looking through this Estimate, one sees many discrepancies that are not found in other Estimates submitted from time to time for the consideration of the House.  Has either the Minister or his predecessor given any consideration to suggestions repeatedly made for the setting up of an advisory committee, consisting of people who take a deep interest in this service and representing, so far as an advisory committee of that type can represent, active listeners?  That suggestion is worthy of consideration, and I should like to know whether, so far, it has received any consideration.  I want to make clear that I am not suggesting the setting up of an advisory committee consisting exclusively of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate provides for a salary of £1,000, with an allowance, for the director.  It is remarkable, when one studies the figures further down, that there is a difference between the salary of the director and that of the assistant director of £750 a year.  I understand that the assistant director has a good knowledge of three or four languages and a very good knowledge of our native tongue.  Is it to be taken from <Col N="2128" /> that that in the broadcasting station the Irish language is not getting the consideration which it is entitled to get?  May I take it that the assistant director, in the absence of the director, is responsible for the supervision of the staff working in the station?  If that is so, then one finds many other persons employed in the station with salaries far in excess of that of the assistant director.  I am informed&mdash;I am not sure if I am correct&mdash;that the majority of the persons employed in the station are not employed principally for the doing of work in Irish. The assistant director is provided with a salary of £400.  The principal clerk &mdash;a non-technical officer, I presume&mdash; has a salary of £800 and bonus.  Am I to understand from that that the administrative side is regarded as more important than the technical side of this service?</P>
    <P>Further down, there is provision for talks officers&mdash;one a male and the other a female.  In both cases, these officers, who are nominally subject to the supervision of the assistant director, are on salaries higher than that of the assistant director.  Does not that disclose a state of affairs which requires some explanation? Let it be understood that I am not making any objection to the salaries fixed for some of the officers I have mentioned but, in the organisation of a properly run commercial concern, discrepancies of that kind are not found.  If the discrepancies are there, they should be explained and now is the time to give the explanation.  I should like to encourage the Minister to go ahead on the most progressive lines possible.  Seeing that there is a good surplus available, that this is, in fact, a profit-making Department, if there is anything wrong in the matters to which I have drawn attention regarding staffing and payment of the staff, there is obviously money available to put these things right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin asked how many of the staff can speak Irish.  The general policy is, as far as possible, to get the most competent Irish speakers but sometimes it is difficult to combine other qualifications <Col N="2129" /> with that qualification.  You may have people who are particularly good at music, for instance, but whose knowledge of Irish may not be up to the standard.  Sometimes, knowledge of Irish has to be subordinated to technical qualifications but I can assure the House that, wherever possible, we pay due attention to the importance of a knowledge of the Irish language. We also keep in touch with those who are interested in forwarding the Irish language cause.  Only recently we received a deputation from the Gaelic League.  We discussed all these matters and we gave them ample opportunity of keeping in touch with us, so that we may be able to co-operate in all matters of Gaelic culture.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin asked about the licence fees.  All the money that comes in by way of licence fees is indicated here.  I do not exactly know why the word &ldquo;cash&rdquo; should be put in. Perhaps it is simply to indicate that there is no such thing as credit given where licence fees are concerned. Deputy McCann mentioned the question of fees.  At one time a fee of 10/6 was paid, and I expect that that sum so burned its way into the mind of the Deputy that he has not forgotten it.  I may say that the fees have been improved considerably.  One of the first things that happened after I came into office was that we arranged to meet representatives of the authors, and the director and myself had a good talk with them, and arrangements were made by which the fees were considerably increased.  They are now sufficient to attract quite good material.  I think on one side the material is lacking.  On the dramatic side it is very difficult to get good material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCann and Corish, and also Deputy Davin, mentioned the advisory committee.  That is a matter which I intend to go into more closely. There was an advisory committee formerly and it was not found to be altogether satisfactory.  A good deal of radio work is experimental.  When you read about the continual criticisms of the B.B.C., it would appear that there is another system developing <Col N="2130" /> there.  That new system is called a research system and it may be an improvement on existing methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>If people, when writing in criticisms, would only make suggestions to the station, it would be most helpful.  An advisory committee might easily be a very unsuitable thing, because people come along with special interests and special points of view and these might only interfere with the proper direction of the station.  If there was some system by which suggestions would be made, the station would appreciate it.  However, it is a matter that I will look into and I will see what can be done about it.</P>
      <P>I was surprised when Deputy Corish mentioned that the Wexford reception is still bad.  We sent down an inspector to inquire into the matter and he got the impression that things had improved and that some of the defects in reception were due rather to the condition of the sets than to the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to make any suggestions, but there does seem to be something of a mystery about Wexford.  I will go into the whole question again to see if we can bring about some remedy.  I think it was Deputy Corish who raised the question about advertising.  My experience in regard to advertising is a somewhat curious one.  We discovered that some of the people who were most loud in denouncing advertising at one period are now the people who are pressing me most strongly to adopt advertising. There seems to be an attitude held that advertising does not interfere with the newspapers at all.  I wish the people who are interested in this matter would get together and find some way <Col N="2131" /> in which to settle their difficulties.  It would make it easier for the Government to arrive at a decision.  I am not very enthusiastic about radio advertising, but I see that it has a certain purpose.  Possibly, with the increasing shortage of paper for the newspapers, there may be a stronger demand for advertising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; we will leave it at that.  Deputy Esmonde mentioned about interference with the wavelengths. I have dealt with that.  There are difficulties in having earlier programmes. There are programmes earlier in the day for schools, and advertising programmes follow.  The matter of expense has to be taken into consideration.  If you increase the number of hours there is a considerable amount of expense on each hour that you add to the broadcasting.  I do not think we should venture beyond what we are doing at the moment.  I quite agree with Deputy Esmonde that the more money we have the better.  The reason our programmes are not up to what they ought to be is simply because we are not able to have a larger orchestra.  A good orchestra costs a considerable amount of money. We want to get more orchestrated Irish music.  The material at the disposal of musicians is immensely rich.  We only wish we could give a great deal more first-class Irish music and we would give it if we had it too.  The Deputy also asked for more local news.  The organisation of a news service is very expensive.  That would mean that we should have correspondents all over the country, and it means the provision of a staff needed to run a newspaper.  That is not possible under present conditions.  At the same time if we can give more Irish news we will.  I do not think our news service at present is bad, nor is it fair to say that we are simply giving the news from English stations.  It has been remarked elsewhere that the Irish news is much wider in its scope than the news coming from England.</P>

      <P>Question Time is one of the most popular items on the radio. It will end in a few weeks, but it will be resumed again in the autumn. Representations from local people for Question Time will be sympathetically considered.  All representations so far received have been actually accepted. Special attention will be given to broadcasts of social questions and to discussions on the unemployment problem. The Statistical Inquiry Society will broadcast on this matter in the course of this month.  I think I have dealt with nearly every question put to me.  It occurs to me that Deputies should not be afraid of sending their questions to the director from time to time.  The Minister should not interfere very much with the director, His broad lines of policy are laid down by the Minister.  A good deal should be left to the director.  It is helpful to have encouraging words from listeners from time to time or even criticisms of what they find wrong.  It is a help to know how the people are receiving the broadcasts.</P>

    <P>Tá Meastachán na Roinne Tailte den bhliain 1940-41 níos lugha de £208,356 ná iomlán an Vóta den bhliain seo caithte.  Ní foláir sa tsaol atá anois ann a bheith tíoghbhusach cnuaisciúnach le caiteachas puiblí agus do rinneadh mion-scrúdú géar grinn ar gach altán den Mheastachán d'fhonn an méid is mó is féidir do shábháil.  Táthar tar éis obair Choimisiún na Talmhan do laigheadú cheana agus uimhir mhaith den fhuirinn, idir lucht, oifige agus lucht fostaíochta lasmuich, do thabhairt ar iasacht do Ranna eile le haghaidh dualgaisí speisialta.  Cé go <Col N="2137" /> bhfuil na hoifigigh seo ar iasacht, is as Vóta na Roinne Tailte atá a dtuarastail á n-íoc, ach tá cuid de thoradh an laigheaduithe ar an obair le feiceál sa Mheastachán caiteachais faoi roinnt Rannán:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Is i Rannán I atá an laigheadú is mó.  Do réir an Rannáin sin tá an méid atá ag teastáil i gcóir Feabhsú Estát, etc., £150,000 faoi bhun an mhéide chó-réire don bhliain anuraidh. Sé an fáth is mó ar caitheadh na suimeanna móra airgid ar fheabhsú le cupla bliain anuas ach réimhsí móra talmhan Nea-thionóntuithe do bheith á roinnt, ach anois nuair nach mbeidh an oiread sin talmhan le roinnt beidh laigheadú dá dhruim sin ar an méid a bhéas le caitheamh ar Estáit a fheabhsú.  Ach ina choinnibh sin, ní mór an bhreis atá tagtha ar chostas ábhar tógála a chur san áireamh agus tar éis an scéil ar fad do chíoradh, ceapadh £560,550 a lorg faoi Rannán I in aghaidh na bliana airgeadais seo. Tá £550,000 de seo le caitheamh ar oibreacha feabhsúcháin; teastóidh £5,000 chun Leasa Tionóntachta ar Estáit ba le Bord na gCeanntar gCumhang a cheannach; is le haghaidh éileamh ar Chúiteamh do Lucht Oibre £3,400 de, is i gcóir iostán do Bhanaltrain £50 de; is chun cabhrú le lucht imirce agus le daoine bhí ar fostú ar thailte roinnte a húsáidfear £2,000 de; agus is in aghaidh Eilithe Fuascailte faoi Alt 35 den Acht Talmhan, 1939, £100 de.</P>
    <P>Tá laigheadú de £5,885 déanta ar Thuarastail, Páigh agus Liúntaisí faoi Rannán A.  Folúntais a fágadh gan líonadh agus mion-atharuithe a rinneadh maidir leis an bhfuirinn na príomh-chúiseanna atá leis an laigheadú seo.  Tá tuarastail na ndaoine, idir lucht oifige agus lucht fostaíochta lasmuich, atá ar iasacht ag Ranna eile ina muirear ar an Rannán seo.</P>
    <P>Tá laigheadú de £7,000 ar Chostaisí Taistil faoi Rannán B.  Isé faoi ndear é seo ach roinnt chigirí a thabhairt ar iasacht do Ranna eile le haghaidh oibre speisialta atá le déanamh de dhruim na práinne atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Is ar éigean is gá éinní a rá faoi <Col N="2138" /> Rannáin C, D, E, F, agus G ach amháin gur lugha an méid atá á lorg faoi gach ceann aca; tá laigheadú de £2,000 déanta faoi Rannán F&mdash;Fochostaisí in Oifig an Atúrnae.</P>
    <P>Is chuige Rannán H chun ús agus ciste fiach-laigheaduithe d'íoc ar Bhannaí Talmhan ar n-a dtabhairt amach in aghaidh an tsíntiúis ón Stát i gcóir riail-phraghais Estát Talmhan Tionóntuithe agus praghais Estát Bhanc Náisiúnta na Talmhan agus maidir leis an gCiste Costaisí.  Thárla an laigheadú de £500 tré Bhannaí Talmhan le haghaidh an Chiste Chostaisí, a tugadh amach sa mbreis, a chur ar ceal.  Is gnáthach meadú beag, chun íoc as imeachta nua, do thárlachtaint gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Is chuige Rannán J chun soláthair d'fhonn slánú a dhéanamh ar easnamh sa teacht isteach as tailte nea-thionóntuithe ar n-a gceannach faoi na hAchtanna Talmhan, 1923-39.  Baineann roinnt altán éigcinnte leis ar deacair a gcostas a mheas roimh ré.  Le blianta beaga anuas, ámh, laigheaduíodh an méid a lorgtar faoi'n Rannán seo de bharr forálacha Ailt 33 den Acht Talmhan, 1936.  Foráltar leis an alt sin gur tuigthe paistí talmhan nea-thionóntuithe a mbíonn na coinníollacha orduithe ina dtaobh cólíonta do bheith luaidhte sa liost faoi Alt 24 den Acht Talmhan, 1931.  Níl ach £3,500 á lorg i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is chuige Rannán K chun ús agus ciste fiach-laigheaduithe d'íoc ar an gcion de phraghas tailte Bhanc na Talmhan agus Coiste-thailte is muirear ar an Stát.  Ní théigheann mórán atharuithe riamh ar an méid a theastuíonn faoi'n Rannán seo agus ní gá éinní a tá mar gheall air.  Tá na Comhar-Chumainn Fheirmeoireachta ar fad scurtha um an dtaca so.  Sé an méid céanna, eadhon, £17,300 a fuarthas anuraidh agus atáthar a lorg i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Níl sna méideanna atá luaidhte faoi Rannáin L, M, agus P ach comharthaí sóirt.</P>
    <P>Isé rud le n-a mbaineann Rannán N ach le roimh-íocanna airgid chun íocaíochtaí, ar n-a n-ordú leis an Acht <Col N="2139" /> Talmhan, 1931, d'íoc faid a bítear ag feitheamh aisíoca ionta ó na daoine bhíos freagarthach ina n-íoc i gcás na n-imeacht ceannaigh i dtaobh na ngabháltas do chaitheamh amach ina dhiaidh sin no an phraghais cheannaigh d'atharú.  Ní foláir na Bannaí Talmhan oiriúnacha tugtar amach i leith na ngabháltas san d'fhuascailt agus ní mór soláthar a dhéanamh i gcóir suimeanna bheidh, b'fheidir, le n-íoc le tionóntaithe no le tiarnaí talmhan na ngabháltas sin.  Isé cúis ar fad nach mór atá leis an laigheadú mór de £55,000 ná go raibh méid mí-chuimseardha ag teastáil faoi'n Rannán seo anuraidh chun Cuntas Fiunraíochta as a n-íoctaí caiteachas faoi'n Rannán so roimhe sin do ghlanadh.  Toisc deireadh do bheith leis an Sean-chuntas Fiunraíochta seo, agus toisc an atharuithe atá tagtha de dhruim an Achta Talmhan, 1939, ar an modh chun deighleáil le Bannaí Talmhan Breise in Estáit ina bhfuil na Cistí dáilithe&mdash;tré n-ar cuireadh deireadh leis na Bannaí sin d'fhuascailt in airgead&mdash;meastar gur leor £5,000 fá choinne na roimh-íocanna bhéas le déanamh faoi'n Rannán seo i mbliana.</P>
    <P>An tsuim a cuireadh ar fáil annuraidh faoi Rannán O i bhfuirm Roimh-íocanna chun íoc as oibreachta Bancánachta agus oibreachta eile a choinneál i dtreo bhí méid mí-chuimseardha inti sin freisin toisc na dtairisgeana bhí faoi bhreithniú an tráth sin; ach fágann an laigheadú de £2,000 atá á dhéanamh i mbliana gan ach méid measardha bheith ag teastáil arís.</P>
    <P>Isé fé ndear an méadú de £5,000 faoi Rannán Q ach an soláthar is gá dhéanamh&mdash;de dhruim roimh-íocanna breise i bhfuirm Bannaí Talmhan a bhéas le tabhairt amach i mbliana&mdash; maidir leis na blianachta le n-a n-aisíocfar na roimh-íocanna sin d'athscrúdú, rud a fhágfaidh easnamh le slánú i gCiste na mBannaí Talmhan.</P>
    <P>An méid atá á iarraidh faoi Rannán R, chun íoc as imeachta ceannaigh atá ag feitheamh fós faoi Shean-Achtanna Talmhan na mblian 1903 agus 1909, níl ann ach £1,000 i mbliana i gcomparáid leis an £2,000 do cuireadh ar fáil anuraidh.  Meastar <Col N="2140" /> gur leor an tsuim seo le haghaidh aon chásanna is féidir a chríochnú taobh istigh den bhliain.  Ní mór is gá a chaitheamh faoi aon cheann de na Rannáin S, T, agus V agus ní gá éinní a rá fútha.</P>
    <P>Tá an méadú de £200 faoi Rannán U ag teastáil chun slánuithe an easnaimh i gCiste na dTemmorálachtaí Eaglaise ar n-a theacht de dhruim riaráiste a chistiú, agus íocaíochtaí bliantúla a ath-scrúdú, faoi Alt 18 den Acht Talmhan, 1933, mar a leathnuíodh é le hAlt 28 den Acht Talmhan, 1939.  Tá laigheadú de £2,000 ar an méid atá á lorg faoi Rannán W i mbliana, mar táthar ag brath air go mbeidh níos lugha ag teastáil le haghaidh táillí lóisteála agus costaisí is iníoctha le Cláradóirí Contae as imeachta chun riaráiste Blianachtaí Talamh-Cheannaigh a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Rannán nua iseadh Rannán X atá á thabhairt isteach chun airgead a chur ar fáil le haghaidh Roimh-íocanna faoi Alt 43 den Acht Talmhan, 1939, alt a chuireas ar chumas Choimisiún na Talmhan roimh-íoc a thabhairt do cheannuitheoir ghabháltais fhaillitheora. An £500 atáthar a lorg, meastar gur leor é le haghaidh aon roimh-íocanna den tsórt san a déanfar i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá laigheadú de £14,325 ar na Leithreasaí i gCabhair i gcomparáid le Leithreasaí na bliana anuraidh.  In Altán á 4 tá laigheadú de £20,000 tagtha ar an bhfarasbarr ioncuim ó Chuntaisí Cíosa agus Uis.  Is as suncála a thagann furmhór an ioncuim ó Chuntaisí Cíosa agus Uis fá láthair agus is beag an farasbarr a bhíonn ann aon bhliain.  In Altán a 9 tá laigheadú de £1,000 ar na fáltaisí Ilghnéitheacha, ach ar an taobh eile tá méadú de £7,000 ar an teacht isteach o Bhlianachtaí Breise agus ó Airgead Fuascailte faoi Altán a 6. Bhéarfar faoi deara go bhfuil mionaltán amháin a bhí ann anuraidh ar lár i mbliana, mar do hathghairmeadh Alt 51 den Acht Talmhan, 1931, le hAlt 12 den Acht Talmahan, 1936, agus bhí deireadh i Mí na Samhna seo caithte leis an tréimhse chun &ldquo;suimeanna breise&rdquo; d'aisíoc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2141" /> Níl eolas beacht iomlán le fáil fós ar na príomh-chúramaí bhí idir láimh ag Coimisiún na Talmhan i gcaitheamh na bliana dar chríoch an 31adh Márta seo caithte ach is féidir a rá go ndearnadh 39,000 acra de thalamh nea-thionóntuithe do roinnt.  Laigheadú mór é seo i gcomórtas leis an réimsí fairsinge roinntí i gcaitheamh na mblianta beaga atá caithte; ach nuair a cuimhnítear ar na deacrachtaí do bhain leis an scéal sarar ritheadh an tAcht Talmhan, 1939, i Mí Lúnasa seo caithte, chífear a fhiúntaighe atá sé mar thoradh ar shaothar Choimisiún na Talmhan, agus níorbh fholáir don fhuirinn oibriú go cruaidh chun é thabhairt chun críche.  Níl imeachta chun tailte a thógaint á mbunú anois chó tapaidh agus a bhídís, toisc é bheith riachtanach fearachas a chleachtadh agus fós de dhruim an scéim curadóireachta éigeanta bheith i bhfeidhm.  Mar sin féin, an méid talmhan a bhfuil imeachta ar bun faoi láthair chun é thógaint (go toilteanach no go héigeanta), meastar gur leor é chun oibre cuibhe i bhfuirm roinnte go ceann cúpla blian eile.</P>
    <P>Tá ullmhúchán déanta chun Imirce Gasraí go dtí Coilíneachtaí ar na tailte fairsinge a leathnú, agus tugadh trí chomhluadar fhichead le deireannas ó Ghaeltacht Chonamara go Coliíneacht nua i mBaile Almhan, Co. na Midhe; tá chuile chosúlacht ann go n-eireoidh go geal leo.  Faoi'n Imirce seo na nGasraí tá os cionn céad comhluadar lonnuithe cheana féin i iár na hEireann.  Maidir le hEstáit de Thalamh Tionóntuithe chuir an laigheadú atá déanta ar an bhfuirinn moill, ar ndóigh, ar an obair a bhaineann le húnaeracht ghabháltas do dhílsiú i dtionónta-cheannuitheorí, ach táthar ag súil nach mbeidh ann ach moill shealadach.</P>
    <P>Tuairim's £644,000 a caitheadh anuraidh ar Oibreacha chun Estáit d'Fheabhsú.  Níl an tsuim seo ach beagán níos lugha ná an méid a chosain an gnó so an bhliain roimhe sin&mdash;an bhliain is aoirde bhí an caiteachas.  Is ar oibreacha feabhsúcháin ar thailte a bhíothas tar éis a thógaint agus a roinnt sna blianta roimhe sin a caitheadh go leor den <Col N="2142" /> airgead seo, ar ndóigh.  Tá bailiú na mBlianacht Talamh-Cheannaigh ag dul ar aghaidh réasúnta maith mar is gnáth.  Tá cúig seachtód faoi'n gcéad den mhéid a bhí le bailiu faoí Ghála Mhí na Samhna agus Mhí na Nodlag anuraidh bailithe cheana féin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amazed to discover that none of the leading lights of the Opposition Party had a word to say on this Estimate.  I take it that they are all quite in agreement with the policy of the Ministry and with the administration of the commissioners. There are just a few points which I should like to raise, even though I may be accused of having raised questions of the same kind on Estimates in previous years.  In the statement made by the Minister, it is admitted that the acreage of land divided during the past year has fallen to the very low figure of 39,000. That is certainly a very small acreage to be divided when compared with previous years, either under the present or the previous Ministry.  I assume that the same policy is likely to be pursued during the present year.</P>
      <P>The Minister, however, says that the available staff in the Land Commission are likely to be provided with, I suppose, full-time employment for the next few years in connection with operations for the division of lands which have already been investigated He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The area of land, for the acquisition of which proceedings, both voluntary and compulsory, are pending is, however, considered sufficient to provide a reasonable quota for division over the next few years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether the quota which he has in mind is likely to exceed the 40,000 acres divided during the past year, or whether the acreage to be divided over the period referred to in the Minister's statement is to be increased and, if so, to what extent?  I am aware and other Deputies are aware that a considerable number of officers hither to employed by the Land Commission in connection <Col N="2143" /> with preliminary investigation work and other work have been transferred to another Department of State, and that must be taken as evidence of the decision of the Government to shut down further work of that kind during whatever period has been decided upon.  Is it to be understood definitely that no further preliminary work will be undertaken by the Land Commission officials during the next few years, and that the work of the Land Commission is to be confined solely to cases already in hands, or cases where landowners have entered objections on the ground of acquisition or price to proceedings already instituted by the commissioners?</P>
    <P>In that respect I would be glad if the Minister could supply information as to the number of cases on appeal, particularly since the outbreak of the European War, and whether the outbreak of the European War has encouraged landowners to appeal to a greater extent on the question of price than was done previous to that period. I have no information on the matter, but I am inclined to suspect that landowners were tempted to enter objections on the question of price to a greater extent than they had been previously doing, assuming, and I hope wrongly assuming, that the price of land was going to be advanced in the same way as it was in the European War 25 years ago.  Information on that point would be very interesting to Deputies and, if the Minister has such information at his disposal, I would be very glad if he would give us the figures, even if they are only approximate, as to the acreage of land involved in cases awaiting decision on appeal.</P>
    <P>I have spoken in this House before as to the operations of the Land Commission in connection with the division of land.  I am prepared to admit that no matter who divides land, no matter what inspector or body of commissioners is in existence, no matter what Minister or Ministry is in office when estates are divided, there are bound to be complaints, mainly because there is not <Col N="2144" /> enough land available in most areas to hand over to those who are anxious and willing to work it.  I wish the Minister would give the House definite particulars regarding the order of preference which should be given to applicants on the division of estates.  I understood that preference was given first to persons who lost employment owing to the acquisition of estates, next to uneconomic holders who were or were not-tenants on the estate, but living within a reasonable radius, then evicted tenants, cottage tenants and suitable landless men.  I received a large number of complaints during the past few years from deserving cottage tenants, highly qualified agricultural labourers with grown-up families, who have been ignored in the division of estates convenient to where their cottages are situate.  I submitted the complaints to the Land Commission, but naturally they came in after schemes for the division of the estates were put into operation.  I hope the Minister will have no objection to telling the House and particularly those interested the order of preference laid down for the guidance of the inspectors responsible for the preparation of division schemes, and what order of preference qualified cottage tenants would be entitled to get under that scheme.  It was understood during the term of office of the previous Government, as well as this Government, that applicants residing within a radius of two miles of an estate, provided there was sufficient land, would get preference.  That order has not been put into operation as far as the claims of genuine cottage tenants are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a good case in land division schemes for giving consideration to the claim of a cottage tenant who does not want to become a farmer, but wishes to retain his right to work as an agricultural labourer, a road worker, or to employment that would give him a cash return, to at least five acres, and to make it possible for him to undertake the tilling of two or three acres and grazing a cow or a calf on the remainder. I admit that a cottage tenant, if regarded as a suitable applicant, must make up his mind definitely <Col N="2145" /> on that matter, and must inform the Land Commission inspector whether he intends to become a farmer, whether he is willing to work what is called an economic holding, or to have an additional acreage attached to his plot while still retaining his rights as an agricultural labourer or road worker.  I know very deserving applicants of the cottage tenant type who were ignored.  I am sorry to say that while they were ignored land was given in some cases to other persons who let or sub-let the land after receiving it.</P>
    <P>What is the policy of the Land Commission in regard to persons who get land and refuse to work it, or who let it?  I could understand the case of a good type of person who got land at a period when it was too late to work it for the current year, but I cannot understand the attitude of a person who insists on letting such land for one, two or three years after being put into possession, especially when there are other more deserving applicants living in the locality, who are willing to work it, if the commissioners were prepared to give it to them. Everybody is anxious to assist the Government at this particular period, by impressing upon the people the importance of tilling the largest acreage possible.  The closing down of acquisition work or preliminary inspection work appears to me to be in conflict with the policy of the Ministry to get the greatest acreage under tillage. The small holders and the landless men are willing to till all the land that the Government would like them to till.  It is well known that it is the largest owners who do not till any reasonable percentage of their land.  I brought a few glaring cases in my constituency under the notice of the Department, where a large number of cottage tenants had not sufficient land to graze a cow or to provide themselves with vegetables, while 1,000 acres convenient to which Deputy Hogan resides, were under grass.  If Deputy Hogan takes part in the debate I should like to hear what he has to say about that land.  I have not seen it recently. What percentage of land in Shinrone <Col N="2146" /> area is under tillage now compared with the percentage under tillage in the last three or four years?</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Hogan will agree with me when I say that I should like to see that land acquired and divided amongst deserving applicants with large families, who are quite willing to work it in order to provide for their families instead of sending them to England to look for work.  In the local District Court people were summoned for having cows trespassing on the roads because they could not get grazing rights from the landlords concerned. I raised that case in this House by way of a question on two or three occasions within the last five or ten years, but the acquisition of the land is as near to-day&mdash;I am subject to correction by the Minister&mdash;as it was then.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the employment of men on Land Commission improvement work.  I raised this question in writing on numerous occasions, the complaint being that the Land Commission had refused work of that kind to registered unemployed persons, while people with other means of livelihood were engaged.  Under existing circumstances it is a shame to give work of that kind to persons with other means of livelihood, while registered unemployed who are willing to do it, are a charge on the State because of their failure to get work of any kind.  I do not wish to discuss the cases now, because I have not given the Minister what I regard as reasonable notice, but I have sent the Department particulars about them within the last 48 hours. They are not the first glaring cases of the kind that I have been compelled to bring under notice.  Does the Minister agree, if there are such cases, that it is right for officials to take men away from farms where they are working, and to give them Land Commission work while registered unemployed are available in the area?</P>
    <P>I want to know whether he approves of the policy of giving big farmers' sons work on schemes of this kind, and leaving other persons equally well qualified and more deserving, walking <Col N="2147" /> about the roads or going to the employment exchanges one or two days a week.  The money that helps to carry out this valuable type of work has been collected from all classes of taxpayers and not from that section of taxpayers who are Fianna Fáil supporters. There is no justification for confining the employment available&mdash; as has been done not on one but on several occasions&mdash;to selected individuals. In that connection, I suggest to the Minister&mdash;I hope he will agree with me&mdash;that it is very undesirable that Land Commission gangers should be put in charge of works of this kind in their native counties.  If fair play is to be given in the allocation of this work, Land Commission gangers should not be natives of the county where the work is being carried out. I think that that has led to some of the complaints I have come across.  If these people were not so closely associated with the residents of the area where the work is being carried out, these complaints would not, in some cases, have arisen.</P>
    <P>I hope that the complaint I have sent to the Minister within the last 48 hours will be carefully investigated.  I agree that I have not given sufficient time for a proper investigation for the purpose of this debate.  I do not want to make use of discussions on Estimates for that purpose.  I raise cases in this House only when I fail to get a reply in a reasonable period.  Since I came here in 1922, I have forwarded 95 per cent. of the complaints I have received to the Government Departments concerned.  I have endeavoured to do my work as a Deputy by correspondence because I want to give the officials concerned a fair opportunity of looking into the cases rather than chasing after a Minister who knows nothing about them.  Deputies who have been here a short time must be wasting the time of a number of Ministers by calling into their offices without previous notice.  The Minister will receive you sympathetically, tell you that he will inquire into the matter and send you away with a shake hands.  I prefer to wait until <Col N="2148" /> the case is investigated and then approach the Minister if the case is sufficiently serious.  I do not trouble Ministers much on that score.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has the reputation of being the laziest State Department in the world.  They send out a number of those buff-coloured acknowledgment forms, but they are never followed by an answer to a specific question.  These acknowledgment forms are worthless and a waste of money.  So far as I am concerned, the Minister can keep all his acknowledgement forms for himself seeing that there is such a paper shortage and I will wait until such time as I can get an intelligent answer such as is usually given by other State Departments.  I wonder what percentage of the letters written to the Land Commission are answered within the lifetime of the commissioners themselves.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I feel justified in referring.  I raised it on previous occasions, and I shall keep raising it at every suitable opportunity until such time as it is put on a satisfactory basis.  I have written on innumerable occasions to the Land Commission about the delay in providing houses for people who have been provided with holdings.  Three years ago, three and a half years ago and four years ago, I wrote to the Land Commission about their failure to provide proper housing accommodation, as promised, to people who had got economic holdings.  There is no reasonable excuse for the failure of the commissioners to provide, in three or four years, houses for persons who got economic holdings.  I have written to the Land Commission within the last few weeks about a man who was given an economic holding in exchange for another holding in 1935 and who is still waiting for a house.  Worse than that, he is waiting to bring the woman who is to be his wife into the house.  It is bad enough not to give a man a house within a reasonable radius of his holding, but it is a serious thing for the Minister and Commissioners to have the charge made against them that they are really responsible for what may yet turn out to be a breach of promise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> I have written to the Land Commission within the past few weeks&mdash;there are a number of houses involved in this case in my constituency&mdash;regarding the delay in erection of houses.  The work of erection in this case has been going on for three and a half years and, in the case of at least one house, the roof is not on yet and the man cannot get possession.  Is the Minister prepared to defend that kind of activity&mdash;or inactivity, as I have been reminded I should have said?  If there is not sufficient staff in that section of the Land Commission, then get staff and, in the name of common sense, get the work done in a reasonable time. Failure to build these houses within a reasonable time will involve the taxpayers in increased charges in the immediate future.  If the work had been completed before the war, the cost would have been much less than it will be now.  Who will pay for that except the taxpayers?  Would the Minister say what the position is of contractors who undertook to build houses at a certain price before the war and who have either not commenced or not completed the work? Will an increase be given to the contractors, who will have to pay higher prices for materials, following upon the war, than they would have been obliged to pay if there had been no war, or if they had finished the work before the war commenced?  I had a case of that kind brought to my notice, but it is not a case of one individual being affected. That type of complaint applies to contractors in every part of the country. I ask the Minister to tell the House what the position of these contractors will be, and whether a percentage will be added to the contract price.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions, I have objected, and I repeat the objection now, to the policy of the Land Commission in moving into areas persons from outside before the rightful claims of local, deserving applicants have been satisfied.  I see by the statement issued by the Minister that a large number of migrants have been brought into the midlands.  The Minister has not given the total cost of the removal of those people from areas in the Gaeltacht to the midland counties.  From <Col N="2150" /> a limited experience and knowledge of the operations of these migrants, I can truthfully say that the migrants brought into my areas from Gaeltacht areas have been an absolute failure. They come from a part of the country where farming, as it is understood in the midland counties, is unheard of. They come into an area where they cannot teach any of the local applicants anything about the progressive or the profitable working of land.  I have known cases where some of these people came along, their fares were paid, they were provided with housing accommodation and a farm and they got loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. They are bankrupt to-day.  They are bankrupt in other respects, too.  They are bankrupt in the intelligence and experience that would enable them to work land in the way in which it is normally worked in midland counties. It would be far better and cheaper for a Government that is sincerely anxious, as we all are, to provide the people of the Gaeltacht with a better means of livelihood, to reclaim the lands in the Gaeltacht and leave those people there on the reclaimed lands rather than bring them into an unknown area where they know nothing of the kind of work they are expected to carry on for the remainder of their lives.</P>
    <P>What is the cost per family in putting people from the Gaeltacht areas into midland counties?  Some of these people have been given a weekly wage. I wonder would the Minister agree that, even with a weekly wage, they are still failures?  I must protest against the continuance of the policy of the Land Commission in bringing into any area migrants from the West when there are suitable local people waiting for land and well entitled to it.  I believe it is a policy that is bound to create contention and turmoil, particularly when the deserving applicants in a district are left out of consideration.  That policy should only be pursued where there is division of large estates.  I know of cases where it is being pursued in connection with the division of very small estates.  In <Col N="2151" /> one case brought to his notice quite recently, the Minister asserted that all the deserving local applicants had been catered for and it was the intention of the Land Commission to put into this area, where the small estate was being divided, persons who would not be welcomed by a brass and reed band.</P>
    <P>In one case, in answer to Deputy O'Higgins, it was admitted that one of the persons who received a holding was an old age pensioner, a person over 80 years of age.  I am reliably informed that the pensioner was propped up in bed by the Land Commission official in order to enable her to sign for the holding. I know of more deserving applicants than that old person, and the Minister is well aware that any person who receives a holding is supposed to be competent to work it.  This particular holding has been passed on to a very prominent local politician.  I am now stating that on the basis of the information which appears here in the Official Reports.  There are many more deserving applicants than this old age pensioner or the migrants who apparently are going to be pushed into this locality.  In that and every other case, as long as I am a Deputy, while there are local deserving applicants available, I will protest against this policy of migration.</P>

      <P>I find myself very much in agreement with the remarks of my colleague of the Labour Party, Deputy Davin.  In the early passages of the Minister's opening statement he outlined the present policy of the Land Commission, namely, a slowing down, a curtailment of activity, and the lending of members of the staff to other Departments.  I think that is a policy which should be very carefully examined by this House.  We are in a war situation and we are told that one of the main difficulties of this war is the question of supply, and the most desirable thing that people can do is to produce more food.  At the same time as we have a cry on the lips of every well-intentioned person to produce more food, we deliberately refrain from the giving out of land to produce the food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> The policy of the Land Commission and of the Department of Agriculture at the present moment seems to be that of one completely contradicting the other.  In so far as the Minister for Agriculture is entitled to speak for the Government, he says it is the policy of the Government to have increased tillage.  In so far as the Minister for Lands is entitled to speak for the Government, we are told the policy of the Government is to give less land, to produce less tillage.  I think some further explanation is required from the Minister on that particular point. Further, if we are to have any sense of responsibility and any appreciation as to what we are voting money for, and why, it should not be sufficient for any Minister to say that large numbers of the staff of the Land Commission have been lent to other Departments, but the payment of their salaries is still being borne by the Land Commission. We should be told how many members of the staff of the Land Commission are on loan to other Departments, to what other Departments they have gone and what is the amount of salaries that should be subtracted from the cost of the Land Commission and shown on the Votes of other Departments.</P>
    <P>I noticed, particularly within the last couple of years, rapidly growing discontent in my own constituency with the activities of the Land Commission. I am perfectly prepared to accept now, as in the past, the fact that every Government official does his work impartially and honestly and, in so far as there is a departure from what appears to be justice, that departure is necessitated by high political influence being brought to bear on the individual.  There are two festering sores in one of the counties I represent, both of them, I would say, nothing short of a scandal.  I would be inclined to think, from statements made at public meetings, that I am voicing not only the opinions of the people in the area, but the opinions of my Fianna Fáil colleagues when I say that in certain areas the division of land recently is nothing short of a gross scandal.</P>
    <P>There is one particular estate that <Col N="2153" /> Deputy Davin referred to.  It was a comparatively small estate and it was divided in an area where there is a very considerable number of uneconomic holdings and a very considerable number of landless men.  In that particular area&mdash;I have no hesitation in referring to it in a detailed kind of way because for the past 12 months all the facts have been placed at the disposal of the Land Commission&mdash; numerous applications have been made to me and other Deputies to have the thing put verbally to the Land Commission. We have done so, but nothing has been done by them.  In an area where there are a great many uneconomic holders and numbers of landless men, we find the son-in-law of a very ancient old-age pensioner of great political importance but not of the type that would be eligible for division of land, getting a substantial allocation through the back door, through the very edge.  We find the dying mother-in-law being given a portion of land and the funeral a week after.  Then the land passes to the ineligible son-in-law from another district.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any Minister is prepared to stand over that type of activity here.  I am also prepared to accept the fact that no inspector would take the responsibility for doing a thing like that, except as a result of political direction.  In the same land division a number of people&mdash;they may have been uneconomic holders from a distance&mdash;were taken and planted in the middle of these land-hungry uneconomic holders of land.  That is a thing that no inspector has discretion to do, and he can only do it as a result of higher direction, the result of orders.  Leaving out the question of migrants from outside counties, I take it that the principle always laid down and accepted by the Dáil was that the purpose of land division was to give the land to uneconomic holders and landless men.  That is the first principle.  The strongest claims were those of applicants who lived in the immediate neighbourhood where the land was divided and were qualified for a portion of the land.  The principle was that migrants from elsewhere <Col N="2154" /> within the county would only be brought in when the claims of the qualified people in the immediate locality had been satisfied.</P>
    <P>In one of the cases to which I am referring the Minister in answering a Parliamentary question would not dare hint even that the claims of the qualified people in the immediate neighbourhood were satisfied before outsiders were brought in either by the front or back door.  The Minister evaded that portion of the question by saying that the claims of people in the immediate neighbourhood had been considered.  The question was, had they been considered before the outsiders were brought in?  In the division of that particular estate all the principles which we were led to expect and respect were completely trampled under foot.</P>
    <P>Within a few miles of that estate, and recently too, we had another estate divided.  Accepting the principle that the division of land is in order to meet the claims of uneconomic holders and landless men and in order to have the land worked, we had another estate divided and we had again a number of uneconomic holders, and a number of landless men applying for the land.  In that particular case we find that one substantial portion of the land has been given to a 50-acre farmer who had only the year before sold the same amount of land as he got in this divide.  He has consistently, ever since he got the last substantial portion of land, set it. The attention of the Minister and his predecessor was called to that violation of all the standards which we believed we had set up verbally and in writing, and by every possible means.  But not only was a large tract of land given to this person who had previously been a comparatively big farmer, but some of that large tract of land was a field surrounding the household of one uneconomic applicant who received no portion of land.  In that particular area alone, in that particular division alone, the evidence is that, out of some couple of hundred acres given out, 75 per cent. has been continuously advertised and set on the <Col N="2155" /> 11 months' system ever since it was given to these people.</P>
    <P>With the best intentions in the world mistakes will be made.  Mistakes will be made by everybody.  A person cannot be condemned because he makes a mistake, but persons deserve to be condemned because they make mistakes and continue to make them.  Now, when land is given it is not given finally and for all time.  If, in the division of land, it is immediately afterwards ascertained that land has been given to people who do not require it, and who advertise in the local papers for somebody else to take it off their hands, then it is obvious that a mistake has been made and that mistake should be rectified immediately by taking back the land and giving it to somebody who wants it.</P>
    <P>Why are we asking for hundreds of thousands of pounds?  What is the case behind the demand?  What is the justification for abstracting that money from the pockets of the taxpayers? Simply because it was always understood from the first time in this country that the cry for land division went up that the principle was to take land from those who did not want it and give it to those who did.  That is the only justification for the immense cost of this Department of Lands.  We are not justified in voting money if we vote money for taking land from people who want it and giving it to people who quite definitely do not want it.  That is evidenced by the fact that when they get it they immediately advertise for somebody else to take it off their hands.  In both these estates there is more than a suspicion of relentless political interference with an official who, as far as I can see, has always done his work fairly.  The Minister is as closely acquainted with the facts and the circumstances as I am.  I ask him when he is winding-up the debate to justify, as far as he can, the choice of applicants and the division made with regard to the Kelly estate in Ballyvealeen and elsewhere and with regard to the Murphy estate outside Mountrath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked in this Estimate to-day to vote a considerable amount of money for the administration of the Land Commission for the next 12 months.  In connection therewith I want to raise some matters appropriate to the work of that Department. I agree with Deputy Davin that the Land Commission is probably not only the slowest Department in Ireland, but I do not believe it is possible to find a Department which manages its affairs in such a sluggish and slothful manner as the Land Commission does.  There was a time when one would display blissful innocence and optimism in writing to the Land Commission asking them what they proposed to do about certain districts.  But long experience of the easy-going, crab-like work of that Department has shown that the best way to get information is to put down a Parliamentary question.  Then you make somebody stretch his arm and write some memoranda for the Minister indicating what the reply will be.  Anybody nowadays who writes letters to the Land Commission asking them what they propose to do about the acquisition of land is only wasting his time, wasting paper and causing unnecessary annoyance to the people who have to open the letters.  If he imagines that he will get a reply this side of the grave, well I cannot cure him of that kind of optimism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any more unsatisfactory Department to write a letter to than the Land Commission.  You may write them any kind of letter, you may emphasise that it is urgent to know what is happening, you may tell them that by your effort you are trying to prevent some local agrarian dispute, and say that you would appreciate the favour of an early reply: it does not matter what kind of letter you write to the Land Commission, you get no reply at all beyond a buff acknowledgment form, often written by a person who cannot spell the name of the Deputy correctly.  Very frequently, if you ask for a reply to a previous letter, you get a separate acknowledgment bearing an entirely different reference number, indicating that your subsequent letter has not been connected <Col N="2157" /> with the file at all.  There is some administrative female machine in the place engaged in sending out acknowledgments to Deputies who write letters to the Land Commission, without any regard whatever, either to the interest which the Deputy takes in the matter, or to the manner in which the Land Commission do their business.  I join with Deputy Davin in appealing to the Land Commission to send out no more of these acknowledgment forms. I have such a collection of them that if, in these days of paper shortage, the Minister arranges to send a lorry to my office I will be glad to hand them over.  One would imagine, looking through the Estimate, that there was sufficient staff in the Land Commission to enable Deputies to get replies with reasonable expedition.  I venture to say, and I suppose this has been the experience of other Deputies as well, that if you write 100 letters to the Land Commission in the year about estates of one kind or another, you probably will not get ten replies, if one eliminates the formal acknowledgments. When I say that you get ten replies to 100 letters, I fear that I am giving the Land Commission credit for a degree of activity which, in fact, it is not entitled to claim.</P>
    <P>There are some other aspects of the Land Commission work that I would like to get some information on.  The information was not conveyed in the Minister's opening statement.  We had a declaration by the Government on the outbreak of the emergency situation that it was their desire that tillage should be encouraged, and that, in order to secure that, tillage was to be made compulsory to the extent of requiring persons to till 12½ per cent. of their arable land.  One would imagine that the Land Commission would take the view that the way to encourage tillage was to break up the grass ranches throughout the country to ensure that land would be given to small uneconomic holders and landless men, because experience shows that the smaller the farm the greater is the area under tillage.  But, instead of breaking up the grass ranches and the untenanted land of the country, instead of acquiring and dividing land, <Col N="2158" /> the Land Commission appear to have decided, at a time when tillage was never more necessary, to stop initiating proceedings for the acquisition of new land.  The Land Commission apparently intend to content themselves with dividing such lands as they have on hands.  As regards much of the land which is on their hands, they are sub-letting and sub-letting even for grazing at a very substantial profit to the Land Commission.  That is the policy they are pursuing instead of dividing that land and giving it to uneconomic holders and landless men.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us why, if the Government believe that compulsory tillage is desirable and that an increase in the area under tillage is nationally beneficial, the Land Commission should decide to adopt the policy of not acquiring any new estates for division.  It seems to me that the best way to ensure an increase of the area under tillage would be to break up the grass lands through the country, and put families on them so that the holdings may become self-contained and economic.  If the Land Commission were to do that it would be ensuring that there would be a much greater area under tillage.  Nationally, it surely would be better to do that than be allowing the ranchers to retain the grass lands which they cannot profitably use.  From any point of view, there is no policy which will give a better return in national productivity than the acquisition of these lands and their division amongst small uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>I have had cases in my constituency, particularly of lands adjoining towns, not necessarily urbanised towns, but towns where perhaps there are town commissioners and in other cases where they are still under the jurisdiction of the boards of health, which show just one tendency. That tendency, in the Counties of Kildare and Carlow, manifests itself in this way, that the small man cannot get grass for a cow.  He cannot get land at any price.  He cannot even get conacre because the folk around those towns who have got the large estates prefer to let them in 50 or 100 acre <Col N="2159" /> lots to wealthy ranchers for grazing purposes rather than make small, separate lettings to small men who have to depend for the supply of milk on their ability to get grass for a cow and on being able to get a small area of land in conacre for the production of vegetables to meet the requirements of their family.  The most surprising part of all this business is that while in peace times those people appear to have been entrenched in that kind of wasteful agricultural economy, by having large areas of land unprofitably used, even in a war situation they are now getting a new lease of life from the Land Commission because of the futile and shortsighted policy that the latter are pursuing in not acquiring fresh lands for division during the emergency situation.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that, taking the long view of the matter, the Land Commission and the Government generally would have said: &ldquo;Whatever our rate of progress was in peace times in the matter of accelerating the acquisition and division of land, the tempo of acquisition has got to be increased during this war situation.&rdquo; The Land Commission must feel that its main function is to go asleep, although other Departments may feel that new burdens are being thrown on them.  The Land Commission must feel that there was no activity expected from them the moment war broke out in Europe.  They simply sit back and say: &ldquo;Oh, well in that situation we do nothing; we will not acquire any new land; we will merely content ourselves with accelerating the pastime of dividing the acres which we have on hands and we will do that in our new leisure.&rdquo;  They probably are going to do that in a much more comfortable and leisurely fashion than one experienced in the past.  There is probably no better example of this go-slow policy of the Land Commission, in the matter of the acquisition and division of land, than that furnished by statistics which I have obtained by means of Parliamentary question.  I have some statistics here dealing with the Counties of Carlow and Kildare.  I propose to quote them for the Minister <Col N="2160" /> in the hope that they may disturb his calm and nonchalance in respect of the activities of his Department.</P>
    <P>In the year 1935-36 the Land Commission acquired in the County Kildare 9,500 acres, and divided 7,000 acres. In the year 1936-37, it acquired 4,800 acres and divided 5,200.  In 1937-38, it acquired 3,100 acres and divided 2,800.  In 1938-39, it acquired 3,000 acres and divided 1,700.  The answer to a Parliamentary question which I put down to-day gives the information that in the year 1939-40 the Land Commission acquired in the County Kildare 2,800 acres and divided 1,200 acres.  Look at the trend.  In 1935-36 the Land Commission acquired 9,500 acres and that has fallen to 2,800 acres&mdash;a very substantial reduction. The Land Commission during the past year acquired about 25 per cent. of the land which they acquired in 1935-36 in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>The case of County Carlow is still more striking.  I wonder whether anybody is paid for any Land Commission activities in the County Carlow?  In 1935-36, it acquired 244 acres&mdash;a gigantic achievement&mdash;and divided the same number of acres that year.  In 1939-40, it acquired 270 acres and divided 250.  In reply to a question on the 14th March I was told by the Minister for Lands that the total area of lands in the County Carlow in the hands of the Land Commission for division was 140 acres.  In the County Carlow, where there are very substantial estates, cottiers cannot possibly get grass for a cow or land by con-acre.</P>
    <P>Whatever argument there may be about the possibility of the acquisition or division of land in the County Carlow, there can be no question whatever that there are large tracts of land available for acquisition in the County Kildare.  The finest land in Ireland probably is available in the County Kildare.  It probably ranks with County Meath as the finest land in the whole country.  There are large tracts of untenanted land there available for acquisition.  The land is not half stocked even, and while you can find one <Col N="2161" /> man, very often an absentee landlord, owning 1,000 acres, the poor cottier, the landless man, or the uneconomic holder has no prospect whatever, at the present rate of progress by the Land Commission, of ever being able to get an acre of that land.  We used to read about a white man not being able to get into Tibet.  Every ranch in the County Kildare is a Tibet so far as the ordinary cottier, uneconomic holder, or landless man is concerned.</P>
    <P>The present policy of the Land Commission gives no evidence that that condition of affairs will be remedied unless the Minister takes the matter in hands and insists that there must be a radical alteration in the policy of the Land Commission.  It seems to me to be nothing short of criminal agricultural waste to see large tracts of untenanted land in County Kildare understocked and not available for people who are craving for an opportunity of tilling the land according to the policy of the Government and of enriching the nation by their activities on that land.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the wages paid for Land Commission work.  A case came to my notice to-day where a number of persons were required by the Land Commission to undertake land improvement work, and they were not all tenants of the Land Commission under the scheme of division.  When they went to work and inquired what the wages were, they were informed that they were 27/- per week.  The minimum paid to agricultural labourers, under the rate fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board, is 30/- per week. As a matter of fact, in this particular case on the Bobbett estate at Newbridge the work is being undertaken in an area where the minimum rate is 33/-.  Yet, on this estate, the Land Commission proceed to pay 27/- per week for a normal phase of Land Commission activity.  The same rate of wages that would be paid on aminor relief scheme is now being paid for the work carried out by a State Department. I should like to ask the Minister how he can justify the payment of 27/- per week to Land Commission <Col N="2162" /> work when the minimum for agricultural workers under the Agricultural Wages Board rates is 30/-.  I suspect that the device to justify this low rate of wages will be that agricultural workers work 54 hours per week and that the Land Commission, with its mathematical mind, decided that 48-57ths worked out at 27/-.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say how it is possible for a person to live on a wage of 27/- per week to-day, with prices what they are, with deductions for wet days, with the possibility that no matter how long the job lasts, the worker will not draw a full week's wages in the entire period?  We have to bear in mind as well that certain payments have to be made even from that low wage of 27/- for insurance purposes.  I cannot imagine that the Minister would try to justify a low wage policy of that kind.  It seems to me to be indefensible. The Minister when replying should give some evidence that his Department will not insist upon a low wage policy.  Up to the present the Board of Works have had that unenviable reputation which earned them condemnation from north, south, east and west.  Now, apparently, the Land Commission is bidding for first place in paying low wages, judging by the rate of wages paid in this instance and, I understand, in other instances.  We ought to have an assurance from the Minister that the lowest wage paid for Land Commission work will be the minimum agricultural wage and that is low enough in existing circumstances to maintain a man and his wife and family.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the kind of work the Land Commission is doing in the erection of houses on lands which are being divided.  I should like to get from the Minister some indication as to what the Land Commission policy is in that matter.  Cases have come to my notice where an estate was divided and the Land Commission decided that they would build houses for certain allottees and that they would give a free advance and a grant towards the building of houses for two other allottees.  What is the explanation for the difference in policy?  Why <Col N="2163" /> are certain people compelled to erect their own houses with inadequate grants and advances, while others have houses erected for them by the Land Commission?  I would like the Minister to clear up that point, and tell us what is the guiding principle in discrimination of that kind, so that Deputies may know where they stand in the matter.</P>
    <P>I also want to say that I am not very much impressed by the supervision, if any, which the Land Commission exercises in the matter of the placing of contracts for the erection of new houses.  I had occasion to write to the Minister about two months ago about a notorious case in the Celbridge area where a house had been erected by the Land Commission within the last three or four years.  The roof of that house does not keep out water.  The walls are allowing the rain-water to come in. The wife of the man who occupies the house complained that she fell down through the floor because the timber had rotted.  In order to produce evidence of that to the Minister, I sent him a piece of the timber of the floor which I hope he has carefully preserved in the archives of the Land Commission, as evidence of the efficiency with which they appear to have supervised the building of the house.  Here was a piece of floor that was in an absolutely worthless condition owing to dry rot after three years. The Land Commission inspector that passed that house ought to be asked for a quick explanation.  It seems to me to have been just a scandalous waste of public money, that the Land Commission should pay for the erection of a house of that kind.  In this particular case the woman complained to the Land Commission inspector who went down, and he could not believe that the flooring would be so defective after such a short period.  He asked her what portion of the floor she fell through, and when it was pointed out to him the inspector fell through another portion of it himself.</P>

      <P>That kind of administration does not reflect any credit on <Col N="2164" /> the Land Commission.  Some steps should be taken, if the policy of erecting houses is to continue, to see they are efficiently erected, and that every fellow who imagines he can build a house, no matter how he can manage to do so, should not be regarded as a person whose tender would be acceptable to the Land Commission, unless there was previous evidence of good work, or a substantial guarantee that the house would be put into a habitable condition and would not necessitate constant repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Davin and by Deputy O'Higgins to migrants.  I share their view.  I do not think the policy of migrating people from the west to eastern counties has been successful or even taking the long view that it will be successful.  According to the Banking Commission Report it takes from £1,000 to £1,200 to bring a family from the west.  I think the reports of the manner in which land in eastern counties like Meath and Kildare was used by migrants do not indicate that there is likely to be any great measure of success attending the migratory activities of these people. It might be better if the Land Commission in the long run gave them £1,200 in cash to buy 4 per cent. land bonds and to live where they were.  It seems to me tobe quite a useless policy to bring migrants from western areas where clay, much less land, is scarce, and to try to induce these people to take up new methods of cultivation under conditions with which they are quite unfamiliar.  The results do not seem to justify the policy the Land Commission embarked upon.  Whatever the policy for the Gaeltacht may be, my view is that it might be easier to industrialise it than to agriculturalise it.  It seems to me that the present policy is a highly mistaken one, on the results so far available&mdash;migrating people from the Gaeltacht areas to land in Kildare and Meath with the working of which they are quite unfamiliar, and where there is a different type of agricultural economy.  The experience of local people in these areas does not indicate that the experiment has so far justified itself.  One might <Col N="2165" /> expect that the mainspring of enthusiasm would come on the installation of the migrants.  The results available do not at all justify the large amount of money that has been spent on the experiment.</P>
    <P>If the Gaeltacht problem is to be dealt with it has to be solved in some other way than by migrating people to eastern counties.  It seems to me to be a shame, when so many local landless men and uneconomic holders are looking for land, who are relatively worse off than the migrants, that they have to stand by while the Land Commission is bringing others from the west to estates upon which they expected to obtain holdings.  I do not know on what basis the Minister can justify a policy of that kind.  It may ease discontent in the Gaeltacht area, but when talking to migrants one would not think that much had been done for them.  Certainly a new problem is being created in the areas to which these people are migrated, because the impression is being given there that no matter what energy the local people put into the cultivation of land migrants who are unfamiliar with the local agricultural economy get preference over those who are anxious to get land and who could use it to advantage. The Land Commission should insist on reasonable methods of supervision of the production of crops when dividing such land.</P>
    <P>I know that it can be said by the Minister that this is a new Department as far as he is concerned, and that his sojourn there has not enabled him to become familiar with the work.  I tell the Minister and other Deputies will bear me out, that the work of the Land Commission as we see it to-day is far from satisfactory, and that there is a painfully slow process of dealing with these matters.  Almost every conceivable difficulty can be found to impede the acquisition and division of land. In an emergency situation in particular the Minister could render valuable national service by insisting on the methods in the Land Commission being overhauled, so that there could be greater expedition in the acquisition and division of land, as well as <Col N="2166" /> evidence of a greater drive once land was acquired so as to have it divided and utilised to the full in the national interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal has been said about land division, and I may say straight away that I am not concerned whether or not one acre was divided.  I am convinced that the giving of a farm of 21 or 22 acres is going to create a new congestion problem.  That policy may satisfy Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton, but I think they will live to regret it. I wonder has it ever occurred to Deputies that on a farm of 21 or 22 acres the net cash outgoings are roughly £1 an acre, and that the Land Commission collector and the rate collector would take that amount before one penny was left for the family.  Any one who knows anything about a 21 or 22 acre farm will admit that it takes the area of that farm and what is produced on it to maintain the family without any outgoings.  I submit that the area of these farms should be 40 or 50 acres in order to raise the standard of living on the farm.  I have been convinced of that for years, but especially so for the last six months since the increase in the cost of living has begun to bear on people who were placed on these colonies.  The migrants settled in Meath are complaining that they have not sufficient land.  They are not content with 21 or 22 acres. These farms are too small to keep families of from five to ten persons in potatoes, corn, milk, poultry and other things.  When it comes to providing for other outgoings there is not enough of a surplus left to meet them. The House should remember that.  It is admitted by everyone that there is not enough land available for all those who seek it.  If we are to approach this problem why not do it in the right way and not create another problem in the east same as we have in the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What really concerns me in relation to this Department is a matter I have raised for the past few years.  I have contended that, on the returns of unpaid annuities and on the <i>nulla <Col N="2167" /> bona</i> returns of the Land Commission each year, the burden of unpaid annuities and rates is coming back on the neighbours of those who failed to pay and is pushing out the marginal men.  This question will have to be grappled with.  Deputy Norton apologised for the Minister, that he was new to the office.  Unfortunately, for the past eight or nine years, this Vote has been presented by a new Minister.  No Minister has an opportunity of developing policy.  Would the House be startled to know that, on the halved annuities, the sum outstanding on the 31st January last was £1,228,526 whereas on the 31st January 12 months ago the figure was £1,215,404, an increase of £13,122.  The number of <i>nulla bona</i> returns was 4,970 on the 31st January last as compared with 3,422 on the 31st January, 1939, an increase of 1,548.  In the 12 months an additional 1,548 farms had not a beast on which the sheriff could make a seizure and the majority of these farms would be under £4 valuation.</P>
    <P>I have been urging this on the Department for a number of years and I have suggested that a crisis would, eventually, come in the matter.  If this process of pushing out the marginal men&mdash;the next weakest line to the men who are unfit to pay their rates or rent&mdash;goes on, a national problem will eventually be created.  I have not the slightest doubt about that.  It is as clear as noon-day.  If the Minister understands anything about this question, I want him to tell, not the House but the country, what his policy is in respect of it.  I am amazed to find that, notwithstanding the settlement of the economic war and the improvement in the price of live stock, 1,548 more farms have gone completely out of production. On the other side, the Department issues an order for compulsory tillage.  That is the way we are governing the country.</P>
    <P>Is there any other reason for this rapid step-up of the number of farms going out of production?  When the Land Bill of 1933 was going through this House, the Fianna Fáil Party were <Col N="2168" /> crying out for the allocation of land to everybody who wanted it.  They had a serious case against law costs in respect of the collection of land annuities under the machinery that previously existed.  I recall attacking the machinery provided in that Bill.  It appeared novel and many Deputies thought that it looked simple and would be cheap.  Anybody who knew anything about that machine knew that this novel process would create enormous burdens on the farmers who happened to be unable to pay their annuities within the stipulated period. Take a county like my own where the land annuities may amount to 1/-, 5/-, 9/- or 10/-.  You have to put the sheriff into motion to collect those sums.  Anybody can imagine the consequences. By a coincidence, I got a letter the other day which was really not about the question of costs at all but which has a bearing on this subject. A small farmer in Donegal pays a half-yearly gale of 9/-.  There were two gales due and the sheriff's officer went out and collected £2 9s. 6d.  In other words, the collection of 18/- cost £1 11s. 6d.  Has that anything to do with the steep step-up in the number of farms which are being crushed out of production? You are completely stripping the small farmer in this way.  And we are not dealing with the full annuities but with the halved annuities. When the full annuities were being paid, the amount of arrears amounted only to about half that sum.  I suggest to the Minister that his Department should review the entire position. There is no use in the House blindly proceeding in this way until we are confronted with a huge national problem.  Then we shall all come in and say that something must be done.</P>
    <P>It is not one problem we will have then; it will not be a question of dealing with these arrears, but we will be dealing with the question of the many farms completely out of production. There are Deputies here looking for land. When they were talking about land were they aware that there were 4,970 farms out of production?  They must be out of production if they are not able to pay rent and rates and if <Col N="2169" /> there is nothing for the bailiff to seize. That is the problem that really concerns me.  The work of the Department automatically goes on.  The division of land will be very important. On the present basis I am not going to approve of it.  My aim would be for a 50-acre farm, certainly not less than 40 acres.  If I ever have any responsibility&mdash;I hope I will not&mdash;and if I have to divide land, I will make a point of giving a man what he might call a farm.  Of course, if plots are required for agricultural labourers it might be possible to give them four, five or ten acres, but if I am going to make a farmer of a man I am going to give him every opportunity of being a farmer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate generally, I am only concerned with one item, which does not involve a very big sum.  Apparently the Department does not expect any floods this year, because they have reduced the amount laid aside for the maintenance of embankments.  I wonder if they are going to have an arrangement with the Board of Works in the case of abnormal floods and the breaking of embankments.  The amount set down here is only a nominal sum and I wonder if the Board of Works, under the employment schemes or some other machinery will, in case there is some disaster and the banks are swept away and agricultural land is flooded, repair the damage in order to save the crops.</P>
    <P>I think in Section 10 of the Land Act of 1939 powers were taken to retain the interest on land bonds.  I am prohibited from criticising legislation that the House has passed and I will only say this, that I consider that power should be exercised only in the very last extremity.  I must confess I do not know anything about this class of person&mdash;I do not come from them&mdash;but we must remember that we have intervened in their lives and in no case should the interest on the bonds be retained except in a case of dire necessity.  One can easily foresee the conditions of the type of people who depend upon the interest from these bonds as their means of livelihood.  If <Col N="2170" /> the powers of Section 10 were to be exercised a cruel hardship would be imposed on the people living on the small sum of money derived from the interest on these land bonds.  I appeal to the Minister, if any case of that kind arises, that this power should only be exercised in the last extremity. In cases where the circumstances are known and the people are depending on these sums of money, they should not be retained at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat at a disadvantage, inasmuch as the Minister's remarks did not convey very much to men like myself.  I hope that in the Official Report his remarks will be translated into the language which appears in the pages of that volume as a general rule.  I am therefore compelled to look at the various items in the Estimates and to get some information on them.  In regard to subhead M., loss on unoccupied holdings, there is a sum of £5 set out.  From my knowledge of the number of unoccupied holdings in the constituency I have the honour to represent, I know that that amount does not represent anything like the loss.  These holdings are undoubtedly a tremendous loss to the country, inasmuch as the ordinary rates have to bear both the unpaid rates and the unpaid land annuities with which these holdings have for many years been saddled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one such holding opposite the place where I live.  The land at one time bore a rent of £2 an acre and the place has a substantial valuation. Similar holdings elsewhere have a substantial poor law valuation.  Would it be possible to take over those holdings and use them for the purpose of subdivision making, of course, the necessary agreement with the former occupier as to what compensation he will get, either in the form of portion of the land or compensation in cash?  I am not aware of the position of the Land Commission with regard to paying compensation. This whole matter is a serious blot on the policy of the Land Commission, particularly at a time when the grow more food policy is such an insistent one.  People who <Col N="2171" /> might be occupying holdings and paying their Land Commission annuities and rates are not able to carry out the amount of tillage necessary because of the lack of capital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to 39,000 acres which were available for sub-division.  I do not know that I would be concerned with the actual acreage that the Land Commission have acquired or that is available for sub-division.  A far more important element is the class of people who are getting those lands.  Men who are willing and have the necessary agricultural education to work those lands properly are essential.  Agricultural education is becoming more and more necessary if we have in mind the proper economic working of land.  Enough is probably not being made of the available land of the country.  The giving over in a haphazard way of holdings, often of a considerable size, to men who have not the capital or the necessary experience or probably the inclination to work them, creates the type of position which was referred to in such very serious terms by the last speaker.  Deputy McMenamin with his very expert legal knowledge has been able to trace out from our records the number of farms that are practically gone out of production.  What can be more eloquent than the return of the sheriff to show what the position of agriculturists is in this country, when the Land Commission, with all the machinery at its hand, cannot collect the land annuities?  A large number of these farms had, at some period anterior to this, been divided and given to men for whatever reasons might be accepted by the inspector as suitable. In some cases I know men said they had the necessary capital to farm the land, but we know they had not.  We know they are in occupation of these farms and not having the capital they set them to other people to make money out of them.  Probably that might be a very good thing.  If there are people able to make money out of the land, then that would not be a great loss. It would not be such a loss as we might suspect from the figures given by Deputy McMenamin.  But we know it <Col N="2172" /> is a step in the wrong direction to hand over the most valuable property in the country, namely, the land, to men who are incapable of making a proper use of it.</P>
    <P>I happen to have put before the House on the Estimate last year the very serious position in our area when I enumerated a number of people who had got farms.  I am aware of one man who got 37 acres.  A portion of that is tilled, but most of the land is without crops.  Another man, a road worker, a man who took two prizes for his cottage, got five acres and though he wanted more land he was unable to get it.  There was a portion of the land on the Dinan estate adjoining Castlemartyr.  That land had been devoted to forestry, though there is no doubt it could be used for agricultural purposes.  Five acres were given to a man who had capital and had the necessary experience, because he once worked as an agricultural labourer.  This man had a couple of horses and his five sons were in a position to help to till and reclaim the land and to pull out the stumps of trees in the forestry portion. His application was refused, though the land was unfenced.</P>
    <P>That is one of the factors to which I would draw very serious attention. I think the Minister would probably have looked into it himself and I hope he will do something about it.  There is one great factor which should influence every inspector and that is to consider the claims of the smallholders first.  The smallholders, or men with perhaps even a medium farm, who have long experience of agriculture and who probably have a large family to help them, should certainly be considered. They could certainly make a better use of an addition to their farm than the man who has no previous experience of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The man with experience has a claim over and above the landless men, no matter what any Deputy may say to the contrary, but everyone is entitled to his own opinion.  The man with experience can get better economic results when his farm is enlarged than <Col N="2173" /> the man who has no experience of farm work but who is employed on a holding. I have no objection to an employee on an estate being given land if he has the necessary capital, but in a great many cases, though they claim they have capital, the capital is not there.</P>
    <P>There is one item in connection with the Estimate to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention&mdash;that is the Church Temporalities Branch.  I do not suppose any man pays to the Land Commission a tithe rent charge with any degree of cheerfulness. People resent paying that.  They feel that the Land Commission are getting something to which they are not entitled. The height of irony has, I think, been reached in the last Land Act, when I tell you that the funding of arrears that was previously permitted for this particular section has been abolished.  Large farmers have passed through as trying a crisis as any body of agriculturists could possibly have done in this country.  They have passed through the trials of what was known as the economic war.  They accumulated these arrears of tithe rent charges and annuities and they probably asked for time from the Land Commission.  The Land Commission, to their credit, have not pressed for these accumulated arrears till now.  I know I am not in a position to advocate legislation on this Vote but I am aware that before any farmer liable for tithe rent charges will get the advantage of half the tithe rent charge the arrears will have to be paid.  At any rate I would appeal to the Land Commission to hold their hands and not to enforce the warrants which they have handed to the sheriffs for collection in full.  These warrants amount in some cases to some hundreds of pounds.</P>
    <P>There is a very large number of very deserving people in this country who have not yet come under the Land Acts.  I refer to the sub-tenants.  Unfortunately these men are not aware in many cases of the advantages they can gain by being taken under the Land Commission.  Considering that the State has passed legislation to enable laboureres to purchase their cottages, <Col N="2174" /> surely to goodness the Land Commission can widen the position of these sub-tenants and enable many of them to come in.  This is a class who should reasonably be expected to get a decided advantage by land division and have their holdings enlarged. That is a matter that is very necessary to be looked after.  I am very slow to attack any Department of the Land Commission because the officials of this Department have been very lenient and I find them most courteous in all cases I bring before them.  But in the sub-division branch there is a decided hardship in the case of small portions of land which are taken over for the purpose of erecting houses under the Housing Acts.  A very long period elapses before the tenants of these plots can show the Housing Department they are in possession. That must eventuate in creating a very serious hardship on those people.  I ask that that particular side should be expedited as fast as possible on account of the desperate need that exists.  These are rural workers who suffer under this particular form of delay.</P>
    <P>There is another section too in connection with the long leases and fee farm grants who have suffered much. A great many of these cases are pending and if they could be taken up and expedited, relief would be given to a class of men badly in need of it.  I do not intend to delay the House much longer, but I do ask that where the question of compulsory tillage arises the Land Commission should remember that there are some people who are not able this year to stand up to it.  They are not able to get the necessary implements or the necessary capital. These people have to ask for elemency in that direction.  I am aware they have promised to do their best.  When I say that, might I mention that the State is the chief culprit in this matter of compulsory tillage.  There are large areas of land such as Moore Park, near Kilworth, in the possession of the Board of Works.  There are over 1,000 acres there and not one sod of it has been tilled.  While that is so, and while the State itself is the chief culprit, surely to goodness they cannot enforce <Col N="2175" /> compulsory tillage on other sections of the community who may find it very difficult to carry out these orders.</P>

      <P>When one recollects the debates that have taken place in this House, and the statements made by different Ministers, one must feel rather ashamed that, 18 years after the establishment of this State, we should still be discussing the acquisition and division of land. Recalling to mind the statements made here during the 16 or 17 years that I have been a member of the House, one would have thought that the acquisition and division of land would not be up for debate in the year 1940. That is particularly so when one recalls the statements made about the acquisition and division of land during the last seven or eight years by members on the Government Benches. But, judging from the debate this evening, we seem to be almost as far as ever from being finished with that task.  I think that is a shame when one bears in mind what the Land Commission is costing the country from year to year.  The division of land does not seem to have progressed very far in some parts of the country.  That certainly is the case in my constituency in East Galway where Deputy Beegan comes from.  We are as far from seeing the end of the division of land there as we were ten years ago. We have some very good farmers in that part of the country, and why the land there is not acquired and distributed I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton in what <Col N="2176" /> he said about the houses built on the new estates.  My opinion is that sufficient supervision is not exercised in the erection of those houses.  I would not care to go as far as Deputy Norton did, but I will say that one sees some very poor houses built by the Land Commission.  Some of them, although only erected 12 months, are in a very bad condition.  That is not right. Proper supervision should be exercised, and if a specification is prepared then the conditions in it should be carried out.  If supervisors are employed for this purpose, care should be taken to see that they know their job.  It is possible that a man may be a good land inspector and not a good housing inspector.  Even if it were necessary to have two sections set up so that this work would be properly done, I think it would be advisable to do that.  My suggestion is that good housing inspectors should be employed to see that the building is done in the right way.  We find also that where land was divided 14 or 15 years ago and houses built on it the houses look as bleak to-day as on the day they were erected.  I do not know whether that is the fault of the Land Commission or of the tenants, but at any rate no attempt is being made to put down shelter belts to protect the houses.  It is quite possible that the fault may be the tenants.  The Land Commission were responsible for the erection of the houses, and I think they should have taken care to see that a small corner of the land was cut off and shelter belts put down.  Many of those houses have a very dirty appearance, all for the want of a bit of shelter.  My own feeling is that if the Land Commission showed a good example in that respect the tenants would follow it.</P>
    <P>We find that at the present day the Land Commission are selling houses with small bits of property attached to them.  I know of two cases in my own constituency.  In one case the house is being tumbled down by the man who bought it, and the material sold.  I do not think the Land Commission should allow that because it is a wrong policy to pursue.  One case occurred within two miles of where I live. There the Land Commission advanced £600 towards the sale of this property. <Col N="2177" /> The house on it was of cut stone.  It was a fine extensive building, with the best of out-offices, and every other convenience needed.  The place was bought for £400, so that all the purchaser has to pay is £14 in interest on the £600 to the Land Commission. There are 65 acres of land going with the house.  If the Land Commission had made it known that the house could be dismantled they could easily have got £1,000 for the whole property. What they did was not right.  The benefit should have been given to the adjoining tenants.  Two good holdings could have been made out of the 65 acres.  I hope the Minister will take a note of that case.  What I think the Land Commission should have done was to dismantle the house themselves, sell the material and give the benefit of that to the people living in the area.</P>
    <P>In view of the policy of the Government to increase the area under tillage, some attention should be given to the the question of conacre.  The position with regard to this is very acute in the West of Ireland.  There you have people paying as much as £6 an English acre for conacre, and they have to travel four and five miles to get it.  The average price is about £4 an acre.  I would appeal to the Minister that in cases where the Land Commission have acquired lands and are not yet in a position to divide it, they should give it out at a reasonable rent in conacre.  It would be the means of increasing the area under tillage.</P>
    <P>The estimate for the improvement of estates shows a decrease of £150,000.  I think that needs some explanation. This work was, in many ways, of great benefit to the country. It meant that a good deal of drainage was done, that roads were made into turbary and so on.  Work of that kind was a great help to the people of the district.  We certainly should have some explanation from the Minister as to why useful work of that kind is being held up.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Perhaps before we proceed further I may be permitted to say that certain questions were raised, and certain suggestions made on the last day which I promised to look into, and see whether, after further examination of them, it would be desirable to introduce amendments.  I have done so, but I do not think that it would be desirable to change the Bill in regard to the matters raised.  There was, first of all, on Section 8 the question of making the initial salary continuous so that it could not be changed&mdash;to keep it to the same amount.  That would create a situation in which we would be widening out the circle of officers whose remuneration, which comes from public funds, could not be changed.  I think there is no likelihood that a change would be effected.  There would be an initial contract, and I think it is most unlikely, as the working of the scheme will be in the hands of the council, that any change would be effected in that way.  It was suggested that it might be used as a means of squeezing out some professor.  As full power of removal rests in the President, to be exercised on advice, it would be quite unnecessary, I think, to make provision for a smaller power.  Therefore, I have decided that I could do nothing in the way of changing that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question was raised by Deputy McGilligan on Section 9, that it was stated definitely in sub-section (3) that certain persons shall be appointed by the President, and in sub-section (5) &ldquo;appointed by the President&rdquo; is introduced parenthetically as it were.  The question is whether sub-section (5) imposes on the President the duty by law of making the appointment.  The advice that I received is that it does, that the words &ldquo;appointed by the President&rdquo; could have no other meaning in the context, <Col N="2179" /> so that it is deemed not to be necessary to make any change.</P>
    <P>Then, on Section 15, the question of the seal was raised by Deputy Dillon principally.  The question was whether the seal should be taken by itself as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that everything was done properly.  What is being done here is more or less common form. It occurs in the Electricity (Supply) Act and the Currency Act, and, generally, it was felt that the seal ought to be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the document was genuine and that the seal had been properly affixed.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 19, the question was raised whether the decision of the Minister for Finance should be taken as final.  In that case I think that the provision in the Bill is reasonable. There will be a scheme worked out at the start.  The scheme will be formulated by the council with the approval of the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance, and then it will be operated by the council.  Any dispute with regard to any claim or the amount of any claim of a professor who is being given a retiring allowance, a superannuation allowance, or a pension can only, in the first instance, be a dispute between the individual professor affected and the body operating the pension scheme, namely, the council. The Minister comes into it only when there is a dispute on the matter and he interprets the scheme.  That does not preclude recourse to the courts.  There is no doubt, however, that if the matter did come before the courts afterwards, due cognisance would be taken of the decision arrived at by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The next matter that I promised to look into was on Section 28 with regard to the audit and whether the accounts would be examined by the Public Accounts Committee.  It was agreed generally that we should have here whatever applies to the universities and, particularly the National University under the Act of 1908, which was mentioned by Deputy McGilligan. We have had that examined and it would appear that the provision here is quite similar and in effect would be the same as the provision in the Act of <Col N="2180" /> 1908.  Therefore it was not necessary to make any change.  I think it is right that I should give this explanation.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to ask the House to divide on this stage of the measure because it introduces the important principle of taking away from the universities important functions which had been regarded as definitely and clearly theirs.  That has been done without any attempt having been made to secure the approval of the university authorities as such. When speaking of this on the last occasion, the Taoiseach was careful to say that he believed that this measure when passed would meet with the approval of the university people.  It is significant that although two faculties in each university college are concerned, the academic council of three or possibly four colleges, the governing body of each of these colleges and the university senates, this scheme was not brought before any one of these numerous groups who might have been expected to have sufficient information and sufficient background to enable them to advise and give a lead on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that the foundation of this scheme, so far as it relates to Celtic studies, is something which <Col N="2181" /> happened at the Irish Language Committee of the Royal Irish Academy.  I have been informed that the scheme now before the Dáil in this Bill is a markedly different scheme from that which was proposed by the committee of the academy, and that it is not correct to say that this particular scheme has been put before the academy as such and received their approval.  So far as the academy as a body were approached they were merely asked to get certain information from the Irish Language Committee&mdash;this they did get and transmitted. When the scheme was transmitted &mdash;and the academy was recognised only as the channel for transmission&mdash;they were then given an opportunity to pass comment on the scheme which had been put forward by some of their own members.  They contented themselves with a noncommittal reply.</P>
    <P>I am consequently entitled to say on the whole that nobody of academic standing in the country has been invited to consider this Bill.  The Taoiseach cannot say that he is armed with the approval of any of the academic groups established by other measures who are undoubtedly in the foreground in the academic life of the country and who might have expected an invitation to pass judgment on this proposal or, in any event, to give advice about it.  That advice might eventually have been turned down as proceeding from prejudiced people, but, in any event, there were people there from whom advice might reasonably be sought.</P>
    <P>Care has been taken not to ask these people to submit their views on this matter.  It is, in the circumstances, very difficult to discuss the Bill and to appreciate fully what is proposed by it.  It was spoken of in general terms by the Taoiseach on the First Stage on 6th July last year and again on 10th April last on the Second Reading.  The statements made on these occasions are somewhat at variance.  As far as the Celtic studies part is in question, that was more or less taken for granted.  A special sort of pleading was heard that it was required to unearth manuseripts, <Col N="2182" /> edit texts, to compile a grammar of an exceptional kind, and we were asked to agree to the foundation of an institute for that work.  General phrases were used, all implying or expressing the view that the universities could not do that work.  Why they could not, I do not know, and no reasoned argument was advanced to show how or why the universities were unequal to this task.  When it came to the physics side, we were told that a Heaven-sent opportunity was presented to this country owing to the advent of three people who would be available here for work on the theoretical physics side. Who these people were I did not know when I was speaking in the House last week.  I have since learned their names.  At this point, it is proper to comment that during last week's debate, I asked if these three people had previously and always been professors in universities, and I think I added professors in universities only. I was told that that was the case with two of them only.  As far as my information now goes, it is true of all three, it being understood that one of them had had to leave his own country and was not, therefore, working under normal conditions.</P>
    <P>If what I am told is a fact, and if the three people whose chance appearance here presented this Heaven-sent opportunity were never other than university professors, is it not rather an odd circumstance that they who apparently have advanced to pre-eminence in the matter of research should have attained that pre-eminence on their work in universities without finding their research work in their universities hampered to any extent by their association with teaching?  That comment is certainly true with regard to two, and I am informed that it is, in the main, true with regard to the third, though the third man's career was somewhat abnormal, not for anything in connection with science but for something in connection with his race. Here then without any approach to them such as would enable the universities to be heard in the matter, a very big departure from the whole tradition of university education has been <Col N="2183" /> brought about and so far as the physics school is concerned, it has been made depend on the attraction to this country of three people, each of whom made his name in and about university institutions.  These three people were the main argument upon which the Taoiseach relied when discussing the question of a school of theoretical physics.</P>
    <P>I have tried to discover what principle runs through the statements made by the Taoiseach so that I might discuss this question in a brief way.  I find it impossible to get any real afliliation between the three statements of his ideas and I have to take the scheme as it is presented to me under separate heads.  The first point in the speech of the 6th July on Celtic studies was that at column 1967, where it was stated that the Celtic faculties turn out young men who show promise in Celtic scholarship but who, after going abroad on travelling scholarships, find that there is no work of a research type at which they can work and so are forced into business or the professions.  That might be a good argument for providing extra funds to enable young people of special talent to be occupied in connection with Irish studies, but it is no argument for transferring such work from universities.  If that is the only argument, it is quite clear that what is aimed at could be achieved by giving these extra moneys to the universities and ear-marking these funds for use solely on Irish studies, for the special matters detailed in this Bill in connection with the Irish side.</P>
    <P>There is no argument on that ground for having a separate institute, getting clean away from the universities, locating a few people in two houses in Merrion Square, but removing these people, in the main, from university life.  If there is any argument in this, it turned on the fact that young men in the Irish faculty or otherwise, showing certain talents, passing certain examinations at a certain point advanced themselves by a period of study abroad and then came back, and found nothing to do.  If it is intended to save these from drifting into professional <Col N="2184" /> work that could be done inside the universities.  On the second point made on July 5th, at column 1968, it was stated that the existing universities had two main objects, one to teach and the other to conduct research, and then there occurs the ominous phrase:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But, if you want to have this particular type of work done systematically, and if the State should, as I think it should, take over responsibility for seeing that it is done systematically for a time, I see no way in which it can be done except by the establishment of an institute of this kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If words have any meaning, that establishes that research must be systematised, that the State is to take on the burden of systematising research.</P>
    <P>On the second occasion on which he spoke on April 10th, the Taoiseach seems to have had a somewhat different view as then he admitted that research work is work which very often is merely haphazard.  But to keep for the moment to the 6th July debate here, in the forefront of it the Taoiseach said that if it is desired to have a certain type of work done, the State is to take over the responsibility for seeing that it is done.  There is no way, except by having it done through the State and the institute.  I do not see that that follows.  It is not a logical conclusion. I do not think it is the right method, and I see no good likely to accrue to anyone from the State delving into research.  The most that any State can do is to provide funds, and, as far as possible, to insist on these funds being at the disposal of people with talent of a particular type and to leave such people under the guidance of their professors to work according to how the mood and the subjects sway them. It is particularly a temperamental matter, and most good work judging by results has been done incidentally.</P>
    <P>It is getting back towards the Dark Ages to accept the idea that the State must interfere in such work, ordering what research work is required to be done and hoping that, from the payment of money for results, good results <Col N="2185" /> will follow.  Good results have hardly ever followed from that class of attention. I object, first of all, to the State having anything to do with this, except to increase the available funds, so that better financial provision may be made for research.  To proclaim that the State is going to systematise research is bad right at the start.  But even if the State were going to pursue that policy, I cannot see how the conclusion logically follows that this systematised research can only be done by an institute of the type proposed.  Incidentally, I am not sure that, in the end, if given the choice of State interference in the university system, under the pretence that the State could direct or guide research in their present position, the universities would not say: &ldquo;Take your institute and your interference away from our free academic system, and leave us as we are.&rdquo;  The proposal here lacks logic. The conclusion is not apparent from what has been previously said&mdash;that, if you are going to systematise research, it cannot be done except in an institute of the type described.</P>
    <P>We are told that one of the purposes of the institute is to attract from other countries people interested in Celtic studies.  If the attraction of people from abroad be an aim, how does that necessitate an institute?  If the provision of money, the granting of better accommodation in a variety of ways, the provision of a more leisurely occupation, the relief of people from the strain and worry of modern times&mdash;if all that is likely to create a movement in respect of Celtic studies which will attract people here from abroad, can it not be carried through by the existing university institutions?  How does it require the establishment of a separate institute?  We are told, as if it were an argument in favour of the institute, that one of the objects is to attract people from foreign countries. We are told that this country should be a world-centre of Celtic studies.  With that, I am in complete agreement. Why that was thrown in I do not know.  It does not tie in to any argument that tends to establish that an institute is required.  We are told later that the stress with which universities <Col N="2186" /> work, prevents their specialising to the extent that an institute would be able to specialise.  Why?  I find quite a lot of material in that.  That is thrown in, possibly, out of place.  It was put in, I think, as an aside in the speech of the 6th July.  It is referred to at greater length later and I shall deal with it later.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the speech of the 6th July, we are told that these schools will be devoted solely to the advance of learning and to the establishment of the reputation of the country as a centre of learning and that they will attract students of the post-graduate type from abroad.  It was held out that this institute would have nothing whatever to do with teaching.  The schools of the institute were to be centres of learning.  They were to be regarded as secluded shrines to which devout people&mdash;in the sense of being devoted to their subjects&mdash;would come to pay their respects. But these schools were to have no part in teaching.  That was definitely ruled out in the text of the speech of the 6th July.  The whole idea was to keep these people secluded, to keep them away from the universities, to save them from the bustle and hum of university life and from the stress of teaching which operates against the seclusion and quietude required for research. If that was intended to be a correct picture, then it was not a correct picture if we are to have regard to the later speech.</P>
    <P>When the matter was resumed on the 10th April, the Taoiseach was not going to speak at all, as he had previously spoken on the 6th July.  Under pressure from Deputy Mulcahy, he said that, although it would be more or less repetition, he would venture to speak again.  Quite early in his address on the 10th April, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The work could not possibly be carried out by the universities&rdquo;&mdash;this part of the speech deals mainly with Celtic studies&mdash;&ldquo;because it is of a different character from the work on which they are engaged.&rdquo;  Then a phrase was added that it could not be carried out by the academy because, as <Col N="2187" /> it more or less emerged, that was a resort for people who might meet on infrequent occasions to discuss things in a rather amateurish kind of way. In connection with the universities, the crude statement was made that this work for Celtic studies could not be done by them because it is of a different character from the work on which they are engaged.  That is developed in a number of phrases.  I shall take out one or two which, I think, indicate the chief idea.  Later in the debate the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A century or two ago, an institution for advanced learning such as is proposed here would have been regarded as needless duplication. That work would have been regarded as the proper work for the universities because, at that time precisely, the advancement, encouragement and fostering of advanced studies was the peculiar work of the universities. Universities of the present day have a very different task.  The advancement of knowledge in these later centuries has been so rapid that, in order to keep up with the advances made even in a very narrow branch during the lifetime of an individual, he would have to give his whole time to it.  The universities, therefore, if they wanted to perform that task would really need to have two separate branches, because the man who had to keep abreast of the knowledge that had been achieved up to that particular time would have to give his whole time to that without any question of teaching.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is developed at greater length, but it emerges as the chief ground of argument in this contra-distinction between teaching and research.  It develops into the contention that, because of the bustle of life in the university, it is impossible to have anybody there who will do teaching and research at the same time.  The speech continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of the modern universities, the greater part of the time <Col N="2188" /> of the professors and lecturers has to be devoted to teaching.  At one time, I thought it might be a very useful thing if we were to have two parts in our universities: one for teaching and the other mainly for advanced research work but, then, the cost of that to the community would be far greater than what is proposed here under this system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That stumbled me.  Take, say, University College, Dublin.  In a particular faculty, you have a number of professors, lecturers, demonstrators and assistants.  By degrees, the work is evened out to the point where the big class and examination work is taken by the lecturers, demonstrators and assistants.  You have the professors keeping definite touch with the classes, but what might be called the routine teaching is done by those in the junior ranks of the staff.  Above, you have either a professor or two professors&mdash;I am speaking of a faculty all the time&mdash; and a considerable portion of the time of these professors is devoted to research.  By the statutes of the different colleges and the charter of the university, one of the functions of any full-time professor in any of the colleges is to engage in research.  You have part of the staff with the duty imposed upon them by statute of taking part in research.  It may be argued that some of the classes have grown so big and unwieldy that even the junior staff are not able to handle the routine work and, in any event, some professors have the idea that research benefits from touch with students and the teaching of classes. As long as that idea is about, something might be said for lessening the burden in the really rare case of the professor whose mentality is such that he cannot face a class with case and regards the class and the teaching of the class as a definite distraction.  But, here, it is said that to develop that system would cost far more than the institute will cost.</P>
    <P>Take the subject of theoretical physics.  It is proposed to set up a separate institute, one college of which will be devoted to theoretical physics. I do not know what sum will be devoted <Col N="2189" /> to that particular school.  We are told that something in the nature of £30,000 is involved when the two schools are working at the maximum. Let us take some part of that, say, £5,000.  Minimising the sum cuts both ways, but supposing it is going to be £5,000, what is going to be accomplished for that sum?  We are to get the benefit of one person of eminence who has made his name as a professor in a university.  He is going to devote possibly his whole time to the institute. We had another man, always attached to the university system, who now proposes to live his life out in that system and has taken a step recently which ensures that he will. Then you have the third man who, during all his time in England or Scotland, has been attached to a university system and who, perhaps, until he was retired by age from that university system, did devote himself to it and lived all his life in it.</P>
    <P>For £5,000 you are to get those three. You are going to get an affiliation with one, possibly a better affiliation with the second, and possibly the full-time assistance of the third.  For what purpose? To conduct research.  How does it add to the expense if you allocate that £5,000 to one of the university colleges and appropriate it for the purpose of research in theoretical physics? How would that add to the cost?  I can see an addition to the cost.  A college has its overhead expenses in connection with management and administration. The additional rooms that would be required for the full or part-time use of three professors is not going to be so heavy a burden as to enlarge the overhead expenses of the university.  But for the purpose of the institute a new building will have to be taken, there is to be a new registrar-bursar and new officials.  I do not say that this cost could be so much as to deter people from incurring it if every other argument tended in favour of the establishment of the institute. I do not think it is a very big point, but, so far as cost is concerned, the cost argument tends against the institute and in favour of the university.</P>
    <P>Later on we are told that the universities, <Col N="2190" /> on account of the complexity of modern life, have to devote most of their time to preparing students, making them fit for the part which each one will have to play in life.  Then there is a sudden jump to the students. We are told about the long seven-year period that the student has to spend in intensive work on his own particular profession, trying to acquire the knowledge which is necessary for him if he is to bring to the service of the community the knowledge which has already been gained.  What the length of time the student has to spend in preparation has to do with the professor, I do not know, unless the Taoiseach imagines that because some course has been extended out over a period of seven years the labour imposed on the teacher is proportionately increased. The Taoiseach does know that in the courses connected with the medical faculty there are certain divisions and the professors meeting students in one year of that course may never see them again or may see them only occasionally.</P>
    <P>We are told of the complexities of university life, of the bustle and the hum which prevent a man who requires seclusion from conducting research even in the building where teaching is carried on.  We are told by the Taoiseach in column 1080 that it is very important that the universities devote themselves to arranging a programme by which, in the shortest time, a person can arrive at the stage when he is reasonably fit to enter into a profession. The Taoiseach goes on to say that with that pressure it is quite obvious that very little research work of a proper kind could be done; that by research work he means exploring new fields and advancing the frontiers of knowledge.  To do that, he says, one requires, first of all, men who can devote themselves exclusively to it, keeping themselves abreast of the knowledge of the times, and students of special ability who can be trained to succeed such men.  There is there an insistence on exclusive devotion to research.  A little later it emerges that that is not exactly what is in his mind, for later on it appears these institute professors are to deal with <Col N="2191" /> advanced students, who, when they have travelled extensively and have come back from their labours abroad, are to be the students under the institute professors.</P>
    <P>But here is stressed the value of pure research&mdash;of exploring new fields and advancing the frontiers of knowledge&mdash; and the institute is for men who can devote themselves exclusively to it. That argument was, I think, repeated later on, but it is put in its strongest form here.  Possibly it may have been put to a point of exaggeration that was not meant.  After that there was a rather abrupt jump made by the Taoiseach to a quite different point, and this is a point on which I would like a little more concrete information. I have been in touch with university people in the last five or six days, since this Bill was in Committee, and I cannot find anybody who agrees with the generality of the statement made here, or even with that statement narrowed and limited very considerably. We are told again in column 1080 that the need for such an institute as is proposed here has been felt in practically every country in the world. The Taoiseach goes on to say that side by side with all the universities, in most countries, you will find an institute of this kind.  You will find it in the great and in the small nations, and he mentioned that in Denmark there is a number of them.  It is remarkable that on the Committee Stage, when we asked for examples, we were given two, Princeton and Kharkov.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we get a third. Kharkov is the capital of the Ukraine; Princeton has not a very good reputation amongst university institutions or any other sort of institution.  So far as Kharkov is concerned, I never heard of it except in some books that I read recently where it was associated with what was called the proletarianisation of education, as that is proceeding in Russia.  I there read that there were certain opportunities offered in Kharkov&mdash;one amongst others of certain technical institutes <Col N="2192" /> mentioned.  But that surely was an amazing statement that in practically every country in the world you will find institutes of this kind.  The Taoiseach said that in Denmark there was a number, and now it appears there is one at Copenhagen&mdash;there may be others.  So far we have Kharkov, Princeton and Copenhagen.  I know there were others in America and I have been informed that institutes of this kind were started from time to time, but that almost invariably the result has been that inside a 20 year period they were reabsorbed in the university system.</P>
      <P>I will vote against this measure being passed at the moment, but if it is passed I here express the hope that this institute will eventually be reabsorbed in the university system and, in so far as I have anything to say to it, I regard it as a fairly delectable morsel eventually to be swallowed up by University College, Dublin, wherein will be done any work that it is proper to do.  There have been examples of this kind in the world, but they have met with this fate that, after a trial lasting over a limited period, they swung back again into the orbit of the university system.  I quoted to the academic people whom I consulted this statement of the Taoiseach and had it doubted that this phrase had been used.  I was disbelieved when I quoted the phrase used by the Taoiseach, and I had to produce the text to prove its use.  I failed to find anybody to agree with his statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Side by side with all the universities in most countries you will find an institute of this kind the need for which has been felt in practically every country in the world.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I definitely contradict the Taoiseach when he speaks so&mdash;his statement is far removed from accurately describing the number or the extent of these institutes.</P>
      <P>Later, in column 1081, we come to a new argument.  There he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Universities as they are at present organised cannot be depended upon to do the work of <Col N="2193" /> advanced knowledge and to prepare research workers of an advanced type.  The type of student who might come to an institute of this sort would be a student such as in the National University would get a travelling scholarship.  He must certainly be of first-rate ability and he would have to had done a preparatory course equivalent to securing an M.A. degree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then&mdash;oddly enough&mdash;this is added:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is why we have a special reason for having such an institute as is proposed for Celtic studies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are to be students, students of an advanced type.  What is the argument that is founded upon these travelling students?  I can understand the argument that it is a pity to have people brought to a particular kind of perfection only to find after they have so utilised their abilities that there is no scope for their special talents and that they must divert themselves into the professions.  I can imagine people saying: &ldquo;We will make provision that a certain number of these will be saved for university work,&rdquo; but the way to do that would be to advance additional money to the universities and earmark it for that purpose.  I do not know how numerous are the people who go abroad and who, when they come back, are not satiated with advanced learning, but desire a continuance of their studies. If they are very numerous, then to provide opportunities for them will cost more money than has yet been spoken of.  If they are not numerous, the position will be easier.  But whether the group be large or small they will be retained for the purpose of higher education and research inside the body of the university system. That was what the Taoiseach said on the 10th April when opening the Second Reading debate on this Bill.  Certain other arguments were used, but I do not know that they were different from those I have referred to.  In column 1105 of the Official Report for the 10th April, 1940, when closing the debate the Taoiseach spoke at length.  At column 1105 he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2194" />&ldquo;It should be clear to everyone that all that is intended here is to supplement the work that cannot, under the pressure of modern conditions be given full attention in the universities; ...to supplement that by making it possible to have the work done under conditions of less stress than if it were done by the universities.  It is ridiculous to say that this is taking away from the universities.  It is not.  Universities have not been able to do this type of work in any country, and in particular have not been able to do it here...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the universities had not been able to do that type of research work aimed at under this institute, how does it come that three eminent men of science already referred to have been able to do their best work at universities? One of them even did it here, in this country, in a university institution of this country.  These are the three main arguments for the establishment of the school of theoretical physics.  Yet we are told that the universities cannot possibly do this work, that they have not been able to do it in any country.  But these three men have done it; one in Germany, one in Scotland, and one in Dublin, did their work so as to reach a point of pre-eminence that marks them out for selection to this institute, and they did all their work in universities. Yet the Taoiseach condemns the system which brought these men forth.</P>
    <P>We are told at the end of column 1105 that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount of research that can be done by anyone who has to teach a number of classes with various grades of students for a number of years is relatively small.  He cannot have time to do it.  A certain amount of research work will continue to be done.  In fact, it must be done if there is any enthusiasm at all in the professor, or if he is going to enthuse his students.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the Taoiseach said in columns 1105 and 1106, 10th April, 1940, of the Official Debates.  Afterwards, in column 1106, in answer to <Col N="2195" /> Deputy Mulcahy the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It (the institute) will also help the universities because the professors who will be in these institutions will be expected to give lectures in the colleges in Dublin on their own particular subjects.  These occasional lectures will be open to students of the colleges and to the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another part of this speech already referred to we had the institute professors paraded as people who are to devote themselves exclusively to research.  There were to be three or four men who would require a desk, some writing material, some paper and some rooms in a couple of old houses in Merrion Square There was conjured up the picture of a place surrounded by cob-webs, the argument being that the bustle of university life would prevent devotion to research and that the necessary seclusion almost involved the cob-webs. But here and later on we have it that the teaching of students is a necessary function and that the institute professors are people to whom travelling students will resort.  Then secondly we have it that they will be expected to give lectures on their own particular subjects to the students of the colleges and to the public.  I had thought in the beginning that the basis of the institute was the argument that there are people to whom teaching was such a dis traction that they should not be asked to spend time on it, people to whom the mere thought that they were cooped up with other professors who had students, would so disturb them that the research work could not be carried out.</P>
    <P>Now we are getting the other side. You are now to have professors in the institute who will impart the information they have.  They will first concern themselves with the type of student who has become a travelling student.  They will attract people of culture from other countries and they will give lectures in the colleges, such lectures as will be open to the students and to the members of the public. And yet the distinction between teaching and research was the very foundation of the institute.  If <Col N="2196" /> now this burden of teaching is to be put upon them what has become of the argument on which the removal of these studies from the university system was founded?  Is it not possible to say to the governing bodies of the university colleges: &ldquo;We think that you have one of those rare geniuses who cannot be expected to give of his best when asked to do any considerable or even any small amount of teaching and examination work.  We give you a certain additional amount of money.  Let it be provided in respect of that money that that individual will do no teaching or only a very limited amount of teaching.  Let him confine himself almost entirely to research work, but as we do not want to lose the fruit of the research let him impart his information to advanced students of the travelling studentship class and to such students only&rdquo;?  So it appears that it is considered proper to expose our specialists in research to contact with the student body, to impose on them the duty of giving occasional lectures to students to which the public, if they are interested in them, may be admitted.  Why cannot that be put down instead of making this divergence between the institute, as such, and the university system that we have erected here?</P>
    <P>Later we find the argument in column 1106 that people get travelling scholarships and that, when they come back, find there is no equipment and no career open to them.  If it is only a question of providing equipment and a career, that can be done by the provision of money.  Why channel that money away from the university system?  What in this is the argument for the institute?  Towards the end of the speech in column 1108 there came the worst blow of all from the point of view of the universities.  Previously the Taoiseach had based the school of Celtic studies on the special work to be done such as the compilation and unearthing of manuscripts, etc.  What is the case for cutting that out of the university system?  Then, we had reference to a special situation permitting and demanding the school of theoretical physics&mdash;created by the three individuals.  But from the university point of view a terrifying <Col N="2197" /> vista is opened up by what the Taoiseach said in column 1108:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I did not want to have in this scheme one school which would give the wrong impression that it was simply an additional organisation to promote Irish studies.  It is intended to be something different. It is a further stage in the general edifice of education and learning in this country, and it is needed.  It is intended to be a modest beginning but fairly representative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This institute is to be part of &ldquo;the general edifice of education and learning in this country.&rdquo;  I take it that these words are divorced from the context of Celtic studies.  &ldquo;It is intended to be a modest beginning but fairly representative.&rdquo;  That opens out this future for the universities, that there is to be a scheme of institutes with a number of schools, and each, presumably, is to be founded on the same argument, that research work of a particular type is not possible in the faculties that would more or less represent these schools in the university system.  Research work must be handed over to those secluded people, working apart from the universities. There are two points in that: one, by implication, a criticism that the universities have not been doing research work in particular matters, and, secondly, that for the future they are not going to be allowed to do research work&mdash;some research work in any event&mdash;in those faculties.  The institute, therefore, is to be part &ldquo;of the general edifice&rdquo; of education in the country.  I may be misinterpeting that.  It may only mean it is to be part of the general edifice in regard to Celtic studies, but I think the words have a wider context when you have the phrase that it is intended to be &ldquo;a modest beginning but fairly representative.&rdquo;  In view of those words I do not think there can be any mistake.  Therefore, I believe that what I have read into those words is really there.</P>
    <P>Later, we return to the teaching business.  At column 1111 the Taoiseach said that the work to be <Col N="2198" /> done in this institute &ldquo;will not be that of ordinary teaching.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be the teaching of advanced students and the leading of them along lines of research while enabling the professors themselves to proceed along the same lines.  For the reasons I stated you cannot do research work in the universities at present.  When a professor is working at a class a brilliant student may suggest something that is particularly interesting.  The professor cannot delay and pursue that interesting topic if it opens into a special subject.  If that happened with advanced students in the institute, they would immediately stop ordinary work and pursue a line of investigation of that sort.  In the university students have to cover a definite course and suggestions of this kind could not be dealt with in the short time available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is some obfuscation there on the part of the Taoiseach, and that he must have his mind fixed on, say, the medical schools of the universities, with a recognition of the fact that the majority of the people who go to them go for the purpose of qualifying for a profession and getting a money-making occupation, but, surely, that statement is not to be taken as depicting the ordinary life of the universities.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The professor cannot delay and pursue that interesting topic if it opens into a special subject ... students have to cover a definite course and suggestions of this kind could not be dealt with in the short time available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, they would not be dealt with in the ordinary time available. They would be dealt with by the professor in his research time.  Take the case of the medical professors&mdash;I do not mean those who are at work only part-time&mdash;but the full-time professors on the medical side.  Does the Taoiseach believe that more than, say, one-tenth part of their wakeful activity is devoted to teaching?  As far as this is put forward as a thumb-nail <Col N="2199" /> sketch of university life, one gets the impression that the Taoiseach believes that the university professor is teaching more or less during an eight-hour day: that he has no time to spare for anything except the course, and, that the course is so long and difficult to get over, he would not have time to attend to suggestions that might come from a brilliant student.  That is a complete misconception of the situation.  You have professors who do occasionally get suggestions from students.  In any event, whether they get them or not, something that a student does wakens a train of thought in the professor's mind which leads him to a particular type of research.  I believe that it is possible, and often happens, that the professor has plenty of time to pursue that subject.  He has people working in the laboratories who can help him, and he can go to other professors engaged on kindred branches of work for their help and pursue this particular idea along lines which their science will help.</P>
    <P>Take the other side of the picture. Is there going to be plenty of time for research work in the two or three houses in Merrion Square?  Are there going to be lots of opportunities for getting suggestions from brilliant students there? You are going to have a less numerous student body there.  I would remind the Taoiseach that professors do not always get the most valuable suggestions to proceed along a particular line of research from the most brilliant students.  It very often happens that an individual, with very little learning, does a thing in an awkward sort of way, and this leads to an interrogatory as to whether some lines of advance could not be made along the lines that are being indicated.  If the men in the two or three houses in Merrion Square are going to have more time for research, they are going to have less contacts with the people there from whom those ideas may be derived.  The Taoiseach's statement, as a short sketch of university life, is the most appalling thing that I have ever read&mdash; that in the universities students have to cover a definite course, and that <Col N="2200" /> when a brilliant suggestion comes from a student it cannot be dealt with in the short time available.  If a bright suggestion does come from a student, then, so far as the universities are concerned, there is no limit to the time in which the matter may be pursued.  A professor teaching a class may get a suggestion, or something may be done to excite a train of thought in him.  It may be ten years afterwards when he gets a result.  An analysis of the Taoiseach's thesis creates the impression that he believes a suggestion made in a class would more or less be worked out in the class period or in the year in which the class was being run.  That, of course, is too ludicrous to require any further argument.</P>
    <P>At the end we are told that the Taoiseach believes that we have the goodwill of the universities, of the academy, and of the people of Ireland as a whole.  If there was any anxiety about the goodwill of the universities, an attempt could have been made to get it, by letting them know what is proposed, and requesting their views. Instead of that, as I understand, the only approach made was through the Irish Language Committee of the academy, people to whom a bait was held out by the foundation of the institute, and to one university professor, who was also tempted.  There are faculties, authorities, people of different types of thought and, possibly, there might have been divergence of thought on the matter.  Surely it would be worth while investigating that. The Taoiseach has a connection, through a position which he holds, with one university authority and one would expect that it might at least have occurred to him to test the opinion of the body that was close to him on this matter.  Yet the procedure is that the measure is introduced and the pious hope is expressed that we will get the goodwill of the universities.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to tie these ideas together.  If there is anything in the way of an idea in the Taoiseach's head it is that the universities are too much absorbed in the day-to-day tasks, and that it is not possible in the atmosphere <Col N="2201" /> of the university system to get research of same type done.  I cannot understand how anybody could have that viewpoint.  As far as ordinary research is concerned, it has been done and done effectively all over the world and here in and through university institutions, and the occasions upon which there has been a breaking out into institutes of this type have been rare.  In the main, as I am informed, when these exceptional attempts have been made to found an institute, one finds the institutes eventually coming back to the university system.</P>
    <P>I sought for some information on this point from academic people, and any I got was adverse to the scheme. I was referred to certain books.  So far as one book is concerned which dealt with higher education in America, it spoke of knowledge as a unity which may have to be pursued through particular phases, that it had to be broken up into particular phases for ease in working.  But the people who pursue the knowledge have still to remember the unity there is about the whole matter.  So it is the pursuit of knowledge can only be carried out properly in such a university institution where there are a number of professors occupied with the details of the ordinary sciences, where one could bring his mind to bear on the problems of the other, could lend assistance in the problems of the other, bring his learning to bear on the particular problem in his colleague's mind, and assist his colleague when the pursuit led along a particular channel.  That was one aspect.</P>
    <P>I did find that in Germany at a particular period, under the authority of a Minister for Education in Prussia, there was a system by which these institutes developed.  But even the Minister who developed it insisted on the full equipment of the faculties in the different universities for research proper.  He insisted on giving them all that they required in the way of equipment, staff, leisure, and everything else; that is, the university system was his first care.  He then went on in this way: He held that even under <Col N="2202" /> ideal university conditions you might get here and there a rare genius who would squander in teaching or administration abilities that ought to be concentrated upon research.  He planned research institutes, very few in number, and always built around, not a subject, but an individual; and so in practice he carried out the theory which he had. The chief institute which was developed under his scheme was an institute for research in experimental therapeutics for an individual named Wasserman and, when he died, the institute was about to collapse.  It was then discovered that they had another of these rare geniuses&mdash;Professor Neuberg&mdash;and the institute was turned over to him as an institute of biochemistry, and after his death, I understand, the institute lapsed for a number of years.</P>
    <P>That was the situation as he saw it; that here and there you get a rare genius whose abilities would be wasted in teaching and who ought to devote himself to research.  These institutes were not of the type that we have here, because they were freer, even in Germany, from the sort of control that we have proposed here, Here and there an institute would develop and these institutes were built around an individual and, in the main, those institutes either collapsed or were re-absorbed in the university system when the individual for whom they were established had passed away.</P>
    <P>A series of lectures was given dealing with universities and institutes, referring very specially to this particular scheme of institutes as developed in Prussia at that particular time.  These lectures were afterwards expanded into a book and the person who lectured and who afterwards wrote the book said this when speaking of the disadvantages of research institutes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The university has at hand a student body from which &lsquo;novices and apprentices&rsquo; may be drawn by professors who have had the opportunity to ascertain their merits .... Again in the complexity of modern science, there is no telling from what <Col N="2203" /> source the magic fact or the magic conception will come.  The very breadth of the university increases its potential fertility&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He winds up in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Far more hopeful, in my opinion, than the rapid multiplication of research institutes would be the freeing of existing universities from inhibitions and encumbrances, and their development into instruments competent to perform well their proper functions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that may be what is required here.  It may be that there are certain of these rare geniuses in university life at present, that they are the sort of people to whom even a small amount of teaching is a distraction, and that they ought to be freed from that.  I see no reason for attempting to break up the university scheme as we have known it and to take away from university people what were previously functions of theirs.</P>
    <P>If this scheme is to be carried out, is it not incumbent to consider it from the point of view of its personnel?  Who will be appointed to the new institute? Are they to be drawn from any university college?  Will that university college be the same as it is now without these people?  Will the university improve when these people are taken away from it?  Will these people improve by being put in two or three houses in Merrion Square?  Supposing the person in the physics section was still free&mdash;he is no longer free&mdash;would University College, Dublin, lose by being deprived of his services?  Would the country gain by having him transferred from his university work to these two or three houses in Merrion Square? Are the people who are going to be transferred from the life of the university likely to be more or less indolent in the seclusion of two or three houses in Merrion Square?  Are they going to lose anything by being deprived of what has been referred to as the stimulating touch with their own colleagues <Col N="2204" /> and the still more stimulating touch with students?  These brilliant men are being taken from the place where they have made their reputations and where they had better opportunities than they are likely to get in the institute.</P>
    <P>I put forward these arguments at this late stage, having had very little opportunity of consulting on this matter people who are in a much better position than I am to tell this House and the country what is the proper situation with regard to this institute. I think we have a definite source of complaint that touch was not made with these people; that they were not given an opportunity to express their views; and that from a body of informed opinion&mdash;because we have no informed opinion in this House on the matter&mdash;we should have the benefit of having someone with informed opinion produced in this House telling us what is the position with regard to these institutes elsewhere; what has been their fate, and what has been the fate of university colleges from which temporarily even some of these men were removed.  On the information I have I feel bound to vote against the Bill, and if it goes through I should like to assert that, as far as I can at any time in the future, sway those in Government, I will try to get this institute brought back to the academic group from which it should never have been separated, and associate it with University College, Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone through a very weird experience in dealing with this measure.  Deputy McGilligan picked out in one respect some of the weirdness that one gets of a picture of the new research institute in Merrion Square&mdash;cobwebbed and gloomy&mdash;with people working there, I might say, without any sense of time; working on the boundaries of no knowledge as the Taoiseach suggested.  I draw a brighter picture, because I consider the proposals here for the work intended are as sensible and as promising as if certain classes <Col N="2205" /> of experimental work for the propagation of plants, or for improving the soil were going to be taken away from the Albert College and carried on in some window-boxes in Merrion Square. The Bill was introduced in July last. Without seeing the light at all, the Taoiseach's remarks gave me a kind of sense of things to come, and I recalled in connection with the school for experimental physics the remarks of a great Frenchman on a particular occasion, when a change was being brought about that would take religious teaching out of the French schools and substitute physics, &ldquo;that it was a pale flower without a root, but, perhaps, not without a perfume.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly as far as the institute of experimental physics is concerned the description of the root is very close to the mark.  We were to have the Taoiseach making the school of experimental physics a modest addition to render the picture rather complete and fairly representative, what the additional developments would be. It was easy to include it in that scope, because all that was wanted was an adequate library, the brains, the men, and the paper, but the paper shortage at the present time is nothing to the shrinkage that is taking place in the supply of men for this institute.  Three men were to be available, but two are not now available, and one who is already in the country, and is working, is the sole remnant of the roots from which this institute was to be developed.  I say that the experience has been weird. Only one voice has been raised in the House on the Government proposal dealing with the advancement of Celtic studies, and the restoration of the glorious name for mathematical qualities that our people held in the middle of the last century.  The case has been presented as if the Taoiseach was a kind of shadowy spectre.  He used a considerable amount of words subsequently in dealing with this matter, spoke rather of gestures and knobs, but not a single inspiring or illuminating word was spoken by him on what advanced Celtic studies meant to our people.  Not an inspiring word was spoken by him as to what having <Col N="2206" /> our name held in respect throughout the whole world or being again a school of learning, including mathematics, would mean to our people.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is so wound up, and so devoted to re-establishing or developing a name for this country for learning that he can come in here without consulting any of the bodies Deputy McGilligan spoke of, as to the development of the institutions or what they are going to bring about, surely one might expect that we would have some inspiring appeal from him that would direct our views and warm our hearts as to what is possible if we get this institution working.  Not an informative word has been spoken, and we are now left with a proposal to build up one of these institutes around a very eminent and a very distinguished scientist, no longer capable of pursuing his work in other countries, but happily whose services we are to have here.  We are able to give him a home and able to allow him to pursue his work here and to take whatever advantage there is from pursuing that work in our midst and being in contact with people who can benefit by it. But to think that, because we have that advantage and that chance, we are to strip our universities of work that has been done, or of men working there, is simply a very haphazard proceeding. It has been pointed out by Deputy McGilligan that the men who were to form the foundation root of this institution were the product of universities, were working in universities, and in so far as the one person of the three connected with this country is concerned, that he was a product of our university, was working in our university, and would be a loss to our university system.</P>
    <P>In respect of advanced Celtic studies, I think that the case made by Deputy McGilligan, that research benefits from contact with students, applies particularly. There is the other side to it, that in the institution where students are pursuing Celtic studies, the whole leaven of the work must inevitably be raised by the fact that they are in touch with the higher research work which is being done. <Col N="2207" /> Take advanced Celtic studies, remove them from the university and house them in a building away from the university, and you lower the standard of work being done in the university in Celtic studies.  The fragrance of the advanced work that is to be done in an institution like this will mean very little to our country or our reputation if the normal pursuit of Irish studies amongst the normal class of student or the normal people of the country is slowed up.  It will mean little to us if the result be the lowering of the standard, the impoverishment of the atmosphere in which the work of the university is being done or the retarding of the work of saving the language as a living language amongst our people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach looks questioningly at me while I make these remarks.  I ask the Taoiseach to explain to us, even at this late hour, what is going to be the effect on higher studies in the Irish language in the National University if the work dealing with even the preparation of grammars and other branches of higher study are to be put outside the walls of University College. No inspiring or warming contribution has been made as to what is to come from this work.  On the other hand, in the manner outlined by Deputy McGilligan, you can strengthen the atmosphere of the university and bring about a livening of the university mind, which must inevitably pass itself quickly and rapidly to the students. Again, with a more stimulated intellectual development in the lower ranks of the university, you will get&mdash;and only in that way will you get&mdash;the soil that will produce men and women who will pursue those higher studies.  The divorce of higher studies from university life will simply injure university work and make all the higher studies sterile, barren and fruitless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think that it was possible to have so much nonsense talked on a subject like this as I have been listening to for the past hour or so.  It has been suggested that the university is going to be stripped of its functions in regard to research. <Col N="2208" /> One would imagine that we were going to say to the professors of the universities: &ldquo;Thou shalt not continue research work.&rdquo;  Where is the stripping? Is it not quite obvious that this institute will help to stimulate work in the universities, that it will enable some of the professors to do more research work than it has been possible for them to do up to the present?  I was speaking to one of the professors of the National University the other day about this question.  He said that one of the great boons of this institute would be that there would be immediately available to the professors up-to-date, direct knowledge with regard to development in certain branches of study which, if they themselves had to seek it and to master the literature appertaining to it, would take up their whole time.  It is nonsense to say that this proposal will take away anything from the universities.  It will be complementary to the research work being done in the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be well to take the the school of Celtic studies first, deal with it and then deal with the school of theoretical physics.  With regard to the question of research, any professor in the universities can continue his own individual researches.  He may have a student in the advanced classes to whom he will give a thesis on a particular line of investigation which that student would pursue for a year or two.  That is the end of that matter so far as that student is concerned.  The professor gets another student the next year and, if the particular line of research is not finished, he gets this student to pursue the same line.  The result is that there is no continuity. If there were an arrangement by which a student like that would be kept on, you would have continuity.  It is precisely that type of continuity which will be made possible by this institute. Deputy McGilligan would say: &ldquo;Give it all over to us in our college and we will do it just as well&rdquo;.  I do not think so.  Suppose we wanted to set up a special branch of industrial research. Would we hand it over, say, to University College, Dublin?  I know they could do it but it would not come ordinarily into their line of work and <Col N="2209" /> it would be very much better to have it carried out by an independent body. That would not mean a complete divorce from the work being done in University College.  If the institution were doing its work properly, it would try to interest the professors in the branches with which it was dealing and get their co-operation.  It would be a centre of co-operation for the particular branches in the university and the particular professors concerned, whether professor of chemistry, physics or engineering.  In the same way, this institute will be able to organise work along special lines when these lines seem to indicate a possibility of fruitful advance.  The first fundamental mistake is to suggest that you are taking away something from the universities. There is no function of the universities at the present time and there is no research work which it is possible for the professors in the universities to conduct at present which cannot be continued in the future.  In fact, they will be enabled to conduct their work better by the establishment of this institute.</P>
    <P>The only case of substance made up to the present is the case which suggests that whatever money is available&mdash;£15,000, £20,000 or £27,000&mdash; should be handed over to University College, Dublin, which would do better work than would be done by the institute. There, we shall have to agree to differ.  I think that that is not so.  We could have organised folklore research within the framework of University College, Dublin, but we did not do that because it was a definite piece of work which had to be supervised in a special way and we thought that an independent body would be the better body to deal with it.</P>
    <P>When we were dealing with the publication of the Irish historical manuscripts we could, undoubtedly, have given the money that was devoted for that purpose to University College, Dublin, and we could have said to them: &ldquo;You can get this work done through the professors as a part of the college work, within the college regulations and system.&rdquo;  But that was not done.  It was done <Col N="2210" /> in another form, in a way in which it was considered that it could be done more effectively.  I believe, whether you talk about folklore or the manuscripts, these two <i>ad hoc</i> bodies did their work much more effectively than it would be done if it was brought into the ordinary college system.</P>
    <P>In regard to the school of Celtic studies, there are two things to be done.  There is, first of all, the making of this country the principle centre of Celtic studies in the world.  The next thing that has to be done is this: there is a mass of material which is available and the work on which can be organised.  I admit it is not always possible to organise research in a definite way.  Sometimes when you are travelling along the by-paths you may come across the richest vein for development.  It is possible, in regard to this question of working through a mass of material, to organise it, but the only people who can organise it are the people who have reached a certain eminence which enables them thoroughly to understand and supervise the editing of that material.  That can be systematised and worked over a period of years.  This school of Celtic studies can engage in the editing and production of that mass of material, which is of tremendous importance for the development of the language.</P>
    <P>There is another work which could be systematically engaged in, and that is the production of improved dictionaries.  That is a work which could be done over a period of years. Nobody will suggest that the Irish dictionaries in use are by any means complete.  You can have a professor of eminence, a man who knows his work, continuously directing the improvement of these dictionaries and the production of new ones.  The moment one edition is produced, the same band of workers could be set to work to improve that one and give us a newer edition.  The same is true in regard to the question of Irish grammar. Not merely have middle and classical modern Irish to be examined and grammars made available for students, but there is great need of <Col N="2211" /> grammars of the language of the present day, dealing with the different dialects and so on.  An individual professor in any one of the colleges can undertake that work.  A university professor can spend his spare time arranging and compiling a grammar and he can give us an authoritative work.  He would be working largely alone; he cannot have a number of workers with him constantly and you require the same workers if you want the work done effectively.  Even the most advanced students will be passing out of his immediate control sooner or later.</P>
    <P>In this institute it is possible so to arrange that you will have a continuity of assistants under direction in the examination of dialects, the production of grammars, the editing of texts, and so on.  That is not going to prevent professors in the universities from giving to their students particular these in the treatment of texts. Many of these things could be organised in association with the institute. One would imagine from Deputies who have spoken that you were going physically to take away from the existing colleges all the work that they have been doing and that you were going to send the manuscripts and all concerned with them to some foreign country.  It will really mean that the professors, if they want to come in contact with each other, will be able to do so in this city.  That is one of the reasons why we made this City of Dublin the seat of the institute, because it is more likely that you will have the advanced scholars who are dealing with these things meeting in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>You can have continuous work of an organised kind carried on.  There are certain types of work which can definitely be organised.  That organised type of research is not possible in the same way in the colleges as they exist at the moment.  We could take the institute and put it in as a special section in University College and call it college work, but I think it will do its work better in a new atmosphere and surroundings.  With regard to <Col N="2212" /> contact with students, of course there will be contact, but they will be students of the advanced type, students who will be working on the sort of work that the professors of the institute will be engaged in.  You will have classes, but they will be very different from the classes you have in the university where a certain course has to be covered.</P>
    <P>I am not thinking, as Deputy McGilligan seems to suggest, of the medical school.  I am thinking of any of the faculties in the university and any of the branches of study.  If you want to make a special study of a particular subject, you are not going to do it in the same way as if you have to cover a definite course.  In every one of the years in the university there is a definite course to be covered.  It is true that the professor indicates what the course is, and he can branch out on a particular line in which he is personally interested, but he knows that he cannot pursue that line, no matter how interesting it may be to himself, if he does not cover the definite ground-work which is necessary in order that the student may pass on to the next year of his course.  I think the arguments used on the opposite side were most unreal and, if there was a unreal picture given of university life, it was not given by me.</P>

      <P>It will be in contact with the university.  It is nonsense to say I have not been in consultation; I have not consulted any academic body as such, but I have been in consultation with the people who matter on this question.  This scheme was put up as a result of a report by the Committee of Irish Studies in the Royal Irish Academy which consists of professors and others interested in Irish studies. This scheme itself embodies the recommendations which were put forward by that body.  I have got nobody against it except political opponents.  I have got nobody from University College or the University of Dublin to say a word against it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I consulted the people who matter in those branches and I expected naturally that the political professors would oppose it.  I was without any misapprehension in that regard.  Before I started I knew the grounds on which it would be opposed. Anybody with commonsense would know that.  The picture that has been painted here of this institute and of the way in which it would strip any university of research work which has been done by its professors is too absurd.  As I say it will, in fact, stimulate and help research and it will provide for research what is now badly needed, that is men who will have the leisure to devote themselves to this advancement of knowledge and to inspire advanced students about them in the prosecution of their own individual research work.  You have, naturally, research that you cannot organise and the type of research that you can.  In the case of the work that lies before the Celtic studies school we have a type of research that can be well organised.  It would be a great advantage to the nation if the work that lies there could be done. With regard to the school of theoretical physics the work there cannot be organised in precisely the same way, but a considerable organisation can be done.  The director of that school will keep himself in touch with the work done by the individual professors <Col N="2215" /> of theoretical physics in the country and support that work.  He will be able to help the professor or professors of theoretical physics from time to time as the result of the prosecution of the work of the individual professors of the school.  They will give lectures occasionally in the colleges on particular branches.  These would not be the sort of lectures that have to be given now in the undergraduates' course.  There the professor has to start and lay the foundation of the subject, the classical forms and the rest of it.  All that sort of work would have to be done before the students would come to the lectures which the professors of the institute would give. Otherwise the students would not be able to follow the lectures.  It is possible that the public could come to these lectures.  Sometimes a brilliant man may be able to put in nontechnical language the results of his investigations and a large public may possibly be able to understand, follow them and profit by them.  Ordinarily that will not be the case.  Ordinarily the professor will be dealing with some particular branch which only those specially qualified are likely to follow. These lectures will be open to everybody, but actually the number who will come there will be very few.  You will be dealing with specialists for the most part.  I cannot understand why Deputy McGilligan parses every statement I make.  First there is the misrepresentation that you are taking away from the university something which it had up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>It is possible that in some particular context I may have used a phrase which the Deputy could make use of to misrepresent what I have been saying.  I say that the effect of this measure is that you are not taking away from the university any functions which they have at the moment.  You are adding or supplementing <Col N="2216" /> opportunities for research work over and above those at present available in the university.  By doing so you are going to stimulate and help whatever research work is at present being done there.  The Deputy gave a wrong picture of the work of the professors.  A few years ago there was a man who was ideally fitted for research work and he had to spend his time teaching a large class of first-year medical students.  I do not think that anybody is going to tell me that that teaching was going to stimulate that professor in his own research work. Such a thing was most unlikely to happen.  They have to do that work. Where were the lecturers, demonstrators, and so on?  He was a professor of chemistry and he was ideally fitted for his research work, and he had done a great deal of research work already. What particular advantage was it to him to spend that particular hour teaching the students?  There was no detachment.  It is wrong to say that this will be detached&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know what was done.  I know that thing had happened.  I think myself it was a waste of time so long as that particular man was capable of doing tremendous work in another direction, work that had to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as I have said, it is a wrong picture to make these men appear as if they were going to be in cobwebby rooms with no contact with other human beings or with other scholars or professors.  They will be in constant <Col N="2217" /> contact with professors and with people of the type most likely to stimulate them&mdash;the advanced student. There will be another value to the university, and it is this: that it will be provided, through an institute like this, with the new professors who will be required and will be available.  One or two professors may be taken away from a particular college, or a particular university, but they will be available for the country as a whole, including the universities.  Their places will be filled by other people, and it is much better that their places should be filled by other people in their own lifetime than that they should be filled when they are dead.  They would have to be filled some time.  It is not as if they were going to live for ever.  You are providing, therefore, for a natural succession by having an institute of this sort.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I was surprised that there should be this opposition.  The only real ground for it is that there is a sum of money being made available, and apparently it is thought that sum should be made available for University College here.  That is what the opposition comes to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if it justifies itself, as I am hoping it will justify itself, he would not dare lay his hands on it.  If it does not justify itself it will not be our fault.  We will have given it the opportunity, and if it does not justify itself well and good.  It will be up to those who will be put in charge to do that.  They will be given an excellent opportunity for doing very valuable work.  If those appointed do not avail of that opportunity, we cannot help that.  It will be to the advantage of every university institution in the country that this opportunity should be given.  If the school of Celtic studies functions properly, not merely will this mass of work be systematically gone through over a period of years, but we will have coming here from different countries students and future professors in those countries who may be interested in Celtic studies.  If he institute does not flower to that promise, well, again, it will not be our fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way with regard to theoretical physics.  The men who will be <Col N="2219" /> in charge of this school are of such eminence that they ought to attract from different countries special students, and ought to give to our own students and professors here excellent opportunities of becoming fit successors to these.  It is natural that it is from the universities we should get the material for the professors.  The point has been made that the professors in the new institute will be people who themselves had done certain work in the universities.  There is no particular point in that.  It is the natural place to get them from.  We will have them here, and we hope that they will be succeeded by people who, perhaps, will have been trained by themselves.</P>

      <P>I have given my answer, and it is a more correct answer than the Deputy's answer simply of &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  So far as the Opposition is concerned, whatever the parsing or the representations of university life and <Col N="2221" /> of the work that university professors do, I have not for one moment said that university professors do not undertake a certain amount of research work.  It would be almost impossible for them to do their work if they do not do some research work, but I do say that they have not the same opportunity for continuous research work&mdash;of having the assistance and direction, for instance, of a number of professors&mdash;that they will have in this institute.  As I have said, it can all be summed up in this way: that this is being opposed on one simple ground. It all boils down to this simple idea, that there is a certain sum of money available and that that money ought to be used in such a way that the work could be done by University College, Dublin.  That is my summing up of the whole objection.  I believe that the foundation of this institute will help University College, Dublin, and will help Trinity College and the other colleges in the country; that it will stimulate research in these colleges and provide a succession of competent professors for them; and that the money will be better spent in this particular way than by simply handing it over to the universities.</P>

Then there is the Finsen Institute, devoted to research into the biological effect of light, which, I think, is in Denmark. Then you have the Carlsberg Foundations Biological Institute, also in Denmark.  In Finland you have some institutions; I would not call them institutes because I do not know their organisation.  I do not know the particular work that is being done by them, so I would not like to include these. In answer to the question, I might say that the fact is that it is recognised that specialist work of this sort has to be organised outside the ordinary university scheme.  In Great Britain alone there are dozens of institutes of one kind or another doing special research work.</P>

      <P>On reading the statement made by the Minister when moving this Vote, I was amazed at its brevity, and at the amount of information given as to the activities of the Department during the past 12 months.  There was a decrease in the amount asked for of £208,356, while practically all the sub-heads showed considerable reductions.  That is rather an extraordinary state of affairs at a time when the Department of Agriculture is asking for more extensive tillage operations during the emergency period.  We are practically shutting down land distribution.  We are given no comparative figures to show the amount of land divided during the past 12 months as against previous years, but we are told that the untenanted land came to 39,000 acres, which appears to be a rather low figure.  In the last paragraph of the statement, the Minister referred to the collection of land purchase annuities, stating that they had been reasonably well maintained, and that of the amount collectable for the November-December period, 75 per cent. had been collected.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the very high costs that are very often incurred in the collection of these land annuities through the sheriff's office. Deputy McMenamin has already referred to the matter, but the Minister may reply that that is not a responsibility of his Department.  It is a matter that ought to be considered, as there is collective responsibility of the Government there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No effort has been made to facilitate unfortunate people who are seriously in arrears with land annuities.  The custom simply is that the matter is pushed into the sheriff's hands.  Has any attempt been made by the Minister or his Department to devise some other method and to make these unfortunate people aware that the Land Commission are prepared to afford them reasonable facilities?  I know that facilities have been given after representations have been made but, very often, before tenants become aware of that, these costs are incurred. The Minister should understand that some of the people concerned are not well-informed and they find themselves in this unfortunate position as a result. There is no doubt that the costs that are piled up as the result of getting those amounts collected by the sheriff have very considerably increased the burden of these people.  As the Minister is not directly responsible, I shall not go further into that matter, save to refer to the information we got this evening, which the Minister did not advert to in his statement.  The number of returns of <i>nulla bona</i> has shown an alarming increase&mdash;from 3,422 last year to 4,970 this year. That means that there are 1,548 additional farms without any stock.  That is a very serious situation.  There is an increase in arrears of annuities <Col N="2226" /> from £1,215,000 to £1,228,000&mdash;an increase of £13,000.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words regarding the acquisition of land for the purpose of division amongst uneconomic holders and landless people.  After the great land agitation of the past century, we had various Acts passed to give the tenant fixity of tenure in his holding, fair rent and free sale.  Under one of these Acts the Land Commission was set up.  The tenant was in that way encouraged to improve his farm buildings and the general condition of his land&mdash;to open up drainage and increase the fertility of the farm of which he now became owner.  In recent years, the position of the farmer in that respect has been upset.  I shall not go into that aspect of the case because I am aware that I am not entitled to criticise legislation, but we have often argued that the situation that obtains as a result of that legislation has rendered land no longer collateral security for the raising of loans by our agriculturalists. One of the reasons for that is that the occupier from whom land is about to be acquired has not got fair compensation from the Land Commission.  The banking institutions would, I believe, be prepared to advance loans against the security of land, but they cannot anticipate what is likely to be paid by the Land Commission in the event of the land being acquired.  If it is good national policy to acquire and divide land, then the State ought, if the price be not economic, to make good the difference and not victimise the unfortunate owner.  We have several examples all over the country where ordinary-sized farms have been practically confiscated by the Land Commission. The procedure is that a fair price is first fixed by the Land Commission. The cost of redemption is deducted from that, and the net result is that the residue is so small that it is tantamount to confiscation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular cases were referred to last year.  I had a particular case in County Kildare, where lands were acquired at Barronstown.  An advance of £1,200 was made on a farm of considerable size, and the sum paid in compensation for the holding, when acquired, <Col N="2227" /> was not sufficient to meet the bank debt.  The widow in that case never got a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; for her holding.  The Minister admitted at that time that the case was one of very serious hardship. On other cases mentioned by Deputies, he said he was sorry they had occurred.  Is anything going to be done about the matter?  I think that there is a bounden duty on the Government to undo, as far as possible, the gross injustice done to those people. Their cases should be revised.  In the particular case I referred to, the woman, who was in a very good financial position a few years ago, is now in a very bad way.  The Land Commission stepped in, wrecked her position, and left her a burden on the country. The responsibility is on the Government to remedy that injustice at any cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House that &ldquo;preparations have been made for an extension of colony and group migrations, and 23 families from the Connemara Gaeltacht have recently been installed in a new colony at Allenstown, County Meath, in promising circumstances.  Under the group migration scheme over 100 families have been already settled in the Midlands.&rdquo;  In my constituency in North Kildare there are very bitter feelings as a result of this policy of migration, because the claims of local people are overlooked and ignored in the division of big estates there, while strangers from the west of Ireland are brought in.  I do not think any serious objection is taken to bringing these people in provided the claims of local people are carefully examined and get first preference when so entitled.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that, when an estate is about to be divided, the claims of local people, some of whose ancestors were at one time in possession of the lands, are overlooked and ignored.  There is no serious objection to these people coming in, provided local claims are first dealt with on a just basis.  We were told in the Banking Commission Report, apparently from information received from the Land Commission, that this <Col N="2228" /> scheme is costing on an average £960, for each family, or approximately £1,000.  We are also told that, under a group migration scheme in respect to 100 families settled in the midlands, the cost to the State already has been £100,000.</P>

      <P>The cost for the Rathcarne migrants, changed in 1935-36, is estimated at £392 9s. 0d.  The estimated cost in the case of the Allenstown migrants, transferred in 1939-40, is £212&mdash;that is in the case of Gaeltacht migrants.  The Land Commission also have in operation a further scheme of group migration, whereby, although persons are migrated, they do not receive the special terms which Gaeltacht migrants get.  In 1938-39 the group migrants received on an average £168, and in 1939-40 the amount was £141 5s. 0d.</P>

      <P>We will take it that each man gets 25 acres under this scheme.  From my experience as a working farmer, I say that it is utterly impossible for any man with a wife and family to live on 25 acres and I suggest that we are simply creating another congest problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection at all if they give uneconomic holders additional pieces of land.  If a man is living on a small piece of land, and if it is possible to divide an estate in that locality and increase that man's holding so as to make him an economic holder, that is, to my mind, good national policy; but, on the other hand, I consider it is a rotten policy to establish additional uneconomic holdings, and that is what the Land Commission are doing under such schemes as these.  If you want to consolidate two small holdings, the Land Commission, I understand, will not be a party to such a proceeding if the combined holdings are not going to make what in their opinion would be an economic holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that their present policy is tending to set up problems for future generations in this country.  Do we not all know that putting a family on a holding of 25 acres is not an economic proposition?  It simply means slavery&mdash;drudgery and slavery&mdash;and it would be better for that family to attempt to earn a livelihood by some <Col N="2233" /> other method.  That type of holding cannot possibly make for economy of management.  It does not justify the possession of a pair of horses, and how can a man properly cultivate his land without a pair of horses?  A holding of 25 acres will not carry two horses. How can you expect a man with 25 acres to buy the implements necessary for the proper cultivation of his land? He cannot eternally be relying on the assistance of his neighbours.</P>
    <P>We have not always ideal weather in this country.  We have a good climate, and people have to try to do their work in weather that is not ideally suited.  Men have to adapt themselves to weather of this sort.  We have to get in the crops when the opportunity offers.  A man sometimes has to wait until some good neighbour comes along to his assistance.</P>
    <P>All this shows that the system of dividing land and making uneconomic holdings is creating nothing but hardship and poverty and is an ill-advised system.  That brings me to the point of co-operative farming.  I understand that Ford has a co-operative farm at Dagenham and has made a great success of it.  Whether it is possible to work such a system with Irishmen is a different proposition.  But there is nothing to prevent the Government trying it.  The Government might acquire an estate of 300 acres and put in, say, under a manager 12 tenants on that 300 acres.  Working that 300 acres under a manager, the profits arising therefrom would be distributed amongst the tenants who could live together in a group of buildings or dwellings.  They could be supplied with water much more easily than under the present system.  At present we hear a lot about this new unit for farming operations, the Ford-Ferguson tractor plough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>For a 25-acre farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, for a 300-acre farm. Some experimental attempt should be made to work 300 acres of land on a co-operative basis.  By putting in good economic equipment it would be possible to work successfully a farm of <Col N="2234" /> that kind on co-operative lines.  It is not feasible or possible to work 25 acres of land by itself.  The farmer has to maintain two horses on a farm of that size.  The Government can either adopt the co-operative method or if they do not believe in the co-operative method, at all events they should experiment in that direction.  If we are not prepared to do that, there is only one alternative and that is to increase the area of land given to each individual farmer.  I say that because we are not bestowing any real benefit on a man when we give him 25 acres of land.  I disagree with the policy of the Department for the reason that that area is too small.  If we are going to put a family to live on a farm it ought to be an economic farm, a farm out of which one can live.</P>
      <P>At the present time a good many people get about 20 acres, and they cannot live on it.  They have to supplement the income they get from that by working on a bigger farm.  That type of man is a nuisance.  If a bigger farmer has that type of man employed he finds his man is always looking for assistance; he is looking after his own land, and the very day he is needed on the big farm he is absent.  We should either make him a whole-time farmer or a whole-time agricultural worker. In the case of the agricultural worker, it is a good policy to give him a couple of acres of land for the grazing of a cow and calf or two, and for a supply of milk for his family.  There should be two definite types of holding created by the Land Commission.  That is the very small type of farm that will provide milk for the agricultural labourer, a farm where he can keep a cow, and raise a calf or two.  He can sell that calf or two to provide clothes for himself and his family, but such a farmer should not have more than two or three acres of land.  When you go beyond that you are creating a farm not sufficiently big to be an economic proposition for the family to live on it without having to go outside that holding to supplement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the selection of tenants, I just want to add a word to what has been already said to-night. <Col N="2235" /> I am in entire agreement with the condemnation that has been voiced here on the methods of the selection of the candidates.  I have no doubt political considerations very often enter into it.  The system of sending down an inspector working like a detective in the district is a bad one.  You often find one man telling lies about his neighbour.  The inspector comes along and he asks that man: &ldquo;What are the circumstances of your neighbour so-and-so; do you think if he got a bit of land he would work it?&rdquo;  That is not a proper system of examination.  It is very difficult for a man coming down from the city to get correct information on a matter of that sort.  Some sort of public inquiry should be held. Information should be got by public examination at an inquiry, and not have secret detective work.  When an inspector comes down sometimes an individual in the district gets an opportunity to do his neighbour harm, and he makes full use of it.  That opportunity is given by the inspector calling on him. Very often an injury is done to a decent man, because the inspector gets untrue information from a neighbour who has a grudge against him.  That is not a proper system at all.  There should be some sort of local cooperation, and some sort of a committee formed where that sort of inquiry would be done publicly.  No suggestion could be made afterwards that political influence was used.  The inquiry should be over and above board.  Under the present system it is open to much suspicion, often for the very good reason that political influence is being used.  Some people get preference in the giving of the land over others who are better fitted to work it.  The decent man is passed over, and the unsuitable applicant gets the land.</P>
    <P>On the question of fencing I just want to say a word or two.  I do not know that the system of fencing land adopted by the Land Commission is an economic method at all.</P>
    <P>The holding which the Land Commission calls an uneconomic holding is <Col N="2236" /> already a very small one, but, small as it is, nine or ten feet of it is under a fence.  You have big gripes on each side.  Why not, instead of that class of fence, put down concrete posts and wire, and then set some quicks?  There is a terrible waste of land by having these big banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>How long will the wire fence last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The quicks grow up in a short time, and with the wire and concrete posts you would have a very satisfactory fence.  I agree with other Deputies that it is utterly impossible to get any information from the Land Commission.  I would not go so far as to say that the officials there are lazy, or are not doing their job.  I know that the pressure of work is enormous, and that they have a very difficult task, but while that is so, when a Deputy is approached for information by a constituent, he is surely entitled to get some consideration from the Land Commission.  As a rule, when he writes he gets a formal acknowledgment, and that seems to end the matter. If he writes again, another card comes along.  From the point of view of Deputies, that is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.  I am sure Deputies in all parts of the House suffer in this respect.  We have been put in our present position by the people, and we are surely entitled to get some help and assistance from the Minister's Department.  In the absence of that assistance, we are forced to seek information by means of Parliamentary Question.  That is very unsatisfactory. Would it not be just as easy for the Department to give the information in answer to a letter as to be forced to give it by way of answer to a question in the Dáil?  This matter was mentioned last year, and still there is no improvement.  I hope that something will now be done to bring about an improvement, and that the Minister will give the matter his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak on the Estimate, but I think it is only right that some Deputy <Col N="2237" /> should reply to the remarks made by Deputy Hughes about the migrants.  If the Deputy knew the conditions under which those people had been living, he would not, I think, have spoken as he did.</P>
      <P>From his point of view 25 acres of land may seem a very small holding for a family to live on.  But a holding of that size represents an immense improvement on the conditions under which those migrants had previously been living.  Quite recently the Minister told the House that a number of migrants had been brought up from Connemara to Allenstown.  It might surprise Deputy Hughes to learn that some of them had been trying to exist on two acres of land.  These were people who worked very hard.  They are very thrifty, and if the Deputy knew all the circumstances I am sure he would agree that it was really a miracle how they managed to exist at all.  In this connection I would ask the Minister to give to the House, as he did last year, a statement indicating the production on the new holdings compared with the production on the old holdings.  I believe that if the Deputy had an opportunity of studying that statement he would change his views, and would not be quite so hostile to the settlement scheme in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand that he should be anxious to get first preference for the people in his own constituency, but this question of land settlement cannot be looked at from the parish, the county, or a provincial point of view. After all, if the Government did not use the residue of untenanted land for the relief of congestion, taking the country as a unit, they would, in my opinion, be doing very bad national work.  One has to admit that land settlement is costly, but there is an aspect of it that ought not to be lost sight of.  It is this: that if we were to go back over a period of forty or fifty years, and total up the amount of extra grants which the congested districts have got from various Governments&mdash;the British Government and our own Governments here&mdash;grants over and above what people in other parts <Col N="2238" /> of the country were entitled to get&mdash;we would find, I think, that we could have migrated practically all our congests for the sums of money spent in that way.  I think that any Government here must continue to keep that point in mind&mdash;the amount of money which the public purse has to provide to assist people who are so circumstanced.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, what the Government are doing in regard to this scheme is a good business proposition from the point of view of the Government, apart from the uplift it gives to those people who have been suffering so long.  It is a good £ s. d. proposition. I think it would be nothing short of a national disaster if the Government, during the present national emergency and the financial stringency it has brought about, were to be diverted from the policy.  Those people, as we know, had been living under miserable conditions.  They managed to exist simply because part of their subsistence was provided by their sons and daughters who emigrated to America. Emigration has now stopped.  Usually young persons who emigrated to America sent money home for a period of ten years.  After that they settled down, and the people at home received no more help from them.  Now that emigration has been stopped, and that the American money has ceased to come, it is up to the Government to fill the void.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this migration scheme has met with a better response than the Land Commission anticipated when it was first formulated.  Land Commission officials and others with whom I discussed the matter when I was first elected, told me then that I was wrong in my estimate of the people's attitude to it when I said that the people were anxious to go.  There was a time when they would not leave the congested areas to migrate inland, but the closing down of emigration definitely gave a new outlook to these people, and they were the first to realise, because it was on them that the shoe pressed, that some other outlet would have to be found for them. In my opinion, the Government found that outlet.  My only regret is that they cannot go ahead with it on a <Col N="2239" /> larger scale, and try to get this question of the congested districts dealt with once and for all.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that it is the primary duty of the Government in the matter of land division and land settlement to see that the people in the congested areas are first dealt with.  If they do not do that, the duty is on them to see that they are served in some other way.  I cannot see the problem of the congested areas being solved industrially unless you have industries run as they are in other countries on the continent and forced into districts where, in the ordinary course of events, people would not place them.  From the point of view of the Gaeltacht and the language I do not think that would be very desirable.  Therefore, I think there is no other policy for the Government to pursue.  Assuming that Deputy Hughes' argument about congestion is right, that 25-acre farms represent a new congestion problem, in answer to that I maintain that if we are to have congestion on the land here that congestion should be on the best land.  If Deputy Hughes says that 25 acres of the best land is a congested holding, I maintain that it is not so congested a holding as three or four acres of waste land.  That is the only argument I offer to it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to draw the particular attention of the Minister.  There is a motion on the Order Paper in the names of Deputy Beegan and myself about a matter of rather minor importance, namely, the letting of two houses which were formerly a coastguard station.  I would not have put down a motion on a matter of that kind except that no other course was open to me.  There are two houses in the coastguard station on Inisheer in the Aran Islands which were vacant. These houses were let, I understand, by the Land Commission without any tenders being invited publicly.  I have been asked by constituents there to request the Government to see that these lettings are put up for public tender so that everybody interested can get a <Col N="2240" /> chance of tendering.  I think the matter was dealt with in a very high-handed fashion by the Land Commission. As a rule, these buildings are under the care of the Board of Works and they always let or sell them by public auction or, at any rate, by inviting tenders.  After all, these buildings are State property and, in my opinion, all the citizens who were interested should get a chance of tendering. I think it is most high-handed on the part of the Land Commission to give away this property to an individual in their own absolute discretion. I ask the Minister to see that this letting is cancelled, that everybody who is interested will have the right to tender, and that the highest bidder gets the property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Estimate is always, to a very great extent, an unsatisfactory one, because the main work which the Land Commission is doing is the acquisition and sub-division of land, and when anybody in this House points out that land has been acquired which ought not to be acquired, or that land has not been acquired that ought to have been acquired, or that land has been improperly divided by the Land Commission, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, as the case may be, can always blandly say: &ldquo;That is not our job; we have nothing to do with the acquisition of land; we have nothing to do with the division of land; we have nothing to do with the deciding of the question whether there is to be a Gaelic colony or not in County Meath.&rdquo;  The Government has nothing to do with that, because, by statute, these are reserved services which are left to the Land Commission in which the Minister cannot interfere at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, as I say, discussion of this Estimate will be unsatisfactory this year, as it has been every year since that alteration in the law took place, and the Minister will say: &ldquo;No doubt there has been this shocking indictment brought by Deputy O'Higgins against the Land Commission, but do not blame me because I had nothing to <Col N="2241" /> do with it; I am not responsible for it.&rdquo;  In other words, there is no Parliamentary responsibility in the Land Commission, and, in consequence, the Minister has got a very easy time. Deputy Davin and Deputy McMenamin expressed surprise to-night that there should have been so many changes from time to time in the office of Minister for Lands.  I am not surprised at all.  If any Minister wants a half-time job I am sure he goes to the Taoiseach and says: &ldquo;I am getting a little tired now; will you give me the Land Commission?  There is nothing to be done in the Land Commission. The Land Commissioners do the whole thing.  Give me a year of a half-time or a quarter-time job.&rdquo;  If the Minister was altogether lazy, I am sure he would say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Give me the Department for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures where there is no work to be done at all.&rdquo;  But if he is willing to do a half-time job, the Land Commission is a very admirable half-time job without any responsibility. Except for forestry, there is really nothing to do there, because, as I say, the Land Commission in all their big work are, by statute, perfectly independent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister is the only public channel through which we can convey our views to the gentlemen whom in a previous debate I described as the &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; and who decide this question of the acquisition and division of land.  I should like the Minister to convey to them that, as seems to be envisaged by this Estimate, the complete shutting off of the acquisition of land would be very bad indeed for the country at the present time.  They might slow down, but I appeal to them not to give up completely the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>To go into individual cases of the acquisition of land in a debate like this, or to pick out one particular farm of land for acquisition, is in normal circumstances a very stupid line of argument to follow, because if every Deputy were to mention a particular farm of land which he wished to have acquired, we might be here for many weeks on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> Therefore, it is only owing to abnormal circumstances that I want again to draw the attention of the Land Commission, through the Minister, to what, in my opinion, is the very necessary acquisition of a comparatively small remnant of demesne land, consisting of about 130 acres, situate at the south end of my constituency and bordering on North Galway.  It is a demesne with a very curious history. I am sure it is well known to the House.  A millionaire bought it and intended to build there, but the people were determined that they would get this particular farm.  There was a great deal of agitation, and for 20 years the land has been grazed. Recently the owner sold the land for something over £1,000 to three purchasers. The reason I mention it in particular is that I understand that there is grave danger of the revival of agrarian trouble in that neighbourhood. From newspaper reports I understand that the police were sent for, and that there is a good deal of &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; in the district. I need hardly assure the Minister and the House that no one stands more firmly for the administration of the law&mdash;there is no greater enemy of lawlessness in any shape or form&mdash;than I do.  Any influence I may have in that neighbourhood will be exerted to prevent the slightest act of lawlessness.  I will condemn it as strongly as I can, but I want to assure the Minister that there is grave danger of lawlessness, and that there is a tremendously strong case for the acquisition of this particular place. There is very bad congestion in the district.</P>
    <P>Amongst those who came to see me was a man who travelled 25 miles.  He is making a living on land for which he pays an annuity of £1 per annum. He is not the only person in that position in this extremely congested area.  In all the circumstances it seems a case that ought to be dealt with immediately and, above all, dealt with in the interests of harmony in a peaceable neighbourhood.  Owing to the amount of congestion there is a stronger case for the acquisition of that <Col N="2243" /> land than for the acquisition of any holding in any part of Ireland.  It would be very bad if a row started and if the Land Commission said that they would not buy.  After a great deal of bad feeling and rowing, possibly under pressure, the Land Commission at the end of a few years may buy it. It would be unfortunate if that state of affairs should arise.  I ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Land Commission what I have said, seeing that these three purchasers have not yet gone into possession, or, if they have, it is only within the last three days.  I have been assured, not by them, but by others that the purchasers would be willing to take the price they paid the owner, and that the people around would be perfectly willing to repurchase from the Land Commission at that price.  Only that the circumstances are abnormal I would not have brought up this particular case in the House, but I do so in order that the peace of the neighbourhood may not be disturbed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there was a man in that county who supported a wife and a family on land on which the annuity was £1 a year.  That brings me to what Deputy Bartley said about the Gaeltacht and the migration policy.  I only know the West of Ireland, and the farming and social conditions there intimately.  I have a smattering of knowledge about conditions in other parts, but if the ordinary small farmer in my constituency was told, as Deputy Hughes and Deputy McMenamin told them, that 25 acres of good land are not enough for an economic holding, they would simply laugh.  Any experienced Land Commission official or ex-Congested Districts Board official would say that such a statement was wrong.  When dealing with this matter I think reference to acres means nothing.  I happened to come across a case the other day in which 425 acres of land were involved.  Strange to say, there was an action about one acre, but the total valuation of the holding was 17/-, not 17/- per acre, for over 400 acres.  Therefore, when we start talking about acreage that may mean <Col N="2244" /> nothing.  I prefer to think in terms of poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>A person who has a holding on which the poor law valuation is £25 a year in my part of Mayo will be looked upon as a man with a better holding than any of his richer neighbours. The efforts of the Land Commission and certainly of the old Congested Districts Board aimed at £8 or £10 valuations as economic holdings.  I sincerely wish it were possible to bring every small holder in Mayo or Galway up to the £8 or £10 valuation, because if that could be done we would have solved the problem of congestion as we understand congestion.  To talk about giving these people 25 acres of land or holdings on which the valuation was £25 is simply useless.  That would be desirable if the land was available.  I venture to think that if holdings with a poor law valuation of £25 a year could be given, in a short time there would be applications for sub-division between sons of the tenants.  That is what used to happen.</P>

      <P>Everybody who knows the congested districts realises that if the people could be brought up to the standard of having holdings with £8 or £10 valuations, and to have no holdings under that size, the problem there would be solved.  I am <Col N="2245" /> afraid that will never be done.  As far as Gaeltacht colonies are concerned I have not formed any very definite opinion on that question.</P>
      <P>I am quite willing to believe that if the persons who have lived on farms in Meath and Kildare all their lives see these Connemara people coming up, men who have never held a plough in their lives, they will immediately scream with laughter at the amateurish efforts the Gaeltacht migrants are making.  That will last for some little time.  In my own vicinity, in County Mayo, a large farm was broken up. People were brought down from the Tourmakeady mountains and that neighbourhood to this farm, which is called Castlecarra.  Their neighbours used to collect on Sunday to laugh at the crooked &ldquo;scriobs&rdquo; where the poor man who was holding a plough for the first time was trying to plough.  That was about 15 years ago.  They are completely and entirely up to the level of their neighbours at the present time. They simply learned.  It will take these migrants, under entirely new conditions, eight or ten years to be as good farmers as the persons who knew the conditions beforehand.  But they will learn.  So much is to be put on one side as regards the migration of people from the Gaeltacht by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another side to the matter. People talk very glibly of the breaking up of the big grass lands in Meath and Kildare.  They say that these farms are an injury to the country and that it would make for better tillage and, as Deputy Norton said, more tillage if they were broken up and divided.  The breaking up of grass land has not increased the tillage area and has not decreased the cattle population.  I am old enough to remember when the Congested Districts Board first broke up a place immediately in my neighbourhood. William O'Brien saw it done and started his United Irish League for the break-up of land.  I quoted figures in the House a couple of years ago&mdash;I have not got them now because I did not know that this subject would <Col N="2246" /> arise, but they are available to everybody in the House&mdash;to show that, in the County Mayo, which is the county in which the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission have broken up most land, the tillage area has decreased since 1892.  The human population has decreased and the cattle population has increased&mdash;the very reverse of the conclusion which, by <i>a priori</i> reasoning, one would have arrived at.</P>
    <P>My objection to the breaking up of the grass lands of Meath and Kildare is the reaction it is going to have on the people in the west of Ireland.  At present, the main source of ready money of the small holder of £8, £10, or £12 valuation in the west of Ireland is the price he gets for his cattle.  He sells his cattle to somebody from Meath or Kildare to be finished.  He sells them as stores&mdash;at present he has to sell them as stores&mdash;and these stores are brought to Meath and Kildare and adjoining counties where they are fattened upon the grass.  If you break up the Meath farms entirely, you take away the principal market the small farmer has got for his stock, and you impoverish him in consequence.  In other words, if you break up the rich lands of this country into small holdings, where the people themselves will breed store cattle, you aim a very hard blow at the economic basis of society in the west of Ireland.  My idea for the relief of congestion in the west is: Take as much land as you can reasonably get in those counties for the relief of congestion and move, not the small farmers, not the people on £2-a-year farms, but the larger farmers.  Break up amongst the smaller farmers the land which the larger farmers will have left behind.  When they go to Meath these larger farmers will be purchasers of the cattle which will be reared on the land which they had, and which will have been broken up.  A person I know very well farmed in North Mayo, which is not in my constituency.  He swapped all the land he had in North Mayo for land in Kildare and Dublin, and he is now the main buyer in North Mayo fairs.  He buys from the small farmers there the cattle reared on the land <Col N="2247" /> which he at one time farmed.  That, in my opinion, was the ideal settlement of the problem.  I think that it is a better and surer settlement, from the point of view of the west of Ireland, than the policy of migrating the small tenant to Meath.  When all is said and done, is it not tinkering with the problem to take 100 families out of congested Mayo?  You might take 100 families out of a square mile in parts of Mayo.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I desire to allude has been touched upon already. That is the question of rent collection and the method of collection.  There are two ways in which the Land Commission can collect annuities from persons who are indebted to them.  One is by ordinary process in court&mdash;either in the Circuit Court or in the District Court if the amount be small.  In that case the person gets notice, has the documents served upon him, and the costs, if the amount is small, will be very small.  The other method is, I think, under the Minister's direct control. It has nothing to do with the acquisition or division of land.  The collection of annuities is not a reserved service, and is, therefore, under the Minister's direct control.  The Minister can give instructions to the Land Commission's solicitor. He can say to him, &ldquo;You are to go to court and get decrees,&rdquo; or he may say to him, &ldquo;You are to put your certificate from the office in the hands of the sheriff forthwith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of the cases which have been mentioned in the course of the debate here to-night are cases in which, if I may put it this way, judgment has been marked against individuals in the office of the Land Commission, and that judgment is being put directly into the hands of the sheriff.  You get these shocking examples where the sheriff's fees for collecting 18/- were £1 10s. 6d.  You did get these monstrous things at times, whereas suppose you brought proceedings in the District Court, the person would then be aware of the fact that the Land Commission <Col N="2248" /> were taking proceedings.  He would have a great deal more to go upon, and would have costs amounting at the outside to 2/6 or 3/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters in connection with the Land Commission policy with which I should like to deal.  Owing to the war the policy of the Land Commission has changed in the matter of the acquisition of land and, that being so, I suggest that the Minister might switch some of his officials who were engaged in the acquisition and division of land to devising a land drainage policy.  There are certain large areas which have been flooded for the last 20 or 30 years and it seems to be nobody's business to see that these lands are again brought back into cultivation.  This matter of flooding presents a very serious problem in some parts of the country.  I might also mention that there are river embankments that require attention.</P>
      <P>The River Barrow affords one instance.  Deputies from Wexford are continually being told of the breaches in the embankments along the River Barrow.  The Land Commission have had this matter under consideration for a number of years, but little or nothing has been done to remedy the situation. I believe that at the present time they are about to repair one small breach. They have tried it on five occasions within the last few years and they are still trying to repair the breach. There are at least five other breaches needing attention.  I heard that they started repair work last week, and that there was a row with the ganger and the work was closed down after one day.  That is the fourth or fifth time that the work of repairing that breach was halted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated, there are other <Col N="2250" /> breaches within a few miles of the one they are now trying to repair.  The tenants of the affected land, in their original agreements, undertook to repair the embankments.  There is no possibility of their being able to repair the embankments at the present time, because the cost of building up the embankments would be more than a man's whole farm was worth.  The Minister should endeavour to get the Land Commission to take a serious view of this matter.  A large area has been flooded on both sides of New Ross town for a considerable time. The Land Commission hold that they have no responsibility, and they are proposing to repair the one embankment to which I have referred by way of spending some of the money out of the employment fund.  I think it should be the policy of the Land Commission to arrange a scheme for the drainage of land.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this matter on a number of occasions here in the Dáil in the last few years but I failed to impress the Minister for Lands with the necessity for formulating a land drainage policy. I am aware that we had a Drainage Commission sitting but that commission was not concerned with land drainage at all.  It was only with arterial drainage they were concerned. But arterial drainage would not affect land drainage.  In the County Wexford there are large tracts of land flooded with water for years past.  I do hope that some policy will be formulated that will deal with land drainage and land improvement.</P>
    <P>There is another very important matter that I wish to mention and that is the question of the resettlement of persons on the land.  In our county we have a large number of holdings which are for some time derelict.  No annuities and no rates are being paid on them.  In some cases this has been going on for the last ten or 15 years. The arrears are continuing to mount up and the neighbouring ratepayers are compelled to pay these in addition to their own.  I know that in some of these holdings £500 or £600 annuities <Col N="2251" /> have accumulated and almost the same amount for poor rates.  The farms are really not of value to anybody.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission, in my opinion are acting quite wrongly in not acquiring these holdings for sub-division or otherwise.  Something needs to be done about it.  Even in the future the Land Commission will always need a policy of land re-settlement because for some reason or other a number of people will continue to drop out.  That will happen no matter how prosperous the times are.  Even in the time of the last war a number of people failed to make use of their holdings; yet they still hung on there though they are of no use to themselves or to the country. They are a burden on their neighbours who are compelled to pay the annuities and rates of these defaulters.  I do not quite understand why other ratepayers should have been called upon to make good these arrears.  For over ten years those charges are being set down against the land.  The ratepayers all round the county would be glad to have these matters brought to an end.  It would be much better to do so and even to have the arrears forgiven than to have the other ratepayers paying them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which reference has been made.  That is the housing policy of the Land Commission. I am convinced that in a number of cases where the Land Commission acquired land they built an inferior type of house.  I refer to mass concrete houses of rather a poor type.  I have had a number of complaints about those houses, though only a small number of them have been built in my constituency.  The contractors tender for these houses at a very low rate. They could not afford to use proper concrete and give the houses a proper finish so as to make them fit for habitation. It would be much better if they were built with cavity walls.  Such walls give a much better chance of having a dry house than walls built of mass concrete.  This type of damp house will eventually be a big source <Col N="2252" /> of expense to the unfortunate people who are compelled to live in it.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in several places through the country where the Land Commission have acquired lands that the timber on the estates is immediately cut down.  How is it that the Forestry Act is not made apply in these cases?  Whether it is the outgoing owner or the incoming tenants or the country at large who go into these estates and destroy the timber, cutting down the woods recklessly, I do not know.  There is a certain period from the time the land has been acquired by the Land Commission until it is sub-divided, and in this interim nobody seems to be in charge at all. It is during that period that the destruction is wrought.  I know that a very large amount of valuable immature timber has been cut down during that interregnum.  But the Minister for Lands is also the Minister for Forestry; he should take serious note of this, see that the timber is protected, and that the incoming tenant should not have the right to cut this timber without applying to the Land Commission for permission.  On these holdings I have noticed in a number of cases that the timber on the land was immediately destroyed after the estate had been acquired by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Well, it has happened anyway, and it is a thing that could be easily stopped.  There is no necessity for allowing it to continue.  I hope the Minister will formulate a drainage policy for his Department.  This is a <Col N="2253" /> most important matter.  At the moment no Department of State seems to have any responsibility for the drainage of land.  I am aware that the Board of Works take no responsibility, and neither does the Land Commission.  It is most strange that people who have all this flooded land can get no State Department to move in the matter. Many of these people are prepared to contribute something towards the improvement.</P>

      <P>I think the Land Commission as a body are entitled to every respect for the work they are doing.  They have a heavy and unpleasant task to perform.  However, I do not intend to throw any bouquets at them, though I am satisfied that they have done a great deal of good work.  So far as my county is concerned, the whole debate seems to be centred on the question of bringing migrants from the West of Ireland.  I have been looking at that operation for the last few years, and while I have nothing to say against the migrants, it is a policy of which I do not approve.  As a body of men I know that the migrants are decent, honest men, and in the majority of cases they are trying to do the best they can.  From the point of view of that scheme I can definitely say that it is an absolute failure.  It is costing a huge amount of money and is not giving any satisfactory return. I am satisfied that the majority of the holdings held by the migrants from the West of Ireland will, in the course of time, be linked together again and that one or two farmers will own them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was all right to go a certain distance in this direction of land division. I myself was in the forefront of the movement to get the ranches broken up, but after ten or 15 years of that experiment we find that the County Meath is in a worse position than before we ever tackled it.  Meath is a peculiar problem in itself.  The land of Meath is very fertile.  It was taken over, preserved and nourished for generations and it is probably some of the best land in Europe.  But I think the problem should be tackled in some businesslike way.  Before going any further there should be a public inquiry and the best brains of the country should be brought to bear on the question to ascertain whether we are doing good or bad in smashing up that county. We all know that the best cattle and the best horses in Europe were bred in that county.  But when divided into 25-acre holdings, surely you cannot expect to breed good horses.  All such a man can have is three cows, one <Col N="2255" /> horse, three or four calves and some store cattle.  The rest of the farm will be in hay.  That sort of farming will produce very little for the wealth of the nation.  It may carry half a family but the other half of the family will have to go to Dublin, to England or somewhere else for a living.  I ask the Department to put an end to the bringing of people up from the West of Ireland.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has spoken on this matter exactly as I would like to hear him speak.  I know that the Deputies from the West are doing the right thing from their point of view in shoving in hundreds of their people into our county.</P>
    <P>If they really think that then, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said, they are doing an immense amount of harm. I certainly agree that the big ranches in Mayo and Roscommon and other Western counties should be divided up, and that the bigger men on them should be transferred and given, say, holdings of 60 acres in the County Meath.  Men of that type would be an asset to our county.  The lands from which they had been removed could then be divided up amongst the congests in the West.  We would be glad to get the right type of people for land in the County Meath, but the people who are being brought there are no asset to it.  They are being brought there without a penny in their pockets. They do not know how to till land, and it must be confessed that they find themselves in rather hostile surroundings. In view of what the position has been for some years, we in the County Meath think that we have behaved pretty well towards those people.  As a matter of fact, there is a very strong feeling there, and it was suggested at meetings, secret and otherwise, that vigorous action should be taken against them.  It was suggested that those colonies should be burned out.  If anything like that had been attempted you would have had a conflagration the like of which was never seen in the County Meath before.  If it had been started neither the Land Commission nor the Civic Guards or even this House could stop it, but I am glad to <Col N="2256" /> say that the advice of prudent men was taken, and that nothing of the kind occurred.</P>
    <P>Congests are being brought up to the county in lorries, buses, motor cars, with as many as five, six, eight and ten inspectors accompanying them. Gangers are there to meet them and hand over their property to them&mdash; cows, horses, sows, ploughs, hens, ducks, meal and flour, turf and even piers and gates for the land, but while that is so the unfortunate men who had been herding those lands, some of them for 50 years, get nothing but 22 or 25 acres of scraggy grass land, and not even a gate will be put up for them. I ask Deputies is it not hard for the people in the County Meath to stand that?  I think the proper solution of this problem would be the one I have suggested: that men in the western counties with large holdings should be transferred to the County Meath, and their land divided up amongst the uneconomic holders there.  Otherwise, the fairs and markets in the west are going to suffer.  You will soon have nobody with anything to offer at the great fairs of Ballinasloe, Athenry and other places.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in bringing penniless men to Meath.  If what I suggest were done, you would still have the people of the western counties in a position to produce the store cattle and sheep that are finished on the lands of Meath and Westmeath.  That system in the past proved, and would also prove to-day, to be of benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of old people, some of them 90 and 92 years of age, are being brought to the County Meath at the present time.  During their lifetime they are of some assistance to their families.  They have the old age pension, and others of them are getting the 30/- a week from a bountiful State.  But as soon as these moneys cease to come in, the families have nothing.  Their sons and daughters are leaving Meath and going over to England to take employment.  That is a <Col N="2257" /> thing that was never known in the County Meath before.  It is quite a common experience now.  In fact, the example of those people has had a bad effect on County Meath people because some of the latter are now beginning to leave and go to England.  That is a sad state of affairs.  Those people were far better off before they were brought to our county.  They are not able to live on the 22 or 25 acres of land they get from the Land Commission. They were able to do far better on the five, six or ten acres that they had in Connemara.  The valuations were low, and they had not many charges to meet.  For three or four months of the year the young people went away to the hop fields in Kent and brought home £40 or £50 with them.  That was a great help to their families, and helped to tide them over difficult times.  Some of those migrants have told me that if their old holdings had not been already disposed of by the Land Commission they would go back there again.  Many of them, too, have told me that as soon as their present holdings are vested in them, they will cash them, if they can possibly do it.  Another point is, that many of those migrants are single men.  I think it is not right to be bringing them from the West and giving them land in Meath.  Surely that is no way to relieve congestion.  All this is a political racket.  The Fianna Fáil T.D.s simply tricked and slipped it across the Land Commission, their object being to get rid of people who were becoming lukewarm in their support of them.  Some of those people were really becoming a danger to the T.D.s, and they had them sent off to Meath.  I can tell those Deputies that the people they have sent to Meath are not a bit welcome there.</P>
    <P>Deputies should remember that the land in the County Meath is very highly valued.  I am living on 30 acres of a divided farm myself.  The valuation is £64 10s., and, before the annuities were halved, I was paying £60 a year for it.  The rates are £18 a year.  I could not employ labour, nor could I live on that holding if I had not some other means.  It would be <Col N="2258" /> impossible for me to make it pay. During the last three or four years the rates have been increased year after year.  Seeing that I could not make that holding pay, I challenge anybody to say that people coming from the west of Ireland can make a living out of those holdings.</P>
    <P>As regards the Irish colonies, what happened was that from 1932 to 1935 land was given out to all and sundry. Anyone who shouted for land, and was able to show a Fianna Fáil badge, got a holding.  It is true to say that 50 per cent. of those holdings are now derelict, so that the whole thing is a disgrace to the country and to the Land Commission.  All that was done to make a laughing-stock of the County Meath.  While that has been the position during the period I speak of, the sons of decent County Meath farmers cannot get a share of land in their own county.  The whole thing is a disgrace and a blot on the Land Commission.</P>

You had men on horses going out to meet them and big processions, with a lot of fools marching at the head of them.  The people who did that would kick them home to-day. Some of those people are standard bearers and staunch supporters of Deputy Kelly and Deputy O'Reilly, but these two Deputies were ashamed to sit in the House because they knew what I was going to say.  The people who were brought to Rathcarne did not behave as they should.  The only persons getting anything out of them are the lawyers.  They are lighting <Col N="2259" /> morning, noon, and night.  Those people, instead of making Rathcarne an Irish-speaking colony, are going to make it a proper West-Briton, narrow, bitter, un-Irish type of colony.  The story is told that when a parish priest in Connemara was asked why he had supported the removal of 30 or 40 families to an Irish-speaking colony in <Col N="2260" /> the County Meath, said he was glad that they had gone elsewhere.
