    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 31 to add &ldquo;for a period of not less than 10 years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> This amendment is in defence of what I consider to be a very important principle. To clarify the principle involved it is necessary to refer back to the Principal Act of 1960.  In that Act we laid down procedure whereby the Authority should appoint its officers permanently.  Section 12 (1) sets out:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall, as well as appointing the Director-General, appoint such and so many other persons to be officers and servants of the Authority as the Authority from time to time thinks proper, but, subject to subsection (2) of this section, a person shall not be appointed under this section to be an officer of the Authority unless he has been selected by means of a public competition.</P>
    <P>That is the general provision.  The exception provided under paragraph (ii) referred to is an appointment consisting of the promotion of the person who is already an officer of the Authority.</P>
    <P>We have preserved in our statutes an archaic, old-fashioned procedure of description for public servants which is not appropriate to modern conditions. When we speak in a statute of the Oireachtas of an officer of a public authority, we speak really of an established, pensionable employee of a Department of State or of a semi-State body.  When we speak of a servant of a Department of State or semi-State body, we refer to an unestablished employee of that body.</P>
    <P>The original Act, which came under protracted consideration by the House, determined that any person who was to be appointed a permanent, pensionable employee of the Authority was to be appointed only after he had been selected by means of a public competition, but we made the provision that if somebody had submitted himself to that public competition and had been chosen as a permanent, pensionable servant of the Authority, he was eligible to be transferred from the post in which he already enjoyed permanent, pensionable employment to another post for which he would <Col N="817" /> otherwise have to stand another public competition.</P>
    <P>There are innumerable parallels for that procedure in the public service. We are all familiar with the conditions of dispensary doctors.  If a person seeks appointment as a dispensary doctor in the local authority health services, he can do so only as a result of an examination open to all qualified persons, on foot of which a recommendation is made by the Local Appointments Commissioners to the local authority which the local authority are bound to act on.  But there is an exception.</P>
    <P>If a person has already been appointed by public examination as a dispensary doctor in a given county, it is within the discretion of the manager of the local authority of that county to change him from one dispensary to another and it is a common practice that if a young doctor has served well in a relatively poor and difficult dispensary area, if a more satisfactory and attractive dispensary area becomes available within the jurisdiction of the same local authority, he may be transferred to that area and a vacancy declared in respect of the less attractive dispensary post.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that numerous analogous situations obtain in the public service.  Here we have a slightly different situation because we have the peculiar, and somewhat anachronistic, institution there of temporary postmen. Many of us have grown up beside temporary postmen who have been temporary postmen for 30 to 35 years. It is not unseemly, in the very special circumstances obtaining there, where the skill is delivering the post, that if a permanent position arises, there should be a confined examination, confined to persons who have been for many years temporary postmen so that they may go from the category of unpensionable and unestablished public servants to that of pensionable and established public servants as permanent postmen.</P>
    <P>We have an analogous situation in the Department of Agriculture.  That <Col N="818" /> also has a historical background.  When the old Congested Districts Board was established in this country, one of its functions was to provide instruction in the type of agriculture commonly obtaining in the congested areas.  In the course of time, with the passage of the Land Acts which were passed when the State was founded, the Congested Districts Board was abolished. All the functions it used to discharge within the congested areas which were appropriate to the Land Commission were transferred to the Land Commission and all the functions it used to discharge in the congested areas which were appropriate to the Department of Agriculture were transferred to the Department of Agriculture, with the result that we acquired in the Department of Agriculture a body of inspectors who were doing work closely analogous to that of a junior inspector of the Department of Agriculture. Owing to the fact that they were originally appointed by the Congested Districts Board, they did not enjoy established status.</P>
    <P>In that connection it is important to point out to the House that there was a distinction here because the CDB inspectors were not required to be university graduates in the faculty of agriculture.  A junior inspector in the Department of Agriculture was required to have a degree in agriculture. In that case, I am on record as having urged that there should be a confined examination to promote the CDB inspectors, congested area inspectors, to the post of junior inspectors in the Department through a confined examination because they were doing the same work.  There I ran up against the problem that the men of the congested areas had not got a degree in agriculture whereas the junior inspectors had to have such a degree.  I eventually resolved that problem with the assistance of the then Minister for Finance, who, I think, was Deputy Sweetman, by which we gradually established the CDB men in their own right, because we were prevented from conducting a kind of confined examination which their circumstances would justify by the fact that they did not have a university degree in agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> There are many cases throughout the service in which we seek, for special reasons and in special circumstances, to make straight the path of a long-service employee of a Department to move into a higher grade through a course of preferential treatment in consideration of his long public service. I am not against that recognised procedure but looking at section 4 of the present Bill, one sees an entirely new principle being introduced.  It is a very dangerous principle, a very bad principle, because, having laid down in section 12 of the original Act that the Authority must not appoint any person to be an officer of the Authority, unless he has been selected by means of a public competition, we now come along and in section 4 of this Bill propose to make an exception to that rule.  It is an exception stated in very peculiar terms. We propose to provide that the Authority shall not appoint any person to be an officer of the Authority unless he has been selected by means of a public examination, unless the appointment consists of the promotion of a person who is already a servant of the Authority, that is to say, an unestablished employee of the Authority in any capacity.</P>
    <P>We have to consider what that means.  There may be a vacancy in the Radio Éireann Authority or the Television Authority for a junior engineer.  Somebody wants to get that post for some particular person. All the existing junior engineers in the service of the Authority are already appointed under the general terms of section 12 of the original Act by public examination, but you pick out the junior engineer you want appointed and appoint him gardener, caretaker or maintenance man, that is, an unestablished servant of the Authority. Remember the Authority can do that without submitting him to any public examination at all and, having put that person in the position of a servant&mdash;I am now using the archaic language of our statute&mdash;an unestablished employee, you can then publish a notice that a vacancy exists for an engineer who is an established officer <Col N="820" /> of the Authority in Telefís Éireann and that you propose that there shall be a confined examination, confined to persons who are already servants of the Authority, with the result that there is only one candidate.  The only candidate, the only maintenance man, the only gardener, the only servant of the Authority who is an engineer is the person to whom you want to give the permanent post.  That is the extreme case but that is a bad principle to establish by statute.</P>
    <P>I remember very well a case in this country, not so many years ago, in which there was a post to be filled for a local authority, a medical post.  I remember that the advertisement appeared and when you came to study the small print of the advertisement, all the customary qualifications were stipulated but there was a new qualification, that the candidate for this post must have a diploma from some obscure pharmaceutical society in London.  It transpired that of all the applicants, and there were 20, only one applicant had this diploma of the obscure pharmaceutical society.  That was the end of the examination&mdash;he got the job.</P>
    <P>Now, we are not legislating for today or for tomorrow; we are legislating not only for the Television Authority but for the whole system of public appointments in this country, and the issue here involved is: do we stand over the principle laid down in section 12 of the Act of 1960, which established the Broadcasting Authority, subsection (1) of which says:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall, as well as appointing the Director-General, appoint such and so many other persons to be officers and servants of the Authority as the Authority from time to time thinks proper, but, subject to subsection (2) of this section, a person shall not be appointed under this section to be an officer of the Authority unless he has been selected by means of a public competition.</P>
    <P>I think we should stand on that principle and should not introduce this highly undesirable qualification.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that, unless we introduce this qualification, we <Col N="821" /> will exclude from desirable promotion in the future numbers of persons who, in their youth, had not the opportunity to acquire the kind of education which others acquired.  Well, none of us, I suppose, will make the case that this new subsection should be used for the purpose of promoting an unqualified person.  If he is going to be made an officer of the Authority, we are to assume he has acquired, in the course of his employment as an unestablished employee of the Authority, the qualities requisite for the established post. All my amendment provides is that, when the established post comes to be put up for competition, all the unestablished servants of the Authority will be free to enter for the competition but that anybody outside who wants to enter will be free to do so, too.</P>
    <P>Now, some people will make the case: &ldquo;That seems hard; here is a young fellow who has been seven or eight years, or longer, in the service of the Authority as an unestablished officer.  Is he entitled to no preference over an external applicant who, perhaps, has been working with Imperial Chemical Industries, Associated Electrical Industries or some wholly exterior body to the Television Authority?&rdquo; In principle, there should be no advantage but, in practice, we know that if a man is going for a job in the Television Authority, has been in and out there, knows all the comings and goings and is familiar with all the practices and procedures of Montrose, the headquarters of the Television Authority, or is familiar with all the proceedings and practices of the outside work of the Television Authority, he has&mdash;in any examination the Authority may prescribe to qualify an established officer&mdash;a very substantial advantage over a person with equal technical qualifications but with no prior experience of service at Montrose.</P>
    <P>What we have got to secure, and ensure, in this Bill is that the general exception proposed under section 4 in paragraph (iiA) is made to cover appointments in such a way that it cannot be abused in the future.  I direct Deputies' special attention to this, that it cannot be used as a precedent to justify a similar procedure <Col N="822" /> in regard to the whole system which we have painfully established in this country in regard to the appointment of persons to permanent pensionable status in the service of State Departments, local authorities, or semi-State Departments, such as CIE, Bord na Móna, et cetera.</P>
    <P>The specific danger against which I seek to make provision here is that, with a special examination for the appointment of an established officer of the Authority in contemplation, some chosen individual will not be made what is technically described as a servant of the Authority, lest the permanent appointment, when it comes to be made, shall be made the subject of a confined examination, confined to existing servants of the Authority, to the exclusion of all others.  At the same time, it seems reasonable&mdash;on the analogies I have laid before the House as existing in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Agriculture and certain other Departments of State&mdash;that the possibility of a confined examination in very special circumstances should not be made impossible.  Therefore, my suggestion is that we should add these words to section 4, paragraph (iiA).</P>
    <P>That would provide that the Authority, if it contemplates making a permanent pensionable appointment, must hold a public competition, as provided in section 12 of the Principal Act, unless it desires to proceed by way of an appointment consisting of the promotion of a person who is already a servant of the Authority, and as I suggest, for a period of not less than ten years.  That would give the Authority a discretion to hold an examination confined to those who were genuinely unestablished, nonpensionable employees of the Authority but who had not been brought in nominally as unestablished, non-pensionable employees, for no other purpose but to give them what would, in effect, be exclusive access to a confined examination, such as was contemplated in subsection (1) of section 12 of the Principal Act of 1960.</P>
    <P>I shall not urge on the Minister that ten years is the only period which <Col N="823" /> might with propriety be fixed for the purpose of establishing that a person is genuinely a servant of the Authority, in the technical sense of that word.  If the Minister thought some shorter period would provide adequate protection of the fundamental principle I am concerned to preserve, I am quite prepared to meet him on that.  But I do urge on him most strenuously that we should not depart from the considered decision of Oireachtas Éireann, as set out in section 12 of the Act of 1960, and that, if we do, we will do it not only to the grave detriment of the Authority itself but to the grave detriment of a principle which has served a most useful purpose in keeping the Civil Service of the State and the civil service of local authorities throughout the country relatively free from the deplorably corrupt practices that disfigured these services during the 19th century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Telefís Éireann has been in existence only five years, it seems that Deputy Dillon is now saying: &ldquo;I agree there should be an avenue of promotion for qualified people but they will have to wait five years before they qualify&rdquo;.  That is what the amendment says and I am sure Deputy Dillon gave it very full consideration before he put it down.  As I said the other evening, <Col N="824" /> Deputy Dillon is a great man for making a case and following it out to the bitter end, but there is one snag&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy himself is not a bad hand at special pleading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that this morning he has been setting up a number of Aunt Sallys and the beauty of that whole operation is that one can set them in a position in which it is very easy to knock them down.  Deputy Dillon, having knocked down most of his own Aunt Sallys, does not leave very much room for anybody else to attack them.  Personally, I have no interest in this beyond the fact that I am a firm believer in promotion from the ranks.  A few years ago we had an outcry when it was decided by the Department of Defence that non-commissioned officers would be entitled to promotion to full officer status.  That was tried and the idea was found to be a very good one.  The only snag was that they were paid less as officers, but that is something that can be got over.  I quite agree with Deputy Dillon that it would be a shocking thing if we had so corrupt a set-up in Telefís and Radio Éireann that, when a vacancy was about to occur and it is known to those who run the Authority, they would immediately run out into the street and bring in an unqualified person, appoint him as a gardener or a sweeper and, the following week, set out conditions which will allow him to be appointed to a technical post for which he has no qualifications, good, bad, or indifferent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not with him when he suggests that a person who is in the job and has been doing it, and who has fully qualified for it for a number of years, should not get any preference over those who are employed in some other type of employment which may provide a certain amount of experience.  Deputy Dillon knows better, I think, than I do that in this country, and in any country I know of, if a man is employed in a job and is recognised as being reliable and a good worker, and he qualifies for a vacancy which occurs, he gets preference, and rightly so.  It would be a shocking thing if, even in Deputy Dillon's own business and in the trade union of which I am the secretary, we went outside and threw open possible promotion to everybody, irrespective of whether we knew the background or anything else.  It would be a shocking thing if we were not entitled to promote from our own ranks, that we would hold a certain type of examination and depend on the result of that rather than on what we knew of people over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that are wrong with the present examination system is the fact that young people are expected to think their whole future depends on the couple of hours during which they are examined in certain subjects, subjects which are set by accident, subjects which, by accident, they may know or, again by accident, may not know.  Telefís Éireann are asking for permission to promote suitable people from servant&mdash;I agree the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; is a little outdated&mdash; to officer.  A few years ago we had in the health services&mdash;this still operates in some cases&mdash;wardsmaids, wardsmen, boilermen and others who were officers of the local authority.  The people who worked with them were only servants.  The Minister for Health at the time decided he would change and from a certain period&mdash;I think it was some time around 1950&mdash;they became servants and they are now no longer officers.  There is no difference except that everybody is called a servant. It was a pity, perhaps, that <Col N="826" /> everybody was not declared an officer; they might feel a little bit better.</P>
    <P>In this particular case the proposal is that, if somebody is employed by the Broadcasting Authority and a vacancy occurs, and, because of the particular type of work he is doing, he qualifies for that vacancy, it should be possible to set a particular type of examination; if he qualifies in that examination, then he is entitled to promotion to officer status.  That is my interpretation. My main objection, and this is something to which Deputy Dillon did not advert so much this morning as he did the other evening, is that, from my own experience of people doing examinations, it very often happens that some will get questions of a more academic nature than a practical nature relating to the type of job for which they are being examined. As I said the other night, there are people who did not have an opportunity of getting the kind of education others have had, but that does not stop them from being very good workmen and very competent in their job and, if they got the promotion, they would be well fitted for the jobs for which they are being examined.  Despite that, these people can be ruled out if the examination is of the type the Appointments Commissioners set from time to time.</P>
    <P>There is the other angle.  Deputy Dillon knows it better than I do.  Take the case of the postman who passes in everything, has an excellent character and excellent health.  Yet, the Appointments Commissioners, despite the fact that such a man got 2nd place, said: &ldquo;You cannot get the appointment and we will not tell you why&rdquo;.  I had a five-page letter from that man this morning.  His mental health is obviously affected.  Does Deputy Dillon want that kind of situation to become common in the Broadcasting Authority? What is wrong with the suggestion that those who are in the employment of the Authority, who are known to be reliable and who are considered suitable for promotion, should be given a test?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that it should not be a question of taking <Col N="827" /> somebody in today and promoting him tomorrow.  If you say two or three years and the Minister is prepared to accept that, that would be a good idea, but I do not think the whole thing should be thrown out simply because it seems to be cutting across the neck of one of the sacred cows set up here many years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment for a number of reasons.  Firstly, I have no reason to think that this will be abused in any way whatever; secondly, I am not establishing a precedent in this case; and thirdly, because I have as much confidence in Telefís Éireann as we have the right to have in any other State body to which we have given a relatively free hand.  This is a new enterprise, not very long in existence, and the rules, if you like, under which they may employ staff are laid down in section 12 and give them pretty wide scope to recruit technical and other staff.  I have no reason to think, and I do not think any other Member of the House could rightly assert, that they have in any way abused the high principles which should govern the employment of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It did.  Even if you take paragraph (iii) in subsection (2) which refers to &ldquo;an office for which, in the opinion of the Authority, specialised qualifications not commonly held are required&rdquo; they can under that take in virtually anyone.  They do not take in people that they do not want, or who would not be useful to them. This is a service in which the lack of proper technical experience would manifest itself in the worsening of the service.</P>

      <P>Nobody can accuse them of using subversive methods in employing staff.  We all keep our eyes open as far as these things are concerned.  I would not ask the House in such a simple matter as this to apply this to the most subordinate grade.  This is merely to give the Authority the right to give to the lower grade workers a feeling of security, that it is possible that they would become better integrated in the service and have more security, in the knowledge that they will have security at some stage.  I would not impose a period on them for the reason that I am satisfied already with the precautions that have been taken in the employment of staff at all levels. Workers today are sufficiently well organised to be able, in consultation with management, to seek a suitable formula without my trying to impose on them what it should be.  I do not think that people who are already working there are going to allow somebody to be taken in off the streets today and be promoted tomorrow.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is that labour is sufficiently well organised today to prevent that happening.  They are capable of making their own case.  We give to the Authority much greater powers for much more serious administrative matters and this would be the simplest of tasks we are entrusting to them.  If we cannot depend on them to <Col N="829" /> look after the establishment of the lowest grade as they think fit then I do not think they are capable of being entrusted with other things which it is their responsibility to do.  This would be a great reflection on them.  What we are doing is giving them authority to promote people who for the purpose of the Act are called servants. There are others who are called officers and officers can cover a wide field in the Civil Service.  They can be one of the lowest grades, for instance, clerical officers.  They could be unestablished clerical officers.  This is only a distinguishing line.  It may be an unfortunate selection but it is to distinguish between two classes.  Some of these people are doing work as assistants or helpers in different capacities and their experience over the years has become very important to those whom they are assisting.  These people would be qualified and I can understand the anxiety of the higher staff about being in a position to ensure that they can retain these people by at least being able to say to them &ldquo;Some day you can or may be given more security.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have not intervened very much on this question. I have listened to Deputy Dillon's argument for his amendment about which, I must say, I was never very happy. We have to make up our minds as to whether, on balance, we run the risk of somebody being appointed for mainly political reasons.  When I say &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;, I mean moved from the position of a servant to the position of an officer in the Authority.  What we are making up our minds about in connection with this amendment is: do we sufficiently trust the Authority to <Col N="831" /> appoint the proper person when he is already a servant of the Authority? As the Authority has given us no grounds for believing that it has abused its power in regard to any appointments made or has appointed unsuitable people, I think that in the interest of administrative efficiency and also in the very real interest of the servant sections themselves, we ought to grant the Authority this right without hamstringing it by specifying a period.</P>

It is not fair to the servant sections that they never, never can get out of those positions, even though, in the opinion of those who know them and who work with them, they are fully entitled to that promotion.  Therefore, I would say we should accept the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We can take them as read.  There are 86 of them. In regard to this amendment, the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; occurs 86 times in the Bill. It is neither an appropriate nor an accurate definition, and is not necessary. If we substitute the word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; for &ldquo;accident&rdquo;, we would define exactly what is needed.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, it is not right to suggest that all injuries that happen to men or women in the course of their work are accidents. Very often they are not accidents.  I instanced the case of the conductor who is travelling in a bus with a rowdy crowd on a Saturday night and somebody hits him.  That is not an accident, but according to the code here, it is. Take the farm worker who is milking a cow and the cow kicks him.  That is not an accident; I am quite sure the cow intended to kick him.  The occupational diseases which are covered in the Bill are not accidents.  There should be a more precise definition.  I have suggested one, but perhaps the Minister has a better idea.  A number of other countries have already removed the description &ldquo;accident&rdquo; from their compensation code.  I suggest to the Minister we should do the same in this case.  I do not want to prolong the argument because we have already covered this ground fairly well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something that was considered by the Commission, and both the minority and the majority of the Commission were in favour of retaining the present wording.  Let me quote what the Commission said in regard <Col N="833" /> to the use of the words &ldquo;by accident&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The first matter which arose in our consideration of the liability of employers was the meaning of the words &ldquo;personal injury by accident&rdquo;. These were the words used in the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897, and they were retained in subsequent legislation, including the Act of 1934 in this country.  They have also been retained in the British and Northern Ireland National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts of 1946.  Down the years many cases have turned on the legal interpretation of the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and workmen have failed to get compensation where they were unable to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that their incapacity was due to a personal injury by accident.  We noted that in the workers' compensation legislation of Queensland, Australia, the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; had been deleted by an amending Act of 1944, in an attempt to make it easier for injured workmen to establish their claims. That Act substitutes the words &ldquo;has received an injury&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;is injured by accident&rdquo;.  It was suggested to us that a similar provision should be adopted here.  Having considered the matter fully and realising that the Courts have given, so far as injured workmen are concerned, a wide and generous interpretation of the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;, we do not recommend the deletion of the words &ldquo;by accident&rdquo; from the Act.</P>
      <P>It was considered generally by the Commission that what needed to be provided for was injury arising in the course of employment.  That is being done in the Bill and it appears to me to be undesirable to change this wording, the meaning of which has been well established by many court decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister knows, in the previous workmen's compensation legislation, the question of whether or not the injury was received accidentally could decide the case for or against the applicant.  In this case <Col N="834" /> the Minister has deliberately excluded certain defences which could be raised, for instance, whether the man was guilty of misconduct and other such defences. The Workmen's Compensation Commission was not aware that the Minister was going to do that.  The case is entirely different and the position now is that there is no reason why we should have this question of accident brought in.  It does not have to be an accident to entitle a man to compensation.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for the Commission which investigated this code and particularly for the people who brought in the minority report because they felt they were fighting what was regarded as a losing battle all the way.  The Minister has not accepted every word which they suggested should be included in the Bill and surely the House should have a say in the final drafting of the Bill? If it is reasonable to replace the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; by a more suitable word, the case can be made that the Commission did not recommend the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.  The Minister should agree to have another look at this matter.  It is a matter that is likely to cause a certain amount of trouble in the courts in the years to come.  The Minister is taking this matter completely out of court.  If it can be proved that the State can refute an accident in a workman's compensation claim, we do not know where it will go but it can be that it would be brought to the High Court or the Supreme Court. The Minister should realise that the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is now a misnomer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is correct to say that.  The Commission assumed that there were to be these modifications and still recommended that the same terminology be used. The main difficulty about putting in the word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is in case of disease.  If we put in the word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;, there would be the possibility of claims being brought on the basis of accidents in the case of a disease contracted in the ordinary way, whether in the course of employment or not.</P>

      <P>When a farm or horticultural worker is treating certain types of vegetation, the need arises to use some type of chemical. The worker finds that the chemical may spill on to his hands or face.  That is a normal happening and on the container of the chemical there is a written notice that it is not harmful. The man may subsequently develop a disease such as dermatitis.  Subsection (1) of section 23 does not cover that. In the course of his employment, he has to do this particular work and the chemical gets on his hands.  In such cases, surely the question of injury to his flesh and body is not covered by the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to support the amendment strongly.  There is a great deal in it.  Coming from a Border county, I know that many farmers in Monaghan, Cavan and the other Border counties have land in Fermanagh or some other northern county. If I understand the section correctly, it means that if a Monaghan or Cavan farmer sends a workman who is practically full-time employed in the Republic to do some work in the North and he meets with an accident there, the workman is precluded from receiving compensation.  There are areas in Monaghan and Cavan where practically all the farmers have turbary rights or turf banks in Fermanagh.  For as long as I can remember and for long before that they have been going to Fermanagh to cut and save turf and to bring it home.  Quite a number of farmers still do that.  As I see the section, if a workman employed by these farmers receives serious injury in the course of turf operations in Fermanagh, or on the way home, if a horse bolted in Fermanagh or a tractor were involved in an accident whereby the workman received serious injuries, the section would preclude him absolutely from getting benefit. Deputy Tully's amendment would enable the Minister to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of the Act of 1952, for instance, gives me these powers.  I am satisfied that I have power to make these regulations under the Act of 1952 and that the amendment is not necessary.  Sections 12, 13, and 64 of the 1952 Act give me these powers.  Section 64 in particular deals with the aspect Deputy Fitzpatrick has mentioned.

      <P>The Minister is completely missing the point.  The section is very definite.  It says:</P>
      <P>Occupational injuries benefit shall not be payable in respect of an accident happening while the insured person is outside the State.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister can talk about this matter being covered by other Acts and about the fact that he already has the necessary power. He let the cat out of the bag when he talked about reciprocal agreements.  We are not talking about reciprocal agreements. We are talking about somebody who is employed in the State and who in the course of his employment must go outside the State and returns to the State.</P>

      <P>In this section the Minister lays down specifically that occupational injuries benefit cannot be payable.  Take the case of lorry drivers who go to the North.  They are a typical example.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has mentioned farmers in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, on the Border.  The same can be said of Louth.  People are constantly going across the Border on their employers' business.  This section rules them out completely.</P>

It is intended that such persons shall be eligible to receive benefits under the scheme though there may be a limitation if they would be entitled to benefit from the country in which they are employed.  I have power under section 13 of the 1952 Act to make regulations for the type of case that has been referred to and I intend to do it.  It is not necessary to give me power specifically in this Bill because this Bill is simply amending the 1952 Act.</P>

      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  Under the workmen's compensation code, if a farmer in Cavan lends his employee to his neighbour across the Border for threshing operations or any other agricultural work away from the farm in the Republic, that employee is deemed to be still the employee of the farmer in the Republic.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 9, to delete lines 49 to 53.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to delete the provision that benefits shall not be payable in respect of the first three days unless the man is out of work for 12 days or more.  I must say I have never understood this.  In the workmen's compensation code, it was four days.  I have never agreed with that and I put down this amendment for the purpose of affording an opportunity for a discussion on the provision. If a man is out of work for three days, that is more than half a week now, and it could mean a considerable amount of money, comparatively speaking.  I do not see why this should be followed for the sake of following something that has been there for many years.  I suppose the argument is that it is to discourage the small pinpricks of small claims but, on the other hand, if a man who is out of work is able to go back to work on the fourth day, he may say: &ldquo;I will lose three days anyway,&rdquo; and this may encourage him to be dishonest and stay away from work for 12 days to qualify for the benefit.  This is one of the things that are carried from Act to Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The original arrangement whereby no payment was made for the first three days was included because of the fact that in the disability benefit section of the Minister's Department, it was felt that a man who had a few drinks on Saturday or Sunday night might be inclined not to come to work on Monday.  It was felt that if he were paid for the first three days, he might possibly be off every Monday.  That does not apply in this case, and I do not agree that there was any validity in the original argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man meets with an accident and is injured, surely it is not suggested he deliberately stays out for three or <Col N="852" /> four days?  This sort of thing, as Deputy Fitzpatrick so rightly pointed out, discourages a man who does not want to lie up after receiving an injury. Instead of going back to work in the first two or three days when he might feel all right, under the present system if he stays out for a fortnight, he will be paid but what this provision says to such a man is: &ldquo;If you are fool enough to return after three days, it will be at your own expense; you will not get paid&rdquo;.  The principle is wrong. The other angle is that a man with a family cannot afford to have three days pay, which might amount to between £4 and £6, deducted from his weekly income because it involves not only himself but his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputies Fitzpatrick and Tully on this question and should like to raise another point as well.  Some workers are not inclined to stay away from work because of the prospect of losing three days pay.  At times it gives rise to difficulties in certification.  It is suggested that it is in the workers' interests to have certificates. Workers may say they will get nothing in respect of the first couple of days of illness and go back to work, later to find themselves in difficulties about certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick gave the real reason&mdash; that the idea is to discourage trivial claims.  I think it is a valid reason.  Three days is not a long period but if the incapacity proves to be of any considerable duration, in this provision we are proposing to go back and pay for the first three days also.  That is not done in the case of other social welfare benefits.  The cost of doing what is suggested here would be considerable and in view of the fact that this is being put into the social welfare code, that these benefits are being provided under the Social Welfare Acts, I think the extra provision whereby the three days will be paid for is as good as we can be expected to do.  They are the same conditions as apply in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister's statement that the cost <Col N="853" /> would be considerable is the best possible argument for saying it should be done.  It means workmen will lose a considerable amount if it is not.  The Minister says he will go back and pay them if they are out for 12 days.  A roughly similar provision was included in the old workmen's compensation code which we are now replacing.  If a man is genuinely ill or is injured for three days and, as Deputy Gibbons said, his doctor advises him to stay out for two or three days and he will be all right, and if in spite of that, the man hobbles back to work, he may be out for weeks and weeks instead of three days.  This is a matter in respect of which we could depart somewhat from what has been done in the past and from what is being done in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  There is no reason why we should tie ourselves hand and foot, slavishly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My trade union some time ago succeeded in making an arrangement with a number of employers, including local authorities, to have payments made in respect of sickness.  If the employees fell sick, they were paid.  An extraordinary thing was that this, instead of increasing the amount of illness, in fact had the effect of decreasing the duration of illness, because if somebody became ill, he stayed out and then, as Deputy Gibbons pointed out, was not exposing himself to the possibility of long periods of illness as a result of not staying out in the first instance.  That being so, the matter should be dealt with in this way.  At present a number of employers pay employees in respect of the first three days because they realise, being closer to the people, perhaps, than we are, that a man cannot exist without payment for three days. We are in fact tempting Providence by taking the risk of forcing them to go back when they are not fit for work.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 29 seek to increase the rate of injury benefit and Deputy Tully's amendments, Nos. 55 and 56, seek to effect similar increases in benefit.  For that reason perhaps the House would take amendments Nos. 27, 28, 29, 55 and 56 together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> In subsection (3), page 10, lines 14 and 15, to delete all words after &ldquo;dependant&mdash;&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for any period during which the beneficiary is between the ages of 17 and 18&mdash;£5 1s. 3d.; and for any period during which the beneficiary is under the age of 17&mdash;£3 17s. 6d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think all the amendments could be taken together but Deputy Fitzpatrick may have a point which he wishes to deal with on amendment No. 29.  It gladdened my heart to hear the Minister say that the benefits here were the same as in Northern Ireland and Britain.  If the Minister agrees that we should have comparisons, then I am glad to be able to supply him with a number of comparisons.  I am seeking to have parity with the Northern Ireland scheme.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 is:</P>
    <P>In subsection (3), page 10, line 16, to substitute &ldquo;one hundred and thirty-five shillings&rdquo; for &ldquo;one hundred and fifteen shillings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 55 is:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 15, line 36, to delete the words after &ldquo;payable&mdash;&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;£5 1s. 3d. where the beneficiary is between the ages of 17 and 18 and £3 17s. 6d. where the beneficiary is under the age of 17.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 56 is:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 15, line 37, to substitute &ldquo;one hundred and thirty-five&rdquo; for &ldquo;one hundred and fifteen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think there is nothing at all wrong with the suggestion we are making.  In fact, there is a very good reason why there should be at least parity with Northern Ireland because in fact the charges for the services are higher. There is no reason why the Minister should not be able to agree to these amendments.  I propose to show him on later amendments that there is substantial difference between what is being offered here and what is being offered in Northern Ireland, for a far higher contribution here.  Actually, amendments Nos. 62, 63 and 64 also ask for parity with Northern Ireland. <Col N="857" /> As we have not been asked to take them together, I suppose we can take them separately.  We believe that if we are to have parity with other sections of the Northern Ireland regulations, we should also include the amount of money that is being paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should say that Deputy Tully was not 100 per cent consistent in relating the increases he proposes to the rates payable in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are some cases in which the rates proposed in the Bill are higher than those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask to have those reduced.  I never ask anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he did not ask to have them reduced.  The Deputy was also rather inconsistent in proposing changes here which would cost&mdash;it is difficult to estimate them exactly&mdash;at a rough estimate £750,000.  At the same time, in another amendment, he proposes reducing the contributions which have been assessed in order to provide the amount of money necessary to pay the rates of benefit proposed in the Bill.  The only other source, of course, from which this money could come is the Exchequer and it is the principle of the Bill that the cost should be borne by employers, just as the cost of workmen's compensation is at present borne by employers.</P>
      <P>The rates proposed here are the rates recommended by the minority report but they are adjusted for increases in the cost of living here.  The rates proposed by the minority of the Commission were, in fact, the rates in force in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  They have been increased there since then to deal with conditions there and I think what I am proposing in the Bill, that is, to adjust these recommendations to compensate for the increase in the cost of living since then, is as much as I could be expected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was obvious from the report of the Commission that both the majority and the minority had roughly the same idea as to the amount <Col N="858" /> that it would be reasonable to ask industry to pay for this cover because the cost of the two schemes that were recommended were roughly the same. Since then, there have been increases in the cost of living and I am proposing to adjust the rates suggested to compensate for that.  Deputy Tully wants them raised further and he also wants the rates of contribution reduced. That is entirely unrealistic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is assuming that the rates of benefit he has produced here and the rates of charges are assessed on the actuarial basis.  Did the Minister just simply take the Northern Ireland rates and benefits and say that we will relate those to the cost of living here?  Of course, the Government always think the cost of living here is lower than anywhere else and then they start taking off bits here and there to prove that their belief is correct.  Do not forget this.  In Northern Ireland, where the incidence of injury is very much higher than it is here, the rates of benefit are higher and the rates of contribution are lower.  The same thing applies to Britain where there is heavy mining. In fact, mining here is only starting.  I see Tynagh has an open-cast so the Minister need not worry too much about the danger which will arise there. The Minister has been trying to have the best of both worlds here.  He is charging more and is giving out less.  I do not know why he should have adopted this particular line.  Since we have heard so much about the Northern Ireland scheme, the least we could do is pay the rates they are paying there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are extra cases covered by this scheme which are not covered by the Northern Ireland scheme.  The Northern Ireland scheme does not provide medical care.  Medical care is being provided under this Bill and it has to be paid for.  In addition, disability benefits will be payable with disablement benefits here.  It was proposed and passed during the Second Reading that the cost of disability benefit should be payable from the occupational injuries fund.  That represents a substantial proportion of the <Col N="859" /> extra cost here and, I think, is an explanation as to why the rate of contribution here has to be somewhat greater.  We have the extra cost of medical care as well as the cost of disability benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 10, line 16, to add to the end of paragraph (b) the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where the beneficiary's pre-accident weekly rate of earnings was less than £10, or 75 per cent of the beneficiary's pre-accident weekly rate of earnings where the weekly rate of earnings was £10 or more.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to seek to relate, to some extent, the amount of disability benefit, or benefit payable for injuries received in an accident, to the wages being earned by the workman at the time of the accident. As the Bill stands at the moment, a workman will be paid 115/- per week whether he is earning £8 or £20. I do not think that is right: there should be a relation between the wages and the compensation.  In this amendment I propose that, whether a workman is being paid £10 per week or not, subject to the other provisions of the Bill, he shall be paid compensation at the rate of 115/- per week, but, if his wages were £10 a week or more, he shall be paid 75 per cent of his wages. That is only reasonable.  That was the provision in the old workmen's compensation code, admittedly subject to a ceiling, but there is a lot to be said for it.  There seems to be even more to be said for it now when the workmen's <Col N="860" /> compensation is being abolished and when the only compensation a workman will be entitled to is that under this Act.</P>
    <P>At the present time a workman might be entitled to £4 10s. 0d. per week and, the Minister realising he could not live on that, was prepared to pay him social welfare disability benefit, bringing him up to the rate of present benefit.  But, when the Bill becomes law, he will have one source only to claim from, namely, the Department of Social Welfare.  The principle is wrong, that there should be a flat rate, especially when it is being paid for by the employers.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment, in principle.  If he does not accept my figures, he and his advisers could work out some equitable scale but he should accept the amendment in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I think, is not really necessary&mdash;certainly not on any hardship grounds because, of course, there are, in addition to the rate of 115/-, increases for adult and child dependants.  This proposal is to introduce wage-related benefits for persons with wages of £10 per week and over without any change in the rate of contributions. One could not very well justify doing that; there would also have to be increases in the rates of contributions and that would be a very involved process.  It is estimated that this proposal would be likely to give a total increase of about £150,000 a year for injury benefit and would involve an extra impost on industry which was not recommended by either of the sections of the Commission and I do not think it is necessary, or desirable, to do this.  The rates being proposed of both injury benefit and disablement benefit, plus the fact that disability benefit or the unemployability supplement will be payable in addition to disablement benefit, make this not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I cannot accept the Minister's views. I think an injured workman who is being paid £16 or £17, or even £20, a week should, even if he is not married <Col N="861" /> and has no dependants, get more than his fellow workman who is similarly circumstanced but is only earning half that amount.  That is my contention. If it is an effort to compensate the workman for his injury and loss of earnings rather than to give him a mere means of existence, I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not argue against the theory that it would be a good idea to have wage-related benefits, but it is a difficult thing and we could not start to introduce such a completely new idea in this Bill.  But, I cannot argue against the theory that the person who has a larger income when he is at work suffers a more severe diminution in his standard of living on becoming disabled or unemployed. That is obvious but the most we have been able to do here at the moment is to provide flat rate benefits under the social insurance scheme. That is all we can aim at at the moment in this extension of the scheme.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We had best be clear about this.  I do not want to say this in any offensive way but the Minister will agree, I take it, that in 1966 115/- a week will do no more than keep a single workman in existence&mdash;&ldquo;frugal comfort&rdquo; would be nearly too strong a term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what Deputy Fitzpatrick forgets is that that 115/-would be payable to the man who is assessed as being 100 per cent disabled&mdash;even if he might, in fact, be able to work and would be paid while he was working&mdash;but, in addition to being eligible for this 115/- disablement benefit, if he is also incapable of work, then he will get the social welfare disability benefit.  For a single man that would bring it up to £8 7s. 6d. The position is not as serious as Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (5). Subsection (5) of section 8 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person under the age of sixteen years shall not be entitled to injury <Col N="862" /> benefit except in so far as may be provided by regulations.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with that, because, as I understand it, the practices are compulsory insurance.  That is the first point.  The next point is that the school-leaving age still stands at 14 and boys and girls who leave the national schools and do not intend to pursue further study automatically go on to the labour market.  That is the accepted practice at the moment. Children are not obliged to attend full-time educational establishments beyond the age of 14 and, when they leave school, the obvious thing for them is to try to get gainful employment for the purpose of supporting themselves or contributing towards their support in the home.  Their employers are compelled to pay 2/1 per week for them if they are boys and 1/6 per week if they are girls.  Nevertheless, under this Bill, they are to be paid only on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis at the will of the Minister.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>There are provisions which disentitle people to benefit if their employment is illegal unless the Minister decides otherwise.  I have no objection to that, but it is going too far to write into this Bill that a person under 16 shall not be entitled to benefit, unless otherwise directed by the Minister. I know perfectly well that under the old workmen's compensation code a person under 16 was not entitled to compensation but the employer could pay insurance in respect of him.  Here, unless I am greatly in error, we are compelling the employer to pay social welfare injuries contributions in respect of these people and, practically in the next breath, we say they are not entitled to anything as of right. That is wrong.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is correct in asking that this should be deleted.  I can see no reason why this sort of thing should be included in the Bill at all, except for one of two reasons: that it was in the previous Act and someone decided that, if it was good enough for the people who went before, it is good enough for us or, instead of working out a table and putting it in the Bill, as could so easily have been done, showing what young people would be entitled to, which would be a lesser amount, they decided that at their leisure they would eventually work out something that would apply to these.</P>
      <P>We had an example of this in the contributory old age pension.  The Minister by regulation precluded a number of people, not deliberately but because of the regulation he made, from receiving the pension.  The regulation excluded people who should have been included.  At the moment we have two sections of youngsters, those who go on for further education after 14 and those who leave school at 14.  The latter are not just hanging around the roads.  They go to work. The Fianna Fáil Deputies present are as well aware of that as I am.  It is desperately unfair that they should not be safeguarded in this Bill.  The Minister may feel he will be the custodian of their rights and will make a regulation ensuring they get that to which they are entitled.  I do not think that is good enough.  I am not decrying what the Minister might do, but this Bill is being passed for people; they must have insurance paid for them.</P>

      <P>In subsection (7), page 12, line 16, after &ldquo;scale&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(in Table III)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this is that subsection (7) at present reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the extent of the disablement is assessed for the period taken into account as amounting to less than twenty per cent, disablement benefit shall be a gratuity (in this <Col N="866" /> Act referred to as a disablement gratuity)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  of an amount fixed, in accordance with the length of the said period and the degree of disablement, by a prescribed scale, but not in any case exceeding three hundred and eighty pounds, and,</P>
    <P>(b)  payable, if and in such cases as regulations so provide, by instalments.</P>
    <P>I wish to have included a scale which sets out the disability benefit, the same as operates in Northern Ireland.  In Northern Ireland, the scale is laid down at £45 for one per cent, £67 10s. for two per cent and so on, until we reach 18 per cent.  When we reach 16 per cent, we find that the amount is £382 10s. in Northern Ireland but for 20 per cent here, it is proposed that there should be £380 so that in fact we are falling behind right along the line.  I do not know in what way the Minister proposed to have gratuities for degrees of disablement attended to under 20 per cent.  Who is going to decide the amount?  The sensible thing would have been to add in one per cent, two per cent, three per cent and so on.  Everybody would then know, once the medical evidence had been satisfied and so on, what the entitlement to benefit would be.  This in another of these cases where it appears that there has been a lazy approach for the purpose of avoiding the trouble of having to calculate and then add a subsection to the Bill.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 37:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (7), page 12, lines 16 and 17, to delete &ldquo;three hundred <Col N="869" /> and eighty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one thousand&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that the figure of £380 as a maximum for a degree of disability less than 20 per cent is totally inadequate. The scale in Table 1 provides that where the degree of disability is 100 per cent, the disability pension is to be 115/- and where the degree of disability falls to 20 per cent, the disability pension is to be 23/-.  If the degree of disability were to be 19 per cent, the very maximum compensation the injured man could get would be a lump sum of £380.  That is unfair.  I gather from the Minister that mathematics is a difficult problem and certainly it is not my long suit, but calculating what a man whose disability was just under 20 per cent would get, it would work out, I think, at £50 a year.  If he were disabled for life at 35 years of age, taking his expectation of working life to be 65, he would have 30 years, and 30 multiplied by 50 gives 1,500.  If he was entitled to a pension of just under 23/- per week it would work out at about £1,500 for a man between the ages of 35 and 65. Under this Bill he will get only £380. I cannot understand that.  There should be a sliding scale all right but the maximum should be much higher.  A man with a few degrees of disability would be paid only a small sum, but the man with 15, 16, 17 or 18 per cent disability should get a much more substantial sum, depending on his age and the probable duration of the disability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The only other angle to this is that the Minister, I am sure, is aware of the man in employment who suffers slight disability, and the usual thing is that if the employer is carrying his own insurance, the employee is offered light work.  He is kept in employment for a while and if the incapacity is greater than it was supposed to be, an effort is made to get rid of him.  Under this <Col N="870" /> regulation it is proposed to pay such a person a certain sum of money&mdash;I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick, a totally inadequate sum of money&mdash;and if he is unable to find further employment he may be in the awkward position of having to go around from job to job, and he will not get the full rate to which he is entitled because he is only slightly incapacitated.  The amount should be very much more than the amount laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of the incapacity which would arise of less than 20 per cent would be such that it would not diminish the person's capacity for performing his normal employment.  Taking the scale of disablement benefit that would be payable for different percentages of disablement, the amount of the gratuity proposed for 19 per cent represents the approximate value of the pension that would otherwise be payable if the same system of reducing the pension in accordance with degrees of disablement was followed.  It was felt that the weekly rates of pension for lower degrees of disablement would be so small as to be inconsequential and that in these cases it would be better to give the lump sum instead.  If we were to increase the lump sum as suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick it would be making the amount payable for the smaller percentages more valuable than the amount of the disablement pension that would be payable for higher percentages of disablement.</P>

This regulation is one that may not be made.</P>

      <P>Here we are simply asking for parity with what has been done in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The Bill says:</P>
      <P>The scale prescribed for the purposes of this subsection shall be the same for all persons, except that a lower amount may be fixed thereby for cases where, at the beginning of the period taken into account by the assessment, the beneficiary is under the age of eighteen years.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the age should be 17 years.  Have we actually decided that there is a dangerous period of one year which it would be better to take away? The Bill as it is at the moment makes 18 years the age at which one becomes an adult, rather than 17 years.  I think the Minister would be well advised to make it 17 years.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Tully is actually proposing is that a reduced scale should be applied and there is a provision in section 9, subsection (7), that a reduced scale may be applied in these cases.  Deputy Tully's amendment does not appear to make sense in this.  If amendments Nos. 39 and 40 were both made in the Bill, it would read: &ldquo;Where the beneficiary is under the age of 17 years or, as the case may be, 17 years&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>What I am suggesting is that we should substitute &ldquo;seventeen&rdquo; for &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo;; in other words, that the full rate should be paid to those over 17 years of age, as is done in Northern Ireland and Britain.  The Bill suggests that those under 18 will be paid on the lesser scale.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

They were suggested in the minority report and adjusted to take account of the increase in the cost of living since that time.  The scheme has been costed on that basis and the rates of contribution decided to finance the rates of benefit proposed in the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (9).</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, I stated I could not receive this Bill with enthusiasm.  In saying that, I had provisions of the Bill like subsection (9) of section 9 in mind.  My amendment proposes to delete that subsection, which reads:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of section 44 of the Principal Act, an appeal shall not lie against a provisional assessment of the extent of disablement before the expiration of two years from the date of the first assessment of the extent of disablement in the case, nor where the period taken into account by the assessment falls wholly within those two years.</P>
      <P>As I understand that, if an assessment of disablement is made, the injured workman is not to have a right of appeal to anybody against that assessment for two years, no matter how mistaken the assessment may be.  Worse than that, apparently, if the disablement is to last for only two years, then he is to have no right of appeal whatever at any time.  That is taking away from the workman his fundamental rights.  It is provisions like that and later provisions in the Bill&mdash;provisions like the lump sum of £380 we have been talking about&mdash;which will leave workmen regretting very much we ever departed from the workmen's compensation code.  It is provisions like this that will spoil this measure. I want to make it perfectly clear, as I did on the Second Stage, that I do not want to hold out for the retention of the workmen's compensation code as it stands at the moment, and neither do my Party; but I do want to preserve for workmen their right of appeal.  I do not want to leave them in the hands of the Civil Service completely, as this measure proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if a man is dissatisfied, there should be an immediate appeal from an assessment.  Deputy J.A. Costello stated on Second Reading that there was a well-known phrase in the Department that &ldquo;the fund must be protected at all costs&rdquo;.  The Minister stated in reply that Deputy Costello had not quoted the entire phrase which <Col N="879" /> was &ldquo;that the fund must be protected against fraud&rdquo;.  It means the same thing because people in the Department may think something is fraud which is not fraud at all.  I know from experience that it is the easiest thing in the world to develop, and develop honestly, either an insurance company bias or Department of Social Welfare bias to the effect that the workman is malingering.  It is much more important that the injured workman should be protected than that the fund should be protected.</P>
    <P>The provision in this subsection (9) seems to me to mean that the funds should be protected at the expense of the insured workman.  I could give the House an example which occurred within the past few months and about which I had to write to the Department where an injured workman, with a wife and seven children dependent on him, has been certified by a medical referee or other medical officials in the Department of Social Welfare as fit for work at the same time as the regional orthopaedic surgeon in our area advised him not to work and had reserved a bed in the Regional Orthopaedic Hospital in Navan to perform a serious operation on him.  That man's wife had to be driven three miles to the county council relieving officer in order to get £3 for him.  If there were no right of appeal in that case, what would the position be?  We are dealing here with disability benefit of a limited nature but the principle is the same.</P>
    <P>Officials in the Department of Social Welfare can make honest mistakes. They can develop biases.  I shall have more to say about this on a later amendment which I have put down and on which I shall challenge a division because a vital principle is involved and if necessary I shall produce the case I have just been speaking about.</P>
    <P>I intend to press this and I ask the House to hold with me that there should be an appeal.  I will say, on a later amendment, to whom the appeal should be made but certainly there should be an appeal immediately the workman is dissatisfied.  It is altogether out of keeping that the rights of workmen and indeed, I would say, of <Col N="880" /> natural justice that a man should be deprived of an appeal for a period of two years and if the cause of his complaint falls within two years that he should have no appeal at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said.  The Minister and his Department know that one of the few things I find fault with is the appeals system.  The Minister himself, I think at a time when he was not on his usual guard, made the comment, in reply to a supplementary question by me some time ago, that a second appeal is not important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if he was not entitled to avail of his right to have a second appeal.  The Minister said yes but that he did not think it as important as the first one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was a fact that a person who was appealing for the second time had already been found fit by two different medical referees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that I can produce evidence to him of appeals and eventually a person was found unfit after he had been declared fit by two of his doctors. I know of a case similar to that mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick where a man was declared fit for work by an appeals officer of the Department on the same day as the local assistant county medical officer of health had recommended his return to Peamount where he has since died.  This is one of those things which should not happen but did happen.  If there is to be no appeal, the Act can be badly misused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may not be reading this subsection correctly but I read into it that if somebody who is suffering as a result of receiving an injury comes under the Workmen's Compensation code and a degree of incapacity is assessed, let it <Col N="881" /> be one per cent or 100 per cent, then that degree of incapacity must remain for two years, if he does not get better or die in the meantime.  He has no right of appeal against it even if he has stonewall evidence that the assessment is incorrect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only if that period is included in the assessment.  If the medical officer certifies that his degree of disablement will be of such a percentage for a period of two years or more&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a doctor's stethoscope that he would require for that but a crystal ball.  I do not know if the Minister would issue crystal balls to the medical officers of health.  I do not know how anybody can say, with any degree of certainty, that a degree of incapacity is likely to remain over a period.  What I do not want to see happening is that a person who is declared by his local doctor&mdash;and this is the important thing&mdash;to have a high degree of incapacity is examined by somebody who says his degree of incapacity is very much lower will have no right of appeal for two years if the person who declares the state of incapacity says he will remain that way for two years.  The Minister will admit that very great hardship could result if this is accepted and he should have another look at it.  Possibly, it is just put down there without going into the other side of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Deputies across the floor of the House are making concerns a man who is probably dissatisfied with his primary assessment. The primary assessment having been made, the man's condition may deteriorate.  He may deteriorate from 40 per cent to 80 per cent.  His case should be reviewed inside the statutory period or even inside any period laid out by the medical referee provided <Col N="882" /> his local doctor asks the Department to do so.  He could do so by indicating to the Department his opinion that this man's condition has deteriorated and that he is a suitable case for review.  I think there should be no limit to that review and that it should be a matter for the local doctor and the patient himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. A provisional assessment means that it is of a temporary nature.  It implies that there is a possibility of the degree of disability changing.  In the event of such a deterioration taking place, the person concerned is always at liberty to apply for a review.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Minister can satisfy me by reference to some section that a review can take place without any change in circumstances I will be satisfied but I am not satisfied to accept the position that the first doctor who examines a man is deemed to be infallible for two years.  That is what is in this section. I am not saying that the Department of Social Welfare doctors alone can make mistakes.  Every day in the courts we have had under the old system men cut off on reports of insurance companies' doctors.  A man would bring his case to court and when it was tried and other doctors gave evidence he would be restored to benefit immediately.  I am not being offensive or suggesting that this can only happen in the Department of Social Welfare.  It can happen outside it.  A doctor who examines a man expecting or hoping to find nothing wrong with him can honestly make a mistake.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to put this in the clearest way.  If he can show that a provisional assessment must not stand without question for two years I will have second thoughts about it.</P>

As recently as three or four weeks ago, for the third time, I had a case of a man who was examined by one of the Minister's referees and declared fit for work.  This man was suffering from asthma.  It was discovered that at the time of the day at which he was examined he was apparently in good health whereas a few hours later he was barely able to walk.  For the third time, I asked that the matter be reviewed and, again for the third time, he was declared unfit for work, as he is unfit, and has been for quite a long time.  He did not claim that his condition had deteriorated.  He claimed that he was not fit for work.  According to what the Minister says, he would have to be able to prove that his condition had disimproved.  We are not talking about such a case.

Another referee examined him and said he was unfit.  Three times that has happened.  I can give a number of other cases where the same thing has happened.

      <P>In fairness to doctors, may I say that we may be dealing with <Col N="886" /> a matter of one per cent in these cases? Where one doctor may find a 45 per cent disability, another doctor may find 50 per cent.  On the other hand, one doctor may find a 44 per cent disability and another doctor may find a 40 per cent disability.  We are dealing with very fine margins at this stage and it will be difficult to decide in many cases.  There is no doubt that injured workmen will be very dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>The other point I should like to make is that in the case I have mentioned where the family doctor asks for a review and it is found on review that the man's health had deteriorated from the date stated by the family doctor, will the workman be paid retrospectively the increased amount per week to which he is entitled for that period?  I do not know whether it arises here or not.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to repeat that I think an appeal is necessary as of right in all cases.  I go back to the case that I told the House about and of which I had experience a few months ago.  A man was in receipt of social welfare benefit at a fairly substantial rate.  He was certified by somebody who came to the local social welfare office as fit for work.  The man was getting about £7 a week disability benefit.  He had an excellent industrial record of about 20 years' work in a factory.  His wages had been about £10 or £12 per week. At £7 a week, he was at a loss.  He is certified as fit for work.  He says he is not fit for work.  The regional orthopaedic surgeon for the north-eastern region has certified him as not being fit for work.  He says: &ldquo;I am waiting to bring you into the orthopaedic hospital in Cavan to operate on you.&rdquo;  That man is deprived of his disability benefit until I write in an appealing letter asking them to do something about it, and then he gets a cheque or a paying order for £80 arrears.  If that man had no right to appeal to someone he would have to go on suffering this injustice for two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know we are dealing with disability benefits, but there can be a <Col N="887" /> difference between 100 per cent and 20 per cent which would be £4 12 a week, if I understand it correctly, and if this section means anything, and if it is worth writing in, it means that there is no appeal for two years irrespective of the length of time the man has been suffering.  Worse than that, if he was certified as disabled for 18 months only, and the percentage of disability was 20 instead of 100, he could go on suffering this loss of £4 12 a week for 18 months.  That is what the section means.</P>
    <P>Under the present workmen's compensation code, if a man's compensation is cut off, or if he is declared partially fit for work, which is substantially what this is doing here, he has a right to bring his case to court, and the doctor who is certifying him as partially fit has to come in and subject himself to cross-examination, and has to face the evidence of another doctor.  He has to substantiate what he says.  Here, nothing is done about that. The man will be examined behind closed doors by one doctor, who will not be subject to any cross-examination, public or private.  That is the end of it.  It sounds fantastic to me, and if the working people of this country and the Labour Party will stand for that I will be amazed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is necessary.  The procedure that is available to have a case reviewed in the light of new evidence, which would cover additional medical evidence, is actually a better and a more favourable procedure for the workman to adopt.  If Deputy Tully and Deputy Fitzpatrick are prepared to accept that I will consider this and see if there are any serious administrative objections to it between now and Report Stage.  I will do that, but I think the position as it is is more favourable actually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few general remarks on the question of personal injuries in the course of employment, and their causation.  I feel that in the second line of subsection (1) the words &ldquo;or diagnosed&rdquo; should be added after the word &ldquo;caused&rdquo; because in changing over from the workmen's compensation code to the Social Welfare Acts there will be cases of men with injuries and they may overlap the appointed day. It will not be too easy for them to go back and prove when they got the injuries.  The same thing will apply in Section 23 on the question of disease.</P>
      <P>I am thinking of a man who develops what is called beat knee in the course of mining.  The same would apply to arthritis, and it would apply particularly in the case of pneumoconiosis which obviously started before the appointed day.  A working man might not find it too easy to prove when he got it.  It might mean going back some months or some years.  I think it would make it easier if the words &ldquo;or diagnosed&rdquo; were inserted. As I understand the procedure in the House, the Minister can consider it between now and Report Stage.  It may be said that surely a man would know when he was injured.  That would apply in a lot of occupations, but there are people in parts of the country who move from one employment to another.  This occurs particularly in my area, and people are not in a position to state exactly when the injury occurred and when they are examined by a doctor they may be told: &ldquo;You have got arthritis following an injury you received at such a time&rdquo;.  In view of the fact that we are changing the law, we should try to take in those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other cases I could mention.  Take the case of a man who injures his knee playing football.  He gets the benefit of the national health service and perhaps three months afterwards <Col N="889" /> he injures the same knee at work.  Is he entitled to benefit under the Social Welfare Acts?  Subsection (3) (b) (i) reads:</P>
    <P>would in any case have been subject thereto as the result of a congenital defect or of an injury or disease received or contracted before the relevant accident, or</P>
    <P>If this man injures his knee at work on the second occasion, is there a danger that he will be told: &ldquo;You injured your knee playing football about three months ago and you are not entitled to receive compensation under the Social Welfare Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the man who injures his back and receives compensation under the workmen's compensation code.  He returns to work after the appointed day and some months later he re-injures his back.  Is he precluded from the benefits of this Bill or will he get them because he suffered the injury in the course of his employment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have a note more or less on the same lines as what Deputy Gibbons has been saying and he may be able to help me. Subsection (3) (b) (ii) states:</P>
      <P>would not have been subject thereto but for some injury or disease received or contracted after, and not directly attributable to, that accident;</P>
      <P>I am thinking of a case where there were two accidents which caused the disability and I am wondering is that covered by this section.  If he has suffered two injuries is he excluded?  That should be included.  You might have a man who met with an accident and carried on all right but who then met with a second accident and the accumulative effect of the two caused disability. I suggest that case should be included, though I am not sure that it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming to the end of this debate for today. Deputy Gibbon's points were excellent but there is one further thing I have been trying to define.  I have read the Bill three times and cannot find it.  It <Col N="890" /> is in reference to the person who meets with an accident and is in receipt of compensation prior to the coming into operation of the new Act.  Let us suppose his employer is either carrying his own insurance or goes broke or dies, and there is no way of continuing the compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any danger of this being taken over as workmen's compensation or industrial injuries benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to a person who receives one injury and gets the appropriate benefit and receives another injury of a similar nature, he can get further benefit, provided the total of the awards does not exceed the maximum rate of benefit provided under the Bill and, of course, subject to the rule that it does not exceed pre-accident earnings.  Theoretically, a person who injures a knee playing football and the injury recurs during work could be excluded if this were established. That, however, is very unlikely to happen.  On the question of inserting the word &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;incur&rdquo;, I do not think that would be practicable.  There is a provision in section 23 (4) whereby provision will be made by regulation:</P>
      <P>(4)  Provision may be made by regulation for determining the time at which a person is to be treated for the purposes of the Acts as having developed any disease or injury prescribed for the purposes of this section, and the circumstances in which any such disease or injury is, where the person in question has previously suffered therefrom, to be treated as having recrudesced or as having been contracted or received afresh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That subsection covers the cases Deputy Gibbons has in mind&mdash;cases of diseases such as pneumoconiosis&mdash; in the only way in which it is practicable to deal with them.  The regulations will prescribe that the first day of incapacity will be deemed to be the date on which the disease was contracted. It seems to me to be the same thing <Col N="891" /> as the day on which it was diagnosed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point in relation to congenital defects.  I suggest the Minister should have another look at this question.  With the great efforts now being made to employ the handicapped, the suggestion that a person is suffering from a congenital handicap and that he will not be entitled to compensation under this legislation may mean that employers will not employ the handicapped.  I feel that, as far as possible, such persons should not be subjected to this handicap.  The Minister did not refer to my point about the man who had received his lump sum some time before the new Act came into force, but had a recurrence of his injury some months following the coming into operation of the Act.  Will he be told he has already received compensation for his injury or will he come under this section as if he were incapacitated for the first time?  This is important because people may not employ such a man if they feel there is some such risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons referred to the big effort being made to employ the handicapped.  I have a couple of hundred unemployed people in my area who are not handicapped and I should be delighted if Deputy Gibbons would help me to get employment for them.  How will the system work if somebody receives an injury after the passing of the Act? Supposing a man working in a farmyard falls and goes to the doctor in order to apply for benefit, which he eventually receives.  If at a subsequent date another doctor certifies that this is the result of an old injuiry, does that man continue in benefit, or what happens?  It has been brought to my notice, as general secretary of a trade union, that quite a number of my members have been injured at work and have found, when their cases come to court, that the doctors say the injury complained of occurred many years before.  Most of them tell me they have no recollection of any such accident and it is suggested in court that they are suffering from arthritis and the bottom falls out of their case. <Col N="892" /> Can that happen under the legislation we are now discussing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a medical matter&mdash;a question where the medical evidence determines whether the person is suffering from arthritis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He is suffering from an injury.  The doctor to whom he went originally says he is suffering from an injury and for several months he is getting compensation, but a specialist later says the man met with an accident years ago, sustained a break in the bone and is suffering from arthritis.  This is causing a lot of annoyance.  It has been cropping up quite recently.  If somebody is paid compensation under the new Act and is certified as having sustained injury in an accident in his employment, can the same thing happen?  On a subsequent date, if some doctor certifies that the man suffered from an old injury, is that man to be put on ordinary social welfare benefit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a conflict.  A man may be told to go back to the employer with whom he worked when he was injured.  If the word &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo; is included, once the case is diagnosed, the Department of Social Welfare will take responsibility for it.  There would then be no conflict, no necessity to go back to decide when the injury occurred.  All this, of course, applies more appropriately to section 23.  My feeling is that the word &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo; is vitally important, particularly to cases arising during the year following the coming into operation of the Act.  It would save workmen, solicitors and others, and probably the Departmental officials, a lot of worry and trouble. You would have something concrete once the certificate was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What could be more concrete than taking the first day of incapacity as the day on which the disease was contracted or the injury received?  If the worker made his claim on the ground that he was incapacitated before the Act came into force, then it comes under workmen's compensation.  If he does not claim <Col N="893" /> that he was incapacitated until after the day the Act comes into operation, he comes under the Bill because the disease is taken as having been contracted on that date.  I do not see any need for including the word &ldquo;diagnosis.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pose a question to the Minister as to what can be done where there is a difference as to diagnosis.  I had a case recently of a young man who was obliged to lay off work due to illness. His doctor diagnosed a simple skin rash.  The condition worsened considerably and the workman had to be hospitalised. The doctor in the local hospital diagnosed dermatitis.  In the meantime, he had applied for social welfare benefit for his wife and very large family.  The question was raised in the Department of Social Welfare in respect of the ailment diagnosed and described in the doctor's certificate.  A long delay ensued before this issue was cleared up.  The man, having left hospital went back to the local doctor again, who, incidentally, was the doctor attached to the factory, the business enterprise in which this man worked.  The doctor persisted again in putting down a skin rash.  The workman brought this to his notice and as a result of putting this on the certificate, social welfare benefit was held up and he and his wife were destitute for a number of weeks.</P>
      <P>The man pointed out further that in the county hospital the doctors' panel there diagnosed dermatitis and stipulated it was such.  The doctor changed his attitude slightly only to this extent.  He inserted on the certificate &ldquo;dermatitis&rdquo; but added the words &ldquo;non-industrial&rdquo;, causing added confusion.  Be it said, there was obviously a vested interest in this matter. Be it said to the Minister's credit, and that of his Department, when I made representations on the basis I have outlined, social welfare disability benefit was very promptly paid, on the understanding that the workman would not take action against his employer. Perhaps this is precisely what the firm or other vested interests want in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult.  When this kind of thing happens, there ought to be an independent arbitrator who could be <Col N="894" /> called in to clear the lines specifically as to diagnosis and ailment or injury at any given time.  There is too much hanky-panky going on in respect of diagnosis and anything the Minister can do to tidy up the defects which we have had to mention on this section will be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the ambiguity which existed for so long in respect of miners' diseases in particular &mdash;I represent the constituency which has one of the biggest anthracite coal mines in the country&mdash;is being cleared up and that there are regulations in this new measure which will clarify the position in respect of tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis and all the other chest ailments which may or may not be attributable to employment in mining as such.</P>

As I am reminded of it again, I should like to know from the Minister if he intends to continue with this practice of certifying surgeons or will it be abolished in future legislation.  This is probably more appropriate to section 23 than to this section.</P>

It would be accepted in that case that it was dermatitis from the start.  It would be diagnosed then, and accepted, as having been dermatitis from the original date of illness, so that such a <Col N="895" /> person would come under the provisions of the Act.

      <P>In the case of the proposed schemes at Dunmanway and Timoleague the county council, having examined the possibility of improving the layout of both schemes, have now requested approval to their original layouts.

      <P>Land Commission statistics are not kept in such a way that the number of allotments of a certain area can be ascertained readily. As I informed the House on 27th November, 1963, when speaking on the Second Stage of the Land Bill, 1963 (Vol. 206, Cols. 67 and 68), the Land Commission have adjusted their working practices since 1962 so as to aim where practicable at the achievement of a family farm unit of 40-45 acres of good land in the land settlement programme.  Holdings and enlargements are being planned in all areas to provide farms of this size or the equivalent in land of varied quality and all applicants with holdings below that level are eligible for consideration for enlargements.</P>

    <P>This amendment is to take account of the fact that the sum of £11,250 issued by the Minister for Finance to Aer Rianta for investment in the hotels has not been invested pending a suggested revision of the agreement between Irish and Intercontinental Hotels Limited, the owning company, and Intercontinental Hotels (Ireland) Limited, the operating company.  This sum is now being transferred from Aer Rianta to Aerlínte who will issue shares to this amount to Aer Rianta and will hold the money pending the outcome of the suggested revision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 45, after &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;either before or after the commencement of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee direct the borrowing of £1 million by Aer Lingus from the Irish Life Assurance Company in 1957 which he had previously guaranteed through Aer Rianta.  It is an amendment which is really put in to assure the Irish Life Assurance Company that their State guarantee is being properly safeguarded in this Bill.  It does not alter the construction of capital.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment <Col N="914" /> No. 3:</P>
      <P>To substitute for subsection (2) the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister for Finance shall not so exercise the powers conferred by subsection (1) of this section and subsection (1) of section 4 of this Act that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  advances to Aer Lingus under the latter subsection together with the amount, or the aggregate amount, of principal which he may at any one time be liable to pay on foot of any guarantees under subsection (1) of this section for the time being in force in relation to moneys borrowed by Aer Lingus after the commencement of this Act together with the amount of principal (if any) which the Minister for Finance has previously paid on foot of any such guarantees and has not been repaid by Aer Lingus exceeds five million pounds, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the amount, or the aggregate amount, of principal which he may at any one time be liable to pay on foot of any guarantee under the said subsection (1) (other than a guarantee to which subsection (12) of this section relates) for the time being in force in relation to moneys borrowed by Aer Lingus before the commencement of this Act together with the amount of principal (if any) which the Minister has previously paid on foot of any such guarantees and has not been repaid by Aer Lingus exceeds one million pounds&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is of exactly the same character.  It again provides for the £1 million borrowing by Aer Lingus from the Irish Life Assurance Company in 1957 and this amendment follows on the previous one.  There is one change in it, that is, the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; appears in the proposed amendment in subsection (2), in line 3, paragraph (b). This word also appears in subsection (3), line 9, and in each case the word should be &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo;.  We are making <Col N="915" />&ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; plural in order that the Bill can be correctly printed.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (12), line 27, after &ldquo;debentures&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;securing the repayment of moneys borrowed by Aer Rianta and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment makes it clear that the continuation provided for in this section, of existing guarantees by the Minister for Finance is in respect of moneys borrowed by Aer Rianta on behalf of Aer Lingus as distinct from direct borrowings by Aer Lingus guaranteed by Aer Rianta which are covered in section 5 (1).  The clarification is inserted at the instance of the lenders concerned.  In the annual report of Aer Lingus will be found the direct borrowings of Aer Lingus guaranteed by Aer Rianta.  They consist of debentures from the Irish Life Assurance Company and a loan from the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada.  Again it is in order to ensure that the repayment and interest on these loans are also guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a protest about the continued inclusion of provisions preventing categories such as these from becoming Dáil or Seanad candidates?  We have had this in other Bills&mdash;I remember some in the Seanad &mdash;and it is a very bad thing to restrict people from taking the necessary steps, or agreeing to have the necessary steps <Col N="916" /> taken for them, to enter public life while directors of bodies such as this. I do not see the logic of it and perhaps the Minister might like to defend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been the view of the Government that directors of the State Companies should not be members of the Oireachtas.  It would involve them in political pressures and difficulties and make it difficult for them to be objective in the carrying out of their duties as members of the Oireachtas and directors of State Companies. In addition, they would find it difficult to be objective in regard to their attitude towards discussions on any particular state company.  This has been discussed on many occasions in the House and we have had the general agreement of a great many members, including those in Opposition in regard to this.  I might also add that it is the practice in other respected and efficient democracies.  There is nothing new in this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not naïve enough to suggest that a director who is not a member of either House could not be subjected to political pressures also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also dealt with that at great length and we have had discussions about the position of State companies and the fact that they should be run as commercial concerns. I do not think the Deputy wants me to go into that country this afternoon.</P>

      <P>It is to be hoped that the scheme for the granting of pensions and gratuities and other allowances on retirement will be planned much more carefully and, if I might venture to suggest, much more equitably than is the position in other <Col N="917" /> State companies, particularly CIE, and that the greatest consideration will be given to the position of people entering upon retirement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In line 14, to delete &ldquo;SUBSCRIBE FOR AND&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment of the Title is considered desirable because the £700,000 referred to has already been subscribed by the Minister for Finance by way of a repayable advance to Aer Rianta, the purpose of section 3 of the Bill being to provide for the transfer of this money from Aer Rianta to Aer Lingus and for the issue by Aer Lingus to the Minister for Finance of shares to a corresponding amount.  The revision is due to the fact that the amount permitted had been already spent by the company and £700,000 had temporarily to be given in the form of a repayable advance which will now become part of the permanent capital of the company.</P>

      <P>I wish to say one or two words on planning in relation to the air companies' buildings.  Such buildings should be planned and built for as long a period as is humanly foreseeable.  It is gratifying to note that the planning at Dublin Airport appears to have been extremely well foreseen and that the buildings being erected there are permanent.  I am not so satisfied with the buildings at Shannon.  According to the new plans which are now available and being considered at the moment, buildings which have not been ten years in operation in Shannon and built at a cost of many thousands of pounds are to be demolished.  Even the new restaurant which went into operation only last year and which was built at considerable expense is to go, under the new plan.  The steam unit is far from satisfactory, and altogether, as far as I can gather&mdash;perhaps my information is not fully accurate but there is never smoke without fire&mdash; work has been done piecemeal year after year at Shannon, which has become a perennial paradise for architects.  Considerable money is being expended, and in a very short time that money goes for nothing as a result of demolition of the work upon which that money was expended. I should like to hear something from the Minister on that.</P>

      <P>I think it would be true to say that in the case of Dublin Airport it was easier to provide a fairly long-term plan because the presumption was made that the traffic would grow continuously and steadily and that a great part of the traffic <Col N="919" /> would be handled by comparatively small aircraft doing business between this country and Great Britain, and that there would be a very steady expansion of traffic.  Furthermore, it was possible to make some predictions about the total increase in the number of passengers passing through the Airport, there being no division as between transit passengers and terminal passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Shannon Airport, when this airport commenced it was almost like an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic.  It provided an essential stop for piston-engined aircraft moving from the Continent of Europe across to the United States.  The discovery of jet propulsion entirely altered the picture and made it essential to provide for a decrease in the number of transit passengers and an increase in the number of terminal passengers.  The coming of the jet planes also required the construction of a longer runway and the construction of a new control tower, and I do not think we could have done much more planning than we, in fact, have in connection with <Col N="920" /> Shannon.  No building under ten years old has been demolished.  Any buildings that have been demolished were at least 20 years old and they were erected originally as temporary buildings. Actually when Shannon was first built it consisted largely of wooden buildings of what could be described as a purely temporary type.  Although the builders could hardly have predicted the changes that would come, the fact that the buildings were temporary meant that they were much less costly than if they were of a permanent character.</P>
    <P>The changes taking place at Shannon are absolutely essential because they provide for the alteration in the pattern of traffic as between transit passengers and disembarking and embarking passengers.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the constructional programme for Shannon is very carefully examined and kept to the minimum cost possible.</P>
