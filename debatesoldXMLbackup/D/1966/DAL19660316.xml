      <P>One would imagine the Minister for Finance introduced this Budget for fun or to try to persecute people.  I admit it is a tough Budget.  A number of my friends and I are all feeling the effects of it but what was the Minister to do?  Was he to do the same as the inter-Party Government did in 1957?  Was he to leave this country on the rocks and rush out of government?  They did not make any positive decision at that time.  We are trying to make a positive decision now to rectify the financial position of this State.</P>
      <P>I want to say that we intend to keep this State going, to keep full employment here and to see that the programme we have set before us will be achieved.  We will do that in the interests of every single person in this nation.  If we fail in that duty and if we do not face up to our responsibilities as a Government, posterity will treat us very unkindly.  We are very proud of our financial position and our economic and political philosophy and we will try to sustain it as far as possible.  The Opposition are anxious on all occasions to get better social services, better this, that and the other, and every chance they get they criticise what we are doing.  They do so down the country when they talk at every chapel gate and in every hall.  They say: &ldquo;We will do this and we will do that but directly the position arises in which the Government and our Party try to bring about those things, it is just like the Merchant of Venice.  You can have your pound of flesh but do not draw any blood at all.  That is the philosophy of the Opposition.  When our country is up against it, they criticise the action taken by the Minister for Finance to rectify the financial position.</P>

      <P>Thank you for an intelligent interjection.  That is what we are faced with, and if the Opposition <Col N="1745" /> have any constructive statement to put up here, surely we should at least get beyond this little sing-song we have been listening to for years: &ldquo;This serious position facing our country.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is a serious position which is facing our country.  When a serious trade balance is facing any country, it is up to the Government to do their best with regard to it.  They should go beyond politics to rectify it. That is what we are concerned with. In 1955, 1956 and 1957, the adverse trade balances of this nation were wrong and we found ourselves in a shocking position.  I never want to see that happening again, if it is God's will.  In my constituency I saw hundreds of people leaving hundreds of houses and going to England, America and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In 1956-57, my dear man.  On top of all that, came an adverse trade balance and I shall make a statement on that position.  I do not want to see it again.  Surely the Members of the Opposition, whether they be Labour or Fine Gael, have a national duty to perform?  If they have any suggestions to make, constructive and not destructive, to help the Minister for Finance, they should stand up and make them and they would double their votes in their respective constituencies because the people would realise they had put country before self.  We had an adverse trade balance last year and we tried our best, as a Government, to rectify it.  The great British nation had the same problem, as had the United States and other great countries.</P>
      <P>One effect of a financial crisis that concerns me is a possible recession in house building.  I have had experience of travelling in Israel with other delegates when we went to a town planning conference in Jerusalem.</P>

      <P>I shall sit here and listen to the Deputy and not say a word but would be mind closing his mouth while I am making my speech?  We have reached a turning point and we have a very big programme ahead. Our second economic programme is under way and I appeal to Deputies and to the Irish people at home and abroad to invest in the welfare of the country.  We have been criticised for going to Jerusalem.  One thing I can say about it is that it gave me great pleasure to address the 2,000 delegates and invite them to a similar conference here.  If the Irish people abroad gave us a small percentage of the support Israel has got from her people and friends abroad, we could, as I have already said, be the greatest nation not only in Europe but in the world.  If the steps the Minister for Finance has taken are not sufficient to remedy the problems facing the country, I appeal to the members of all Parties, to the representatives of church bodies and to all the people to give even sixpence per week per person towards a pool of goodwill to ensure that the nation will go on with any programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the German nation could come back after six years to become one of the richest in the world&mdash;I am not an anti-Hitler preacher&mdash;I do not see why we cannot do the same.  It is no use our speaking about the Minister for Finance <Col N="1748" /> having done this or that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought that when making this national appeal I would at least have some co-operation from the Opposition but they are so blinded by political considerations and so concerned with the interests of their Party that they cannot see the national interest.  We are concerned with the interests of the nation as a whole, irrespective of politics.  We have always and will always put the interests of Ireland before the interests of our Party and anything we can do for the benefit of the country, we shall do it. Little can be done, even if the Minister for Finance were ten times better than he is, unless we get the wholehearted co-operation of the people.  We must do something practical and worthwhile and that can only be done by the people as a whole rallying behind the Government, whatever Party are in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy O'Higgins on television and one would imagine that he had just arrived in this country and knew nothing about the background. One would never suspect that he was a Minister in the Government who ran away from their responsibilities in 1957.  He criticised the present Minister, the Budget and everything else. If that is Irish politics and if all we can expect in 1966 is that type of dishonest approach, it speaks ill for our prospects.  While the Deputy is a very nice fellow personally, a gentleman, he <Col N="1749" /> spoke in a very brazen way in so far as his speech on Telefís Éireann was concerned. It was the most dastardly thing I ever heard.  One would imagine he had cures for all the ills.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy say anything constructive?  To say the least of it, it was an extraordinary performance by Deputy O'Higgins who knew the background and all that we had undergone in that period and who knew the humiliation of leaving office with an unbalanced Budget and the country in a chaotic condition. Had he said that he did not agree with the harsh taxes that had been imposed in this Budget and that other items should be taxed instead or had he made some constructive proposals, the people would have said: &ldquo;That is an honest man.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have thought he was Deputy Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>But the people know that Deputy O'Higgins was a Minister in the inter-Party Government when the country went as low as it could go.  That was political play-acting and that is what is retarding the progress of this great old country.</P>
      <P>I shall finish by expressing the hope that the Irish people will really behind the Government as the Jewish people have rallied behind the Government of Israel and I hope that the national aim will be to ensure that there is no unemployment, that we shall not be retarded in our progress towards the aims we have set for ourselves and that we shall all do everything we can to make this country a better country than it was when we were born into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Burke at this early hour for giving us the heartening news that in Jerusalem they can build houses and raise American loans.  I am sorry the Deputy did not remain to reflect that possibly the secret of Jerusalem's success is that there is not a Fianna Fáil Government in power because here we cannot raise American loans <Col N="1750" /> and we cannot build houses and these are among other things we cannot do. This day week we trooped into this House to hear the Minister for Finance in a dazed way asking the House what went wrong with the Budget of last May.  That is a remarkable statement in a number of ways, remarkable because I think it was the first time in the history of the House that a Minister for Finance had to ask such a question.  It was also remarkable in that it was a wrong question for the Minister to pose for himself.  The proper question for the Minister to pose for himself, those sitting behind him and the country was: what went wrong over the past few years?</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to ask in this dazed way: what went wrong with the Budget of last May, as if everything that happened only began since last May.  The difficulties from which we suffer today are long-standing, not something that happened in the past few months, between now and last May.  We are now reaping the harvest of inept frightened government over a long period.  There is no doubt that the Government have failed to govern since they went back to power in 1957.  They have encouraged people to believe that the land flowing with milk and honey which they promised in 1957 had been attained and that nothing could go wrong with our economy.  Having set themselves up as the dynamic force which was going to put Ireland ahead of any other European State industrially and commercially, they are afraid to turn back and say: &ldquo;We must put on the brake.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During one of the major debates since January&mdash;I think it was on incomes policy&mdash;I said that what was wrong with the Government was not that they had done too little too late but had done too much too soon.  They had failed to face the possibility that if they did put on the brakes, people might have become disillusioned. Unless we find Governments ready to face that, our little life in this Dáil is quite likely to be rounded with a sleep.  Unless we do our duty we are not going to get a proper state of affairs here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke about 1957 <Col N="1751" /> and about the policy of the inter-Party Government.  If the inter-Party Government did go out in 1957, they went out because they were ready to do the unpopular thing and because they felt it was necessary to do so.  The Fianna Fáil Government saw the cancer growing in our economic body and were afraid to apply a scalpel of any description lest it would frighten the people.</P>
    <P>This Government have deliberately courted popularity at the expense of those who elected them to govern. They have failed to govern.  They have failed to tighten the reins when the reins should be tightened.  They have kept the people on a loose rein and have let them gallop ahead until we find the Minister coming in here last Wednesday to say that the root of the present inflationary troubles in which we find ourselves is that public and private spending have outstripped our resources.</P>
    <P>If that is so, who is responsible for it?  Was there one note of warning issued from that front bench?  Was there one note of warning issued at any of the dinners to which the Ministers went, up and down the country, to address responsible bodies such as chambers of commerce, over the last few years?  Was there one note of warning sounded by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Finance or any of the other spokesmen of the Government Party who went on television and radio before the general election in April last year inviting the support of the people?  Did they say anything except: &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;? implying that if Lemass led on, he would lead on to further economic progress and when we of this Party asked the very sensible, logical question which followed the invitation to let Lemass lead on, &ldquo;Lead on to what?&rdquo; When we sounded a note of warning, when Deputy Dillon came in on 17 occasions, according to himself here yesterday, and sounded the same note of warning and made the same sort of speech that this ersatz prosperity could not continue, it was dismissed as a political gimmick.</P>
    <P>As I said, every whim of the electorate <Col N="1752" /> was indulged so that the people might believe that at the wave of a wand the Fianna Fáil Government could erect factories and create industries overnight.  Nobody ever stopped to ask where was the money coming from.  We were suffering and still are suffering, as I hope to prove at a later stage in my speech, from that most dangerous and pernicious of symptoms, delusions of grandeur.  We thought we had money for everything.  We thought that any foreign industrialist who came into this country could get millions at the wave of a wand.  Down went the people's money; up went the factories, without there being the slightest investigation as to the potentialities of those factories, without the slightest investigation as to the past history of some of the people who came here looking for those factories, so that this country was left in the sad situation that on at least one occasion a convicted British criminal could get the people's money to set up a factory on the understanding that 200 persons would be employed. He got the money.  Up went the factory; down went the people's money and, instead of 200 persons being employed there, there are, I understand, and have been over a long period of time, six persons employed for the expenditure of tens of thousands of pounds of the Irish taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I mention that as a classical case but it is not the only case.  There is the case of the Potez factory; there is the Dundalk fiasco and many other cases.</P>
    <P>When we asked the Minister for Finance to justify certain expenditure on certain matters, the Minister was able to say: &ldquo;Look; I have got specialist advice and I am told I can build ships here.  I have got specialist advice that we can produce fertilisers here.&rdquo; The Minister forgot that specialists are people who know almost nothing about almost everything; they specialise in their own field and cannot look into the more extensive background which surrounds such things as new industries.</P>
    <P>We came into this House year after year&mdash;particularly Deputy John A. Costello and myself and a few more <Col N="1753" /> who travel the roads extensively&mdash;and we asked the Government was it right that millions and millions and millions of pounds should be spent on our main highways, allegedly for tourist purposes, when the people could not get houses, and we were unheeded.  It was plain and still is plain to anybody who travels our roads that we have spent and will continue to spend unnecessary millions upon the roads.  I am very glad that these monuments to Fianna Fáil ineptitude exist because they show plainly that the Government as a result of many years in Government both since 1957 and prior to 1954 have become completely out of touch with the people.</P>
    <P>I remember fighting a by-election in 1954 when the people of Cork were crying out for housing.  At that time the Government's contribution to easing the lot of the unhoused thousands in Cork and other cities was to purchase a horse called Tulyar.  I succeeded in that by-election.  I still believe that much of our success in that election arose from the fact that we had a slogan, &ldquo;You wanted a house and you got a horse.&rdquo;  That kind of thing still happens.  People want houses; they get roads.  People want houses; they get factories which are likely to close down.  The people in Cork wanted houses; they got an opera house.</P>
    <P>I was very roundly criticised in certain circles when here in this House I reminded the Minister for Finance, who comes from my own constituency, when he came looking for £35,000 extra for the completion of the Cork Opera House, that whilst I had no objection to the Cork Opera House, I thought it meet that we should consider was there any other better way in which that money could be spent.  In all, from public funds there went towards the building of the Opera House £160,000.  If that money from public funds could now be recovered, would we still spend it on building the Cork Opera House?</P>
    <P>That gets us back to a remark that the Minister passed when introducing his Budget last week, a remark which appeared to the Minister evidently as being completely original.  It was, <Col N="1754" /> admittedly, original thinking from the Fianna Fáil benches but as far as this side of the House is concerned, it is as old as Methuselah.  The Minister said that this year various desirable improvements have necessarily to be postponed until the means of paying for them can be more readily found. We have been appealing to the Minister over the years to adopt exactly that philosophy, to approach economics in the same way as he would approach his own problems of household management and to ask himself, not what was desirable but what was necessary and to spend first on the necessaries and then get along to the things which were not necessary but which were desirable when the resources could be more readily found.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that this day week the Minister, for the first time, enunciated that principle as a cornerstone of Fianna Fáil policy but I regret deeply that that policy was not adopted by the Government three, four or five years ago, in time to prevent the situation developing in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>These are not recriminations.  They are reflections on the grim facts of political history so that the mistakes, the effect of which we are now suffering, may not be repeated.  Never again must we see the depressing spectacle of the Minister admitting that both the private and public spending have outrun our resources and that we are in the grip of a frightening inflation. The remedy for it is not in our hands; the remedy for it is in the Government's hands.  They were elected to govern and we are entitled to say: &ldquo;You are in Government and do not come in bleating and blahing about the private expenditure which has outstripped our resources.&rdquo;  If private expenditure has outstripped our resources, it is because the Government were afraid to put on the brakes, afraid to pull on the reins, afraid to say: &ldquo;the golden era of Fianna Fáil prosperity is over and you must tighten your belt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke asked if we had any constructive proposals.  Constructive or not, there are certain comments which <Col N="1755" /> can be made on the present economic situation which are worth making. They go back to my earlier suggestion that this Government are completely out of touch with what the people want.  They go back to the day when the Government informed the banks that credit should be restricted and they exist today in the situation that if I go into a bank and ask for £1,000 to build a house, I am told: &ldquo;I am terribly sorry, sir, there is no money&rdquo;.  However, I can go down the street to a hire purchase company, which is a chip off the same bank, and say: &ldquo;I want £1,000 to buy a motor car&rdquo;, and I will get it.  I will pay more interest for it but I will get it.  But in no circumstances anywhere&mdash;and when I say anywhere, I mean anywhere, Government sources or elsewhere&mdash; can I get money to build a house in which I can bring up my children in the fear and love of God.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of constructive criticism the Government might think about.  There is no use in the Minister coming in and saying that private spending has outstripped our resources if he is not prepared to do something about private spending and say: &ldquo;Look; young men and women cannot afford motor cars on the nevernever system and we will make it very difficult for them to have them&rdquo;.  My advice to the Minister is: &ldquo;Be a man.&rdquo; My advice to the Government is: &ldquo;Be a manly Government; govern the people and do not be governed by them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke here in depressing terms about his Budget.  He admitted that it was a difficult and unhappy Budget to introduce and he said that it was all take and no give. He explained it by saying that all the giving had been done already, implying thereby that the giving had been done to the people, that the nice Minister for Finance had said: &ldquo;Here is £1 for thou, here is £1 for he and here is £1 for she.&rdquo;  Where was the giving done?  I have already suggested where the giving was done&mdash;to foreign industrialists and into our roads and various such projects, not into the pockets of <Col N="1756" /> the people.  Now the taking is being done from the pockets of the people and the great tragedy is that the giving has not stopped.</P>
    <P>Over the past year and a half we have had the most prodigal expenses in keeping our forces in Cyprus.  In External Affairs, we are the bullfrog of the United Nations, blowing ourselves up to the point where we nearly burst, blowing ourselves up and saying: &ldquo;We know that it is costing nearly £1 million to keep our forces there but please do not offer us payment because we will not take it.&rdquo;  It was only when suggestions came from this side of the House that that was the kind of thing we could not afford that the Government began to think that maybe they could get some of that money.  Despite our sorry experience over the past one and a half years, the Government are now considering keeping our forces in Cyprus and it is very plain that if they are kept there, they will not be kept at the expense of the United Nations but at the expense of the Irish taxpayer.  I trust that if the Government are asked to keep a force there for the next six months, they will consider first whether or not they will be paid for them.  If they are not paid for them, they will answer at the bar of public opinion which is outraged by the fact that the most glaring economies are exercised at the expense of the FCA but evidently we can spend as much as we please on keeping our forces with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>However, there is the still more amazing example contained in the book of Estimates on page 174 where under the heading &ldquo;United Nations,&rdquo; we have &ldquo;Contribution towards the United Nations Emergency Force: The expenses of the United Nations in respect of United Nations Emergency Force are being met by contributions from member States assessed on a percentage basis.&rdquo; We pay £12,350 for that.  Not alone that, but we are giving £18,000 to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Cyprus to meet the cost of the United Nations forces there. Under the heading &ldquo;International Co-operation&rdquo; we are voting £204,300, almost £20,000 more than last year. <Col N="1757" /> In addition, this House was horrified to hear in reply to a Parliamentary Question asked recently, that about £8,000 had been spent by the Minister for External Affairs in flitting from here to New York and staying there and coming back now and again to see how his constituency was doing.  The Government who say that they are flat broke and might have to come back to us again in the autumn with a Supplementary Budget might well consider every reasonable economy.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the fact that we on this side of the House, both in the House and in the local authorities to which we belong, have protested time and again against the horrible prospect of some £100,000 of the taxpayers' money being unnecessarily spent in holding the local government elections on a day separate from the Presidential election.  I remember the Minister for Local Government coming in here and saying that he would give us the reasons for this the following week.  He gave us the reasons and none of us was surprised that he had postponed giving them.  They were so shallow, so unreal and so divorced from the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves that even the Minister for Local Government could well hesitate to have the brashness to come in and give them as reasons.  We heard the Taoiseach on Saturday night, when being asked <i>ex tempore</i> questions by Mr. Barrington, regretting that there was so much cynicism about public life in this country.  The decision to which I have just referred the House is a breeding ground of the cynicism the Taoiseach regrets so much.</P>
    <P>The local bodies which were to be elected in the local government elections this year got a mandate from the people to govern for five years in their particular areas.  That was up last June.  Many of us who are members of local bodies probably look around us in the local authority chamber and say so-and-so is past his prime and they might say we ourselves are past our prime.  But past our prime or not, the only mandate we got was to stay in office until June, 1965.  This Government for reasons best known to themselves alone have decided, irrespective <Col N="1758" /> of the will of the people and by a wave of a wand by the Minister for Local Government, that people not elected to govern shall continue to govern. That is a denial of the democratic right of the people to elect their own local representatives.</P>
    <P>Another pressing aspect of the Budget is that small savings have dropped by some £5 million.  The Minister mentioned it but did not try to explain it.  The fact is, of course, that a people running on the loose reins held by the Government are spending their money.  Those who are not spending it are not encouraged to invest in small savings.  The Minister was down in Cork recently opening a new branch of the Cork Trustee Savings Bank.  He explained in a comforting sort of way that although the investors in the bank got only 2½ per cent of their money it was all right because that money came up to Dublin but came back again through the Local Loans Fund.  He forgot to mention to the grateful people of Cork that their money invested in the Savings Bank at 2½ per cent, sent to Dublin and conduited back to Cork came back at 6¾ per cent.  Is that any encouragement to people to invest in small savings?  If we had a reasonable, logical Government approach to this matter we would long ago have had an announcement from the Government that some new incentive was being given to people to invest in small savings.  I regret very much we have to refer to these matters.  Possibly Deputies on the other side feel it gives us some gloomy satisfaction.  If this country fails we all fail.  It is not just the Fianna Fáil Party or those who support it who are going to feel the lash.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Taoiseach being interviewed by a Mr. Barrington on television on Saturday night.  We saw the back of Mr. Barrington's poll.  The questions appeared to come from that area&mdash; from some posterior area of Mr. Barrington.  The Taoiseach was suitably surprised by the questions thrown at him by Mr. Barrington.  The Taoiseach explained that these questions were just the questions that you, the <Col N="1759" /> people in the drawingrooms of Ireland, would ask.  The people in the drawingrooms of Ireland could have thought of much more embarrassing questions.  I would like to pay tribute to the charitable approach Mr. Barrington took towards the Taoiseach when he framed his questions.  I would like also to pay tribute to the artistry of the Taoiseach, the surprise he showed, when the questions were thrown at him and the manner in which he was able to answer.  Despite the fact that it was an excellent piece of showmanship, it satisfied nobody in this country that they were the sort of questions the people of Ireland wanted answered. The people of Ireland want answered the questions I have posed here.  Why must we continue to waste money in keeping troops in Cyprus when we could have been paid for them all along?  Why must we continue to build roads, footpaths and various other things which are desirable but not necessary?  The Minister for Finance said last Wednesday that we must postpone the desirable things so that we can spend our limited resources on the necessary things.</P>
    <P>I want to finish on a note which was sounded by the Taoiseach on Saturday night during this interesting interview on television.  He told Mr. Barrington all he could really hope for was that provided certain assumptions were well founded we could expect a much more impressive growth of production in 1967.  That is the Achilles heel of the Fianna Fáil programme. Everything is founded on certain assumptions.  If these certain assumptions are proved to be correct everything will be wonderful.  We have been living in an age of assumptions for the last four or five years.  This year instead of that we have descended to reality because the hard facts of our lack of economic progress have forced us to do so.  We found ourselves in a situation here last Wednesday in which the Minister, in his own nice, inimitable fashion, apologised to the House and said he was terribly sorry that this thing had to be done.  Then all the gentlemen behind him clapped. I want to congratulate my colleagues <Col N="1760" /> in the constituency of Cork, Deputy Healy and Deputy Wyse, for clapping the Budget.  It was the most courageous action I have seen.  But I would like to assure them that they are the only two citizens of Cork I have met so far who have clapped the Budget.  The Budget is a measure of the manner in which we have continued along the roads of assumptions which have led us into the difficulties we are now experiencing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke asked us for some constructive proposals.  I have done my best to give them.  I have done my best to indicate that the people do not want to send our brave boys out to Cyprus when they have to put their hands into their pockets.  In addition to paying extra PAYE, extra income tax, more for petrol, cigarettes, drink and other things, they do not want to have to pay the extra money that obviously will be involved in keeping our troops in Cyprus.  They do not mind driving on roads which are quite reasonably fitted for the growth in Irish traffic at present.  They do not mind having a few holes in footpaths if they can save expenditure.  I would suggest to every member of the Fianna Fáil Party as well as members of other Parties who belong to local authorities that if their estimates are not already completed they should approach matters like that on the basis suggested by the Minister, so that instead of the inspiration coming from above it might come from below and percolate into Government circles. From this on until we are able to look our creditors in the face we will not waste our money on desirable things. We will confine ourselves to necessaries and never again will Deputies have to face the spectacle of being told by the financial spokesman for the Government that both Government and private spending have outstripped our resources and that despite the fact that a blistering Budget is being inflicted upon the people in the month of March, 1966, there might be further bad news ahead in the autumn.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> The following motion was moved by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on 15th March:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The County Borough of Waterford (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1966, provides for a change in the Waterford city boundary by taking into the city an adjoining area lying on the present western boundary, and comprising a number of complete townlands and parts of others totalling, in all, some 520 acres of which, I may say, Waterford Corporation already own about 43 per cent.  Under the terms of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939, the Provisional Order already made requires, in order to be effective, the confirmation of the Oireachtas.  The Bill at present before the House is to secure such confirmation.  The objective is to make the extension effective as from the 1st April, 1966.</P>
      <P>As we know, Waterford is an ancient city which dates back to the 9th century, a city which has down the centuries occupied an important position in our history.  In 1840 Water-ford's area was only 650 acres.  An extension in 1896 increased the area to 1,438 acres; at that stage the population of the city was of the order of 20,000.  In the post-war period, Waterford Corporation has erected 1,548 houses, and in order to cater for this building programme and its necessary social and economic concomitants further extensions became necessary in 1944 and 1955 which brought the city acreage up to 2,096.  By the early 1960s, the position had again been reached where this community required more space to expand and develop. The area within the city boundary had become closely built-up, and if the local authority's housing programme were to continue, it was necessary that additional land be acquired. Moreover, the building programme in the private sector had to be provided for and provision made also for the needs of industrial enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> This background brings into perspective the steady economic and social progress which has been taking place in Waterford.  It may be expected that this growth will be accelerated by the recent decision of the Government designating Waterford a development centre.  It is accordingly vital to ensure that this expansion is not hampered by lack of space.  Not alone must provision be made for housing and industrial expansion for approximately the next 20 years or so but the need for schools, churches and many other essentials of a large and expanding urban community must be catered for. Provision must be made to rehouse people from insanitary houses and overcrowded conditions in central city areas while at the same time providing for new housing needs arising from population and employment growth. In this connection I might mention that the estimated population for the city for 1966 is 28,700 approximately.</P>
    <P>As Waterford city grows in size and prosperity, it should provide employment and a market for a growing hinterland and not alone bring economic and social advantage to its own citizens but also radiate prosperity over a wide economic catchment area.  The proposed extension has been agreed in detail between Waterford County Council and Corporation and there were no objections to the extension at the public local inquiry held into the matter on 1st December, 1965.  The compensation to be paid by the corporation to the county council in respect of the added burden on the county rates to which the extension will give rise is agreed at the sum of £19,000.  This settlement has been ratified by the two authorities.</P>
    <P>In order to reduce the impact of the full city rate on ratepayers in the proposed added area a graduated scale of rate payment has been devised so as to bring the new city ratepayers on to the full city rate by stages spread over a period of six years.  Article 13 of the Provisional Order and the Second Schedule thereto give effect to these provisions.</P>
    <P>Following the extension, agricultural land in the added area will cease to attract the agricultural grant.  A sum <Col N="1763" /> corresponding to the reduction of grant to the county will, however, be paid to the corporation and in turn the proportion of the valuation of the land in the added area to be assessed will be seven-tenths, as is the case of all agricultural land taken into the city.  In addition, the sliding scale of rates I have referred to will operate in these cases.</P>
    <P>Finally the Provisional Order contains the usual standard provisions which are normal in such cases and are designed to give smooth effect to the extension and to introduce legal savers where necessary.</P>
    <P>This extension is desirable and necessary; it has been agreed to by the county council and I think that it should recommend itself to this House, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the Minister is able to assure the House that complete agreement has been reached between the two local authorities concerned, that is, Waterford Corporation and Waterford County Council.  A short time ago, we had a similar proposal before us in respect of Cork and there was a great deal of objection raised, particularly by the people on the county side of the border, and recent events indicate fairly clearly that the objections of the people on the county side of the border were fairly well justified.  I understand that the recent increase in rates on the county side of the border in Cork is something in the region of 14/- in the £ and this is the direct result of the loss of income from the portion of the county that has gone into the city.</P>
      <P>I have always felt that in any of these adjustments the people on the county council side have got the worst of the bargain and have suffered a considerable loss.  I know the loss is abated over a period of years but, nevertheless, it represents a substantial loss.  There is a six-year period here which can be stretched in certain instances to ten years.  However, it is a loss that will never be fully recovered by the people on the county side of the border.  It is a matter of surprise to me that the county council have so quietly agreed to the adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1764" /> Progress cannot be halted and, as the Minister says, this is an ancient city that must be allowed to grow.  The population increase has been fairly large in recent years.  What struck me about the history of Waterford as given to us by the Minister is that the adjustments have been very frequent, and a number of adjustments have taken place in fairly recent years.  Since this has been made a development area by the Government, the area now being taken in may also prove to be too small.  I think it is right to say that it is felt in Waterford city that they may have made a mistake, that most of this added area is on the southern side and that a similar area could well have been taken in on the northern side of Waterford.  I am not sufficiently conversant with it to say whether this is right or wrong, but since it is a developed area, since we expect considerable building and industrial development there, we may not be taking in a sufficient area and may have to come to the House in a short time again for another extension, which would seem to be rather unnecessary and undesirable if we are able to anticipate accurately the needs of the city for extension in the time to come.</P>
    <P>There is just one small point on which I should like to hear from the Minister.  The Minister says that the land going into the city area will no longer rank for agricultural grant and there is an adjustment being made to compensate for that.  I assume, however, that there would be quite a number of buildings in this area and I should like to hear from the Minister whether or not it is the intention of the corporation to revalue for rating purposes the buildings going into the added area of the city.  If this happens, certainly the ratepayers who are now being pushed into the city will have to pay a substantial additional sum to the corporation.  It may be right to say that living on the fringe of the city for a number of years, they have had the best of both worlds, but if their property is now to be revalued, they will receive a great shock when they find themselves under the corporation <Col N="1765" /> of Waterford instead of under the county council.  However, as I say, the increased area seems to be needed and we certainly raise no objection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the extension.  There has been unanimous agreement by all concerned that this should be done.  In cases like this, however, if there is any question of disagreement at all, the Minister should hasten very slowly.  We have found that recently quite a number of towns have been casting envious eyes on the areas around them, areas which have been built up not by urban councils or corporations but by county councils.  When a transfer such as this occurs, it sometimes happens, and Deputy Corry made full use of this during what I call the Cork debate, that quite a substantial amount of local authority money has been expended on the houses in the area by way of loan and grant; these houses pass out of the hands of the local authority responsible for building them and into the hands of another local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments in favour of assisting house building, apart from the humanitarian side of it altogether, is the fact that there is the eventual possibility of recovering through rates portion of the money expended.  If another local authority takes them over, there is no prospect of recovery. It amuses me sometimes to see the anxiety of corporations to take over land beside their boundary, while in the centre of the area under their control there is a considerable amount of land which could be built up if the corporation took the trouble to do so. I do not know whether or not that is the case in Waterford.  The fact that there has been unanimous agreement makes it appear that everything is satisfactory there.  However, I would suggest to the Minister that, when applications are made for an extension of boundaries&mdash;further applications will be made in the not too distant future&mdash;by either corporations or urban councils these bodies should be asked to prove whether or not they are making full use of the land within their own boundaries before they are <Col N="1766" /> permitted to extend.  I do not want to be accused of stopping the march of progress, but there is another side to it.  Even in the city of Dublin there are examples of what I have been saying; the city is stretching out into the countryside while in the heart of the city there are several derelict sites. That sort of thing should not be encouraged by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Waterford, my information is that it is very closely built up and all land has been fully utilised.  I can assure the House, therefore, that in this case the extension is required and there is no question of their passing over land in their possession which could be used.  It is only to be expected that urban authorities would look out beyond their boundaries to areas in which building has been done by adjoining local authorities.  That is only to be expected. Whether or not they may go further than just looking out is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the safeguards when an extension is sought is the fact that a public inquiry is held and all interested parties are invited to give evidence.  If any investigations are required as a result of statements made at the inquiry, the areas are inspected to see if the authority seeking the extension has in its own possession suitable lands and it is only after the fullest investigation of all the evidence tendered that the Minister is recommended to make a decision permitting the extension in whole or in part, or, indeed, disallowing it.  That is the practice.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of ratepayers who will come into the city area under this extension, the number is small.  There are 24 ratepayers involved.  There is no reason why, because of this extension, there should be any general revaluation of these 24 properties.  The normal procedure with regard to revisions will govern their cases naturally, but not by virtue of this extension.  It does not follow that they will be revalued; neither does it follow that they will not be revalued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> With regard to Cork, the matter raised by Deputy Clinton is still undetermined.  There is little I can say about it except that the financial adjustments and arrangements by way of compensation, and so forth, are being pursued by the two authorities, so far without any final conclusion. With regard to the rate impact on the county area this year, that does not take into account the compensation they may hope to get and it is true, therefore, that the impact would be greater in this year's rate than it necessarily would be, had the agreement on compensation been concluded before the striking of the rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, in discussing the annual Budget, that there be a rational approach in regard to its provisions, particularly in view of the fact that, apart from doing the annual national accounting, the Budget itself must take into account the overall economic position in the country and adopt such measures as are designed to ensure that economic progress is maintained and expanded.  In this context, it should be seen that our present economic position is not one for despondency, is not one for pessimism, but is one in which we can take a hard look at the situation, recognise that problems have arisen which can be dealt with by a Government who want to govern and look forward to a future in which, if these problems are solved, we can expand the progress and achieve the targets we have set ourselves for 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important job of a Government facing problems or difficulties is to govern.  Indeed, the job of government would be very easy if there were no problems.  Problems and difficulties are, in fact, the very meat of politics and administration.  I suppose that, so long as politicians are here or in any other country and so long as Governments are here or in any other country, <Col N="1770" /> problems will arise.  To deal with these problems, it is important not to get hysterical or panicky but to look at the problems in a cold light, assess the situation and deal with them accordingly.  The important thing, though, when problems arise, is that the Government of the day will sit down and look at them in a cold light and take the measures necessary to correct them.  That is the situation in 1966.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hark back too much to that period but it is pertinent to say that ten years ago, in 1956, the Government of that day, when faced with economic problems&mdash;I will not say they were entirely of their own making&mdash;did not face up to them, did not govern, but, instead, scuttled to the country prior to bringing in their Budget which it was their duty to do, as the Government of the day.  They did not face the people and they did not face the realities of life.  It was their duty to face up to their responsibilities. The then Leader of the Labour Party &mdash; the late Deputy Norton&mdash;and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, were totally at variance in regard to how the problems should be solved.  The inevitable split was there and we witnessed the refusal of that Government to face up to their responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic purpose of any Government is to bring in their annual Budget and, in so doing, to face their responsibility.  This is probably the most important task any Government have to face in accounting to the country for the nation's finances and in devising what should be done to balance the nation's books, to correct the economy and to get it moving in the desirable direction.  This Government have faced up to their responsibility at the present time.  We shall not go to the country.  We do not intend to renege the responsibility with which we were charged by the people in the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want this House and the people as <Col N="1771" /> a whole to contrast the situation which exists today in 1966 with the situation which existed in this country in 1956.  I charge the Coalition Government of that time on this single issue alone.  I shall not discuss the merits or demerits of how they found themselves in that situation but, having found themselves in a situation of economic difficulty, with problems to be faced, they refused to face up to them and to bring in their Budget because there was basic division within their ranks.  They scuttled and went to the country and left us the job of clearing up the mess they left behind them and of initiating the progress which we felt this country was capable of achieving.</P>
    <P>The figures since 1958 are good and give cause for optimism.  Problems must be settled before the targets we have set ourselves can be reached, but the progress made since 1958 gives cause for guarded optimism as to the future of this country.  In 1958, for the first time, a Government here originated the idea of economic planning, of programming for the future, of setting targets and devising the aids and incentives in various Government departments to achieve these targets. The result has been that, since 1958, the Irish people have had a rise of one-third in their standard of living.  Since 1958, industrial output has gone up by two-thirds.  There has been an increase of 20 per cent in employment in industry and an increase of 70 per cent in exports.  I mention these figures to indicate what has been achieved since then.</P>
    <P>The inevitable decline in the number of people living on the land has been counterbalanced to a substantial extent by a rise in industrial employment, though not to the extent we would wish.  However, to a substantial extent, the inevitable decrease in agricultural employment has been absorbed since 1958 by an increase of 20 per cent in industrial employment.  This is the basic problem which faces this country and every other country in the world today.  If you go around the globe, you can see the invariable pattern of greater mechanisation, larger farms, <Col N="1772" /> fewer people living on the land, larger concentrations of people in urban and city centres.  This is a problem in the USSR; it is a problem in the USA; and it is a problem here.  Our answer to that problem&mdash;indeed, the answer everywhere&mdash;is to ensure that there is a growing volume of employment in our industries, based on our towns.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable for both the Fine Gael and Labour Parties&mdash; although it strikes me as very surprising coming from the Labour Party&mdash;to decry our policy of industrial expansion, to say, as Deputy O'Connell said yesterday, there was something wrong with the policy of industrial grants operated here since the formation of An Foras Tionscal, and which has brought substantial benefits by way of increased employment in Ireland.  It is very easy to pinpoint the failures in regard to factories which did not succeed.  But then I would advise Deputy O'Connell, and, indeed, anybody else who wishes to criticise in that way, that there is one way only in which no failures will occur, that is, to do nothing.  The whole system of industrial promotion, of encouragement of foreign investment here, of giving grants and loans to such investment, of giving tax incentives where such investment was based on export industry and of assisting industrial expansion has been built up by our Government since 1958&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, in the carrying out of that programme, inevitable risks had to be taken and there have been failures.  But I would like to look at the failures in the full context of success.  The odd failure gets the headlines but the fact of the matter is that 97 per cent of the industrial projects started in the towns of Ireland since we initiated this programme in 1958 have been successful.  There has been only a three per cent failure.  If I had any criticism of that policy, it would be the reverse of the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party criticisms&mdash; that, if anything, it was an overcautious <Col N="1773" /> policy which has resulted in so few failures and which might be described as conservative, as possibly not taking enough risks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am facing the facts as I have them from An Foras Tionscal.  My only criticism of that fact is that it indicates, by reason of a three per cent failure compared with a 97 per cent success, a certain conservatism, a certain lack of taking more risks.  I noticed Deputy Mullen was at it the other day, too.  It appears to be a mounting criticism.  Do the Labour Party want fewer people employed in this country?  Do they object to the fact that there has been a rise of 20 per cent in industrial employment since 1958?  That rise has been largely due to the fact that we devised this scheme of grants and loans to industry to generate private investment here which would give employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell yesterday gave the figure for An Foras Tionscal grants at £32.6 million.  He went to great pains to pinpoint the odd failure under that scheme but 97 per cent of those projects have been successful.  I will now give another figure.  The grants amounting to £32.6 million generated an overall capital investment of £120 million and the employment content, when full production is reached, will stand at 37,800 workers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may put all that down by way of Parliamentary question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am not here in the witness box, under Deputy Lindsay, much though I should like that.  This is a question of making a speech, based on certain principles, in regard to how we are to go forward to make further economic progress. Further policy must be by way of public investment, directly by such State-sponsored bodies as Aer Lingus, the ESB, and Bord na Móna, or by way of indirect investment by the State in the form of grants and aids to stimulate further investment in industry.  This is the basic policy, the theme, which must run through the programme we have operated since 1958 and which I have noticed tends to be decried in recent weeks because some failures have been highlighted.  It surprises me, indeed, that the Labour Party, in particular, have seen fit to decry this expansion of the economy. I do not mind Deputy Barrett speaking in his usual conservative fashion; he spoke well here this morning.  He epitomises all that is conservative, all that is lacking in progress in the Fine Gael Party, and it is a point of view which should be at variance with the points of view of Deputies O'Leary and O'Connell.  At any rate, we should be proud of the progress made in the way of industrial employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts of life, as the Minister for Finance saw them, were that £12,500,000 had to be got.  This was a deficit which had arisen, not by reason of Government expenditure in any prestige direction, because the items of expenditure which gave rise to this deficit of £12,500,000 were subsidies on dairy products and on the export of pig products which showed an increase of about £2 million: again, an essential expenditure in order to maintain the income of the small farmers of this country.  We have decided that the essential economy of the small farm must be based upon milk and pig production.  There has been an increase in the Exchequer grant towards relief of agricultural rates of over £1 million.  We have an increase in the cost of social welfare payments <Col N="1775" /> of about £3 million, of which I am sure the Labour Party will approve very strongly.</P>
    <P>The only other increase is in regard to the service of debt in regard to the capital expenditure over the years because we are paying back, to a much greater degree, the debt incurred in the past.  Here again, the Labour Party policy would appear to be either irrational or dishonest.  Deputy Coughlan some days ago deplored the fact that the National Debt stood at a high figure.  In that respect, I think I am more in the Labour Party tradition than Deputy Coughlan or Deputy O'Connell because the £600 million expended since 1922 has been invested in hospitals, in houses, in roads, in improving our standard of living, in forestry, in land division, in every aspect of investment for this country's benefit that one can think of.</P>
    <P>Again, had we stayed put since 1922, done nothing, and merely governed this country with the least possible expenditure either current or capital, we would have tagged it to England as an extra region and no more.  Mind you, this has been the policy of all Governments and was, indeed, the strong policy of the first Coalition Government from 1948 to 1951.  At that time they were accused of going too far, but I think they were right and I think we are right.  My only criticism of that figure is that it is not enough. When these conservative gentlemen seek to decry the fact that we have a National Debt, I say that it represents in practical terms better Irish farms, better rearranged holdings, better living for our farmers, more factories, more houses, more roads which were built up on our own initiative since 1922 by our own Government.  We took over a run-down economy which was used as a place for throwaway reliefs by the Government in West-minister. That £600 million represents an investment in the Ireland of today and the Ireland of tomorrow for our children and our children's children. That is where the £12.5 million deficit arose.  I forgot to mention education in which there is also an increase since last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal headings under which there is this increase in current expenditure are: debt service, £12.6 million; agriculture, £8.1 million; social welfare, £7.4 million; education, £4.4 million. These figures were given by the Minister for Finance in his speech and they show that in the past two years there was an increase of current expenditure under four main headings: debt service, agriculture, social welfare and education.</P>
      <P>These are the facts of life with which the Minister for Finance was faced.  He could have adopted two approaches.  This might be the philosophy of Deputy Barrett and some conservative members of the Fine Gael Party, but it would never be the philosophy of our Party, and despite the conservative trends in some members of the Labour Party, I think it would never be the philosophy of the Labour Party.  The Minister could have decided to run a deficit and to finance that deficit by way of borrowing, and by so borrowing reduce investment on the capital side from £98 million to something like £86 million.  That would have been a very conservative approach and it would have meant massive disemployment because, although we have curtailed the Capital Budget from £101 million to £98 million, we have not curtailed it drastically. If our investment of £600 million by way of the National Debt were retarded, we would face massive unemployment because side by side with the encouragement of private enterprise, it is essential in our circumstances that the State should play a very substantial part by way of direct investment in continuing progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett criticised expenditure <Col N="1777" /> on the roads.  This again is a substantial way in which employment is given.  I will not defend the building of roads from the employment point of view alone.  Our roads are a major tourist asset.  With the car ferry service now operating, our excellent roads are a major attraction from the point of view of tourism.  Investment in our roads represents a major investment in tourism proper.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government had said: &ldquo;Right, we will not impose any extra taxation; we will continue by way of borrowing and drastically curtail our capital programme,&rdquo; less money would be spent on houses, on hospitals, on roads, on the expansion of our State-sponsored organisations. Instead, we made a modest curtailment in our capital programme from £101 million to £98 million.  If there had been a drastic curtailment in our capital development programme of the order needed to finance the Budget deficit, that would have caused massive unemployment.  The Government decided not to take that step, but to face up to the inevitable unpopularity involved in bringing in a strictly balanced Budget in which the deficit would be fully met by current taxation.  Deputy Dillon said yesterday that I and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Government were concerned with courting popularity and seeking votes.  Any time Fianna Fáil brought in a Budget which was fully balanced, and brought it in in such a manner that the deficit was fully covered, we courted unpopularity.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that due to the financing of all the services, due to the inevitable demands of education, social welfare and agriculture, due to the provision of a higher standard of living&mdash;a standard of living which has jumped so much since 1958&mdash;due to all these factors, we were faced with the problem of a deficit which has been solved by way of taxation in the current year.</P>
    <P>There was another problem which had to be faced.  There was a straight-forward issue between doubling the turnover tax and devising the taxation which is before the House today.  I <Col N="1778" /> think the decision which was taken was the right one, and I think most Members of the House would agree it was the right one.  The President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. John Conroy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President of the Irish Transport and General Worwers' Union, Mr. John Conroy, suggested some weeks before the Budget that we should increase income tax substantially.  We did not go as far as he suggested.  He suggested increasing the standard rate by one shilling and it was increased by 8d.  It was indeed extraordinary to see the Labour Party with the background of that advice marching into the Lobbies to vote against this increase in income tax which I have heard Deputy Corish advocating over the years as being the proper sort of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I think the proper decision was taken. The wide range of taxation increases which were announced was a better choice than doubling the turnover tax which would lead to an increase in the cost of living.  On the question of the cost of living, the progress which has been made since last May is the stability which has been achieved in regard to prices.  That has been done by exhortation on the part of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and by price control measures.  I think the major effect of the price control measures announced has been moral or psychological rather than anything else.  These measures combined with exhortations on the part of the Government have resulted in stability in prices since last May.  Instead of doubling the turnover tax, this is the best method of seeking to attract into the tax net as many as possible of the spending public without responsibilities.  A perusal of the range of taxation will show that the <Col N="1779" /> taxes are on petrol and private motorists, leaving out commercial vehicles, on income tax with the family allowances still keeping people out of the net at the lower level, on dancing, although this tax will not bring in much, on cigarettes, beer and spirits. This range of taxation covers the major segment of personal expenditure as we see it today.  I think that when faced with the reality of having to raise taxation, faced with the reality of having to meet this deficit, we did the right thing and I think the people see it in this way.  The people see that, faced with the situation in which we found ourselves, the correct choice was taken.</P>
      <P>As far as the future is concerned, the approach now must be to hold the line at all levels over the next 12 months. This inevitably involves restraint in regard to incomes of all kinds.  This means that if the trade unions, officially, or members of trade unions, unofficially, push too hard, it will not be good for the economy.  Certain lines have been laid down by the Government in regard to this matter.  The Minister for Finance stated that an overall income growth of three per cent with a possible two per cent more, having regard to certain factors, might be possible.</P>

      <P>There can be no substantial increase in incomes this year.  This undoubtedly is a matter for people at trade union level, people at management level and people at employer level.  What is needed today is not less work, not a five-day or a four-day week, not more leisure, but more work.  We need largely today a new moral or psychological attitude and I do not think the Government, despite their exhortations to achieve this, can <Col N="1780" /> do this without co-operation at trade union level, at management level and at employer level.  The Government can achieve their purpose only if there is a new moral attitude on the part of people in the trade unions and the workers that the country cannot afford too much and that if they ask for too much from the country, it means more of their neighbours will be out of work.</P>
      <P>An attitude on the part of management that a five-day week, a four-day week or even a lesser week, with more time in the golf club, will not be good enough in today's circumstances. Management must give more by way of work and ingenuity.  There must be a realisation on the part of employers that they have a duty and a responsibility towards the community as well as to themselves to ensure that expansion takes place.  There must be an risks in order to see that that expansion takes place.  There must be an acknowledgment on the part of politicians, public servants and people at all levels that what is needed today is not fewer hours of work but more work and a new moral approach in which the notion of an affluent society, and the notion of leisure will not work against our ultimate aims.  These notions are completely faulty in the present situation.</P>
      <P>As far as life is concerned, whether it is life today or life in 50 years' time, we will never solve the problems of mankind in any facile manner.  They will certainly not be solved by a five-day week, a 40-hour week, a 30-hour week or a 20-hour week.  Work is part of our nature here and I myself am happier when I am working.  Most of our people have that sort of attitude. As far as our duty at the present is concerned, this notion of living in a euphoria of less work and more leisure is totally unreal.  That situation does not obtain in any country where progress has been made.  Progress has been made by hard work at all levels, at workers' level, management level and capitalists' level if they take the risk and incur worries to see that progress is made.  Any of the successful countries in the world have followed that principle.</P>

      <P>We can have a five-day week, a 30-hour week or a 20-hour week and the people can have fewer hours of work and more leisure but it can only be earned by hard work.  They can earn it if they put plenty of hard work into their job and use their ingenuity to increase productivity. If they achieve those objectives, that is to the good.</P>

      <P>I have mentioned this as part of the general public attitude. I am talking in terms of the general public attitude which seems to think that at the present time more leisure, greater affluence and less work are the things to have.  That does not happen in reality here any more than anywhere else.  The sooner there is a change on the part of workers, on the part of management and on the part of employers with regard to this matter, the sooner we will achieve something. This is not a matter for the Government primarily.  It is a matter for public leaders, both lay and clerical, and also the trade unions, the employers, and the voluntary organisations and public organisations who give advice to the Government and investigate social and economic problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This view was expressed in the NIEC Report, on which sat employers and trade union representatives.  They expressed the view that you cannot take out more than you put in.  As a people we have shown that we can solve our problems.  We can make progress, as we have seen we did since 1958.  I have no doubt we can do that again but we will not do it by making the sort of bombastic speech made by Deputy Dillon yesterday and the irresponsible speeches made on some sides of the House.  I am not denying that we can have good speeches and good commonsense from all benches but we cannot have this unless there is a <Col N="1782" /> practical commonsense shown by everybody that we are facing up to the realities.</P>
    <P>I see this Budget as one way in which the realities were faced.  I see the Budget as a sound one and one by which this economy can achieve future progress. The Budget will achieve the ultimate purpose of ensuring that our balance of payments is brought down to a reasonable level.  Progress can be achieved if we do everything we can to generate an atmosphere of confidence which will attract investors in here and encourage foreign enterprise, as well as Irish enterprise to invest here.  A sound Budget, such as this one, is designed to generate confidence and to ensure that the capital inflow, both here and from abroad, comes forward.  Unless we are a Government who face up to their responsibilities in regard to this, confidence will not flow.  I am satisfied, as a result of this Budget following on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, that we will have more investment over the next six to 12 months.  We cannot have that investment unless and until there is a change in the moral attitude of our people and unless the people who want to invest their money here can see that at all levels, at worker level and management level, the people as a whole are working towards that goal.</P>

      <P>I am sure he must realise that good progressives, as he has termed us in the Labour Party, have never, at any time in the past, been against the extension of credit in the raising of our employment level. He is incorrect in saying that our approach to a modern Government's task is no more than the traditional liberal's approach.  We do not regard a modern Government's task as being that of a caretaker authority which <Col N="1783" /> does not take real action to assert its own economic ideas.</P>
      <P>A modern Government must take a meaningful approach to employment, investment and the other problems with which the economy is faced.  The Minister for Justice knows as well as I do that the Labour Party are prepared to go behind any Government who will energetically tackle these necessary jobs.  Our fundamental accusation of the Government transcends Party politics because we think that should be the approach at this time. The root and the bone of this accusation is that the economy, which all of us agree is still inherently sound, is at the moment hindered by the Government in power.  The Government have made such a mess of their own bookkeeping, we say, that they are hindering the necessary advance of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Government in 1965-66 produced a new version of politics as the economic situation began progressively to worsen.  They said: &ldquo;Do not, for God's sake, as an Opposition attack us as reactionary as we in the past attacked.&rdquo;  No longer must Opposition Parties say what is wrong.  They should rather address themselves to the underlying problems and say the Government in power are doing their best. We, as a responsible Opposition Party, refuse to confine our attack on this Government merely to the choice of taxes they have taken at this time. The Government would seek to confine the debate to where we would get the taxes necessary, to the alternatives we would adopt as an Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask how this state of affairs came about which put the Government in this straitjacket.  The answer is that the Government landed themselves in this position, put themselves into this straitjacket by their choice of extra taxation.  It is all the more regrettable because this Fianna Fáil Government find themselves in a more fortunate position than previous Governments because they have more sophisticated economic instruments at their disposal than ever before.  From all quarters there are experts' reports on all phases of the economy.  There have been economic committees and <Col N="1784" /> reports from experts and indeed if one were to judge the economic health of the nation by the numbers of attending economic doctors and surgeons, the patient should be well on the way to recovery.  Yet, in spite of all these assessments of what is wrong, the Government came out with this hoary conservative Budget, and despite the energetic apologies of the Minister and his colleagues for it, it is in no way a different Budget from what we got in the 'thirties or earlier in the century.</P>
    <P>It is foolish to suggest that this Budget can be tacked on lightly to the economic problems with which we are faced because of the nature of the economic problems with which we are faced.  In the nature of these problems, this is a Cabinet of chancers because they preside over a situation to which by their action in this Budget they have no answer.  They say the situation is now so bad that they will have to bring in a mini-Budget in the autumn.  They have not in this House during this debate come down honestly to admit where the mistakes were made in their approach to the problems this year, where they were made last year.  Their intervention in the year before has become highly suspect. It was the by-election year, 1964, when we were deciding on the 12 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The Government then made several doubtful interventions in this area. Their motives were not dominated by the kind of consensus politics that they so earnestly desire to operate at present. At that time, it was a time for mean Party politics.  Their pronouncements at that time, the results of which we are reaping now, were motivated by election advantages.  The position has now arisen in which the problems being faced in 1966 allow of no mean political advantages any longer.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out that this Budget will not solve our present economic problems because the main portion of the revenue raised in this Budget will be eaten up in further servicing charges and this will necessitate a fresh look at the whole area of Government accounting in the autumn.  Therefore, the debate on these taxation proposals will not bring <Col N="1785" /> the Government or the country any nearer to economic sanity or to the stability we are looking for.  I had hoped that in the course of the debate, in view of this crippling increase in income tax, opportunity would be taken by some spokesman of the Government to try to help the current wage negotiations and the current impasse in industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Since there has been this massive onslaught on the living standards of employees through this increase in income tax, I had hoped the Government would give an authoritative guide line in pounds, shillings and pence for the benefit of wage discussions that are going on.  They and we realise that the present rash of industrial disputes will spread and they must realise that the determination of the people involved in these disputes will be made all the stronger as a result of the onslaught on their real living standards by the increase in income tax.  I hope that before the end of the debate opportunity will be taken by some member of the Government on this matter.</P>
    <P>One of the acid tests of a Government's success in the State's economy, in the management of the Government's economic affairs, lies in that most sensitive of all registers, the field of employment.  For 1966, OECD have had occasion to draw attention to the Government's failure in this area. Though there has been an increase in industrial employment, the fact is that the fall-away in agricultural employment has more than offset that increase and indeed in the foreseeable future, according to this survey, we cannot hope for any signs of the increase in employment which the Government, in their own political version of the economic future of this country, forecast a few years ago.</P>
    <P>If it is true&mdash;this is becoming increasingly evident&mdash;that the aims of the Second Programme were over-optimistic&mdash;my Party criticised the Programme for being too optimistic in its estimates in regard to employment&mdash;then the Government must take the House into their confidence and begin a more realistic assessment of <Col N="1786" /> where this Programme is leading us, because there is no use in having this country committed officially to an economic plan by consent, by exhortations to the interests involved, if the targets which these groups are supposed to reach are now becoming increasingly unattainable.  Definitely, in the area of employment, we see the targets of the Second Programme as becoming a little Utopian in our situation. This is a pretty sad position for a Government who are now approaching their tenth year in office, as the present Government are.  It is understandable that any Cabinet after ten years in office should be a little tired.  All the signs of the present Cabinet's approach to our economic problems indicate a Government who are tired, bereft of ideas, whose grip on the real economic situation is becoming progressivly more feeble, a Government who very soon, unless they try a new and more honest approach to their problems, must go the way of all Governments losing their grip on real events.</P>
    <P>Although the Government have not said so as yet&mdash;the Taoiseach denied it early last year&mdash;the position now facing us is becoming increasingly serious.  I think nobody can deny that now.  The Government should tell us, in this debate, if it is their intention if the situation continues as at present, if it does not change for the better, authoritatively whether they intend to devalue the pound.  Drastic as this devaluation of the pound is, it is one way of answering our problems.  In any case speculation on this matter will increase unless the Government tell us what is intended.  They have bungled credit in the last year or two. They did not intervene because of narrow political considerations in time to stop the credit bonanza which swept the country at that time.  This was the land of plenty; there was no real cloud on the economic horizon.  The situation has changed and last July, I think, the Taoiseach for the first time gave a comprehensive assessment of the situation and its serious implications.</P>
    <P>This year and at the end of last year this Dáil has been more dominated than ever by the economic situation. This must be about the fourth economic <Col N="1787" /> debate we have had in the 18th Dáil.  During the discussion on the Free Trade Agreement, our Party based their opposition to that Agreement on the fact that we did not consider that Agreement as any real substitute for a realistic policy on our economic situation.  Stripped of all the ballyhoo surrounding the negotiation of that agreement, it emerges as merely one other leap in the dark by this Government.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that this is not a time for panic but a time to look seriously at the situation.  I do not think the macabre suggestion of Deputy Burke about a sixpence a head save-the-country fund is a realistic answer to our situation.  Flag days will not help the country better its present economic position but certainly the Cabinet must make a drastic reappraisal of the programme under which it is working, the Second Programme.  It must tell us whether these targets are unrealisable and have become so, in fact, and what changes we must make in our investment programme in the years ahead if we are to survive this particularly difficult period.</P>
    <P>The OECD Report to which I have already referred has posed questions as to whether our growth target should be reduced and I think the Government should consider the three possibilities posed by the OECD at this time.  We could consider whether further external borrowing should be made to foot the present capital bill before the Government.  We have had a rather unhappy experience in the past year in regard to our trips abroad to raise foreign capital and certainly we could not long afford that line of activity if the interest rates which, unfortunately we were forced to pay in the case of the recent German loan, were repeated. In any case it is a pretty doubtful proposition to say that a Government's continuing hope of influencing investment in the country must depend on such short-term considerations as the borrowing of foreign funds to finance capital industry.</P>
    <P>The 1965 OECD Survey Report spoke about the necessity for an incomes policy.  Our Party have <Col N="1788" /> always been in favour in principle of an incomes policy and we are glad to see that the Government last year came round to this view, but what we must emphasise even more now is that in an incomes policy, time is the all-important factor.  It is no use calling for an incomes policy when inroads have been made on the living standard of the workers.  As far as possible some kind of equilibrium in incomes must be reached before we can consider an incomes policy as a realistic possibility.  Such equilibrium is not in sight at present.  If anything, incomes appear to be swinging further away from equilibrium and unjustifiable differentials exist even on the wages front and appear to be increasing.</P>
    <P>We have consistently said that the criterion for one's sincerity in the application of an incomes policy must be the amount of thought given to its applicability to all types of income groups.  It is no use to be aware of the difficulties in the introduction of an incomes policy merely for the lowerpaid groups, the trade union employees, the hewers of wood and drawers of water.  We must understand how it can apply to managing directors, Cabinet Ministers and property owners. If we do not prove consistent in showing how it can be applied to all groups, we show clearly that our talk of an incomes policy is no more than another short-term expedient to ward off economic ills.</P>
    <P>Imports have risen.  As we can see from the OECD Report and its assessment of these rises in imports, we cannot really blame as the major cause of this, the usual culprit, a working force with too much consuming power which demands more goods and many of them foreign imports.  In this case it is shown that a large proportion of the imports was capital equipment for different industries.  If we are to cut down on this import figure, and reduce our balance of payments problem, we must be selective as regards the kind of capital equipment we import and how we go about this particular angle of imports.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing his Budget, spoke about this country being still a very comfortable place, one of <Col N="1789" /> the best places in the world in which to live.  One of the troubles of being in Government for upwards of ten years is that it is understandable that Ministers can become a little strange to reality.  By sheer inertia of power from being in Government for so long, they become unaccustomed to the ordinary facts of life and a little distant from them.  The Minister is a sincere man.  I am sure life is comfortable for him.  It is comfortable for many of us in this House.  It is not comfortable for the majority of people in this country. The present unrest in industrial relations is not a tribute to the comfort of life for the majority of the people.  It is a testimony to the discomfort and hardship that many people are faced with in the increasing cost of living.</P>
    <P>Remember, this Government and this Budget have given no answer to the predicament of these people faced with the increased cost of living.  Rather, they have promised them hairshirts all the way.  If this is a hairshirt Budget, there is another promised for next October.  The Government have spoken in guarded terms that if the situation does not improve, a further hot bath may be necessary in the autumn.  In these circumstances, to look for restraint from ordinary working people throughout the country is to expect a little too much.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the Government had discarded the idea of increasing turnover tax.  I do not think that we can be rid of the suspicion that this Government before their term of office expires this year or next year will not resist the temptation to increase the turnover tax.  We in opposing the turnover tax element when first introduced were chiefly aware of its inflationary tendency in our economy. We thought of it, we suspected it, we opposed it on the basis that we considered that it gave the Government an inbuilt inflationary device in our economy and in the event we were proved absolutely right in our suspicion in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government, considering that this was an inflationary boomerang, that it pushed up retail prices, that it <Col N="1790" /> intensified the inevitable race between prices and wages, rejected that particular tax on this occasion, introducing it merely in the area of dances, but, as Deputy Dillon said, what is introduced in an area like dances may later on be introduced in other areas.</P>
    <P>The fact is that some of the taxes imposed in this Budget will themselves have an inflationary tendency in our economy.  Who can give us a realistic answer to where the increase in petrol will lead, what it will lead to in our economy?  It is true that the Government can give an appearance of being a determined Government who are immune to criticism from all quarters and can say resolutely that petrol is a luxury commodity.  Petrol is not a luxury commodity for many people at the moment.  Many people depend for their livelihood in a private capacity on petrol, on fuel consumption.  Indeed, the increase in petrol and other fuels in this Budget must have its inflationary effect on our economy.  With a Government so determined on taxing, in their definition, luxury items in this Budget, so determined to show themselves to be a Government with the interests of the people at heart, it is extraordinary that, when faced with social welfare recipients, the Government should delay until November of this year any extra payment to persons who are now recognised, irrespective of Party affiliations, as being people deserving of some concern and care.</P>
    <P>We have all moved to the left.  This Government have gone further to the left than any Party in this House.  Yet, this move to the left does not include any concern for old age pensioners and social welfare recipients.  A Government who were showing themselves really concerned about those people in our population whom all consider to be unjustly treated could have given them a higher priority on their list of help cases in a Budget than this Government have done.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the tendency to broadcast benefits in advance of their payment has become an increasing feature of this Government.  We have had it already in the proposals on health.  We have had television broadcasts as to <Col N="1791" /> their merit but no indication of implementation. There is a similar case in the area of social welfare recipients. Again, we have a fanfare: &ldquo;We are the people who will introduce it but wait until later for the actual pay-out.&rdquo; This, in effect, is government by propaganda, not government by deed or by action.  It is government by remote control, government by sooth-saying.</P>
    <P>To sum up, we, in opposing this Budget, considered that it was important to make it quite clear that, in an economy which in the past two or three years, in a large measure due to favourable international trends, was fundamentally healthy, but which did suffer a certain tendency towards inflation last year, the Government in charge of this economy, given responsibility for the management of this economy, misjudged the signs of danger in the economy, or ignored them, for what motives we do not know. This Government, indicted of this particular neglect, come to this House with this Budget and say: &ldquo;We crave the Opposition's indulgence in this serious situation facing the country. Please do not be rough on us.  The situation is definitely against us.  Give us your helpful constructive criticism.&rdquo; We will give our helpful constructive criticism but at the same time, we must indicate who are the people in the dock in the debate on this Budget which does not give any real hope of economic improvement, which is a repeat of old refrains.  In a situation in which we have more economic tools in our hands today, better methods for dealing with the economic position, the Government merely repeat old tunes better forgotten.  This Government brought forward a Budget that shows no imagination, no real thinking in regard to our problems and expect the support of the Opposition Parties in this debate.</P>
    <P>We think that the country should know that the people responsible for the economic difficulties we are going through at the present time are the Fianna Fáil Government, now entering their tenth year in office, a Cabinet of chancers with no real control over the economic situation.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Budget is now in its second week.  So far there has been a considerable scarcity of Government defenders for the policy, or ought one say the lack of policy, as appearing in this Budget document, Nevertheless, in the course of this morning and last evening, I listened to three extremely interesting contributions from the Government benches.  Last evening Deputy Moore spoke of the wave of pessimism that was raging throughout this land.  This morning Deputy Burke, with characteristic external honesty images, submitted this country to what Deputy O'Leary has called a flag-day process but what I would call passing round the hat.  He earnestly pleasded that in our present circumstances all good and patriotic people both at home and abroad, should co-operate with this great Government in their great crisis today.  He urged upon us the example of the new State of Israel and he sought to encourage the Irish in America to make some contribution towards remedying the financial chaos here existing by way of bonds of some sort.  When I reminded him that the previous experience of bonds in America might not encourage them at this juncture, he dropped that particular subject and went back to the 6d. a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore described the pessimism that exists.  He went further, as I thought with great courage and great honesty, when he said he wondered if we had as much to celebrate in this particular year as we ought to have, having regard to the sacrifices made and the opportunities we had.  Later this morning the Minister for Justice spoke with boundless energy and with characteristic effrontery.  At one stage during the course of his speech, he said he would not be subjected to cross-examination by Deputies of the Labour Party but by way of pleasant aside, he said he would not mind being crossexamined by me.  I would dearly love to get the Minister for Justice into a witness box and then cross-examine him not alone on this Budget but on the last Budget and on the speeches he made in the last general election.  I would sincerely hope that the fact that <Col N="1793" /> he had begun his evidence after taking an oath would make a substantial difference in the presentation of the case he made here today.</P>
    <P>He told us, unlike the people from the back benches, Deputy Burke and Deputy Moore, that there was no pessimism. He had two other words for it. He said we had a &ldquo;guarded optimism&rdquo;. Well, now, when you pass through the village, if you might describe it as such, of guarded optimism, the signpost to pessimism must be very near the bridge below the town.  He talked of the necessity for a rational approach, of accounting to the country for the nation's finances, and he excused the mistakes in relation to certain industrial enterprises by reason of the fact that if one did not do something, one would not make a mistake at all.  I do not think that is valid.  It is not valid when a Government aided by experts in all fields, having all the time in the world in which to be advised and to consider that advice, made mistakes industrially by way of grants of the magnitude which have been made with the dreadful consequences which have followed in certain areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice urged a change in the moral and psychological attitude of our people.  He was a preacher of sorts coming towards the end; to what particular brand of oratory or what particular brand of spiritual exhortation I would hesitate to classify, but it came very close to the old Latin one of <i>laborare est orare</i>, to work is to pray.  I would remind the Minister that all the exhortations in the world without good example will achieve very little by way of moral changes.  I would also remind Deputy Burke that a slogan like &ldquo;honesty is the best policy&rdquo; on a packet of some kind of commodity does not necessarily give a warranty for the quality of the commodity itself.  In asking for co-operation today, Deputy Burke appealed to all right-thinking people, as he says, to co-operate in this moment of crisis, and then he proceeded to talk about what happened, as, indeed, did the Minister for Justice, in this country in 1956 and 1957.  I am not aware, and I was in Government towards the end of that period, <Col N="1794" /> of being supported, exhorted or, indeed, humiliated by speeches of co-operation and comfort from Fianna Fáil benches at that time.  Rather did they take the full political advantage of a situation in which the Government found themselves, a situation, as was conceded by the Minister for Justice this morning, not wholly due to anything of their own doing at that time.  We suffered adverse terms of trade, there was a Suez crisis and, generally speaking, the whole European and Middle East situation had its effects upon us.  We went to the country and gave the people their opportunity of changing the Government, which they did, and since then we have had the Fianna Fáil Party in power.</P>
    <P>I remember in the first Budget of 1957, the then Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, making great play of the fact that he looked forward under the new policy of the new Government to a considerable decrease in the Civil Service, with a consequent decrease, of course, in the cost of administration. That has not been borne out by the facts so far.  The numbers have increased and the cost of administration has naturally increased with them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increases given to the Civil Service last year, I do not think any right-minded person would begrudge anybody a fair and just wage or salary for a fair return.  After all, the labourer is worthy of his hire.  But I think the increases were too high and were not deserved at that level, as status increases.  Like Deputy M. P. Murphy, I would like to know what is the difference between work described as not having status.  What is a status increase?  I always thought increases should be related to the cost of living, generally speaking.  This status business is something very new, something which is not desirable for the overall good of the country.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I object to the manner in which these increases were given.  They took place after the publication of the Book of Estimates last year and, in fact, were only made known to the public through the process of Parliamentary question here.  That was bad <Col N="1795" /> example and gave rise to all kinds of discontent.  We are all aware now of what followed in the wake of these increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have a nice, contented gathering.  I can begin again.  I was dealing with the Civil Service increases on the larger scale and saying that, in my view, they were not warranted in that amount and that they were given at the wrong time and in the wrong way, with the inevitable result of setting bad example.  The case has been made that people of that kind would have to be paid those amounts in order to keep them in the service by giving them at least the same as they would earn in industry outside.  I do not think that is a valid argument in a country of this kind.  That might be all right in England or America where you have huge corporations employing men of knowledge and expertise, but not in this country.  I do not know of many places where people could walk out of the Civil Service and demand salaries in industry of £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 a year.  If the Government were really sincere about keeping administration on a proper keel it is to the lower income groups these increases should have gone.  It is in the lower income groups you have younger people in the marrying age&mdash; the age of buying a house, making repayments and building up a family. That is the difficult time.  Those engaged in that particular part of the battle of life are the people really enjoying what I would call a status deserving of recognition.</P>
      <P>I am not going to say any more on that aspect.  The whole manoeuvre has done the country a lot of ill.  It was bad example.  When people found that something not in the Book of Estimates, and which amounted to £4 million, had taken place overnight&mdash; secretly as far as they were concerned&mdash; you could not blame them for being disappointed, discontented and looking for more in their own particular groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Characteristically, the Minister for <Col N="1796" /> Justice tried to put it across here today that there was nothing wrong at all. We had only to balance a Budget and pay our way.  This did not involve any great suffering and these taxes only hit the spending public.  As to whom else they could hit, I would find it hard to know.  He did not take any cognisance of the fact in the overall picture that there are fewer at work than there were and that the much-vaunted <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has fallen short of its target in this regard and will fall far shorter by the time the date-line for the target is reached in 1970.</P>
    <P>We are living in the midst of very serious industrial strife.  Each day lost is a day of considerable remuneration lost to the State.  The Government have fallen down particularly in not examining the machinery for conciliation, giving it urgent thought and implementing that thought.  If they came in with legislation of that kind, I am quite certain that from these benches and from the Labour benches, they would get the fullest possible co-operation.</P>
    <P>Everybody is anxious to see a nation industrially at rest and working, in so far as the investment permits, at full pitch in order to see that the country moves along in the same industrious and ultimately prosperous flow that exists in Europe at the moment.  The Government have not done that.  They have fallen down very seriously in that regard.  Even at this late hour some pronouncement should come from the Government that they have legislation ready to bring in.  It should take precedence over everything else so that, once and for all, we shall get our machinery properly in order and we shall enable the Labour Court or such other conciliation body as might be set up to bring in decisions that would be implemented.  Everybody must take a bit of the blame for this, employers, employees, the Government and everybody else.  However, if the Government are going to do things with their own employees they cannot expect other employees not to look for the same kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Emigration is still there, particularly from rural Ireland.  The Minister for <Col N="1797" /> Justice talked of people leaving the land and coming into the bigger centres.  That is not our experience in the west of Ireland nor.  I am sure, is it true of the north-west and south-west. Our experience is that when people leave the land there, small as it is, probably bad as it is, they leave forever. They are not going to an Irish crowded centre, to an Irish town; they are going to an English city or town or some similar place in America.  Once that happens and once they have become accustomed to the highly mechanised standard of living in these countries, it would be unreal to expect them to come back.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies have experience of by-elections. By-elections bring us all into different parts of the country.  I am sure every, Fianna Fáil Deputy was in East Galway, Roscommon and Leitrim, as I was.  I am sure they canvassed house to house, as I did, in certain areas and that deep down as they returned to their hotels or their friends' houses to stay that night they must have felt the same sort of despondency as I and others like me felt when we visited the houses of the old where the voice of a child was absent, when we met the old brother and sister or the widow, nobody living around some of these places that could give one any hope for the future, certainly places that were not either kept or developed in such a manner as would encourage the absent son or daughter to come back.</P>
    <P>These are the things about which we should think a little more.  They are possibly not the things that Deputies representing wealthier parts of the country would be worried about, but if we have any kind of human approach at all to the problems affecting this country we must consider the problems of all the people whether they live on the good land or on the bad land, whether they are in the small fishing villages or living around the flooded areas of the Shannon and other such places in the south and the north alike.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice talked about the necessity for accounting to the country for the nation's finances.  He says that is the exercise at Budget time. I should have thought that the true <Col N="1798" /> pipeline as between government and governed would be that of truth and that the people should be told the truth at all times.  At the time of the last general election&mdash;and I do not care very much for the exercise of going back but it is so recent that, it is probably relevant now&mdash;the Taoiseach, his Ministers and all his candidates went around this country telling us of the wonderful situation we were in.  That was at the end of March and the beginning of April, 1965, not even a year ago.  Everything was under control, and so much was it under control and so prosperous was the state of the nation's affairs that the Fianna Fáil Party conceived a slogan at that time which could mean: Do not disturb, do not do anything to rock the boat but allow the wheels of the nation to continue to run smoothly.  That slogan was: &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with slogans if they achieve their objective for the people using them.  At the same time, there must be a fundamental honesty about a slogan so that it will be valid after the achievement of its purpose. That was only in March/April of last year and then as someone has already said this morning, in July, for the first time last year, the Taoiseach showed certain concern about the financial and economic affairs of this country.  Surely he must have known something about it in the previous March or April, but it was, I suppose, bad politically to let the people know that the country was not doing as well as the Government would have them believe it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance asked what went wrong with the Budget he introduced last May.  Perhaps the real thing that went wrong is that the Budget of last May was conceived and designed for the purpose of bringing the nation's financial affairs outwardly, at least, into line with the complacency we were supposed to accept under the slogan &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;.  In March/April the situation was wrong and, of course, in May the situation was wrong.  However, they could not tell the people in March or April, and May, Budget time 1965, was too soon to burst the bubble of pre-election prosperity.  When it came to July the <Col N="1799" /> Taoiseach could forget all that had gone before and tell us things were not going so well.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Justice that hard work is the basis of all prosperity, hard work founded upon the faith that a reasonable reward will come from it, that it will be stable and of a lasting character.  I do not think we will engender any real atmosphere of that kind in the great deluge of white papers, green papers, and blue papers that are being showered upon us, full of technicalities and full of verbiage which, while they may not be designed to deceive, nevertheless do not give the full and true picture to the uninitiated.</P>
    <P>There are the higher costs of administration and the higher cost of servicing our National Debt.  When the cost of running the Government and the cost of servicing the National Debt are taken from the whole amount of our national Budget, one can see how little there is upon which to work. It will take a great deal of thought and a less prolific output of white papers to cure the particular kind of situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Foreign borrowing has been mentioned. We have reached a rather sad stage in our economic and financial history this year.  First of all, we had the failure of the American loan and, mark you, it is extraordinary that the Americans, with the amount of goodwill there is towards Ireland, were not able to come to our assistance.  The failure was probably due to lack of faith in us and lack of faith in the ultimate result of any particular investment they might make.  We had to go to the World Bank and, hard on the heels of that, we had to negotiate a loan with Germany.</P>
    <P>This year&mdash;this has been mentioned as one of the reasons for bringing the Budget forward&mdash;we will celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the 1916 Rising. Apart from an unfortunate but, happily short-lived, division in arms this country has been at peace ever since. We escaped the ravages of the 1939-45 war.  We had the benefit in those years of being the storehouse for a hungry Britain and, indeed, for a <Col N="1800" /> hungry North of Ireland.  We had all the advantages that accrue from that sort of affluence.</P>
    <P>This year we will celebrate close on 50 years of peace and in this 50th year of peace we have to borrow £7 million from a nation that was on its knees only 20 years ago, a nation beaten and almost battered off the face of the earth.  The contrast is one which does not bear very exhaustive patriotic examination.  The question is are we finished now with foreign borrowing. That is a question to which I should like the Minister to reply when he comes to conclude this debate.  Are we finished with foreign borrowing?  Will this Budget ensure that our finances will be in such a state, when it comes to Budget time again, that we will not have to say anything about foreign borrowing and that we may, indeed, be able to do something about starting on the road to repayment?  Borrowing is always dangerous.  Shakespeare said it &ldquo;dulls the edge of husbandry&rdquo;.  That is true.  Borrowing is an easy process on the whole but paying back, whether it be a personal or a national experience, is an extremely difficult one.</P>

      <P>The great complaint of the people now is that they were not told about the situation in the course of the last general election. They were not told that there was trouble ahead and that they would have to play their part in overcoming that trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget was described by a correspondent on the local paper in my constituency as a Social Welfare Budget.  I am surprised that such a distinguished graduate of such a distinguished paper should so fall from journalistic grace.  The only social welfare effort in the Budget is the 5/- per week from 1st November next.  Even the date has been pushed back from the traditional 1st August.  The sum is only £250,000 for pensioners, whether they be old age, widows and orphans, public assistance or disabled.  Into the picture, too, comes the destitute with no means.  There will be no chance at <Col N="1801" /> all of getting this 5/-.  We have all had experience of the difficulty so many people had in getting the second 5/- in last year's increase.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk about current expenditure and capital expenditure, the public sectors and the private sectors.  Look around the country.  What is happening? When one examines what is happening one cannot be impressed by all this talk of prosperity and increased industrial employment.  The Minister for Justice today tried to make considerable capital out of the fact that the increase in industrial employment had more than offset the reduction in agricultural employment. If it has, then I am very glad but, on the long-term basis, is that a good thing?  I have a fear that, when the Free Trade Agreement comes into operation on 1st July next, industrially we shall be put into a very, very difficult position.  I hope we will be able to survive it.  If we do not survive it there will be inevitably&mdash;this has been conceded&mdash;unemployment in certain types of industrial production.  All that will be left will be the land on which to fall back.  If an agricultural country is not maintained and preserved agriculturally, and the fertility of the soil sustained through all the methods available, if all that is not done, then the agricultural community will begin to suffer and, from suffering, will begin to wither away.  That will be true particularly in relation to the small farms.</P>
    <P>This is a very savage Budget because it affects almost everybody.  For everyone it represents a cut of some kind, however big or however small.  I particularly deplore the increase in the tax on private motor vehicles because a motor vehicle is no longer a luxury or a near-luxury.  A motor car, particularly the smaller car, is no longer a luxury in this country; it is part and parcel of the working makeup of the family.  However, in the main, where there is a car, it is used for the family's particular employment or certainly that of members of the family.  I know people who have motor-cars&mdash;they are on the hire purchase: there is no doubt about that&mdash;and they have to drive long distances to work.  They would be <Col N="1802" /> the second and third sons, say, of a small farmer going to work with the ESB, Bord na Móna, at forestry or for some other business or even sometimes in shops in towns and who go home in the evening.  To them, this increase in the taxation itself, coupled with the increase of 4d a gallon on petrol, must be a substantial wage cut&mdash;as well, of course, as the 8d increase in income tax.</P>
    <P>At one time, the people or the Party or the Government, either here or in any other country, who sought to reduce income tax were immediately accused of trying to favour a certain class of people.  But now, since the introduction of PAYE, everybody pays income tax, less or more.  Income tax is no longer a mysterious kind of tax which was paid by the wealthy only. It is now paid by everybody.  Accordingly, an increase in income tax hits every wage-earner over a certain minimum and the minimum, indeed, is not very considerable.</P>
    <P>These are the two things and I particularly deplore the attack on the motor-car.  Of course, there has been the departure from the principle&mdash;well-established and recognised&mdash;that motor taxation is for the Road Fund and the improvement of roads.  I know it has been said by other speakers that on one occasion the Government to which I belonged did take half a million pounds from the Road Fund and that is true, but the House and the country were told about it, and anyway, it was for one year.  This, however, is something different.  This goes into the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long beer, spirits and tobacco will survive these perennial attacks.  There must be a point of no return.  I do not think we can be very far away from it.  However, the Minister in his wisdom, and having regard to the advice which he had, decided that that was the best way of going about this business of collecting an extra £12½ million taxation this year.  I hope he gets it and, if he does, it will be a great tribute to the drinking, smoking and driving community of this country.</P>
    <P>I hope that this increased taxation <Col N="1803" /> to the tune of £12½ million, will bring about a situation where we shall not have to write repeatedly on behalf of our constituents to the Department of Local Government to pay housing grants.  I hope we shall not have to write repeatedly to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to get the most meagre amounts sanctioned.  I hope the various local authorities will soon be able to meet their commitments in the housing field.  I am not at all impressed by this talk about education and health. There has been a cut-back on these and let us face that fact.  I am afraid that all of the talk about schools and the building of schools and transport is nothing but talk.  It is a smokescreen to cover a very awkward situation for which there has not been and probably is not any money to remedy it.</P>
    <P>We have not been able to get any of the grants paid in respect of the heifer scheme or any of the various schemes in the Department of Agriculture. There is a deplorable situation in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I know they have their industrial troubles there but I do not think that justifies the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in seeking to get three, five or even up to seven years of the rental in advance, thereby eating the calf, as the old saying goes, in the womb of the cow.  That has always been recognised, even in the adage, as an extremely dangerous economic practice.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, we have the threat of the autumn Budget.  I hope it is only a threat: in fact I think it is. I think it is a threat to trade unions not to seek any more increases.  I do not hold any brief for trade unions or for organised labour, except that, as a public representative, I hold a brief for fair play.  I do think, again, that the Government have fallen down on this in not providing the proper, necessary and effective legislation to remedy this horrible day to day, week to week, month to month, situation where valuable time and production are lost.</P>
    <P>The most significant thing, I think, of this account of the nation's housekeeping <Col N="1804" /> is the reduction of £5 million in small savings.  That is the kernel.  You see what is happening in a country where savings drop, particularly small savings.  I think every Deputy on all sides of the House will agree with me that, to save anything at the moment, even on what would be regarded as a good income, is an extremely difficult thing to do.  Where people do manage to save a little, on comparatively small incomes, it is always a marvel to me how they do it.  Certainly, it is not done without considerable sacrifice and considerable self-denial.  Now, of course, when I get up to speak here on the Budget situation, I am conscious of the fact that I am speaking for a constituency situated in the west of Ireland which, for many a long year, has been almost forgotten.  Frequently have I said that the economy of this country appears to be the economy of the good land and forget about the rest.  Now, on page 14 of his Budget speech, the Minister deals with the small western farms.  He talks about the selection of 12 pilot areas for special development and of an increase in land project grants.  Everybody knows that that increase in the land project grants&mdash;certainly in the kind of area which I represent&mdash;has been largely illusory and that one cannot get the £50 an acre unless one satisfies the local inspector that the estimate will be for a minimum of £65.</P>
    <P>I hope that the appointment of the full-time officials in each western county for the work of assisting county development teams will bear fruit, and bear fruit soon, but I do not see that they will get much of a chance.  I should like to know what fund these men will have at their disposal in order to promote the good of these areas.  If it is a question of advising people about the land project, about surface drainage, hill sheep farming, and so on, we have all these advisory services already.  I want to know what they will be doing and from what fund they can draw to supplement any scheme which they may formulate and find sanction for in the appropriate Department.</P>
    <P>From page 16, paragraph 2, I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> As a further indication of the Government's intention to be flexible and helpful in dealing with the development needs of the West, it has been decided, even in the difficult circumstances of this year, to arrange to vote a sum of £100,000 which could be drawn upon for special schemes for small Western farms.</P>
    <P>One hundred thousand pounds sounds a lot of money; it is the equivalent of two people winning first prizes in the Sweep, two £50,000s.  Anybody who would hear of anyone winning two first prizes in the Sweep would say they were made up for ever.  But, taking it merely as a £12 million increase in taxation this year, what does £100,000 represent?  This Government magnanimity to the west has allocated a fund of £100,000 from which drawing could be made; it is not fully allocated.  What does it represent of that increased taxation?  It represents a halfpenny in the £1.  If it were related to small farms so categorised, it would represent one-tenth of a penny for each farm.  This is a very sad performance for the various people in the National Farmers Association, in Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and all the voluntary organisations who pinned their faith to the great promises which were made and who were content to leave agitation on one side in order to await the fulfilment of the great promises.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice called today for a change in the moral and psychological attitude of our people. Once a people are treated with this cynicism underlying this amount, they cannot be expected to refer their will, either morally or psychologically, towards a Government who would be inclined to call this benevolence.  Mind you, it is not that this Government, through their Party, are not devoting considerable attention to the west of Ireland by way of attending functions and meetings and delivering there the most spirited of addresses.  Within the last six to seven weeks, we have had three Ministers in the constituency of North Mayo which Deputy O'Hara and I represent here.  The Minister for Justice had a rendezvous with the faithful in Crossmolina.  He did not tell <Col N="1806" /> them anything only six or seven weeks ago of any likely increases in taxation or where they might be.  He did not exhort them to change morally or to adopt new psychological attitudes unless that was to be interpreted as telling them that the Opposition had slipped before and that they could slip again and to do their utmost to get their second seat back in North Mayo.  I think their hopes of that, after this Budget, are remote in the extreme.</P>
    <P>About a fortnight after, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs visited Ballina&mdash;another dinner&mdash;and he had great news for the people there.  It was not about taxation; it was not about any intention the Government might have with regard to taxation.  He said the progress which had been made was of an astounding character and Deputy Calleary agreed and said he was never happier than the day he heard of the Trade Agreement.  But before that&mdash;I must be fair to the Minister&mdash;he also told them we had abolished the oath of allegiance and the Governor-General. The younger people, I am sure, were wondering what these new pop tunes were.</P>
    <P>On last Sunday week, to Ballina again, came the Minister for Social Welfare without a word about taxation and he was assisted there by his local lieutenants who promised him everything, that everything would be done to get the second seat back.  I doubt if the second seat will be got back by increased taxation on the motor cars which bring young people to work at Bellacorrick, Glenamoy, or any of the other places where they use cars to go to work.  There was another piece of good news for the country's future economy at the same meeting when it was urged strongly upon the Minister to bring back to the Government the views of Fianna Fáil in North Mayo that the local elections should not be held in October because, by then, the entire labour force of the constituency would be in Great Britain.  Is that a great tribute to the progress made by Fianna Fáil in that particular part of the country?</P>
    <P>Before I finish, may I quote from two very interesting speeches?  One was made in Ballina on 28th March, <Col N="1807" /> 1965, by the Taoiseach.  He was supported there by his friends in the Party, old and new.  He said, and I quote from the report of his speech published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the following day:</P>
    <P>The most important matter that would have to be considered by the new Dáil and the new Government would be the completion of plans to build up the economy of the western seaboard counties and to complete the plans already coming into operation to improve things there.</P>
    <P>He said that he believed this was the major unfinished business now outstanding in the nation's affairs. Other things, by and large, had been settled; industrial development was going ahead and, provided there was not interruption, it would continue. Their agricultural plans were now completed and beginning to give results in higher outputs and higher standards of living.</P>
    <P>So, the Government having thought it all over and having devoted their attention to this major unfinished business, thought well&mdash;in this Budget of 1966&mdash; to devote £100,000, a halfpenny in the £1 of the increased taxation, towards saving the small farms.  Of course that was before the election, and the pressure was on.  That was at Ballina on the Taoiseach's tour of the principal towns.  He could not be expected, of course&mdash;although a Taoiseach did it once before&mdash;to go to the lesser places, but he sent an equally important person to Belmullet two or three days later.  I want to quote now from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 31st March, 1965, and to his new friends and old in Belmullet, the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, began by saying:</P>
    <P>No other matter will receive more unremitting attention from the new Fianna Fáil Government than the economic revival of the West, Mr. Haughey, Minister for Agriculture, declared in Belmullet yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in lighter vein.  The report goes on:</P>
      <P>The Government regards it as a national, and not a local problem, he said.</P>
      <P>Outlining the methods to be adopted, Mr. Haughey said the Land Project grants will be increased.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with that.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>Sheep could be of great benefit to Western farmers and he intended setting up a special pilot area to see what additional aids are needed in this sphere.</P>
      <P>This was a speech full of great promises to people who, if they got half as much as was promised, would have been very content indeed.  Up to last Friday there was no notion in the Department of Agriculture of setting up pilot areas to deal with sheep or anything else in that part of Mayo.  The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey also stressed Government plans for drainage credit and the commonages problem.</P>
      <P>Anyone who wants to go into the commonages problem and find out the assistance they will get, the submission of maps they will have to make, will discover that the Land Act is not as wonderful as it was cracked up to be. The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>On the land project grants, he said the Government is having the situation examined to see what is necessary and what new grants could be introduced.  As a first step it has decided to increase the present limit of the grant of £30 per acre so that a number of farmers now unable to benefit could do so.</P>
      <P>Access to credit will be essential and this is already available in a number of different ways.  If, however, it can be shown, either as a result of experience in the pilot areas or otherwise, that any substantial number of farmers cannot avail themselves of the structure of services, then I shall have them amended or extended where necessary, he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> He was not finished.  He went on:</P>
    <P>Drainage is of fundamental importance to the farmers of the West. The Shannon Basin affect a great part of the West and, at the special request of the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, Mr. Donogh O'Malley has prepared a special crash programme to get this work started immediately.</P>
    <P>Of course, the crash programme was started in Boyle at an election meeting and was accepted by the people of Roscommon as the hypocritical announcement it was, and they succeeded in returning Deputy Mrs. Joan Burke with a substantial majority.  He went on:</P>
    <P>By the use of new and revolutionary techniques he has been able to get the time taken on preliminary work very substantially reduced so that actual construction work can begin much earlier than we originally thought would be possible.</P>
    <P>It has not yet started, and Deputy O'Malley has now moved to the Department of Health where he is building hospitals, installing X-ray units and operating theatres at a rate which is no man's business.  We have not seen them so far but they will all be there and we will get our share in the west of Ireland out of the £100,000 or the ½d in the £ of increased taxation.  That all came under the heading: &ldquo;Development of West to be a main objective.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this Budget is unreal.  As I said about a similar Budget in 1957, when the £9 million for food subsidies was abolished, the only effect I can see it having&mdash;the ½d in the £ notwithstanding&mdash;is that in these western areas more houses will be closed and more families will go away.  The job of the Minister for Education of replacing schools will be made less difficult because of the absence of pupils.  If that is the kind of desolation and desertion of the west the Government want, they are likely to get it with the ½d in the £.</P>

      <P>In facing this Budget, we must remember that there were three different periods here&mdash;this is the third&mdash;in which difficult situations had <Col N="1810" /> to be faced.  The cure of the Fine Gael Minister for Finance for the difficulty was to cut the old age pensions from 10/- a week to 9/- a week, a reduction of 1/- a week or one-tenth of the pensioner's total income.  Another Minister for Finance from that side of the House recently had a cure for a difficult situation and it was to put a tax on ladies' curling pins backed up, if you please, by a tax on toilet paper.</P>

      <P>The difference between the Fianna Fáil Government and the two inter-Party Governments which we have had in the past 20 years is that on each occasion as soon as the difficulty arose, the gentlemen opposite quietly walked out from under.

      <P>I will come to it as quickly as I can.  The difference is that this Government always stood their ground and tried to find a way out of the difficulty.  They did not turn their backs on the country and say: &ldquo;There it is for you.  Find someone else to run it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay was bothered about the west.  I do not know exactly what we can do about the west.  After all, when we were establishing the beet factories we put one in Tuam.  The factory in Galway was supposed to function for the western area, but what happened?  The people there did not grow beet.  That was followed up by a potato factory in the same area.  Last year the potato factory had to be supplied with potatoes from County Louth. There is a food-processing factory in Banagher.  I wonder what is the present position in regard to that industry? I am taking things as I see them and things that meant an enormous change in the economy of other counties and other districts and what they meant here.  I would like to make that comparison seriously and then come to see what they are to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great liking for the people <Col N="1811" /> of the west.  Every year my colleague here, Deputy Cronin, takes a ramble down to Deputy Lindsay's and Deputy O'Hara's constituency and collects there some 250 to 300 workers which we bring down every year to the Mallow factory and give them employment there with the farmers singling and harvesting beet.  They are fine workers.  I will say that for them.  They see that they get better conditions, better terms and more humane treatment from the farmers of Cork and Waterford than they get in the trips to Britain Deputy Lindsay has been talking about.  God helps those who help themselves.  I would like to hear any Deputy from the west tell me the reason why the beet factory in Tuam is not functioning as it should and why the potato factory in Tuam is not functioning as it should?  I would like them to tell me why the food-processing factory in Banagher is not functioning as it should, either?</P>
    <P>There are two sides to every question. I am concerned, and a few more like me are concerned, more with our principal industry than with any other. Despite the percentage increases that everybody was supposed to have got, I find that you have practically come to a period in agriculture when you will have to go back to a ranching system altogether.  You cannot blame the people.  I do not blame the workers.  I do not blame the worker or the farmer who finds that on a costing made up of £7 16s 0d a week, he has to go on strike to extract the equivalent of that from the subsidy paid to him.  We had to go on strike last year to extract 5/3d a ton on beet from the Sugar Company.  This year we were entitled to more but it was not forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The result of the two manoeuvres is this.  You have a reduction of roughly 20,000 acres of beet in the two years.  That means a loss to the farmers in income of something like £1,700,000.  It also means in our balance of payments here, in the import of foreign sugar, a pretty considerable amount also.  It is roughly <Col N="1812" /> 30,000 tons of sugar.  Those are the things I would like to have examined and corrected.  You have, in addition to that, something like one million barrels of malting barley produced here every year.  The price of that malting barley for the coming year is the same price as was fixed for it in 1948&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in entirely different conditions.  Is there any worker today who would accept the conditions he had in 1948?  Still, we are rather surprised at the flight from the land as some of the opulent gentlemen stated. A penny on the pound of sugar on the £2,500 a year civil servant or on the £20 a week gent, the difference of that 30,000 tons of sugar, the impact of that on our balance of payments would have made a difference, but it was not forthcoming.  Those are the matters I would like considered and threshed out.  We have the position created today, as far as industry is concerned, that we are like the old lady in the song long ago, the woman of the three cows.  You have Jack who thinks that his job is a special job and who thinks he should get 10/- a week.</P>

    <P>I have only two regrets in regard to the Budget.  One is that the Minister did not turn his attention to bingo. Even if he had got little out of it, he should have put his hand down heavily there.  I do not believe in that kind of stuff in this country.  We were told that the bingo in Dublin would suffer serious reverses during the dock strike because every card they used was imported from British printers. When a gambling crowd start along those lines in this country, there is only <Col N="1815" /> one cure for it&mdash;tax the devil out of them.  I suggest also that the Minister should have increased dog licence fees. If he had done so, he would have taken away some of the worry from the Minister for Agriculture who now has to compel every fellow with a dog to get a collar and put his name on it.  If the fee had been increased by 10/-, fewer collars would be needed.  Two old men of the sea also worry me.  One of them is the Civil Service.  If the economy is to improve we must, by regulation, reduce the number of civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the Budget. I should like to deal now with the transport situation.  That is an old man of the sea that agriculture cannot carry on its back any longer.  A state of affairs has developed in which a licence for the transport of goods in County Cork is worth between £1,000 and £1,500.  The man who buys that licence must also pay for his lorry and rear a family on the profits.  We give £2 million a year towards the upkeep of an inefficient, incompetent organisation.  I had occasion this year as the person in charge of a factory to invite tenders for the cartage of the produce of 350 acres of peas.  CIE tendered, the Cork <Col N="1816" /> Transport Company tendered at 15 per cent less and the tender of the East Cork Hauliers Association was ten per cent less than that.  The question I must ask is whether we can afford to pay 25 per cent more for the haulage of our produce to the factory.  It is a straight question and I want it answered.  It is about time we called a halt to it.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the available information for the years in question.  The official Import List under which imports are classified does not distinguish between lager and other beers or between Scotch and other whiskies.  An examination of some of the original import documents has shown that while importers do not in all cases indicate whether the whiskey imported is Scotch or not most of the whiskey imported from Great Britain is, in fact, Scotch whisky and such imports have, therefore, been shown separately in the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the great need for proper landing and harbour facilities at the islands of Inishmaan and Inisheere, Aran, County Galway, so that a priest and doctor can land in severe weather conditions; and what action he proposes to take to provide these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the question of providing landing facilities for fishing boats at Claí Gainmhe, Inishmaan, Aran which was the subject of a question by the Deputy on 14th December 1965, I am not aware of any proposals for provision of improved landing facilities at Inishmaan or Inisheere.  I am advised that to provide such facilities at these islands suitable for use in severe weather conditions would be a major engineering undertaking whose cost would almost certainly be prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the economy of these islands is built up on tourism and as it is the intention of the Government to save the west, would he not consider that these people should not be isolated completely and that it is about time something should be done?  Will the Minister investigate the possibility of having something done and seeing that these people will be able to get a priest or doctor if the necessity arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are landing facilities at Inishmaan and Inisheere and moneys have been spent on them to keep them in good condition for ordinary use but as far as the suggestion goes to provide facilities to withstand extraordinary weather conditions rather than to provide for tourists, I think that it is rather far-fetched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not far-fetched. <Col N="1825" /> I can assure the Minister that even during the summer you can have weather conditions when you cannot make the boat crossing and people will not go to the island if they feel they cannot get off again.  I think the Minister will agree that the islanders should be entitled to these facilities or does he wish to abandon them completely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such suggestion.  I have told the Deputy that money was recently provided to give good landing facilities.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the design of this channel is not defective and that it functioned well for many years after completion of the scheme in 1933.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">

      <P>The amount advanced to date from State funds to the National Building Advisory Council to meet its expenses is £18,750.</P>
      <P>Since the Council was incorporated on 15th December, 1964, they have held 19 meetings.  Fortnightly meetings were held up to June, 1965.  Since then meetings have usually been held at monthly intervals.</P>
      <P>In regard to the membership of the Council, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question by Deputy Sweetman on 24th February, 1966 (Vol. 221, No. 3, Cols. 473 and 474).</P>
      <P>Paragraph 24 of the White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure indicated the Government's intention that there should be a closer definition of the spheres of action of the State agencies dealing with the building and construction industry.  Pending a decision on this question it is not possible to give any indication of the future prospects of the Council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In November, 1965, the National Building Advisory Council submitted a report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in which they recommended, in addition to certain administrative steps, that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the degree of sensitivity which is exercised in planning public expenditure in the building and construction industry should be exercised in the private sector also, and in this connection that discussions should be held between the Central Bank, the Irish Banks Standing Committee, the Department of Finance and the Council.</P>
      <P>(ii)  in the event of determination on a levelling off of expenditure both public and private within the economy as a whole, such levelling off should be shared by all sectors of the economy,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  the Government should consider making available to the <Col N="1828" /> industry a list of projects which it proposes to undertake in each year, or, failing this, a statement as to each Government Department's proposed capital expenditure on new works on a county by county basis for each category of building.</P>
    <P>(iv)  planning appeals with the Minister for Local Government should be disposed of with the utmost despatch,</P>
    <P>(v)  a system of phased programming in the release of publicly financed projects on which planning to pre-tender stage may proceed, should be considered when the current credit restrictions have abated and that the Government should take steps to encourage semi-State bodies, statutory undertakings and all others effectively within its sphere of influence to instruct their professional staff and consultants to proceed in full with the necessary pre-tender preparations.</P>
    <P>The Council's report did not relate specifically to housing.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the fact that the provision in the Capital Budget for housing, for which I am largely responsible, is £21.84 million in 1966-67 as against a provisional outturn for the current year of £20.06 million.  The total provision in the Capital Budget under the heading Building and Construction is £34.40 million for 1966-67 as against a provisional figure of £33.43 million in the current financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that no loan of any description has been sanctioned by Dublin County Council since December, 1965, owing to the fact that there is no money available; and when money will be made available for such loans, and the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to house-purchase loans.  I understand that approval has not been issued by Dublin County Council to such loans since 31st December, 1965, pending a decision on their application for sanction to further loan accommodation from the Local Loans Fund. A loan of £250,000 was sanctioned on 20th January last and further loans will be approved in the near future on the basis of the capital allocation for the purpose in the coming financial year which will be notified within a week to the council.</P>
      <P>As regards the statement that no money is available to the council for house-purchase loans, I would point out to the Deputy that loan instalments amounting to £450,000 for this purpose were paid to the council to date in the current financial year as compared with £250,000 in the financial year 1964-65.  The amount paid from the Fund since 1st January last is £200,000.</P>

Again in reply to Deputy Tully, who seems to wish to make <Col N="1831" /> something out of when these loans were applied for, the relevant figure is here.  In spite of all the furore kicked up about money, the relevant figure is that Dublin County Council to date in this financial year of difficulty has received from this Fund £450,000 as against the comparable figure last year, without any difficulty, of £250,000.

Agreement has also been reached in principle on outline planning briefs for the Limerick area and for the Glen area portion of the project in Cork city.  Certain other technical and planning aspects of the proposal are under consideration including the preparation of detailed contoured site plans for the sites, and the carrying out of a soil survey of each site.</P>
      <P>Steps have been taken by Limerick Corporation to acquire all the necessary land.  A small portion of land, however, is the subject of a compulsory purchase order which has been submitted to me for confirmation and is before me at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that, owing to the different systems of assessing means for the non-contributory widows' pension and the non-contributory old age pension, cases arise where a widow, on reaching the age of seventy years, has her pension considerably reduced; and if he will take steps to ensure that, owing to the hardship which these cases involve, non-contributory widows do not have their pensions reduced in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the method of calculating the yearly value of capital, the same basic rules govern the assessment of means for non-contributory widows' pension as for non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in reply to a similar question in June last, widows do not normally suffer a reduction in pension on reaching the age of seventy.  The investigations of means in connection with the application for the old age pension may show, however, in some cases that there has been an increase in means since the widow's pension was awarded, and in these cases a reduction in pension is inevitable.  In addition, because of certain differences in the method of assessment of the yearly value of capital for widows' pension and old age pension purposes, <Col N="1839" /> some widows, on reaching the age of 70, may be assessed with a higher income on their capital and so be entitled to an old age pension at a lower rate than the widows' pension which they previously held.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would point out that having regard to the annuity value of a person's capital at age 70 the method of determining the yearly value of capital for non-contributory old age pension purposes is not ungenerous. As the law stands a widow with no other means could have £475 capital and still qualify for the maximum old age pension of 47s. 6d, or £1,780 and still qualify for the minimum pension of 7s. 6d.  With the latter sum, a widow aged 70 could purchase an annuity of about £200.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the incident to which the question refers and that protests as mentioned were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that in cases where potentially dangerous objects are washed ashore it is incumbent on the military authorities to take such precautions as they consider necessary to safeguard life and prevent damage to property.  In the case in question it was considered necessary to control access to the beach on which the unidentified object was lying and the military policemen who were detailed for this purpose were ordered not to allow unauthorised persons to approach the area.  It was in pursuance of this order that the military policeman concerned was involved in the incident with the photographer and, while I very much regret that the incident should have occurred, the military authorities have indicated that they are satisfied that the military policeman was merely endeavouring to carry out his duties to the best of his ability.  I understand that expressions of regret have been conveyed by the Officer Commanding, Southern Command, to the Director <Col N="1843" /> of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the Chairman of the Irish Area Council of the National Union of Journalists who had protested to him about the occurrence and an appropriate reply is being issued to the letter received in my Department from the Radio Branch of the National Union of Journalists.</P>

Does the Minister think the Army authorities are entitled at this stage, as indicated in his reply, to pass the blame for the whole thing over to the NCO who carried out the assault and that the officers can wash their hands of the whole affair?  They knew the photographers were there. They met them and gave them no warning and no indication that they should not be there or should not proceed about their lawful duties.  Does the Minister think that is good enough?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, a statement of Government policy in relation to development centres and industrial estates was issued in August, 1965.  In accordance with that policy An Foras Tionscal has been charged with the task of establishing and administering industrial estates.  That body will not be in a position, however, to enter into firm commitments in this respect until the necessary enabling legislation is passed by the Oireachtas.  Proposals for such legislation will be introduced in Dáil Éireann in the near future.  In the meantime such preparatory work as it is possible to undertake in relation to the industrial estates at Galway and Waterford is being carried out.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position, however, to say at this stage when factory buildings will be available on the estates for renting.</P>
      <P>With regard to inquiries from interested industrialists about the proposed industrial estate at Galway, the position is that while a number of inquiries of a general nature has been received, no specific industrial proposal has been received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions which the British authorities propose to hold with New Zealand and Australia arise from Britain's arrangements with those countries in regard to imports of butter.  Britain's arrangements with us in this regard are set out in the Exchange of Letters in connection with the Free Trade Agreement. These provide for an increase in our basic butter quota from 12,905 tons to 23,000 tons for the quota year ending March, 1967, and on the basis of our present estimates of milk production this quota is adequate to cover the amount of butter which we expect to have available for export to the UK during the year.</P>
      <P>I might add that we were in fact consulted recently about supplementary allocations which the British authorities were proposing to make for 1966-67 and which have now been announced.  These supplementary allocations are considerably less than those made for 1965-66 and if we had been depending on them, our butter exports would have been seriously restricted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1853" /> for Health if in view of the growing shortage of nurses in some Irish hospitals he will consider recognising service in England and elsewhere as if this service were given in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to nursing salary scales. The standard practice is that annual increments on these scales are granted by Health Authorities to members of their permanent nursing staffs in respect of satisfactory service with them.  A nurse taking up a permanent appointment in the service of an Irish Health Authority for the first time would normally enter the appropriate salary scale at the minimum.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied at present that a need exists for health authorities generally to consider changing the present practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that this is regarded as the most serious reason why nurses cannot be got back from England, particularly in the Dublin Health Authority area? They have to start at the bottom of the scale, even though they have spent quite a number of years in England.  There is a serious shortage of nurses particularly from the point of view of the increased number of geriatric patients requiring heavy nursing at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the shortage of hospital and school accommodation for mentally retarded children; and that children put on a waiting list by St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, in 1962 are only now being given accommodation; and if there are any plans for improving this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keenly aware of the shortage of accommodation for mentally handicapped children and a <Col N="1854" /> considerable quantity of residential accommodation is in the course of being provided.  The provision of special school accommodation is a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Since 1947, the provision of special accommodation for the mentally handicapped has been more than trebled.  At the end of 1964, there were 3,111 places as compared with 1,030 at the end of 1947.  During 1965 a further 200 places were provided; in the present year 260 additional places will become available and approval has been given for the provision of an extra 200 places.  Furthermore, the making available of accommodation at present being used for other purposes is being considered and will, I am sure, result in further alleviation of the present position.  It will be appreciated that suitably qualified staff for dealing with these children is an important consideration and it is not just a matter of providing institutional accommodation.</P>

      <P>A suitable site has been offered for the proposed new central school to replace Ballinafad and three other small schools and sketch plans have been prepared.  Until evidence of title to the site has been furnished, however, a grant towards the cost of the new building cannot be sanctioned nor can the further arrangements for the provision of the school be undertaken.

      <P>I was dealing with the position regarding what I would call old men of the sea who are on the backs of our community at the present time.  One of them is CIE.  We had the example of what happened when a processing firm sent out invitations for tenders for the removal of agricultural produce to the factory.  CIE tendered; another party tendered 15 per cent lower than the CIE tender; and a third party was able to tender ten per cent under that again.  I would point out that the members of that third party that tendered are knocking out a fairly good livelihood for themselves.  They are supporting their families in comfort and paying good wages.  Nevertheless, they can tender 25 per cent under CIE.</P>
      <P>Lest that might be taken as an isolated instance of what is happening, I have a letter from Messrs.  Thomp-sons of Carlow, which I have had reason to mention here previously, in connection with the erection of a shed in Mallow.  In the course of that letter, they mention that they use a large quantity annually of steel which comes from Haulbowline but that none of it comes by CIE in consequence of the charges.  They say that, by so doing, they save 40 per cent in freight.</P>

      <P>Those are matters which are seriously affecting our agricultural community.  We cannot afford, on the one hand, to be held on prices and, on the other hand, to have our transport charges increased each year.  That is something that is happening and, in my opinion, it has got to end.</P>
      <P>I now come to the subject of the Civil Service.  We had guarantees here some years ago that there would be a cutting-down on the number of civil servants.  I do not know what pattern we started with, but, today, the number of civil servants in this country is a burden which our economy cannot carry and it is just as well to face that fact today as tomorrow.  It has now reached the stage where we cannot continue with that pattern.</P>

      <P>Steps should definitely be taken to curb our anxiety to bring foreigners here to do our work.  We must stop giving out contracts to foreigners, thus further upsetting our balance of payments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Hara could not make a present of anything.  The agricultural community are the principal producers and are anxious to go ahead with production but it is very hard.  It is all right to hear lipservice from Deputies here and wails from them in connection with the flight from the land but you cannot have a seven-day week on the land and a five-day week in every other industry in this country.  I wonder, had we a five-day week in agriculture, what would be the price of milk or the price of potatoes? I wonder, again, what would be the position in regard to the wheat industry? Mind you, the shortage, or the loss, of employment caused by the reduction in the production of 144,000 tons of beef will mean something to the hauliers and to transport in this country.  You cannot kill the goose which lays the golden egg.  But there is no talk of giving the pound a week extra to the man whose wage, on costings in this country, is £7 16s a week.  Last year when we looked for an increase in the price of sugar to enable those men to get that to which they were entitled, we were refused.</P>
      <P>Those are matters which, to my mind, need rectification here and if there is anything loose going around in the line of a pound a week or anything else, it should be given, firstly, to those who have to work a six/and even a seven-day week; for we have not yet invented the six-day or five-day cow.</P>

      <P>If we are to get any balanced economy in this country, first of all, we must have patriotism.  We must have that patriotism shown on the top for a start; we must have it shown in the Government-subsidised industries in this country today.  You cannot have one State industry selling thousands of pounds abroad and even bringing over British contractors to put up its sheds and machinery and, at the same time, have another State industry laying off men for want of the use of that material.  That is what is happening in this country and it is time it stopped. My only regret is that, in the Budget, proper steps were not taken to deal, firstly, with Bingo and, secondly, the sheep-killing dogs.  In those two items alone the Minister could find a field in which he would collect some money anyway, and he would also be doing a great service to the community in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): This Budget is remarkable for a number of things.  It is remarkable, first of all, in so far as it has been introduced about two months earlier than any Budget introduced in this country previously. It is only ten months since the Budget of 1965 was introduced.  It has been described by the Minister, in introducing it, as really a supplementary Budget and we have been promised&mdash;or should I say threatened&mdash; with another Budget later this year.  It is remarkable, too, in so far as the date for the coming into operation of the paltry social welfare benefits for the destitute is concerned.  These have been put back later in the year than any such benefits were ever delayed before: they do not come into operation until the 1st November.  Whereas the Budget is introduced two months earlier, these miserable, insulting benefits for the destitute are delayed, put back from August to November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Budget is remarkable, too.  It is remarkable in the quantity and, particularly, the quality of the support for it from the Government <Col N="1865" /> side of the House.  The number of Government speakers have been very few.  We have just had Deputy Corry, and we had Deputy Burke and Deputy Moore.  I think Fianna Fáil Deputies find it impossible to speak in favour of this Budget, but yet, when the bells ring for a division, they will come in here and vote for it.  Deputy Corry put a number of pertinent questions to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Transport and Power.  I doubt whether he will get answers to those questions in this House.  Perhaps, if he keeps in touch with the <i>Irish Times</i>, he might find Deputy MacEntee giving him the replies there.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Minister has sought to justify this Budget and in so far as the members of his Party support him, it would appear they would like to create the impression that this is a courageous Budget and that the Minister who introduced it deserves credit for taking measures necessary to correct the economy or to clear up a mess.  As I said here this morning, in a friendly interruption of Deputy Burke, I do not know any man in this country who has a better right to clear up the mess, which is admittedly there, than the Minister for Finance of the Fianna Fáil Government, because they were the Government who deliberately, and for reasons which I will come to afterwards, created the mess.  Undoubtedly there is a mess; undoubtedly the economy has gone completely out of gear. We are told from the opposite side of the House that wages have raced far ahead of production, that we are importing more than we are exporting, that the balance of payments increased last year to £44 million from £31 million in the previous year, and that we are very fortunate indeed that the gap has not widened to £50 million.  The figure of £44 million is an estimate.  We have ceased both individually and nationally to be creditworthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The private sector no longer finds it possible to get credit from the joint stock banks.  The country as a nation <Col N="1866" /> is not acceptable as creditworthy on the international money market.  This litany which I have recited is the tale of woe which was told to us from the far side of the House, and is the reason for the introduction of this Budget. Well may Deputy Moore say that there is a wave of pessimism.  Again, those are not my words; they are the words of a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  Therefore I say that if that is the position&mdash;and it would appear to be the position&mdash;no one has a better right to tackle it than the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>This Government have been in office continuously since 1957.  I accept as a fact that we had a financial crisis in 1956, but that crisis was brought about by factors over which the then Government had no control.  It was brought about by the Korean War, the Suez crisis, and a glut of cattle from the Argentine on the British market.  The Government of the day took drastic measures at the end of 1956 to tackle that situation and to correct the then state of the economy.  The Fianna Fáil Party exploited it to the full in this House and in every county council chamber in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear now about a responsible Opposition, but we know the sort of Opposition we had then.  They obstructed all along the line and they put the Party all the way before the country.  As a result, they came into power in 1957.  Fianna Fáil came into power then on the basis that what happened in 1956, as a result of the factors to which I have referred, could never happen under a Fianna Fáil Government, and that they would see that it did not happen in the future. They assured us that they would see to it that a financial situation could never develop again which would give trouble to the country and to the economy.  One would think that a Government coming into power on that note would keep a close eye on the economy, and a close eye on the financial position; yet we have now this tale of woe of an adverse balance of payments, that we are importing more than we are exporting, that our credit has gone wrong, that we are producing <Col N="1867" /> too little and spending too much.  That is the tale of woe which this Government who came into power in 1957 have presented to us today.</P>
    <P>That situation did not develop overnight and it did not develop in a year. The Fianna Fáil Government have been in office since 1957 and during that time they had at their disposal the best brains in the Civil Service to advise them, and they had all the statistics and information available to the Civil Service at their disposal.  Not alone did this situation which the Minister for Finance tells us he is trying to cure not happen overnight, but it did not happen accidentally.  I say it was brought about by Government action.  It was brought about by a reckless and dishonest approach by the Government for selfish and dishonest political motives.</P>
    <P>Let us go briefly through the years during which this Government have been in office.  In 1962, they told the people that the economy was buoyant, that the national cake had grown to enormous proportions, and that everyone in the country was entitled to a fair share of the cake.  They put a Bill through this House increasing the salaries of individuals by as much as £600 a year.  They justified that on the basis that the economy was such that they were entitled to do that, and that it would be unfair to this well paid section of the community to deprive them of their share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>They introduced the status increases in 1962.  We finished up here before Christmas of 1962 with the Taoiseach telling us that the economy was never better.  Immediately after Christmas he introduced the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> which would suggest that despite all the buoyancy we heard about in 1962, things were not so good.  That White Paper was introduced, inviting the ordinary people to tighten their belts after the status increases of 1962. That was at the beginning of 1963, and in the 1963 Budget, the turnover tax was introduced for the first time.  This Party and the Labour Party warned the Government that the effect of the turnover <Col N="1868" /> tax would be to increase the cost of living enormously, and at the same time involve wage increase demands to enable wages to catch up with prices, while prices were outstripping wages. The then Minister for Finance sitting over there I think on the day the turnover tax was introduced made little of what the implications of the turnover tax were because on the day the Budget was introduced he was told so by Deputy Dillon and other members from this side of the House but he displayed a total ignorance of the implications of the turnover tax and what the results of it would be.  He assured us that it would not increase the cost of living.  That is on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>We know since that it has increased the cost of living enormously.  We know how little thought was given to the turnover tax introduced in 1963 when we hear the Minister for Finance, in this Budget, say that one of the alternatives open to him to raise revenue was the turnover tax.  He said he could not touch it, having considered it, because of the effect it would have on the cost of living and on wages <i>et cetera</i>.  That is what we told the former Minister for Finance in 1963 when he introduced the turnover tax.  He told us then we were talking rubbish.  He said it would in some way be absorbed in prices and by some magic or other would not project itself into an increase in the cost of the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>All we ever said about the turnover tax is correct and it has proved to be correct, not by what we say now, but by the fact that the Minister for Finance and the Government are terrified of this tax.  They are terrified to touch it.  It was a tax they introduced to do away with all other taxation, a ready system of taxation which could be adjusted, as required, and which would replace the old, hardy annuals of beer, petrol, tobacco and income tax.  Now they have it and it has done the damage. They are afraid to touch it.</P>
    <P>Later in 1963 the Government were defeated in a by-election in an important constituency in this city.  They were beaten hands down.  Their policy <Col N="1869" /> was rejected and they were threatened or challenged to contest a by-election in Cork city at the end of that year. They refused, in this House, to meet that challenge.  They invoked a Parliamentary procedure never before heard of in refusing to agree to the Writ being moved for the Cork by-election by the majority in the House.  With the assistance of some Deputies no longer in the House they delayed the Cork by-election until the following year when the Kildare by-election came about by the lamented death in the meantime of the late Deputy William Norton.</P>
    <P>It was then the Fianna Fáil Party became politically dishonest, let discretion go to the winds and really decided to have a go.  They could not afford to have industrial unrest in this country coinciding with a by-election in the city of Cork and in the comparatively industrialised constituency of Kildare.  Negotiations were going on for a wage adjustment, necessitated to a large extent by the imposition of the turnover tax.  The Taoiseach, I believe not entirely on his own, acceded to the advice of some of the bright young things in his Party, and decided that the people must be kept happy for the time being, at any rate, irrespective of the consequences.</P>
    <P>The by-election could not be lost. The attitude was: damn the consequences. We will cross those bridges when we come to them.  When the Taoiseach believed that a six per cent or a seven per cent increase in salaries and wages would have been adequate at that time, in order to buy the votes of the people of Cork and the people of Kildare, he gave the green light for a 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries all round, with only the one thought and the one consideration in mind&mdash;the winning of the by-elections in Cork and Kildare.</P>
    <P>They won the by-elections and they damned the consequences.  They said they would cross those bridges when they came to them.  They have arrived at the bridges now and they are taking credit and trying to get across them.  I wonder what those bright young gentlemen&mdash;they are a little <Col N="1870" /> older now and are certainly not regarded as so bright&mdash;have to say to the Taoiseach or what the Taoiseach has to say to them about the advice they gave him in 1964 and about their approach to the position then.  They won the by-elections of 1964 and they bluffed and gambled on through 1964 and into 1965.</P>
    <P>Between the beginning of 1964 and the spring of 1965 there was no complaint about the economy.  There was no warning about the financial position although I charged the Government that they had in their possession at that time warnings from responsible heads of the Civil Service in this country.  They must have had them.  They have the best brains available to them in the Civil Service.  It is the duty of the Civil Service to keep an eye on those things and to advise the Government of the day if things develop.  I am sure they did that.  We never heard a word, as I say, that anything was going wrong.  We had a by-election in Cork again at the beginning of 1965 and the Government then availed of the opportunity provided by the result of that by-election, which did not materially or numerically alter their strength in this House, to have a general election.</P>
    <P>They decided to do that because they knew the state of the economy, because they knew of the financial situation. They knew that if they did not hold a general election then and were compelled to hold by-elections later that year, they would be walloped out of office.  The Taoiseach and his bright boys gambled on the general election of April, 1965, with a two-headed halfpenny: if they won the general election of 1965 well and good, they could hold on and bluff in the hope something would turn up and if they lost the general election they would hand over the mess they had created to the incoming Government, sit back and laugh.  That was the attitude with which they faced the general election of 1965.  They could not lose.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Budget.  It proposes to impose approximately £12 million additional taxation.  If that taxation or any appreciable part of it <Col N="1871" /> were being imposed to encourage production, to improve our competitiveness in the export market or to set up better conditions in which we could enter the Common Market, or if this £12 million or any worthwhile part of it were provided to improve social welfare standards, then the people might grin and bear it and say : &ldquo;It is hard to have to pay additional taxation but when it is for worthwhile purposes we are prepared to do it.&rdquo; This taxation is not being raised for any of those purposes.  It is to pay for the bungling, for the dishonest practices of the Government during the last few years in trying to hold on to office.  In this Budget I cannot see any incentives to increase production.  The Budget, in fact, will have the opposite effect.  I see nothing in the Budget to provide improvement in the health services though it is admitted that the health services are the worst in Western Europe.  There is nothing in this Budget to improve our educational facilities though the Government Party have been campaigning on the need for better education facilities.</P>

My recollection is that no less a person than the Taoiseach said not so long ago that any worthwhile improvements in education or health were being shelved and I challenge Deputy Lemass to say differently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): That is an old story when the value of money is going down steadily, when there is need for more money to buy the same goods or services or less.  Let <Col N="1872" /> us be honest about this.  That is the type of dishonest nonsense we have been hearing from the other side of the House for years.  There is nothing in this Budget for social welfare classesThere is 5/- a week for the destitute but if a man has a room in his son's house or in somebody else's house he gets nothing.  I challenge Deputy Noel Lemass to tell us where is the money to provide additional and improved health services, additional and improved educational facilities, improved services for social welfare classes.  This Budget will do none of these things.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it increases the cost of living while reducing the value of wages.  The taxes on petrol, on cars, on beer and on cigarettes cannot be described any more as luxury taxes. People who are in what is described as the middle income group drive cars to their work and are entitled to do so. On top of the 25 per cent increase on the road tax, they will now pay 4d. a gallon extra for their petrol.  They will pay increased prices for their pints and their cigarettes and they will pay more under PAYE in income tax. The day has gone when only the wealthy classes paid income tax.  The road worker who is not married is now liable to have income tax extracted from him.</P>
      <P>All those taxes will bring about an increase in the cost of living and industrial strife and unrest will follow from that.  It is here at the moment.  People are going on strike by the thousands and I say the Government are responsible for that because they brought about a state of affairs in which the £ no longer means anything, in which it will not buy anything.  Yet they say to the people of the country that they must tighten their belts and not ask for increased wages.</P>
      <P>This Budget will kill our export trade.  If that happens is the adverse balance of trade and payments not likely to become much worse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this Budget will damage our tourist trade.  We are not blessed with very attractive weather and can give no guarantee about weather from one year to another, nor can we give any worthwhile forecast of the weather. But the things that appealed to tourists <Col N="1873" /> here were cheaper petrol, motoring, cigarettes and drink.  The gap is rapidly being closed by this Budget. We are pricing ourselves out of the tourist business which is regarded as one of our best money-earners.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the cost of living going up as a result of the Budget and about industrial strikes and unrest following it, and I should like to say a word about price control.  Some months ago the Government announced&mdash;I think in order to placate the workers&mdash;that they were introducing a system of price control.  That was as bit of windowdressing; I do not think the Government have done anything about price control.  We had proof of that in the past few days when a firm of brewers announced that they are financially fit to absorb the 2d a pint on beer and do not intend passing it on to the consumer.  Does that not mean that this brewery was earning too much profit over the past year? Does it not mean that if Watneys are able to absorb the 2d a pint and still have a profit, they must have been charging too much to the consumer in the past and that there was no control over or investigation of their activities?</P>
    <P>The people as a whole accept that the petrol companies here enjoy far too high profits.  They vie with each other to see which of them can spend the most money on advertising and getting tied sites and control of petrol stations.  Two of these companies, since the Budget, have been able to reduce the price of their petrol by, I think, 1½ per gallon.  Does that not mean that they have been enjoying excessive profits and that the Government have done nothing about it?  They made some sort of feeble effort to check on the price of drink.  I do not know if there was a direct investigation; I do not know how it ended or whether the price of drink was reduced.</P>
    <P>We have been challenged from time to time by the Government side to say what we object to in the Budget.  I object to the state of affairs brought about by the Government which makes these proposals necessary. Apart from that, if the country is in the state in which the Minister for <Col N="1874" /> Finance tells us it is and there is nothing for the farmers or the social welfare classes, nothing for education or health, then we have lost our sense of direction and our priorities are all wrong.  We behave in some ways as if we were a mighty empire with unlimited resources and great responsibility for the rest of the world.  If our position is as bad as we are told it is, we should not be meeting, out of our own resources, the cost of maintaining a military force in Cyprus.  We are neither morally nor legally obliged to do so.  It is not expected of us.  We are a small nation and if we accept what the Minister for Finance says we are in poor circumstances and in such a case we have no obligation to meet the cost of this force in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs, I think, has lost his reason and his sense of responsibility.  He is trotting about the globe like a miniature Mr. World.  The better-off countries must be laughing at us.  I understand we were offered a refund of the cost of this force in Cyprus but we would not take it.  In our circumstances our first duty is to our own people at home, to build up our own economy and provide the ordinary, accepted social amenities our people want before we go trotting about the world undertaking responsibilities and obligations far beyond our capacity to bear.</P>
    <P>People find it very hard to get money for housing.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows how hard it is to get money for simple amenities for people in rural areas in the form of better approached to their homes, better water supplies and drainage facilities. If that is so, and if it looked like that in 1962 and 1963, were we justified in embarking on additional non-productive expenditure on building at Leinster House at a cost of £750,000, spending £750,000 in Cyprus and a similar amount on the Castle Yard? These things are all very well if we can afford them.  I am not against better buildings and better accommodation at Leinster House or Dublin Castle, nor am I against providing a peace force in Cyprus, provided we can afford it, or it does not cost us anything, but as the position is what we are on the verge of bankruptcy, our <Col N="1875" /> priorities are all wrong.  They have gone completely haywire.</P>
    <P>I wonder what does the Minister for Finance mean when he tells us that we are to have another Budget in the autumn of this year?  He has told us that we may expect another Budget and that we may expect more taxes. He should tell the people now in what circumstances he proposes introducing another Budget.  Does he intend to go through the Presidential election on this supplementary Budget?  Presumably he does.  Does he intend introducing his second Budget before the local elections?  He should make these things clear to the House and to the country.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister for Finance introduces any more Budgets, before he starts having two Budgets in the same year, he should accept the challenge thrown down to him in the opening stages of this debate and advise the Taoiseach to test the feeling of the people on his record since 1957 and, in particular, on his record in this Budget.  He should hold, not alone a Presidential election on 1st June, but a general election also, and see what the result will be.  I am satisfied that if he does not agree now to hold a general election with the Presidential election on 1st June, we will have three elections this year instead of two because the people will register their disapproval of Government policy and will reject the present Government on 1st June in such a way that the Taoiseach will have no alternative but to go quickly to the new President and dissolve Parliament.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, in his remarks which included a reference to our overseas contributions, proclaimed that this country was in a state of bankruptcy.  Earlier on, he said he admits that there were certain financial difficulties in 1956 for which, of course, the Government of that day had no responsibility but that from what the Fianna Fáil Party had said in the election of 1957 and subsequently, the people would not expect that such a situation could arise again.  The point that Deputy Fitzpatrick misses <Col N="1876" /> is that the situation of 1956-57 has not come back again.</P>

      <P>The rate of progress this year and the rate of progress anticipated for next year are far greater than ever seen in this country prior to 1956.  That is a statistical fact.  Just because the Government have been doing better than they had planned and better than they had laid down their expectations were and exceeded these things to a degree that has helped to cause an inflationary tendency, there is no need to say that everything they did was bad.  Everything they did was not bad.  In fact, the situation is not bad enough to consider running a deficiency Budget. There was speculation in the newspapers and by some outside economists who know it all, that the Minister would probably go for a surplus Budget.  You do not do that in a time of severe financial crisis.  You do that when your economy is sound and only when your economy is sound, and you do it also to draw into your Exchequer money by taxation instead of by borrowing so that that money for borrowing can be left available for private investors for purposes of further expansion.</P>
      <P>There have been letters to the Press and so on as to why we should borrow abroad when loans floated by the ESB can be filled in 15 minutes.  It is for the same reason as you balance your Budget in a year of this nature, so that you will not take from the economy money that is required by private industry for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was asking me what has been done to improve health, education and social services.  In his Budget statement the Minister points out that one of the problems with which he was confronted was that the expenditure under some of these heads had outrun what he had planned for last year and, rather than pull back on these services, he thought it more desirable to raise the money by way of taxation and, he pointed out, by way of indirect taxation as distinct from turnover tax.  Deputy Fitzpatrick <Col N="1877" /> says that we are afraid of turnover tax: double the turnover tax and your revenue problem was solved.  There is another factor which must be taken into account when considering the form of taxation you will use to maintain services which all Parties agree are essential and which several speakers have said are insufficient.  All of Deputy Fitzpatrick's statement was pointing out the insufficiency of the money spent on health, education and social services.  In fact, the money to be spent on primary education is up by £1½ million; the money to be spent on secondary education is up by £1,100,000, and on vocational education by £50,000, on Social Welfare by £6½ million and on health nearly £2 million and it is still insufficient.  But, you cannot raise a tax to pay for them. We must improve these services and have no money to pay for them.  That is the rock Fine Gael perish on and one would imagine that they would have learned by now.</P>
    <P>At least, the Labour Party made some effort to show how to go about this problem and suggested that the main source of revenue should be income tax.  It is quite true that if we were to increase the rate of income tax to the 8/3d that applies in England, it would more or less balance the Budget.  There again, Deputy Corish, on 16th December, 1960&mdash;Volume 185, Column 1518 of the Official Report&mdash; had this to say:</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach has often thought of the many people who do not pay their income tax, the people from whom no effort is made to get that income tax.  The wage and salary earners cannot escape one halfpenny of their income tax now. They cannot fiddle with expenses and various allowances.  They have to pay it down to the last halfpenny every week.</P>
    <P>This does not sound to me as meaning that Deputy Corish, in 1960, was fond of income tax as a solution.  In spite of some independent expressions of opinion by Labour that have been made outside the House and inside the House.  I do not think it would be a wise thing to increase income tax <Col N="1878" /> further than it has been increased in this Budget, for the same reason as you should not increase the turnover tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The case Deputy Corish was making was for an increase in the allowance for dependent relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but my colleague in Dublin South-West, Deputy O'Connell, wanted a rate of 7/6d.  He took the attitude that savings could be made on Government spending for investment and subsidies.  He took the attitude that the Government would do much better to look for income tax but he said we should be very careful if they were to invest this money in industrial expansion, careful to the extent that the expansion would be bound to be far less and that you would have a diminishing return.  You can be too careful as well as being too excessive. If there is a complaint against the Government it is a simple one, that along with investors and speculators, along with consumers and everybody else, the Government spent too much too fast.  This has been a national ailment, in my opinion, for the past year or two.  Now the Government say that we must pull back on this.  The fiscal and economic policies which the Government are following are in common with those followed by most progressive Governments throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These economic thoughts call for a steadily increasing Government spending and they offer the best chance of rapid national expansion.  However, a danger goes hand in hand with these policies, that is, the danger of inflation. This danger can be caused by various factors, and restraints must be imposed and must be imposed as gently, as firmly and as steadily as possible, if we are to avoid recession.  The cooperation of all sectors is required if this Budget is to work and have the proper effect.  President Johnson in the United States is having a very similar problem.  He is adopting a policy which one could describe as &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo;. A criticism of this Government might be that we waited to see a little too long.  In fact, the Minister for Finance has made it clear that in his opinion, <Col N="1879" /> while these policies are being followed, a year may be too long to have to wait before a review of the nation's situation is carried out and it might be better to come for a little more often, to come twice a year to check the tendencies that become apparent.</P>
    <P>This is the criticism of the 12 per cent wage agreement.  It is felt that too much was injected into the consumer spending market at the same time and for too long a period.  In France now, the employers' and employees' orginisations have agreed to a national increase of three and a half per cent per annum. This is to be a national matter, without discussion, and will be automatically implemented.  President Johnson is trying to get a similar agreement in America.  In Belgium recently, the Government fell because it decided to impose the necessary taxes for the purpose of removing inflationary pressures. The People's Party in Austria suffered an attack from the Socialists for the same reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, but the Socialists attacked the People's Party because it was imposing taxes. The Government of Portugal&mdash;which is rarely criticised; I understand it is a rather dangerous thing to do&mdash;is coming under severe criticism in the Press because of its taxing proposals. The signs are apparent in the British economy where wages went up nine per cent last year and prices went up five per cent.  It could be said of us that we went to the country when it was favourable to us.  The same could be said of Prime Minister Wilson. Germany's problem is the same as England's.  Wages went up by nine per cent and prices went up by four and a half per cent.  India has inflation caused by different factors, caused by a food shortage.  Vietnam has it because of the influx of freely spending foreign soldiers.  Peru has it also, and Brazil has now got the world's worst inflation problem because last year the cost of living went up by 54 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore there is nothing very extraordinary about the problems that <Col N="1880" /> confront us here today.  What may be extraordinary is that national progress is going to be continued and maintained while these problems are being dealt with and while there is a slowing down, the rate of progress will be far in excess of what was thought possible 12 years ago.  Certainly it was not thought possible until about 1956 or 1957.  The rate of expansion increased by one per cent and at various times various Parties considered one per cent a reasonable rate of expansion for this economy.  When I was starting in politics, that was the situation. The cause of these problems is simply that human demands are rising faster than the national economy can afford.  Unless the Government, the employers, the workers and farmers' representatives can agree to restraints when they are necessary, then the advancement of the nation in regard to the availability of work, a rising standard of living for all sectors and an improvement in social services will be hampered and delayed.  It is a question of getting understanding between these four sections, which I agree is a difficult thing.  The recent spending spree after the 12 per cent increase could be likened to a child being let loose in a shop among refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and motor cars in an irresponsible society peopled by ad-men. I do not know who said that but I thought I would mention it.</P>

      <P>There are some matters to which I want to refer and which would be more appropriate on a Vote on Account.  However, before we get away from the points raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick and others, I should like to mention that the late Deputy Norton, speaking on the 11th April, 1962, at column 1826, volume 194, No. 11, dealing with a similar problem of how to raise money, said:</P>
      <P>some of this will come probably from a purchase tax, as in many European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the Labour Party quite accepted the fact that some form of <Col N="1881" /> purchase tax or turnover tax was inevitable in the times to come.</P>

      <P>In 1956, the then Government issued a circular dated June 29th, 1956, headed &ldquo;The Guarantee Scheme&rdquo; and it read:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to the Department's circular letter, H 10/56 of the 9th June, 1956, and to state that following a decision the following arrangements have been agreed with the principal building societies as the basis of a scheme for guarantees in relation to advances for private houses.  The guarantee will operate only in relation to advances for the erection and purchase of new houses for owner occupants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to that, I wrote to every building society in the State and not one would advance money, either on its own behalf or with the so-called Government guarantee.  In the present circumstances I did the same thing. <Col N="1882" /> I got a completely different type of reply.  Deputy Dillon told us the building societies had no money to lend.  That is untrue.  The Educational Building Society on 1st February, 1966, wrote to me to the effect that 90 per cent of the purchase price will be considered in favour of a suitable applicant, subject to the conditions governing advances.  They said:</P>
    <P>A loan application will be considered by the Board of Directors within two weeks from the date the application form is submitted to the Society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not consider them at all in 1956.  The Irish Permanent Building Society wrote on 3rd February:</P>
      <P>The Society is at present considering loans on new and previously occupied houses and there is normally no delay in the completion of the loan.  The decision on an application can be made within approximately ten days and a loan can be completed within a month.  The Society's normal advance is 75 per cent of the purchase price but with additional security such as an indemnity bond the Society can grant a loan up to 90 per cent of the purchase price...</P>
      <P>The Irish Civil Service (Permanent) Building Society wrote:</P>
      <P>In reply to yours of 31st ultimo, I enclose loan prospectus.  At present there is a waiting list of approximately two to three months...</P>
      <P>That is the least favourable one.  The Irish Industrial Benefit Building Society wrote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to your letter of the 31st January, I confirm that this Society is at present receiving applications for loans for new and previously occupied houses from established members of the Society for the present.  This Society has a large number of loans approved, and these loans will be taken up by the borrowers as required on specified <Col N="1883" /> dates without any delay in payment.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the mortgage rate is six per cent.  This is a completely different picture from what we had in 1956.  There is national progress and additional spending on all the items Deputy Fitzpatrick was worried about. There is money available to the local authorities for housing and from the private building societies.  In 1956 the Dublin city manager went down to the Bank of Ireland with a guarantee signed by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, a guarantee which the Bank of Ireland refused to honour, to give the corporation the money they required to meet their normal running expenses.  That is on the record.</P>
    <P>A matter about which I am concerned and which I referred to on previous occasions is that of medical expenses.  Any money people pay to doctors should be deductible for income tax purposes.  I say this for several reasons.  One of them is that the money you pay to your doctor by way of a fee is in fact taxed twice.  The man who earns it is taxed and the doctor who receives it is taxed.  There can be an argument about the morality of that.  Some people for one reason or another&mdash;possibly because they are living a bit beyond their means or right up to their actual means and have not joined the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme &mdash; find themselves faced with heavy expenses for medical purposes.  This can run into hundreds of pounds.  There is no relief in income tax for these payments.</P>
    <P>I think that is wrong.  People can be put off from having important operations for themselves or for members of their family, perhaps causing irreparable damage to health, because there is no encouragement and they say they will put up with the pain for a little longer rather than face the bill; but if these charges were deductible, there would be some encouragement to have the medical attention required. As against that, I know the Taoiseach knows, and I am sure the Minister for Finance knows, a certain gentleman who got a very severe illness and spent several years effecting a cure, which, it seems now, is a permanent one, <Col N="1884" /> thank God.  This man incurred the expense of several thousand pounds which he has been paying in monthly instalments now for about six years.  I think this man, who is in the income tax bracket, should be allowed to deduct these expenses.  That is a just request.  This is probably more proper to the Vote on Account.  I raised the matter before and I will do so again unless the health services are changed to an extent that I do not think this tax incentive is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter with which I am concerned, that is, the method of taxing working husbands and wives.  While it is not any great problem in this country yet, it is undoubtedly a big problem in other countries and leads to people setting up house in the form of a loose assocation.  Here, from Article 40 of the Constitution right through the pronoucements of every member of this House and the Seanad, we have a tremendous respect for the family.  But in section 2 of the Constitution we provide that the State shall endeavour to ensure that no mother shall be obliged to engage in any form of labour&mdash;those are the words of the Constitution.  I think the State must be more concerned about this provision because under the present tax laws married persons with independent incomes have their incomes added up and taxed jointly.  In certain instances, the married woman's earned income allowance cannot exceed £40 a year.  This is in fact a tax on marriage which we have adopted <Col N="1885" /> into our monetary system, which we have lived with and apparently intend to persist with.  You could carry this argument further and say we are in fact bringing in a subsidy on sin.</P>
    <P>What this tax means is that any family anxious to increase their status, who decide to do this by their own efforts and labour and to take on two employments and all the difficulties attached thereto for the purpose of giving their children a better education than they can afford on one salary alone, are severely taxed by the State for so doing.  This is a matter that requires considerable examination.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Interference with Journalists.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment in view of the unsatisfactory answer I got from the Minister today to Question No. 35.  I want to say straight away that I do not think there is anything sinister about the manner in which the Minister replied to the question.  I am quite sure he answered it in accordance with the information made available to him.  However, I suggest that some valid and vital information might not have been made available to him in this connection.  Therefore, I propose to recapitulate and to convey to the Minister the facts of the matter as I see them, as the journalists concerned see them and as the trade union catering for the journalists, the National Union of Journalists, see them as well. Very briefly&mdash;I do not want to bore the Minister or the House&mdash;the facts are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief Reporter of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the staff reporter of Radio Éireann were informed on 17th of last month that this object had appeared on the strand at Ballycotton. In accordance with their duties, they were expected to proceed there and report on the situation.  They did not go by stealth but went quite publicly. They left Cork about 6.30 a.m. and arrived in Ballycotton village some minutes after 7 a.m. while it was still <Col N="1886" /> dark, and naturally they parked their car outside the Garda barracks where there appeared to be a great deal of activity.  The whole place was lighted up and there appeared to be great comings and goings of military as well as Garda personnel.  They had taken the precaution of displaying the Press disc on their windscreen to indicate to any responsible person that they were there on behalf of the Press and that they were not just inquisitive people about other business; in other words, they made it quite clear that they were representing the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the reporting staff of Radio Éireann.  Both of them must have been well known to the officer in charge of the Army personnel there and to the gardaí as well.</P>
    <P>They proceeded about their lawful business, and the car was inspected by a member of the Garda Síochána.  He came over, looked at the car and saw the disc on the windscreen.  An Army officer came over as well.  When the Army personnel moved off in a certain direction, naturally the journalists, in pursuit of their duties, moved in that direction also.  At no stage, even when the Army officer in charge bade them good-morning, did either the officer of the Army or the sergeant of the gardaí say: &ldquo;You are not entitled to go down there and photograph this or make any report on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is in strong contrast to the reply which the National Union of Journalists have received from the OC of the Southern Command who in the course of his letter to the secretary, in which he does apologise&mdash;I freely acknowledge that&mdash;says it was unfortunate that on arrival at Ballycotton the man involved did not speak to the officer in charge of security whom he saw at the Garda station, as, had he done so, the OC felt, he would have received full cooperation and advice from that officer.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that that excuse is a bit thin.  It is now being sought to put the blame on these journalists who were going about their lawful business, who were easily identifiable because of the disc on their car and who were identifiable because they are well-known journalists.  It is <Col N="1887" /> being suggested that they should have said: &ldquo;Please, sir, may we go down to the beach to see and photograph the object that is down there?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is my belief that it was an error of judgment in the first case on the part of the Army but that the Minister and his Department are now hiding behind the unfortunate corporal who carried out the physical assault on the two journalists concerned.  It is quite clear that it is now being thrown back into the laps of the corporal and the private who was with him and who ran down from the cliffs and physically assaulted the journalists concerned.  I am suggesting to the Minister that this Operation Ballycotton was carried out by the officers of the Southern Command in a very stupid and ignorant fashion and that they are not entitled to throw the whole blame on the unfortunate corporal there.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I should like to know from the Minister, in any such emergency or alleged emergency, where does the Army take over from the gardaí; in other words, where does the military authority take over from the civil authority?  It is quite clear that in the hours before the arrival of the journalists in Ballycotton there were high ranking officers from both the Garda and the Department of Defence in deep conclave in the barracks at Ballycotton.  Any ordinary citizen, be he a journalist or otherwise, is entitled to know where the jurisdiction of the Garda ends and where the jurisdiction of the Army commences?  Do not forget that it was said by a member of the Defence Forces to a civilian going about his lawful duties: &ldquo;Regard yourself as being under arrest by the Army.&rdquo;  That civilian was placed under arrest and it was only after some time that some officer came, apologised and released him from custody.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House, including the Minister, will agree, I think, that the Press have been a most loyal and most beneficial influence in the founding of any democracy.  The only reason I raise this matter on the Adjournment is that I do not think there was anything particularly sinister about it but that I feel that even the slightest intervention <Col N="1888" /> by any State service, be they Garda or the Department of Defence, must be immediately nailed and it must be clearly stated that that kind of thing happens not to be the policy of our democratic Government.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying, as I think the Minister endeavoured to convey to me today, that this was an unfortunate incident in which an unfortunate corporal made an error of judgment. That is not good enough, for the simple reason that it is not true.  The corporal and the private were placed in charge of a certain area and they were told that unauthorised people should not intervene and there should be no question of unauthorised people taking photographs of the object on the beach.  The chief photographer of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the staff reporter of Radio Éireann parked their car outside the Garda barracks, which was fully lighted up; they were seen; they were recognised.  They were seen by the Army officers and by the Garda Síochána.  They had a label on the windscreen indicating that they were &ldquo;Press.&rdquo;  Those who saw them must have known why they were in Ballycotton; they were not there for the sake of a swim at seven o'clock in the morning.  They must have known these men were going about their lawful business and nobody indicated at any time that they should not proceed to the beach.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that the whole thing was messed up by the officers who were sent out there in charge of the particular operation.  I freely admit that has been admitted by the OC Southern Command, with this reservation: &ldquo;It is unfortunate that on arrival in Ballycotton... did not speak to the officer in charge of security whom he saw near the Garda station&rdquo;.  If the journalist and photographer were seen by the officer, surely the officer was equally seen by the journalist and the photographer and, unless he happened to be particularly dimwitted, he must have suspected what they were there for.  It is a bit thick, to say the least of it, for the OC Southern Command to say the whole matter arose because the journalist did not approach the Army officer.  If the officers concerned had <Col N="1889" /> made up their mind that not alone the public but journalists should not approach the beach it was their duty to warn them.  They gave no warning and so these two men went along to do their lawful work, in the course of which they were physically assaulted.</P>
    <P>I do not know if all the facts I am relating have been brought to the attention of the Minister and, while I appreciate that the Minister and the Army authorities have apologised to the journalists, the apology is not good enough if they seek to lay the blame for the whole thing on the unfortunate corporal.  The blame rests with the officers in charge and I would like the Minister to note that.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question today Deputy Mullen raised another aspect. With your permission, Sir, I should like to leave the few minutes left to Deputy Mullen to comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to remarks made by Deputy Mullen concerning an article written by an officer subsequently, then that does not arise because it was not incorporated in the question and it is, therefore, outside the ambit of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters referred to was the importance of relations between the Army and the Press.  That being so, we cannot over-emphasise that this is, to all intents and purposes, a democracy and, that being so, we must be extremely careful to ensure people do not take upon themselves decisions they are not entitled to make.  My understanding is that there was no question of a state of emergency, for example, being declared. I make complaint with regard to the manner in which Army personnel behaved on that occasion.  This <Col N="1890" /> cannot be attributed to the rank and file because they were acting only on instructions given by the Higher Command. I question the manner in which the Army authorities decided to handle this situation.  This cannot be flipped off by way of apology to the journalists and their organisation.  This calls for a reprimand of those who exercised this authority.  They should be reprimanded for the way in which they handled this situation.  Again it goes further.  I am just wondering to what extent the Army has got control over the members of the Army.  There is no doubt that representations were made and that during the course of the investigation of these representations, action was taken by an Army officer who was aware of these representations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be found in the fact that this man adopts the role of a free-lance journalist and decides to make comment on something that is being investigated by the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that this has been brought to the Minister's attention and knowing that the Army was investigating the matter surely the Minister would set out to ascertain why a stand was taken by any member of the Army while this matter was being investigated. Nobody is entitled to do that.  I earnestly entreat the Minister to get after this.  No man, whether in the Army or otherwise, is entitled to interfere with an Army investigation. He cannot use his position as an Army officer to write in a newspaper, in an anonymous fashion, on an investigation that is under way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the Army itself is fundamentally the basis upon which democracy is founded and the Army is certainly <Col N="1891" /> the safeguard the people have that democracy shall prevail.</P>
      <P>Arising out of this incident in which a particular photographer was prevented from taking a photograph in Ballycotton on the date mentioned by Deputy Casey, the question that arose out of it today and the previous questions and the contribution that has just been made by Deputy Casey, I gave a very adequate answer to the question today.  I explained the situation fully, as far as I possibly could.  I indicated to the House that we regretted the incident and that we had apologised to the various interests concerned in this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Casey makes much of the point that the military officer in charge did not stop the two news-papermen&mdash;we will call them that: it is a shorter way of identifying them than to describe them individually&mdash; and ask them what they were doing and tell them what they could or could not do.  But, in my view, and from my experience of dealing with newsmen, they are the people who ask the questions.  When they want information, they ask for it: it is their job to seek it.</P>
      <P>These two men, when they arrived in Ballycotton, had a sticker on their motor car and it was easy to identify them.  Probably the military officer knew them: I do not know whether or not he did.  However, he was quite within his rights in waiting to be asked.  As far as I can see, if newsmen want information it is usual for them to look for it.  As far as the Army is concerned, I feel that at all times the military authorities, the local commanding officers and the Department of Defence, do not try to avoid giving news to a newsman when he wants it. The Department go as far as they possibly can, within the limits of security or whatever other reasons they might have for witholding certain particular classes of news.  In so far as this particular incident is concerned, the kernel of the matter is where the newsmen were stopped.  They were stopped by a corporal down on the beach.</P>

It was known that it was not safe to let anybody near it until the indicator was moved to &ldquo;Disarm&rdquo;.  If the photographer went down to the beach and this object was, in fact, an explosive and he was killed, then the same two Deputies would be in here now asking why the military authorities had not taken adequate steps to protect the public.  I think that the security guard was adequately ordered and adequately instructed and that the corporal was carrying out the instruction he got from his commanding officer to prevent a photograph being taken of this object.  He may have become too concerned about whether he would take physical action to prevent the photograph from being taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>
