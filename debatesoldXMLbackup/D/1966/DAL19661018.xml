    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what help Irish Embassies abroad give to individuals or to trade missions from Ireland when they arrive seeking extra outlets and new markets for exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch (for the Minister for External Affairs) Mr. J. Lynch (for the Minister for External Affairs)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Embassies and Consular Offices abroad are prepared to give to trade missions and individual exporters from Ireland every appropriate assistance within the limit of the scope of their functions.  In particular they will be prepared to set up programmes of suitable business contacts, to advise on import formalities and on trade restrictions affecting the commodities of interest, to supply information on presentational and marketing methods and to advise, where <Col N="1366" /> necessary, on the selection of import agents.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I would like to see our exporters and intending exporters making maximum use of the services of our Embassies and Consular Offices.  In order to secure the full benefit of the services which the Missions are in a favourable position to give, it is desirable, if not essential, that they should, where possible, be given advance notice of trade visits and of their precise purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, despite his statement that they are prepared to give every appropriate assistance, inside the past month a delegation of the NFA, led by the President, Mr. Rickard Deasy, went to London to negotiate for markets and better prices for our livestock and were completely ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we got all those in the Trade Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, I am not so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, is the Minister aware that his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, gave explicit instructions to the Irish Embassy that this delegation was to be boycotted and completely ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggests they went over to negotiate better prices, as if to imply they were going to negotiate with the British Government. The purpose of the NFA visit to London was to have discussions with their counterpart organisation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries gave explicit instructions to the Irish Embassy that they were to be boycotted and completely ignored, that the Embassy obeyed his instructions and that the delegation was boycotted and completely ignored?  Is the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries denying that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Bringing in the dirt again.  I am denying it categorically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his Department have any plans under consideration at present for the opening of new Missions in any country or countries with which this country does not at present have diplomatic relations, with a view to expanding the export trade or for any other reason; and, if so, what countries are involved in such plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The question whether our export trade or other interests render desirable the extension of our diplomatic representation abroad is reviewed from time to time.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that, as the setting up of a new Mission involves another Government, it is not possible to say in advance of a decision being taken and agreed with the other Government concerned what plans may be under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the United Nations delegation intend to press for any new initiative for peace based on the Geneva Agreement that might bring an end to the Vietnam war; and whether at his recent meeting with Mr. Rusk he discussed the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, I wish to point out that the situation in Vietnam is not inscribed as a separate item on the agenda of the current Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  I may add that my general view of the Vietnam situation remains unaltered from the reply I gave to the Deputy on 9th June, 1965, when I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All that the smaller members of the United Nations can do is to hope that all the States involved will be wise enough to negotiate a settlement which will bring peace to the sorely afflicted people of Vietnam and prevent a disastrous extension of the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the answer is that I discussed the situation in Vietnam with Secretary of State Rusk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if there are any further details about the Minister's discussions with Mr. Rusk on Vietnam, and whether the Minister said anything in addition to his reply to my question of last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer for the Minister, but even if I had information, I think it is information I could not disclose because the value of these personal contacts is that they must remain confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the Taoiseach and the Government subscribe to the view expressed in Teheran by the Chairman of the Seanad to the effect that the Irish Government and the Irish people were 100 per cent behind Great Britain and America in their policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That was purely an expression of a personal opinion for which the Government have no responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if, in view of the most recent statement of the South African Foreign Minister to the effect that South Africa would tolerate no interference by the United Nations in South West African territories, his own proposals for a commission to be set up to issue recommendations is now practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement by the Foreign Minister of South Africa in no way affects the practicability of the suggestion I made on 3rd October concerning the draft Resolution on South West Africa.  The texts of the draft and of my speech have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be impracticable to be talking about setting up a commission if the South African Foreign Minister says that <Col N="1369" /> he has no intention of paying any regard to any commission.  While the Minister for External Affairs may have the most admirable reasons, it seems to me that it is a waste of time that he should be setting up such a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the amendment of the Minister for External Affairs arose from a motion put down by African countries.  The Minister's amendment attracted support from a wide variety of nations, including Western European and South American countries. I think it is only to be expected that any initiative on the setting up of a commission, or whatever it might be called, would be resisted by South Africa, but nevertheless the fact remains that the United Nations regard the situation as still within their ambit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what percentage (a) of the national income, and (b) of the gross national product is the annual yield of taxation by Central Government, including social security contributions of employers and employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For the calendar year 1965, the national income is estimated at £813 million and the gross national product at £1,015 million.  The total net amount collected by the State in tax revenue, motor vehicle duties and social insurance contributions by employers and employees in the financial year ended 31 March 1966 was £220 million. This represents 27.02 per cent of the national income and 21.64 per cent of the gross national product in the year 1965.</P>

      <P>It is general principle of the social welfare schemes that only one benefit should be paid to a claimant in respect of any period even though more than one of the contingencies for which benefit is provided has arisen in that period in a particular case.  This principle has, however, been considerably modified in its application to widows by the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953 to 1965, under which disability benefit can be paid in addition to widows' contributory or non-contributory pension. Under the regulations, a widow in receipt of a contributory pension who qualifies for disability benefit is paid half the appropriate personal rate of disability benefit; if her pension is non-contributory, the rate of benefit payable depends on the rate of pension and can range from half the appropriate personal rate of disability benefit to as much as the full rate, plus appropriate adjustments in respect of any dependent children.</P>

      <P>Substantial grants have already been provided to assist the Galway Board of Conservators and other local interests in establishing from their resources a major salmon hatching and rearing station at Cong, County Mayo, with the primary aim of improving the salmon stocks of the Corrib-Mask system.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated to an organisation interested in the brown trout of Lough Corrib the minimum cost of facilities at a particular site for hatching and rearing brown trout on the large scale appropriate to the trout stocks of that lake.  I have not received any intimation that the local interests are prepared to contribute to the cost of such facilities.  I should however point out that I am convinced that at best artificial propagation can only fill a minor role in the improvement of trout stocks in Lough Corrib compared with the major work of predator control and improvement of spawning areas which the Inland Fisheries Trust have been carrying out on that lake for a number of years past.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the programme for continuance of that work was recently reviewed at a meeting between representatives of the Trust and local organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>The Minister says the important thing is the work of keeping predators down.  Is the Minister aware that the Inland Fisheries Trust have taken away three people?  They used to have four but they have taken away three, and now there is only one person carrying out this work.  Is he further aware that the local estimate is 300,000 fingerlings to re-stock the lake?  The estimate was £16,000 for the improvement of the hatcheries and the provision of ponds.  Would the Minister make even £4,000 available <Col N="1390" /> to permit of the essential work being carried out now and spreading the rest over a period of years?</P>

      <P>The Trust are making assistance available to the hatchery this year to enable them to strip the trout.

That is not to say that I do not very much appreciate the efforts of a group of voluntary people no matter where they are who are prepared to give their own time and money and who sincerely believe in the efficacy of this artificial propagation hatchery.  This is a very difficult decision to come to.  I do know that a number of these Corrib anglers firmly believe in the efficacy of this hatchery of theirs.  They have devoted a great deal of time and energy to it down the years and I would be very reluctant to bring its operations to an end out of hand. That is the difficulty with which I am faced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons suffering from mental handicap, in so far as institutional treatment is concerned, are <Col N="1404" /> dealt with under the general legislation in connection with the health services. The services are provided free of charge for persons in the lower income group and their dependants and for pupils of national schools where the defect is discovered at school health examinations. Apart from the school children mentioned, as regards persons in the middle income group and their dependants, the services may be provided free or at a charge not exceeding 10s a day and as regards persons outside the lower and middle income groups if, in the opinion of the health authority, they would be unable without undue hardship, to provide the services needed for themselves or their dependants, they also may be given institutional services free or subject to a charge.</P>
      <P>I understand that where there is provision for a charge, health authorities, in determining the amount of the charge, or whether to impose any, take into account the long-term nature of the service which has to be provided for most mentally handicapped persons. Thus, where a health authority might feel justified in charging the maximum of 10s a day for a short-term illness, it would adjust that charge, or remit it altogether, where the need for the service continues over a long period.  Of the mentally handicapped patients maintained in the special institutions all but six per cent are health authority patients.  The revenue collected by health authorities, in respect of patients for whom they accepted liability, in a recent year works out at an average of slightly less than 7d per day per patient.</P>

      <P>The number of permanent posts of district medical officer now vacant is 147.  The dispensary districts concerned are served by temporary dispensary doctors.</P>
      <P>The number of vacancies is above average as, in view of the proposed introduction of a general medical service with choice of doctor, my predecessor requested health authorities in May, 1965, not to proceed with the filling of vacant district medical officer posts on a permanent basis.  Only four posts in remote areas along the west coast, where special arrangements for the provision of general medical services would be necessary under the service with choice of doctor, have since been advertised for filling on that basis.</P>
      <P>I have not changed this general policy but I have under consideration proposals for the holding, through the Local Appointments Commissioners, of a confined competition to permit the transfer of existing permanent dispensary doctors to certain vacant permanent posts of district medical officer.

      <P>The House will have learned with great regret of the death this morning of Deputy Mrs. Honor Crowley, following an illness borne with characteristic patience and courage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Mrs. Crowley had a distinguished career in Irish public life First elected to Dáil Éireann in 1945, she was returned as a Deputy for Kerry South in every successive General Election.  She served as a member of Kerry County Council <Col N="1407" /> since 1948, and also acted on several other organisations, such as the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the Irish Tourist Association, the Killarney Tourist Association, the Derrynane Trust, and the Kerry Drama Festival Committee.  She was a representative of Ireland on the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Her contributions over the years to our deliberations here in Dáil Éireann were highly constructive and deeply sincere, and always commanded attention and respect.  Her devoted and dedicated public service was in the highest and best traditions of Irish public life, and fully in keeping, also, with the best traditions of the family from which she came, and whose record of public service to the people of Kerry and of Ireland is so distinguished and so notable.</P>
    <P>Her appointment by the President to be a member of the Council of State was a fitting climax to such a distinguished career.</P>
    <P>This House has suffered a grievous loss by her death.  Her constituents in South Kerry have lost a most devoted advocate.</P>
    <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to the relatives of the late Mrs. Crowley the deepest sympathy of the House.  Ar Dheis Dé go raibh a hanam.</P>

Indeed, I think she and I came into this House on the very same day.  She was also a colleague of mine at the Council of Europe, and as a representative of Ireland, she was always held in high esteem and her contributions were <Col N="1408" /> valued.  Those who listened to her in this House were interested in her contributions to the discussions in which she participated.</P>

    <Title>Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1966: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to continue the Exchange Control Act, 1954, in operation for a further period of four years.  The Act is due to expire on 31 December, 1966.</P>
      <P>The necessity for exchange control in Ireland arises from the restrictions on the convertibility of sterling into other currencies which have been in force to a varying degree since 1939. Previously sterling was freely convertible into any other currency and this country could at all times rely on using sterling to make payments or transfer money to any country.  The imposition of restrictions on the convertibility of sterling made it necessary for us, in common with the other countries in the sterling area, to control our payments to and receipts from non-sterling area countries.  This control was required to help safeguard the foreign exchange reserves of the sterling area to which we have access for our requirements of foreign currencies.  Foreign exchange has for some years been freely available to Irish residents for all current payments and in February, 1961, we agreed with the International Monetary Fund that we would maintain this position.  Control of capital transfers is however still necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchange control was first operated under emergency legislation which was <Col N="1409" /> replaced in 1954 by the Exchange Control Act.  The Act was expressed to expire on 31 December, 1958, as it was hoped that the need for exchange control would have ceased by that date.  The operation of the Act was however extended in 1958 and again in 1962.</P>
    <P>In general, the 1954 Act contains provisions for the control of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  payments to and payments on behalf of persons resident outside the sterling area;</P>
    <P>(b)  dealings in gold and foreign exchange;</P>
    <P>(c)  dealings in and the export of foreign currency securities and unregistered securities;</P>
    <P>(d)  dealings in sterling area securities on behalf of persons resident outside the area; and</P>
    <P>(e)  the export of currency notes.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that goods may not be exported to a country outside the sterling area unless they are already paid for or are to be paid for within six months and in a prescribed manner. It empowers the Minister for Finance to specify foreign currencies which must be sold to a bank.  It also includes the power to require the compulsory deposit of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities, and to prohibit the importation of such securities, but it has not been found necessary to bring these provisions into operation.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the granting of exemptions by ministerial regulations from compliance with requirements of the Act and for the giving of general or limited permissions in respect of transactions.  These provisions have been operated so that, as I said already, all current transactions are now free and such supervision as is applied to current transactions is directed towards ensuring that they are not used as a cover for unauthorised capital transfers. The day to day administration of the control has been delegated to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>As regards capital transfers applications by emigrants are approved up to <Col N="1410" /> a limit of £5,000 a family.  Other applications are considered on their merits. Persons wishing to make direct or portfolio investments outside the sterling area are not permitted to transfer capital for this purpose at the official rate of exchange.  Investment currency may, however, be purchased for the purpose but of course this currency stands at a substantial premium over the official exchange rates.  Sales of foreign currency securities are permitted, subject to compliance with certain conditions.</P>
    <P>There is no early prospect that sterling will become convertible on capital account.  It is, therefore, necessary that the Act should be retained in full for an additional period in order that transfers of capital to places outside the sterling area may still be controlled and to enable control of current transactions to be re-introduced should this become necessary. It is proposed to extend the Act for a further period of four years.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Fine Gael Party have no objection to the renewal of this Bill.  There are still certain questions I should like to ask the Minister, particularly in the light of his recent return from Washington where he represented this country at a meeting of the International Bank or the International Monetary Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Both institutions. Coming fresh as he does with the various informations from these esoteric centres, I should like him to tell us some of the things I think this Oireachtas ought to know. Heretofore matters relating to international currency fell within the ambit of the gnomes of Zurich, Washington, the City of London, and elsewhere. It appears to me that these matters are now moving out of that exclusive area.  Matters of exchange and the control thereof are becoming instruments of politics.  In that situation, this country, the Republic of Ireland, is <Col N="1411" /><i>nolens volens</i> involved.  I am sure the Minister and the Government to which he belongs have never had any desire to interfere in the international exchange activities of their neighbours, but a situation is rapidly developing in the world in which we are all beginning to feel the economic draught of gradual deterioration in liquidity, with consequential detrimental effects on international trade.  The sinister and unpleasant characteristic of this development is that the average man takes little or no interest in it and does not become aware of it until the effects of its worst possibilities come to impinge on our particular economy.</P>
      <P>I do not profess to be an expert in matters such as international banking, although I suspect there is a good deal of false mystery created around this subject very largely for the purpose of persuading those who hold elected office and therefore are really the delegates of the people that it is none of their concern.  The directors of central banks would sometimes have us believe that we who represent the people and who govern the country, and govern their several countries, should not interest ourselves in such affairs at all, that they are too complicated for simple people and that only those who sit in financial circles are qualified to think&mdash;never mind to talk&mdash;on such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the features that are threatening our daily lives is the diminution in the supply of the currency of international trade.  That currency consists of three elements as I understand it, gold, dollars and sterling.  Gold, for some mysterious reason best understood by the fairies, retains its mystic international standard of value.  It is common knowledge that the only useful purpose for which gold can be used is to fill people's teeth.  Apart from that, it has no known use at all.  Galvanised iron is much better.  Polythene or the plastics will discharge any function of which gold is capable with far greater efficiency, except for this mystical quality that it is regarded as the immutable international standard of value.  Yet all history has taught <Col N="1412" /> us that there was no more grotesque illusion ever foisted upon successive generations of men.  There never has been a time when it was truly important that the value of gold should remain stable that it did not become wildly unstable, carrying into ruin and confusion everybody who believed in it.  Yet it remains the only stable element in the currency of international trade.  In effect, I imagine that today it would be true to say that nearly nine-tenths of the currency of international trade are dollars and sterling.</P>
    <P>What does that situation result in? We are entitled to speak on these things because we are involved. Ordinarily we abstain from comment on the activities of governments in friendly countries because every government has the right to run its own country in its own way.  I accept that right, until the particular operations of other countries severely impinge upon us.  For some reason best known to himself, the President of the French Republic, General de Gaulle, has now decided in order to maintain <i>la gloire de France</i> that it is necessary to kick the posterior of the President of the United States and twist the somewhat moth-eaten tail of the British lion and therefore he converts his considerable holdings of dollars into gold and prophesies&mdash;always by proxy&mdash;the imminent devaluation of sterling.</P>
    <P>General de Gaulle often reminds me of the present Taoiseach and his predecessor. He rarely says rude things in public but he always has a Deputy Corry sitting up in the back benches to yell them on suitable occasions. Officially, the French Government never says these things but, under the rose, we all know what happens.  I want to ask the Minister this question: when he was attending the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and Bank of International Settlement, did it occur to him to ask this question: how long are we going to let this farce carry on?  We all know that the supply of gold does not anywhere approach the needs of international trade; we all know that we must have currency of international acceptability to supplement the gold supplies, to oil the <Col N="1413" /> wheels of international trading if there is not to be a critical world recession. To get the supplement to the available supply of dollars&mdash;given a restoration of equilibrium in the United States balance of payments&mdash;and the supply of sterling&mdash;given the preliminary essential of a restoration of equilibrium in the British balance of payments&mdash;we require some kind of new international monetary unit that will be available to supplement existing sources of supply but we cannot get it without the consent of what I think are called &ldquo;the Ten&rdquo;&mdash;is that not so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>What I do not understand is this&mdash; perhaps the Minister will advance an explanation&mdash;why does not the British Treasury&mdash;and in this matter we are practically part of the British Treasury because we are in the sterling area and the purpose of this Bill is to keep us there and constitute us an integral part of the sterling area&mdash;and the U.S. Federal Reserve announce tomorrow morning that £1 sterling is worth 2.80 dollars US currency and 2.80 dollars in US currency is worth 7s sterling and anyone that does not like that can lump it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that a dollar is worth 7s sterling.  I am obliged to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> Why do they go on to say: &ldquo;As far as the American Federal Reserve are concerned we will buy all the gold that is offered to us at 35 dollars per ounce, payable in green dollar bills but we will sell nobody gold.  If you have not enough gold to fill your teeth with go and fill them with lead or compost or cement.  For every ounce of gold you offer us, whether it be from the Bank of France or the mines of South Africa or Russia, we will pay you 35 dollars in green dollar bills and we will back that with a joint decaration by the Government of the United States and of Great Britain.  You can change those green dollar bills for donkeys, ploughs&mdash;you name it we have it.  There is only one thing we will not sell for a green dollar bill and that is gold&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Does that not resolve the whole problem of liquidity with which the world is at present distracted?  How does it affect the stability of the international exchange resources?  You may say: &ldquo;Oh well, that would be to give the Governments of the United States and of Britain an unlimited licence for inflation and for activity beyond their means.&rdquo;  In the name of Providence, if the Governments of the United States and of Britain choose to go mad, who can stop them?  They could be locked up in a cell made of gold, but if a sovereign government are resolved on their own destruction, injunctions from Zurich or anywhere else will not restrain them.  There is something involved here which is immensely important to public men and it is not today or yesterday I said it.</P>
    <P>I shall not surrender the sovereign authority of this Parliament of which I am a Member to the Chairman of the International Bank, to the Bank of International Settlements or to any other international monetary institution in the world.  If we needed Mr. Black, the first Chairman of the International Bank, we should have called him in long ago and asked him to run our country for us because we were not fit.  If we were not fit to run our country let us face it that we ought to have called in either <Col N="1415" /> Stalin, that bloody rascal&mdash;I used the word &ldquo;bloody&rdquo; in its literal sense&mdash; on the one hand or Hitler, the equally bloody rascal, on the other.  At least they were bloodstained.  They had not got the sanitary and luxurious exterior of the International Bank.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if you are aware of what this Bill is designed to do.  It is to incorporate us anew in the Sterling Area for the purpose of the control of resources for international trade.  That is what I am talking about. I am asking the Minister for Finance if we in the Sterling Area, plus the Dollar Area, are to be held up to ransom by a country which was on the flat of its back and could not pay six-pence for its own salvation 20 short years ago, simply because it has continued this fantastic operation through which it took from the United States hundreds of billions of dollars as a free gift with which it proceeded to buy gold and because it used the free gift it got from the United States to generate the power within France to buy gold out of the cellars of Fort Knox.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are running in circles, tying ourselves in tighter knots.  The Minister will confirm this.  He was warned in Washington that we were approaching a critical situation arising not from what any one of us was doing but <Col N="1416" /> from the growing lack of liquidity in the means of international exchange. We are in the astonishing situation that we are drifting back to precisely the same problems as brought the whole world crashing around our ears in 1929 when we had one man standing at one end of a road hungry for meat and another man standing 100 yards away in his bare feet with a surplus of cattle. The hungry man had thousands of pairs of boots and there were no means of bringing the man with the cattle and without a boot to his foot in contact with the man starving for meat with thousands of boots.  There was no medium of exchange.</P>
    <P>I am simplifying it because when illiquidity grows people start raising barriers to defend their own particular enclaves and the whole system grinds to a standstill.  What appals me is that there is nothing mysterious about it.  If it were purely a question of economics it could be resolved overnight by agreement between the ten executives to whom the Minister referred.  However, it is a purely political situation which coerces the ten to say: &ldquo;We cannot find a solution because one member vetoes the requisite proposal to provide the solution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People may say we have no business in international affairs, that we are not big enough, powerful enough and do not dispose of big battalions.  Maybe we do not but there are certain areas of international affairs to which we do dispose of what can be substantial power and that is the gift of which we are told in the immortal fable about the Chinese Emperor.  He was told by his tailors that they would clothe him in a suit of raiment so exquisite that none but angels could perceive it and they sent him out into the streets naked.  No one dare say &ldquo;I see no clothes on the emperor&rdquo; for fear they would be termed less than angels, until a small child perched on his mother's shoulder said: &ldquo;Mammy, I see no clothes on the emperor&rdquo; and the emperor fled in his nakedness from the streets.</P>
    <P>We have the power to say: &ldquo;At this moment we are beginning to feel the pinch.  The European Economic <Col N="1417" /> Community are beginning to raise barriers in order to protect their domestic market and one of the barriers is a tax of £30 per head on cattle&rdquo;.  That has thrown our whole livestock industry into wild confusion.  It constitutes a threat to the stability of our whole society.  Do not doubt that very similar problems are arising in a vast variety of other countries for the want of liquidity.</P>
    <P>This is the classic case of hunger and abundance being perpetuated by a barrier of gold.  Is it unreasonable that, if there is any Government in this world so reckless as to raise a wall of gold between the hungry and the means to feed them, a small country such as this is should say: &ldquo;There is nothing very much we want except to cross this wall of gold, to build a ladder to enable those of us who are prepared to make the effort to climb and meet one another for no more desperate purpose than to exchange the labour of our hands with our neighbours for the labour of theirs.&rdquo; That is the kind of question this House ought to ask itself.  That is the kind of question an Irish Minister for Finance might, with propriety, ask some of the pundits of international finance in Washington.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember 1928 and 1929 when the Viennese Bank went burst, when the Credit Anstalt Verein of Vienna suspended payments.  Very few people realised the significance of what had happened.  It is perfectly true that it is foolish to be always thinking of the past but it is equally foolish to forget its lessons.  I was standing on the steps of Amiens Street Station when I heard the news that the Archduke of Austria was assassinated in Sarajevo. Nobody knew what that signalled.  I think I was in Killiney when the Viennese Bank went burst.  Nobody dreamt of the disaster of which that was the signal.  I do not know what the collapse of the bank in Beirut means, and I do not know where it is going to end, but it certainly means that some people in the Middle East have got it into their heads that if de Gaulle is buying gold, they also would do well to get their money out of banks <Col N="1418" /> and into gold.  Unless we are all mad are we going to sit here and allow a great man who has stayed on too long in a position of great responsibility in the French Republic to combine with a group of illiterate sheiks of the Persian Gulf and involve us all in an uncontrollable catastrophe?</P>
    <P>I remember the days of 1929, and I think the late Sir Montagu Norman was Governor of the Bank of England. He was preceded by an old gentleman by the name of Lord Cunliffe.  Does the Minister for Finance know that in 1914 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer sent for Lord Cunliffe to ask him what were the gold reserves of the Bank of England and where were they, and that Lord Cunliffe replied he would not tell him what they were or where they were?  Lord Cunliffe secretly shipped those gold reserves to Canada without the knowledge of the British Exchequer.  The attitude in those days was that politicians had no business to inquire, that that was the business of the Bank of England.  To his eternal credit, the late Neville Chamberlain or his uncle, one of the Chamberlains anyway, sacked him and established the authority of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there are any Sir Montagu Normans strutting around today.  This I know, that I lived to see Keynes declared a prophet and the so-called orthodox men who went before him treated as half imbeciles. We are going to see in our time, perhaps, not in mine but certainly in the Minister's, a great many of Professor Keynes' theories go up the spout.  He believed in the grand illusion of controlled inflation, the theory that you can give people nice small doses of heroin and that if they only keep the dosage in control they will have pleasant dreams, the snag being, of course, they never do.  Controlled inflation is much the same, a grand illusion.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister for Finance that, in so far as bankers are available to be used as trained servants of us who represent the people, in so far as economists are there to be used as trained servants of us who <Col N="1419" /> represent the people, they are very useful, but when they begin to labour under the illusion that they know more about governing the country than those of us who devote our lives to it for very much less reward than they are in the habit of accepting, it is time to put them in their place and to tell them that, in our judgment &mdash;and we are people who count&mdash; people are more important than things. That is the lesson we have learned, and very few of them have learned it.  Let us keep the maxim constantly before our minds, that people are more important than things.  Most of the bankers, national and international, and financiers, whether they be practical or theoretical, never knew that simple maxim and those who have heard of it have forgotten or misunderstood it.  They need to be reminded that in a free democratic country it is we, the elected representatives of the people, who must take the final decisions, that they are technicians who are to carry out our orders and if they ever fail, for the want of the will or the capacity, they should be sacked and others found to do it.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear from the Minister for Finance whether that was the line he took at the International Monetary Fund Meeting and, if it was, what answer did he get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is just a continuing Bill, we do not have much to add.  It represents our effort in the Sterling Area to protect the interests of sterling and shows our attitude to foreign currencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about the difficulty in regard to foreign currencies, there is a big problem within sterling.  In London, it appears to be impossible to get any recognition for the Irish £ note.  I should like if a currency that is supposed to be such an integral part of sterling could be recognised in the sister island and embarrassing occasions avoided because at the moment our currency is one that appears to me to be recognised in Cork and Limerick but not to be recognised in <Col N="1420" /> Belfast or London.  Perhaps the Minister might, at least, pass along a few copies of our sterling currency to the British Treasury to inform them as to what it looks like.  It appears to be awkward for ordinary traders.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the travel exchange ceiling that the British Government have imposed lately for travellers outside the area will have any effect on people from our own area travelling outside the sterling area or whether the Minister contemplates any cutting of sterling allowance to our own travellers outside the Sterling Area as a consequence of the British Government's measures in respect of their citizens.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to get the exact provision but I had the impression that in the 1954 Act portfolio investment outside the country was practically excluded whereas I get the impression now that this ban no longer obtains.  I may have misread the original Act.</P>
    <P>I take it that in respect of capital transfers outside the Sterling Area in respect of emigrants, the area we would be referring to in most cases would be the Dollar Area and there is reference to this limit of £5,000 a family and to representations for people who have got emigrant connections in the United States for transfer of capital from the United States to this country.  I should like to know from the Minister to whom these representations can be made and whether the staff now operating under this Exchange Control Act has been increased.  I understand that much of the business under this Act was now managed by banks and solicitors at first hand.  What is their relationship, or do they work very closely with the Central Bank in this connection?</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire also whether any penalties have ever been invoked under this Act in respect of any acts of companies in defiance of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was just inquiring <Col N="1421" /> about penalties.  The original Act sets out in great detail what one may not do.  I was just wondering has any case arisen where a penalty has been invoked against a company or companies who have refused to obey the provisions of the Act or is the Minister or any official in the Department aware of any company or persons going outside the provisions of the Act since its inception?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say at the outset that there is little in the statement made by Deputy Dillon with which I do not agree.  Like many other people who did not have a financing or financial background, I had thought that the world financing problem was a most complicated one.  While I would not like to suggest that it can be reduced to the simple terms as expressed by Deputy Dillon, nevertheless, there is a great deal of fundamental truth in what he said, that international exchange simply means providing the currency to purchase the goods and services generated by the activities of people.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is true that these goods and these services are outstripping the available currency by some six per cent per annum at the present time and if that continues there will, of course, be grave danger of there being brought to real life the picture painted by Deputy Dillon of the man with the boots at one end of the road and the man with the cows at the other end of the road, one not having boots and the other starving.  I did direct my speech at the International Monetary Fund Meeting along these lines.  I will not say that I was as eloquent by any means as Deputy Dillon was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a prepared speech.  I did remark on the fact that the position of the two traditional capital exporting countries, because of the difficulties in which they found themselves balance of payments wise, whether they themselves were responsible or outside sources were responsible, had led the world to the situation <Col N="1422" /> where goods and services capable of being produced by people could not be paid for and that this was affecting the smaller countries, especially the newly emerging nations, the less developed countries, many of them, of course, completely undeveloped but, nevertheless, looking for capital resources to supplement their own and who, of course, could not operate in circumstances like that.  These people are as important as money may have been to the financiers of the world who might be making money which could not be made without people.  Therefore, I impressed on the assembly as well as I could that this is a problem that should be tackled now and solved this year.</P>
      <P>It is true that this Committee of Ten, which consists of the Finance Ministers of what are regarded as the ten financially most important countries in the world and include, as Deputy Dillon says, the United States of America, France, Germany, Canada, Belgium and others, have been meeting on and off but in the meantime they have set up what they call a Committee of Deputies, deputies of the Foreign Ministers of these ten, who have been examining this liquidity problem.  Unfortunately, even after a full year of examination, they have not yet come up with what would appear to be a worthwhile solution. Nevertheless, it has been pressed upon them by smaller countries, including ourselves, that a solution will have to be found quickly, that otherwise the type of chaos that Deputy Dillon has described will descend upon the world.</P>
      <P>With regard to the means of solving the problem, it is generally accepted that as a result of the deliberations of these ten countries it is most likely that a new reserve currency will have to be provided.  As the House is aware, it is the policy of the French Republic to undermine&mdash;perhaps not to undermine but at least to replace&mdash;the £ and the dollar by gold and, I suppose, obviously for that purpose the French Government are buying in gold and selling dollars.  That is causing a difficulty for the United States Government in their balance of payments.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dillon was out of the House just now, I said that basically I agreed with all the Deputy said and that many of us regarded this as such a complex problem that ordinary mortals like ourselves should not even attempt to look at it.  But the more one looks at it, the more one realises that the basic fundamental problems are clouded by issues that could be torn away to get us back to the heart of the problem again.  I do not pretend I know all about it, nor do I think I ever will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there are basic fundamentals that all of us can readily understand.  I have here a copy of the speech I made at the World Bank meeting.  It was published fairly widely in the press.  I did, however, add an off-the-cuff passage along the lines on which I have been just speaking.  I said that the wealthy nations cannot <Col N="1424" /> afford to dilly-dally with this problem any longer because the developing nations will not wait for a solution.  I said a solution will not come if they carry on as they are and that the problem must be resolved in the coming year.  I think it was the ultimate decision of the Assembly, in so far as they can take any decision at all, that before the next annual meeting of the World Bank and its associates, this problem will have to be solved in such a way as to regenerate the availability of money throughout the world so as to generate the economic activity necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary asked me a few specific questions I shall try to answer. The first point was about the cutting of the sterling allowance.  We did not follow the British example on that.  Up to then the sterling allowance&mdash;in other words, the allowance a traveller can take out of the country for ordinary holiday purposes&mdash;was limited to £250. If that person indicated there were special reasons why it should be increased, he was, without great trouble, given permission to take out more in pound.  The British cut it to £50 because of balance of payments problems.  We had to take certain action here in order to ensure that British subjects would not draw more than that through devious methods by reason of their contacts with Ireland and people here.  That was done by way of advice to banks and travel agencies and other people dealing with these matters.  As I said in my opening speech, we made an agreement with the International Monetary Fund some five or six years ago that we would not restrict the flow of currency and therefore, specifically or by implication, would not restrict travel allowances. In order to restrict them, therefore, we would have had at least to consult with, if not get the permission of, the International Monetary Fund.  I doubt if that permission or consent would be given in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, last year the Fund advanced to us a sum of from £5 million to £7 million to help us overcome our balance of payments problem.  It is only for that purpose the <Col N="1425" /> Fund will agree to a country restricting travel allowances and movements of currency in this way.  It is not the intention to seek that permission or consent because in present circumstances I do not think it would be given.  In any event, in present circumstances, I do not think it necessary. Applications for increases in these allowances can be made to any bank or travel agent.  In these matters they work in co-operation with the Central Bank, which, as I have said, operate such matters for the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question about portfolio investments outside the sterling area, this is, of course, permitted but investors must acquire what is known as investment currency.  That is usually available only at a premium of about 20 per cent.  Therefore, the Deputy will readily realise it would want to be a very attractive investment to encourage them to pay this premium. I am not aware whether any punitive or penal action has been taken as a result of breaches of these regulations.  I think it was the case during the period when the Emergency Powers Act was the controlling legislation but since the enactment in 1954 of the permanent legislation, there has not been any necessity to take any specific action.</P>
    <P>These are the questions Deputy O'Leary asked.  Deputy Dillon's question, I think, was confined to one thing: what action had we taken in order to ensure that we, as the elected representatives of the people, are making our voices heard and ensuring that it is our voices are heard in these matters.  The Deputy can be assured as far as I am concerned that I will not in any way undermine the authority of this Parlimaent in any dealings I have with people who are expert in financial affairs.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance that the proper relationship will be maintained by him between the Government of the country and its economic and financial advisers whencever they may come, be it from at home or abroad.  But is an interesting facet &mdash; I fully understand it; I do not complain of it &mdash; that, in answer to Deputy O'Leary's queries about the superficially remarkable distinction between the British limitation of £50 and our limitation of £250, the Minister quite properly said, in effect: &ldquo;When we borrowed from the International Monetary Fund last year, we promised to restrict the allowance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not complain of that.  I am not trying to make the case that our Minister for Finance sold the pass or did anything discreditable or anything he should not have done in the circumstances in which he found himself.  However, it is interesting for Deputies to know that, once the banks at Zurich, Threadneedle Street or anywhere else get their foot in the door, the astonishing fact emerges at once that the sovereign Parliament of Ireland is no longer free to act without consultation not with another Government but with an unrepresentative outside body over which neither we nor others have control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the House this simple question: Do they remember the East Galway by-election?  I remember being greatly criticised for making a speech in Ballinasloe in which I said to the people in the streets of Ballinasloe at night: &ldquo;Remember this: if the balance of payments of this country gets out of control to the point that we have to go to an external financial authority for assistance, on that day the <Col N="1427" /> authority of the sovereign Parliament of Ireland will leave Leinster House and go where the money is.&rdquo;  Fortunately, the sum mentioned by the Minister for Finance is something between £5 million and £7 million. Taking the long view and considering our national income and our annual revenue and our total volume of trade, that is a relatively insignificant sum. Thank God, it is.</P>
    <P>Let every Deputy see the red light shining that, the moment we let our affairs here get into the kind of confusion that imposes on us the necessity of applying to a body like the International Monetary Fund or the Bank of International Settlements for help, the ultimate authority leaves Leinster House.  Do not forget that if we make a treaty with another sovereign power, we deal as equal with equal, as representative Government with representative Government, but if we enter into these kinds of contracts, we make a deed with a body responsible to nobody but suddenly acquiring power over our people through the only instrument the validity of which I recognise, the votes of the Irish people. That is worth remembering.  I have no doubt the significance of that registers on the Minister for Finance as it has registered on me.  I want only to assure him from this side of the House that such measures as he sees fit to take to deliver us from that qualification of our sovereign authority will be sustained certainly by this side of the House and I hope by every Deputy who wants to keep this country free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Realising that we are in Committee and that I may restimulate Deputy Dillon on the question of sovereignty, the Deputy will remember that this House became a part of the Bretton Woods Agreement which set up the International Monetary Fund whose main purpose was to free payments as between countries.  The International Monetary Fund is financed by certain payments in countries' own currencies in proportion to the gross national produce or some other such basis.  It was the sovereign decision of the Irish people, as represented by Dáil <Col N="1428" /> Deputies and Senators, that made us a part of the Bretton Woods Agreement through which we applied for membership of the International Monetary Fund.  In doing that, we are one of 104 free nations of the world who are members and who subscribe to the Bretton Woods Agreement.  We are one of a big majority of that 104 who have taken advantage of the facilities for solving balance of payments problems that the International Monetary Fund provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of immense significance.  The statutory act we took authorised us to subscribe to the Bretton Woods Agreement and, through it, to the International Monetary Fund.  That involved us in no obligation beyond making our contribution. Our obligations began only when we began to borrow.  I quite agree with the Minister for Finance that a vast number of countries find themselves in exactly the same position but there is this fundamental difference. If the United States of America borrowed from the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of International Settlements sought to interfere with the sovereignty of Congress, the United States of America is big enough, is strong enough, and is influential enough to tell the Bank of International Settlements to take a running jump at themselves.  Whatever agreement they made, you know what they would say, namely, in effect: &ldquo;If we owe you money, we will pay it to you.&rdquo;  We are not.  We are not the only borrowers who are in that position. Any small country is in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only because of the immense danger to small countries to pass that kind of power over into the hands of these international banking institutions that I draw the attention of the House to it and not by way of reflection on the Minister for Finance.  It is important to distinguish that what we did by statute and authority of the House was to join the fund.  The decision to borrow was the Government's decision. It would be perfectly true to say that probably four score of countries have borrowed but the vast majority of them are so circumstanced that if the International Monetary Fund began to give <Col N="1429" /> lip, they could tell them to take a running jump at themselves.  A country that is not in a position to do that walks into the danger that it becomes dependent on the resources of such an institution.  Like every other story, there is no crisis now but now is the time to see the potential crisis and not to allow such a crisis to occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (a) provides:</P>
      <P>An election of members of every local authority shall be held in the year 1967 and quinquennially thereafter.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister, I wonder, given any deep thought to this question of quinquennial elections in relation to members of local authorities?  This has been in operation only since 1955 and one wonders if, in all the circumstances, this is the best procedure.  I am speaking now from the point of view of elected members of local authorities and not just as one who has been elected on a number of occasions to a local authority.  Prior to the provision for quinquennial elections, elections were held every three years.  On two occasions, the elections did not take place at the end of the three-year period.  In June, 1953, the life of the local authorities was extended to 1955 and in 1948, there was also an extension because of certain peculiar circumstances.  It seems strange that members of local authorities should be elected for a five-year period when, even though the life span of the Dáil is supposed to be for five years, in actual fact, no Dáil has ever run its full course.  In other countries local representatives are elected every two years.  I doubt if Senators and Congressmen are elected for five years in the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> I raise the matter from the point of view of the continuous change taking place in the balance of population. The Minister may have power to make regulations between now and June, 1967, providing for a change in boundaries, but, as the position is, a candidate for election to Dublin Corporation, who is presently a member of the corporation, if successful at the next election will, as a result of contesting only two elections in a period of 12 years, have represented the people in that particular area for that 12 years.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a candidate for any of the nine municipal areas will be elected to represent a very disproportionate number of the electorate in his particular area.  This has occurred because of the change in the balance of population. May I cite the particular case of the No. I Municipal Area in which candidates elected in 1955 were elected from an approximate electorate of 30,000 but in 1960 the electorate in that area had gone up to over 40,000? Unless there is a change, candidates in the coming elections in that area may well have to go before an electorate of between 45,000 and 50,000.  A councillor is not in receipt of any remuneration; he receives nothing for travelling expenses, the sole exception being members of Dublin Health Authority, to whom travelling expenses are paid, and a councillor is expected, with his colleagues, to look after the interests of a municipal area which is bigger than any Dáil constituency.</P>
    <P>With the growth of tenants' associations, residents' associations, and so on, it appears that some redress is needed.  Local authority representatives who should be immediately responsible in regard to local and other matters should be given the opportunity of reporting back to those they represent more frequently than once in five years.  Possibly the reason why these quinquennial elections were decided upon was partly administrative convenience and partly the reluctance of this House, or of the Minister, from time to time to make provision for local authority candidates to have <Col N="1432" /> access to their electors by means of free postage.</P>
    <P>If this election takes place next June, every candidate, whether he is standing for a corporation, a county council, or town commission, will, if he wishes to have any form of election literature conveyed to the electorate asking for their support, have to bear the cost of the postage, or else have the literature delivered from door to door within the area and this may prove expensive and onerous in cases where the area is large and scattered such as in the No. 1 Municipal Area, or in the No. 5 or No. 7 Municipal Areas.  Such larger areas could impose a handicap on the candidates to the extent that they would not be in a position, having served the people as councillors fairly well over a period, to contact the electorate in order to place their records before them.  Consequently, they are at a very serious disadvantage in contesting the elections.  This is aside from the overall cost.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Minister will say that there would be added cost if elections were held more frequently, but on the other hand, more frequent elections would encourage the Minister and the Government to look at this whole question of the problems facing local government candidates not only in regard to their contesting elections but in regard to endeavouring to carry out their duties.  The Minister, more than anybody else in this House, is in a better position to realise, because of legislation this year, last year and in the previous year, the burdens which fall on the shoulders of local authority representatives who are serving the community, and that these burdens are growing every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, the section does deal with the years but the position may be affected by the fact that these elections take place every five years.  In addition, there is the problem of the candidates who will stand for election in June 1967, as proposed in the Bill.  Many of those who will be elected, and who will have been members of local authorities previously, will find that over a period of 12 years or so they will have been required to go before the electorate on only three occasions.  This appears to me to be a matter which should be looked into.</P>
      <P>This decision to have these elections held quinquennially arose out of the fact that on previous occasions municipal elections were postponed, possibly because they interfere with Dáil elections, or for some other reason, but if these elections are important, and I believe they are, I think the fact that it is proposed to continue to hold them every five years reduces their importance from the point of view of the electorate.  This is the longest period between elections in this country, with the exception of the election of the President who, in many ways, has less responsibility to the individual citizen than a local representative has.  Certainly it is in excess of the period for many elections to public bodies.  I would ask the Minister if he has given this matter any consideration and I have taken the opportunity to raise one or two matters which he might also consider.</P>

It is a reasonable period for members to serve but I do not consider that five years should be the maximum.  More important, however, is that members of local authorities should be elected for a definite, known time, and that at the end of that definite, known period, they should be required to submit themselves for re-election, if they wish to continue in office.  If they do not wish to continue in office, they should be replaced by a <Col N="1434" /> democratic process, and not by co-option.</P>
      <P>I am against this section, just as I was against the Second Reading of the Bill and for the same reason.  I am against this section because the present serving members of local authorities were elected in June of 1960 for a period of five years.  Since then, many of those who were elected at that time have died and their places have been filled by co-option, by people who have not been approved by the electorate. Many members elected in 1960 have retired or resigned from office and their vacancies have also been filled by co-option.  Indeed, the whole pattern and the whole personnel of the local authorities has changed &mdash; I will not say entirely &mdash; considerably since 1960.</P>
      <P>The elections were to be held last year but the general election was held in April, a couple of years, approximately, before its time.  A Bill was then introduced into this House postponing the local elections for a period of a year.  Irrespective of what the Minister for Local Government wishes to say, I want to repeat that the Bill was introduced here, and passed by this House, in the belief, perhaps not stated in so many words, that the local elections would be held this year on the same day as the Presidential election. Despite this, we have this Bill to further postpone those elections until next year.  I say that is undemocratic and a waste of public money.</P>
      <P>There is another very important and serious aspect about postponing those elections further, which is sometimes overlooked.  It is the fact that members of local authorities constitute the electorate for electing the Seanad with, of course, the members of the Dáil and the members of the outgoing Seanad.</P>

I do not think I am doing other than giving my reasons why I consider they should not be postponed.  I wish to put it on record that the local authorities, county councils, borough councils are the electorate for the Seanad.  I say it is very important that nothing should be done which would have the result of electing a Seanad otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of the people.  It might very well be that if those local elections were held this year, we could have an entirely different set of councillors and it could be that the electorate for the Seanad would be changed and changed very considerably.  It is quite on the cards that a Seanad election might be held before June, 1967.  If such an election were held, it would then be held on an out-of-date register, a register of people who quite possibly would not represent the wishes of the people.</P>

      <P>On a technical point, subsection (2) of this section is not very clear to me in one respect.  I am not too clear what is the meaning of &ldquo;after the commencement of this Act&rdquo;.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>The terms of office of members of local authorities current at the commencement of this Act shall stand extended so as to be in accordance with the holding in the year 1967 of the elections of members of local authorities</P>
      <P>We should then scrap the next few words and say:</P>
      <P>and those elections shall be regarded as quinquennial elections.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief. I just want to deal with some of the remarks of Deputy Larkin and Deputy <Col N="1437" /> T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> on the desired length of the life of a council.  Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> complained about the postponement of the elections and the public necessity for them. I should like him to look back to 1960 and see the poll for the whole country in the election of that year.  Speaking for my own area, I find that fewer than 25 per cent voted and here I should like to pay tribute to the Fianna Fáil Party because were it not for their efforts the voting would have been smaller.  I feel that in attracting the right man to serve on a local authority many handicaps may be put in his way.  The public do not respond by coming out to vote for him.  In some cases, were there not loyalty to personal friends many a man would not be on a council today.  I see no case for holding the elections oftener than every five years.  There was a time when they were held every three years. I think that every five years is the ideal time for the election of any local authority.  I also deplore the suggestion of Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> that co-option should be done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I think that prolonging the time between the elections is not generally bad.  I personally do not like elections. None of us likes elections.  From my own point of view, elections mean canvassing and doing extra work. Every representative here and those on local bodies dislike elections because they mean extra work.  There is, however, much to be said for having elections at more frequent intervals. I am speaking about local elections.  I do not agree with Deputy Moore that five years is the optimum.  Five or five plus Dáil election periods work out at five or five minus.  Dáil elections are held more frequently than the period laid down and the tendency is for local elections to be held less frequently. For that reason while the three-year period might be a shade shorter than the three plus, I think if the elections were held in four-year periods or even in five-year periods, at intervals of four, it would be better than the five-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several reasons that would be desirable.  The most important reason from my experience is that &mdash; and I hope I will not be decried as a public representative for saving this &mdash; every public representative deals with local problems.  At an election time when I go around canvassing I find a lot of problems which I did not know existed and which were only brought to my notice while canvassing.  A local canvass brings you into every household where you meet problems that you did <Col N="1439" /> not know existed.  If you go into town every month some of these people would not come out of the house to meet you, but when one goes into the house during a canvass one finds distress problems that were unknown before.  Local elections bring canvassers of the local representative face to face with, perhaps, social problems which he would never know about otherwise, and these are problems which he may be able to rectify.</P>
    <P>My second reason is, I think, a good one.  Very frequently local elections engender an interest in public affairs at local level.  We on all sides agree that the public do not take sufficient interest in political affairs.  We do not know the reason for this, but we do not give them an opportunity of more frequent elections to register their votes.  That can best be done at local election level.</P>
    <P>My third reason in favour of local elections is that if you leave a body too long, as Deputy Fitzpatrick mentions, and if there have been a number of co-options, that body is less representative of public opinion than when originally elected.</P>
    <P>My fourth reason is that with changing political outlook a body elected for seven years may not be representative of public opinion.  That would be my weakest argument because, with the pattern of voting we have, people do not seem to change very much, unfortunately.  These are my reasons but the most important one is that which I mentioned first, that local elections tend to bring candidates and representatives into a degree of contact which no other method does as effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Fine Gael speakers amazes me by reason of the inconsistency they are showing. They made that point the other day and they are now really underlining that today so as to assure us of their inconsistency.  Last year Fine Gael talked only of the postponement of the elections and they had no reservations about extending them to six years. <Col N="1440" /> How can they make this case with all fervour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to straighten out Fine Gael here.  Of course people have been trying to do that for years and have not succeeded. It is true.  Less than 12 months ago no objection to an extension to six years was made and now we listen here for 20 or 25 minutes to arguments that elections should be held every five years.  I do not know of any particular thing that has happened since then that has changed Fine Gael in this matter and it only adds to the inconsistency we see through all the arguments they made on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It may well be that instead of the four nice handy little arguments which the last speaker used and some of those thought up by Deputy Fitzpatrick &mdash; I would imagine he was thinking them up as he went along &mdash; the real reason to emerge is that not only are Fine Gael inconsistent but they are in fact slightly off the beam, slightly off upstairs.  Just one of those arguments makes sense from their point of view, that is, that they are so far off the beam at this moment that they believe that not only should we have local elections but that the electorate for the Seanad is the important element in these local elections and that, as a result of holding them now rather than postponing them, Fine Gael will get a bigger number of votes. It may be a personal matter for Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It may be that he thinks that there may be a general election before next June and feels he may be looking for a seat in the Seanad.  I do not know if this is so.  If it is, it is a rather roundabout way to go about getting it.  Hold local elections in order to get more Fine Gael people for the Seanad in order that if Deputy Fitzpatrick should slip up in the event of a general election and be going back to the Seanad he would have a better chance.  It is a bit involved to believe that and I do not think I even believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the handling of <Col N="1441" /> local affairs but is purely and simply a political matter which no matter how illfounded is this wishful thinking on the Deputy's part would seem to add up to a general election, a Seanad election, and Fine Gael want the local elections held in advance because they believe more voters will support them because there will be more of them beaten in the Dáil election.  This may be their way of thinking but it does not ring true to me as a good argument for not postponing the local elections and not extending the term to seven years and should not adhere to the views being expressed today that never should we have a period longer than five years, considering that the same people, a year ago, implied, by not objecting, that the six year period was all right.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know what Fine Gael want.  This is what bothers me.  What do Fine Gael want at the moment?  Do they want local elections?  If they do want them it would be fair to ask why because they are not at all clear themselves. If they feel, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that last year they allowed this to go through because &mdash; it was never stated, mark you, and is not recorded &mdash; they believed that not only would the local elections be held during 1966 but &mdash; implied in some unknown way &mdash; that the local elections and the Presidential election would be held on the same day.</P>
    <P>I put this counter-argument to Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The law as we have it up to the postponement, indicated that the election would be held in June on a day to be appointed by the Minister for Local Government.  In the present law, which is the one we are talking about, the first postponement, we did not even tie ourselves to June of 1966.  We departed from what was in the law up to that and said:</P>
    <P>The Minister may fix any day up to the 31st December, 1966, on which to hold the election.</P>
    <P>I think it is much more likely that my version of what we did in the House a year ago on the last postponement Bill is the true one rather than Deputy Fitzpatrick's.  It does show that we, in fact, contemplated the holding of these elections possibly even in December of <Col N="1442" /> this year, not in June, never mind to hold them on the actual same day as the Presidential election.  I do not know where Deputy Fitzpatrick got this understanding but it is not recorded nor was it stated.  All the facts concerning the whole situation seem to belie any intention that these two elections should be held on the same day.</P>
    <P>I say to Deputy Fitzpatrick and to those who talk in terms of changes on local councils there have been and there always will be, for various personal and domestic reasons and indeed the death of members, changes on local authorities from year to year.  These changes take place for their own reasons but the change that you get in a local council from the councillors going forward over 20 years is very small.  Ninety per cent of them continue to be returned at the election whether the election is held every five years or every seven years.  This I think is the experience of all local authorities.  People who wish to serve on local authorities and are prepared to give their time to serve on them are continuously, election after election, returned, with very few exceptions. This story about the public not getting the opportunity to radically change the membership of local authorities by postponing them from six to seven years, is not a valid argument either because the facts do not support it.</P>
    <P>I feel that Fine Gael have an exaggerated opinion of how well they would do in any sort of an election at the moment and no blame to them for that. Let them have these notions and hopes in their own minds.  It is probably good and it sustains them in their not-so-good days that they have these notions but to try to translate those notions into causing the House to take certain action that otherwise it does not wish to take, is going a bit too far.  Leave them with their notions and let them have these illusions of how well they will do.  Let them enjoy them while they may and they can enjoy them for another six or nine months as a result of this particular section in this Bill because the disillusionment will come.  As surely as I am standing here the local authorities will see that these are rash thoughts and illusions <Col N="1443" /> and Fine Gael will do no better, whatever about worse, in the next local elections.</P>
    <P>To those people who brought up this little quibble about the drafting of whether you put the word &ldquo;quinquennial&rdquo; or &ldquo;quinquennially&rdquo; as it is in this Bill here is a matter that has been determined by the draftsman.  I respect Deputy Fitzpatrick and his legal qualifications and without reflecting on them in the slightest degree I feel that the man who drafted this is a specialist.  This is his job.  This is the way he gives it to me to meet the certain circumstances and I accept it as being the appropriate wording to give us the particular result that we want in this particular law.  I just say that we accept that and are leaving it stand the way it is.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the manner in which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries last January misled the farmers about future prospects for cattle and sheep and calls on the Government to take urgent steps to protect those engaged in the livestock industry from the immediate disaster that faces them as a result of the serious drop in cattle and sheep prices which has occurred at the same time as the farmers are being asked to pay <Col N="1444" /> increased rates and find their credit restricted.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last week, I was drawing a comparison between the relative merits of the 1955-56 period and the 1965-66 period.  When one has regard to what the Opposition had been doing in 1955-56 &mdash; I am taking the market return for the price of cattle &mdash; one will see that it dropped in the 1955 peak period from 152/- down to 93/- in 1956.  Taking the corresponding period this year and last year, it dropped from 169/- down to 126/-.  The drop in 1956 was 38 per cent and, at the present time, it is only 25 per cent.  Not alone had the Opposition been giving the farmers an exceptionally bad price, they really drove it hard on them because they dropped the price of wheat by 10/- per barrel, whereas last year our Minister increased the price of wheat by 10/- a barrel which gave an opportunity to a number of our farmers this year when we had a good harvest.  They are significant features which show that the Opposition did not really consider what they were doing when putting down this motion.</P>
      <P>We can also see the same thing with regard to the price of lamb on the market at the present time.  The Opposition cribbed that the Minister was not doing enough for lambs this year but it must be remembered that the price of lamb is exactly the same on the Dublin market at the present time as it was this time last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It is through our Minister's intercession that we have <Col N="1445" /> the English market in lambs at the present time.  It is guaranteed up to 5,500 tons.  Not alone have we got that, but the Minister has seen fit to announce that the Government will back whatever is exported over and above the 5,500 tons of lamb into the English market.</P>
      <P>Getting back to cattle&mdash;to show where we have been backed on the livestock markets&mdash;we have been guaranteed 25,000 tons on the British market and our Government are backing the British figures to our Irish factories, so that they are competing at the same rate as the other two people exporting abroad.  When one examines this, it must be realised that the Minister&mdash;when he saw the price of cattle was falling so drastically on the Irish market in August&mdash;instead of sitting tight, went to the Government and got the Minister for Finance and his colleagues to agree to pay a subsidy on the comparable price in England.  Never before had anything like that been done.  As I have pointed out, when the Opposition were in power, they let it ride, let the farmer suffer the consequences and made it harder for him by dropping the price of wheat as well, whereas we hope to have the amount of money it will cost to supplement this export of beef and live beef on to the English market.  We will see, with each succeeding week, how it is mounting up.</P>
      <P>When you have a recession in the general market, you always have a downward trend in the cattle trade because if people have their wages cut back through short time and they have commitments like electricity, possibly hire purchase on television, cars and other fixed commitments, such as rent and rates, the only thing they can do is to reduce on foodstuffs and go for cheaper cuts.  That is what has been happening.  I saw a television interview recently with a housewife who said that, with the lowering of the wage packet, she would have to go for cheaper cuts of meat.  That has been one of the factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also remember that the Minister was told yesterday, when he was in London, that what was suffered by the English farmers in regard to stores was much greater than what <Col N="1446" /> was suffered here.  There are great fluctuations in some of the English prices, to the extent of 50/- a cwt., between the different markets.  The market has been depressed to a certain extent when it was overloaded or over-supplied. A difference of 50/- is considerable.</P>
    <P>We were told that the number of stores going into the English market in September, 1965, was something like 40,000.  This year it dropped to 20,000. The reason for the sudden drop was that they went over completely to beef cattle.  But for the agreement to pay the subsidy, it would be hard to think what would have happened to our cattle trade.  The figure for live beef exports in September, 1965, was 7,000. That has gone up to 20,000 now, which shows that the subsidy and the support payments that the Government have been giving have been having their effect.  If you go into a factory and leave your cattle there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They certainly will: I have never seen one refused yet.  That is my own experience.  They do their best to take all the cattle they can. They are working at full capacity.  I have seen the three factories in my constituency and they are working at full capacity, and are doing a really worthwhile job for the Irish farmer. The farmers themselves have seen the value of the subsidy on cattle going into factories, and the benefit of these support payments which the Government have been giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to learn from the Minister that the very useful trade we had some years ago&mdash;the boneless beef trade with the United States&mdash;has been opened up again.  Since 1st October of this year, 3,000 tons of this meat have been exported to the United States at a value of approximately £1 million. The Department and the Minister must take a certain amount of credit for this market, because it was due to their intervention that it has been re-opened.  It is a really sizeable and worthwhile market.  The Minister has been prepared to travel to Europe to <Col N="1447" /> try to find markets wherever possible. We have seen the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The cattle trade is a completely private enterprise, but when private enterprise fell down, the Minister stepped in and got markets for them.  We can expect more markets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has arranged for 8,400 of them to be sold in Egypt, and it is reasonable to expect that, with our trade delegation, and with a bit of luck, we will have a chance of getting some more outlets for our young cattle.  That will strengthen the trade.  Last year the Egyptian trade steadied the markets, particularly in the South.  Where would we be if the same thing had happened to us as happened to the English trade in relation to the EEC? It would have been very serious for us but for the Free Trade Agreement and the guarantee of right of entry for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the Minister's statement about 2,000 head of cattle going into Europe, the really significant factor <Col N="1448" /> is that he has broken down the barrier against imports of any beef except from EEC countries.  He was able to get this amount into Germany. If they like our cattle, and if things work out right, we may be able to get more in.  At least the barrier is broken down.  We must remember also that that hit the English farmers because they used to sell heavy beef on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I have always known that it takes more than one factor to upset the cattle market.  It takes quite a number of other things to bring down the price of cattle.  It is such a big market that there must be quite a number of factors before it is downgraded to the point where it has an effect on us.  The Minister and his Department have done an amount of work this year in order to help the farmers to bring up their incomes.  There was the 10/- per barrel increase for wheat.  There was the guarantee in relation to barley.  There was the ratification of the Free Trade Area Agreement in July.  There were the support payments in May which were quite a sizeable sum for the dairy farmers in particular.</P>
    <P>When the price of cattle became depressed, the Minister went out of his way and did everything possible to try to get export markets abroad.  One every sizeable market was the one I mentioned, the boneless beef trade on the American market.  Great credit is due to him because of the fact that he has been able to get the support of his colleagues in giving this amount of money to support live beef exports. This was never done in the history of this country, not even when we had a drop of 38 per cent.  Never before has any Minister dared go to his Cabinet and ask for price support.</P>

      <P>Seeing that Deputy Crinion had the last sentence so carefully written out, may I congratulate him on having read it so well?</P>
      <P>In the limited time available to us in a debate of this character, I do not want to go into the history of what has brought about this catastrophe with which we are now faced but if anybody wants to read that story, he will find it in volume 223 of the Official Report of July 8th, 1966, at columns 2461 to 2467.  I ask Deputies to note the date.  I then warned them of what was about to happen.  I said that catastrophe was upon us and that nothing but the most vigorous action then would save the most vulnerable element in our farming community from a catastrophe greater than anything we had seen during the Economic War.  Bearing that date of July 6th in mind, I now ask Deputies to turn to 12th October, 1966, when the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Haughey, spoke on this motion.  Today we had the valiant Deputy Crinion coming battering in telling us that the Minister was a young Lochinvar and had performed prodigies of foresight and resource.  I ask Deputies to look at column 1151 of volume 224 of 12th October, 1966. Deputy Haughey, Minister for Agriculture, said that the present unfortunate decline in prices was not anticipated by anyone.  The report continues:</P>
      <P>I admit it was not anticipated by me.  I admit that in May of this year I had no indication at all that this situation would develop, and neither had anybody else. Neither had anybody in the Fine Gael Party.  Neither had anybody in the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Mr. Clinton: It was the Minister's job to have it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey: No later than June of this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. L'Estrange: The Minister told the farmers they would get £7 more and they are getting £20 less now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Haughey: &mdash;&mdash;We were receiving inquiries to ascertain that we would be in a position to supply the numbers we had contracted <Col N="1450" /> for in the Free Trade Area Agreement because some authorities in the United Kingdom were at that time worried about the supply position and were anxious that we should be in a position to meet our undertakings.  In June of this year, therefore, there was no indication whatever that this situation was about to develop.</P>
    <P>I have been Minister for Agriculture and I know the Department pretty well.  I know the resources the Minister has at his disposal.  They are incomparable in any Department of Agriculture in the world.  They were not at my disposal.  On 8th July, the Minister for Agriculture said he had no notice whatever and I said in this House:</P>
    <P>I want to sound a note of warning to Deputy Moore&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I was speaking ironically as Deputy Moore represents a Dublin constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>who has kindly come in to join us, to Deputy Geoghegan from Carna who is here vigilantly watching the interests of the Gaeltacht ... of a very serious development in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I pointed out how Deputy Paddy Smith with the best intentions had started the heifer scheme and how I had said that we would be faced with the most unprecedented collapse in the price of cattle that this country had ever seen and that urgent measures must be taken then.  I warned that this was creating an acute problem in the congested areas of Ireland.  I said:</P>
    <P>We are now joined by Deputy O'Connor from Kerry ... I think Deputy O'Connor will confirm what I say.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Connor: I do not agree.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Has the price of young cattle not gone back?</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Connor: Not cattle in forward condition.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I said that strong forward cattle are fairly good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> Mr. O'Connor: At 12 months and 18 months.  Advanced cattle are at the highest price they ever reached.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Do not let us quarrel. Deputy O'Connor will tell us what he knows; we will tell what we know.</P>
    <P>I want the House to listen for a moment and wake up to the plain, inescapable facts that are in front of us. It is not enough for Deputy Crinion to tell us that fat lambs on 12th October made 147/6 in the Dublin market.  This day 12 months, they made 150/- and this day two years, they were worth 173/-, 26/- a head more than they are worth today.  Deputy Crinion always looks like an innocent but he is not as big a &ldquo;gom&rdquo; as he likes to pretend he is.  He knows as well as I do that a large part of the lamb trade in this country is the store lamb trade: the fat lamb trade is a relatively specialised trade.  I doubt if I exaggerate when I say that the price of store lambs is down by 30/- a head.  Am I exaggerating if I say that the price of horny ewes off the Connemara mountains is in the order of 25/- a head?</P>

      <P>I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that they are on offer at 25/- a head.  I know a man who offered them and could not get 25/- for them.  Am I exaggerating if I say that Galway sheep are down from £1 to 30/- compared with what they were last year?  I know I am not exaggerating because I am speaking from personal experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stood in the fair of Ballaghaderreen last Monday week and I sold there a black Aberdeen Angus Shorthorn cross heifer for £47.  A conservative valuation for the same heifer this day 12 months would be £65.  I got £47 after a fight that 40 could take part in, and I did not get paid until half-past one because the man did not mark her until one o'clock, although I had been selling her since eight o'clock in the morning.  She was a suckled calf.  I sold her twin, a bullock, for £53 at the same hour after <Col N="1452" /> standing in the fair for 4½ hours.  I would have had men running after me offering me £70 for him a year ago and I would not have sold him for less than £72.  I have a Parliamentary salary and a Ministerial pension to go home to.  I have a shop to go home to and selling a couple bullocks off my farm, which is only 50 acres, will not make or break me, but coming from that fair I passed neighbours who were born and reared and are today rearing families on farms of ten, 15 or 20 acres, and I assure the Minister that I saw them standing there with cattle of less than one year of age.  They were not what you would call forward cattle: they were average cattle off poorish land.  It was not a question of getting a bad price; it was a question of not getting anyone to bid for them.</P>
    <P>I saw a woman go to a fair at Frenchpark&mdash;ask Deputy Dr. Gibbons &mdash;to get the money to pay her rates. She brought a cow to the fair.  I do not know how much she got for the cow but when she had paid her rates, all she had left was 50/-.  This day 12 months I sold suck calves for between £20 and £25 a piece.  A good whitehead at the time was going £26.  I assure the Minister that those calves are worth between £5 and £12 for a choice one today.</P>
    <P>I am not exaggerating.  I am speaking from my own experience when I say that a yearling, a calf which has not shown a permanent tooth, this day 12 months was selling at £30 to £40. The price of the same beast is anything from £17 to £30, and hard to find a buyer.  I am not here to lambast the Minister for Agriculture.  I was Minister for Agriculture for a long time and if things have not greatly changed, whether one was born in the city of Dublin or in County Mayo or County Monaghan, one is not long in contact with one's responsibilities in that Department without beginning to bear compassion for the people who live on the land.  I know the endless strife and struggle the Minister has to get something extra for the farmers and damn little thanks he gets for it.</P>
    <P>I am not making the case to the House, I do not attempt to make it, <Col N="1453" /> that the Minister for Agriculture is indifferent and callous, but I do make the case that he has proved himself egregiously lacking in foresight and I charge against him to his face if he were concerned to promote the interests of the small farmers, he would be doing a much better job by stopping this galloping around the country to parties and publicity stunts.</P>
    <P>The Minister may find the burden of his Department a heavy and a thankless one.  It has been that for anybody who ever took it on.  There is relatively little glamour about it: it is all hard work and damn little thanks for it.  However, it is work in which a man may take a pride, work through which he feels he will leave something after him.  Above all, he will feel he is working for one of the most defenceless elements in the community, the small farmers.  This is not to say that I do not sympathise with my colleagues Deputies Farrelly, Sweetman, Hogan of South Tipperary who represent the wealthier farmers in the country.  I sympathise with them because I know men in Limerick and in Cork, in areas east of the Shannon, who suffered heavy losses this year, who kept cattle who were nothing but guests on their lands and not even paying guests during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is a hard thing.  I shall be quite frank about it.  A man who has sustained a loss this year keeping 200 cattle and getting nothing for them can, however, go down the country to replace them, paying very little for the replacements, and if he loses this year, he will get it back next year.  I do not think the Minister understands the other side, the problem that hits me and other representatives of the congested areas.  I have spoken about farmers north of the Boyne and west of the Shannon.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture understands the despair, the absolute desolation that strikes those farmers when they bring out their yearlings, offer them for sale and cannot find a buyer at any price.</P>
    <P>One may speak to a young fellow contemplating emigration to Manchester or Birmingham.  One may ask <Col N="1454" /> him has not his father got a good holding of 40 or 50 acres.  He will laugh in one's face and say: &ldquo;Do you think I want to stand from 8 o'clock in the morning until 2 p.m. at a fair in Ballaghaderreen with my hat in my hand to everybody who passes up the road and who will not even speak to me?  Do you think it is a pleasure on the way home to find the neighbours leaning over their gates saying how sorry they are that I am bringing my cattle home again?  I would sooner work in the tunnels.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a heartbreaking experience. However, it is useless our coming in here to tear strips off the Minister. That is too easy.  We all agree there is a crisis and what people want to know is what are we to do to meet it.  I shall tell the Minister what he should do and if I were Minister for Agriculture in the morning, I should do it or resign.  I always say it is foolish to look backwards except when one looks back to learn.  I spoke on matters of finance today and my mind went back to 1929, 1930 and 1931, which I remember vividly.</P>
    <P>I was in America when I was a boy and at that time there was full employment. When I went back, I saw men standing on the street corners in New York saying: &ldquo;Brother, can you spare a dime&rdquo;?  I saw a great nation brought to its knees, an atmosphere of black despair spreading all over the country with the fearful tragedy of the banks closing.  It was the practice then to put savings in small local banks.  Then Roosevelt was elected.  Mind you, Hoover was no fool: he was an able man but he was &ldquo;a lame duck&rdquo;, and there were the three awful months from November to March when Hoover was &ldquo;a lame duck&rdquo; and Roosevelt was too cute to do much about it.  He wanted Hoover's memory to stink in the nostrils of all Americans.  I never forgave him for that.  However, when Roosevelt came in, he grasped the nettle and saw the root, but he promptly closed every bank, big and little, for a week.  He said: &ldquo;Stop, boys; let us get our breaths.  We have nothing to fear but fear itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now there is panic spreading among <Col N="1455" /> the small farmers of this country.  We must arrest this panic and there is only one way to do it; that is to convince them that we have the power and the will.  If I were Minister for Agriculture tomorrow, I would insist that every acre of land in the possession of the Land Commission would be placed at my disposal for conacre.  I would insist on being given authority to take as much conacre as I deemed it expedient to take, and I would insist on co-operation from every institution associated with the Department, including the Faculty of Agriculture in the University and the Agricultural Institute.  I would mobilise all our resources and send out the buyers of the Department of Agriculture to every fair in the north, the north-west and the west of Ireland to buy up all the cattle that had as yet no permanent teeth at £8 per cwt.</P>
    <P>That is the only way you will stop it.  If you do that now, you will restore confidence.  People will believe the Minister when he says: &ldquo;Hold on; there are better times coming&rdquo;.  The Minister was furious with Telefís Éireann when they ventured to publish a statement by the leader of the NFA that the NFA doubted the Minister in advocating that small farmers should hold on.  He said: &ldquo;So solemn was my advice, so great was my position and prestige, I felt justified in saying to Telefís Éireann: `Take any qualification of my recommendation off the air. You are helping to demoralise the people' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Very well.  If what the Minister said was true, let him prove it.  Let him go out and buy the cattle.  He cannot lose. He said himself that every small farmer with ten, 15 or 20 acres should hold them and things would come right.  If the Minister loses 10/- or even £1 a head in buying 500,000 of them, it is less than could be lost in the Potez aeroplane factory and he would restore confidence in every small holding.  For all we know, if the Minister's prognostications come true, he might not have to buy any cattle at all.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the Minister's difficulty, and I do not want to ask him to do the impossible, but I <Col N="1456" /> ask him to believe with me that it was not necessary for Roosevelt to close all the banks in the United States.  He could have let all the weak ones go to the wall and the more of them that went to the wall, the stronger the strong ones became.  He knew that. What he wanted to do was to restore confidence, to get the people facing the right way again.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Minister that this is one of the most revolutionary moments in the history of rural Ireland. He could start, and he is in great danger of starting, an exodus from the land.  I know the Minister's difficulties.  He was reared in and around Dublin, and it is intensely difficult for a man who was born and reared in and around Dublin to understand what farming in the west of Ireland, in Monaghan, Cavan or Donegal means.  I want him to understand that if those people suddenly became persuaded that it never can work, the whole area will become denuded and they will abandon the land.  That would be a fearful catastrophe for our people and for the country.</P>
    <P>Some people here will say: &ldquo;Were things not just as bad during the Economic War?&rdquo; They were, but there was this difference: we sold cattle during the Economic War for much less than what they are selling at now, but there was always a feeling at the back of your head that if this old gentleman would only get sense, go to London and do what we told him to do three years ago, the whole business would be over.  Ultimately he did, and the nightmare was over.  We knew the cause of it and we knew that all that was necessary was a political decision and the whole horror was over.  What is wrong now is that the people are beginning to wonder has the whole livestock trade collapsed.  I cannot answer that.  I do not know.  If you had asked me 12 months ago was it possible for any political authority in this country to destroy the livestock trade, I would have said: &ldquo;No.  The 1948 Trade Agreement hitched us firmly to the guaranteed price in Great Britain and nobody can break us.&rdquo;<Col N="1457" /> The astonishing thing is the present Government seem to have done it and by a series, I think, of fallacious decisions and misfortunes for which they were not entirely responsible, with special reference to the adverse weather conditions last year.</P>
    <P>The Government can retrieve in some measure the disaster which has come upon us, but it requires courage, imagination and resolution, and they can do not only that useful service but they can do more.  They can restore to the minds of our farmers the knowledge as well as the belief that the Department of Agriculture is their Department, that the Department of Agriculture is their servant, and once that is achieved, he could open a whole vista for the pilot schemes and the parish plan, and create new confidence and hope among the small farmers related to practical reality and not to fantasy and dreams.</P>
    <P>A great old bishop of this country compared the destitution of our people as my father, Lord have mercy on him, looked down upon them in the Square of Ennis in 1881, with the prosperity that had dawned upon them when I looked on them in 1951, and he said to me: &ldquo;What do you think brought that change?&rdquo; And I said: &ldquo;My lord, I think it was the Land League and the shorthorn cow.&rdquo; If I had to answer him today, I do not know what I would answer, but tomorrow I would like to add: &ldquo;The Department of Agriculture, whoever the Minister may be.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The reason this motion is here for discussion is the severe drop in cattle and sheep prices which has taken place in a comparatively short space of time.  We know that farmers, and particularly small farmers, who listened to the prophecy of the Minister for Agriculture when he spoke in this House in relation to the Free Trade Agreement thought that when this Agreement was in operation, they could look forward to an increase in the price of their cattle of anything from £5 to £7 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is in the names of some 21 Fine Gael Members of this House. <Col N="1458" /> When the Minister was getting the Free Trade Agreement through the House, he relied mainly on the benefits which he said, and which Government spokesmen said, would accrue to the agricultural community.  The Labour Party are the only Party in this House who opposed the Free Trade Agreement, and it is quite obvious to us, as I am sure it will be to the small farmers whose representatives are still plodding their way to Dublin, that Fine Gael are engaging in political expediency, because they were just as misled as the small farmers who believed the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the price of cattle will go up from £5 to £7.  In fact, the price of cattle has gone down anything from £10 to £20.  As one standing up to speak immediately after my friend, Deputy Dillon, I shall not attempt to describe the plight of small farmers in present circumstances.  Deputy Dillon has described it most eloquently and I do not think there is anything I could add except to say that we in the Labour Party truly appreciate the unfortunate position that these small farmers find themselves in as a result of believing the statements made by the Minister during the course of the debate on the Free Trade Agreement.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday evening, in the debate on this motion, the Minister said that there were many factors which contributed to the adverse effects on the cattle trade and he said that they were factors which it was not possible for him to foresee and which it would not be possible for anyone else to foresee.  He quoted the very severe autumn.  He said that one of the factors that contributed to the fall in prices was the seamen's strike in Britain.  He went further and said&mdash;I quote from Volume 224, column 1147 of the Official Report of 12th October, 1966:</P>
      <P>The coming into force of the higher common agricultural policy prices in April of this year dealt this valuable and important trade of ours a very severe blow indeed and, as I say, probably more than any of the other factors I have mentioned was instrumental in contributing to the very severe weakening of cattle prices which took place here from June onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> The Minister attributes most of the blame for the severe fall in cattle prices to the EEC regulation which came into operation in April of this year. Yet, in May and June of this year, the Minister again stated in this House that the farmers could look forward to a very substantial increase in the price of cattle once the Free Trade Agreement came into operation in July.  Can the Minister explain how he could state in May and June that the farmers could look forward to a very substantial increase of from £5 to £7 in the price of cattle when an action had been taken in April, one to two months previously, by the EEC countries which he now claims, as I have just quoted, was mainly responsible for the fall in cattle prices?  That is something that I find it very difficult to understand. The House and the farmers are entitled to an explanation from the Minister, who is directly responsible.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned a very important matter last week, not in this House but outside the House.  He referred to the establishment of a meat marketing board. A great deal could be done to expand exports of dead meat.  For every obvious reasons, it is far more desirable that we should concentrate on the expansion of the dead meat trade rather than on exports of live animals.  Exports of livestock are important for purposes of the balance of payments but there are other aspects of our economy which can be catered for to a larger extent by an expansion of the dead meat industry. For instance, the employment content of exports of live animals is practically nil whereas exports of dead meat affect directly butchers, butchers' porters, loaders, transport workers, persons engaged in the skin and hide <Col N="1461" /> industry, and persons engaged in industries associated with offal, and so on.  There are so many that it would be impossible to think of all of them offhand.  This is an aspect of exports that has been somewhat neglected by the Department.  I do not think it has been wilfully neglected but the Minister is inclined to see difficulties as being insurmountable when, in fact, they are not insurmountable.</P>
      <P>I asked a supplementary question last week arising out of the Minister's reply to a question put down by Deputy L'Estrange with regard to the shipping of live sheep to eastern countries.  I asked the Minister had any effort been made to establish a market for dead meat in these countries.  Apart from the very desirable employment that would arise from dead meat exports, there is the question of the considerable unrest that exists with regard to the conditions associated with the export of live animals to these countries.  The conditions may be very warm and the facilities available on board ship may not be the best.</P>
      <P>The Minister countered that there were insurmountable difficulties in regard to religion.  I know there are difficulties in handling food, particularly meat, to meet with religious requirements.  But I remember the occasion when the Jewish community in this country made a gift of food to Israel shortly after the establishment of that State.  In order to carry out that, they brought rabbis from various European countries, who supervised the killing and dressing of this meat.  I believe there could be a substantial market in these countries for meat in various forms.  It need not necessarily be carcase meat; it could be tinned meat.  The Minister could be usefully employed looking further into the question of the dead meat trade to some of these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on the announcement that 2,000 cattle are to be exported to Germany.  I think it is only fair to say that this came as a bitter disappointment to the small farmers because of the build-up given to it by the Minister in the previous <Col N="1462" /> two or three days.  He led the people to expect an announcement which, if it did not cure their ills, would at least give them some relief.  The Minister is an intelligent man.  He must know that the export of 2,000 cattle to Germany or anywhere else is not much consolation or help to the small farmers who find themselves in the position that they must sell at this point.  I am not so concerned about the people to whom Deputy Dillon referred, those who can hold out or those who can sell without its meaning disaster for them.  I am talking about those who cannot hold out, who must have money now.  I am concerned with those who, irrespective of what price they will get for these cattle, must let them go.  These are the people to whom the Minister gave false hope last week when he made, with such a fanfare, the announcement that 2,000 cattle were to be exported to Germany.  It does not give us in the Labour Party any consolation to say now &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;, but the fact is that we did tell you.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I should like to say a few things in relation to this motion put down in the names of 21 Fine Gael Deputies.  Let us be fair and say at the start that there has been a recession in beef prices and that this must have its effect on the cattle trade.  But the purpose of this motion is to prove here what the Minister did wrong.  In the few minutes left that is what I intend to do. I intend to say what the Minister did he should not have done and what he did not do he should have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, quite a while ago, not so long after he became Minister for Agriculture, it was well known in cattle circles here and in Britain that we were sending store cattle to Britain whose TB records were not standing up to the tests made here.  We know what happened afterwards.  Certain people were found to have indulged in the nefarious practice of associating with those very few veterinary surgeons who were prepared to <Col N="1463" /> give certificates when the cattle were not in fact clear of TB.  Those people should have been locked up, and it was the job of the Minister to see that they were.  I was in Chester at that time with a well-known cattle exporter from this country.  An importer from England could tell us at that time that Irish store cattle were becoming unpopular.  I came back and placed that information at the disposal of the Minister's Department.  It was the Minister's job to see that that practice stopped but he did not do it.  That is the first reason why he was wrong.</P>
    <P>The second is this.  When the Free Trade Agreement was passed by this House he talked <i>ad nauseam</i> about the advantages in relation to the selling of fat cattle; that we were suddenly going to get certain premiums on small amounts of beef we had not got before. He said the Government would make good the deficiency on any extra beef sent and pay the subsidy.  Is the Minister aware that last week in Scotland, as reported there in a farming paper, it was proposed at a meeting of the Farmers' Union that Irish store cattle be boycotted because we were competing with the traditional beef trade in Scotland for the Scottish farmer? That is a matter of bad public relations. The Minister is the man who prides himself on his public relations and more than anybody else indulges in public relations.  He flies from Germany to Spain, from God-knows-where to God-knows-where else, and 90 per cent of that is in the interest of building up the image of Deputy Charlie Haughey.  Let us remember that even last week, when he announced his meagre 2,000 cattle to Germany and left here for the airport, he forgot to tell the House he was on his way to Spain and had to send word back to the Press Gallery.</P>
    <P>Let us also remember that at the time he became Minister for Agriculture his predecessor had just instituted the heifer scheme.  We in Fine Gael had been adumbrating a heifer meat subsidy for three years.  Our plan was completely different from that produced by the Minister's predecessor. <Col N="1464" /> The Minister arrived at the start of that scheme and was enthusiastically laudatory of it.  The Estimate of the Department was that in the first year there would be an expenditure of £300,000 but there was spent £1,900,000, because the scheme was badly constructed.  All the adventurers who had the money, all the very large farmers who wanted to get in on the £15 per head, went straight into heifers, which they would not ordinarily have done, got their once-and-once-only grant of £15 per cow and got out again.</P>
    <P>The result was, because the Minister made no provision for the purchase of the stock cattle from the traditional supply areas in the West, there has been nobody there to buy them.  The men in the east who have gone across to this scheme&mdash;I am one of them myself&mdash;no longer go to Tuam or to the fairs of the West and no longer are there as good customers.  Let us remember that this was done by the Minister. These people were fooled once and once only and they are coming out. What is the proof?  If the Minister looks at the June figures in front of him now, he will find that there are 33,000 fewer heifers in calf in this country as compared with the same period last year, representing a drop of 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the Fine Gael scheme of a smaller subsidy on all heifers, whether or not there was an increase, had been put into operation, there would have been a gradual increase in cattle numbers; there would have been a gradual increase in fertility by the application of fertilisers.  That could have produced the cattle trade as we know it, in expansion. It could have produced the trade for the cattle in the west of Ireland that was traditional there.  The trouble is that the Minister never sat with his father in Tuam or in Athenry; the Minister was never given two cheques and told to go out and to buy two cattle and that when he came back, he would be told whether he had paid too much or too little for them. These are experiences which the Minister lacks.  These are the reasons he has failed and failed dismally, no matter <Col N="1465" /> how well he can put himself across in the modern field of public relations.  I have instanced one particular facet of that, in which his over-enthusiasm to advertise himself resulted in grave material loss for the Irish farmer.  Let us remember, also, that he is the man, who, when there are farmers marching to Dublin from every county in Ireland spent the colossal amount that was spent on a one-quarter page advertisement in every national paper in this country to prove that he is giving millions to agriculture in this country.</P>
    <P>Let me say, in conclusion&mdash;I have only two minutes left&mdash;that the position is that every major industry in this country is now involved in Government expenditure.  Industry and Commerce is involved in it; Agriculture is involved in it; the very tariff system in industry is involved in it.  Health, Social Welfare&mdash;you can count up these millions if you like but they are not benefits that are going to citizens.  They are the necessary spending by the Government of the citizens' money that is gathered in taxes, rates and rents. They represent expenditures that are necessary but they are not free burses or subsidies for the citizen.  It proves only that more and more each day and more and more each year there is Government interference in the affairs of the State, in the affairs of the citizen and in the major industries.  You cannot charge up £54 million to the farmers as they are marching to Dublin because they have not even enough income to subsist upon and get away with it.  The Minister's public relations have failed.  He has failed in his knowledge of agriculture.  His manner of guiding and protecting agriculture demands, as I said 12 months ago, that he should resign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time left at my disposal, it remains for me to sum up some points in this motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party.  We condemn the manner in which the Minister for Agriculture has misled the farmers about the future prospects for cattle and sheep.  We ask the Government to take urgent steps to protect those in the livestock industry from the disaster which faces them.  This is the second <Col N="1466" /> occasion in the space of a few months on which the Minister has found himself faced with an agricultural crisis. This is the second occasion that we in the Fine Gael Party have had to table a motion to force him to take action. This is the second occasion the farmers of this country have had to leave their homesteads to protest and to demand their rights at the seat of power here in Dublin.  This is a terrible state of affairs.  I will go so far as to say that the present crisis is another milestone, if not the final milestone, on the road to the total extinction of the small farmers in this country.  Earlier this year, the Minister mishandled the milk dispute.  He has now, in the present cattle crisis, given a very striking demonstration of his total lack of understanding of the economic and social problems of our major national industry.</P>
      <P>There need have been no picketing of Leinster House last May, nor need the farmers of Ireland be marching to Leinster House now if the Minister for Agriculture had taken the action which it was obvious should be taken and taken it in time and if the Minister had heeded the advice and the representations by representatives of the farmers' organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech here on Wednesday last, the Minister went to some extremes to find excuses for the present problem.  He referred to the closure of the EEC market.  He referred to the financial difficulties in Britain.  He referred to the shipping strike and to other factors.  He was very careful to omit to refer to the facts of the situation.  The facts mentioned by the Minister were undoubtedly contributory to the present situation but he omitted to mention the £15 headage grant which succeeded in increasing the cattle numbers in this country and I am very proud that I opposed it vigorously in this House.  He took steps to bring about an increase in the cattle population and, at the same time, took no steps whatsoever to rationalise the marketing of our livestock.  For the past three or four years, time and time again, demands have been made for the establishment of a meat marketing <Col N="1467" /> board.  The Minister ignored those calls and now, when the gun has been put to his head, he announces that he will establish a meat marketing board.</P>
    <P>Another failure on the part of the Minister was that, in negotiating the Free Trade Agreement some months ago, he did not bargain and try to insist on some clause being built into that agreement which would link our cattle prices with those obtained by the British farmer.  There should have been some built-in safeguard.  The points made by Deputy Clinton in opening this debate and the points made by other speakers can be summed up by saying that it was bad management on the part of the Minister, it was lack of foresight, it was failure to appreciate the situation that was developing.</P>
    <P>I submit that, long ago, when this present situation became apparent, the Minister should have taken the steps which, panic-stricken, he has been taking for the past week.  The Minister should have sought a meeting three months ago with his counterpart in Britain and endeavoured to secure markets instead of having to go around now with his cap in his hand.  The only result so far, which he announced here last Wednesday, is 2,000 cattle to Germany, a completely ridiculous figure in the present situation.  It will not alleviate the plight of the farmers in any way.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the factors which, in his opinion, led to the present situation and, having made his historic announcement that he had secured a market for 2,000 cattle in Germany, went on to refer to certain short-term measures.  Two or three weeks ago at Question Time, I asked the Minister a question, which has now become known as the famous question: would he advise the farmers to hold on to their stock, or not, and he advised them to hold on.  He said that there were adequate credit facilities available. He undertook personally to see to it that any creditworthy farmer who needed credit from the Agricultural Credit Corporation would obtain <Col N="1468" /> it.  The position is that most small farmers, given even unlimited credit facilities, cannot hold on to their cattle over the winter.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also examine into another factor in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation: he should find out how many farmers in recent months have received solicitors' letters and notices of prosecution from the Agricultural Credit Corporation because of delay in the payment of instalments due.  As a practical step, I would ask the Minister now&mdash;another instalment will become due in November&mdash;to make representations to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to give these farmers a chance.  I have seen a couple of these solicitors' letters.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the position is very serious.  Last Wednesday the Minister offered no solution to the problem. Admittedly, he has been attempting to secure new market outlets for our livestock but the net result has been nil.  Deputy Dillon put forward one suggestion and one possible solution to the problem.  The Minister has come up with no solution at all.  It is easy to condemn the Minister and it is easy to be critical in the present situation, but we, in Fine Gael, did not table this motion in an attempt to minimise the difficulties involved.  Our motion is one of censure on the Minister for Agriculture for not doing his job.  I do not know whether or not it was the fault of the Minister's advisers in not advising him properly as to what was happening, but anybody familiar with rural Ireland cannot but have been aware that the position was becoming extremely difficult, particularly in relation to the smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>This year has been a particularly difficult one.  There was a 50 per cent drop in calf prices earlier in the year. There was an extraordinarily bad spring with heavy livestock losses.  A couple of pence per gallon was given for milk.  Cattle prices have now dropped on an average of £15, or more, per head.  How does the Minister think the small farmer will survive in the present situation?  At this eleventh hour, I ask him to do something, even to adopt drastic measures possibly, to <Col N="1469" /> try to save the small farmers from the disaster which undoubtedly faces them.</P>
    <P>I believe this &ldquo;cattle crisis&rdquo;, as it has now come to be known, is a logical outcome of the unsatisfactory agricultural policy pursued by the present Government, a policy which in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion relegated agriculture to second place, a policy which omitted agriculture from the NIEC, a policy which, in 1965, drove 15,000 people <Col N="1470" /> from the land and a policy which, every day, is driving hundreds more from the land.  I want the Minister now to realise the situation, to face up to it, and to make up his mind that the farmers have had enough of it.  Their patience has worn out and feeling is running very high.  Before it is too late, the Minister should face up to the facts, formulate a realistic agricultural policy, or resign.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Before the interruption of business, I had tried to put my objections clearly to the section which seeks to postpone the holding of the elections.  I object on the grounds that it is undemocratic, that the bodies now in office were elected for five years in 1960, that there have been many deaths and retirements and that certain bodies of local representatives constitute the electorate for the Seanad.  I also directed the Minister's attention to what I thought was a drafting error.  I regret very much that in answering me the Minister thought fit to descend to personalities and to drag me and my constituency into this debate in a personal manner. That is very regrettable, but he having done so, I wish to put on the records of this House that there is absolutely nothing personal in my objection to this section and, so far as my parliamentary constituency goes, I feel obliged to put on record, in reply to the Minister, that the Fine Gael vote increased there from 7,000 approximately in 1961 to 10,050 in 1965 and that the Minister's Party lost a seat there in the general election of 1965.</P>
      <P>I wish also to put on record, in so far as I am concerned in a local capacity, in view of the Minister's objectionable remarks, that I have been chairman of my local authority from 1960 to date.  Therefore, I say I have nothing to gain from my objection to the postponement of the local elections.</P>
      <P>I drew the Minister's attention to what I think is unnecessary over-drafting  in subsection (2) which I consider is very hard to follow.  I told the Minister that I, as a lay member of this House, and I am speaking as such, am of the opinion that the words &ldquo;next after the commencement of this Act&rdquo; seem to be unnecessary.  I asked the Minister for a full explanation of the presence of those words.  I am afraid I must place on the records of this House that I simply got an ignorant retort from the Minister that his draftsman had drafted the Bill in that fashion and that he presumed the draftsman, who was an expert, had done it in the way best calculated to give expression to the Minister's thought.  I consider that is hardly a sufficient explanation to a Member of this House who puts a civil question to the Minister.  When a member of this House who puts a civil question Minister he is at least entitled to a civil reply.  If this is the way the Minister intends to continue this debate, I suppose it is part of the price one must pay for democracy.</P>

I should like the Minister to answer that particularly having regard to the very interesting contribution by Deputy Moore, a member of the Minister's own Party who indicated that at the last municipal election only 25 per cent of the electorate voted.  That shows the great amount of apathy which existed at that time.  This is as a result of the apathy of his Party at the time of the last municipal elections six years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder now, in regard to this Bill, whether the Minister is not in the Bill indicating that he is likely to postpone <Col N="1473" /> the elections next year.  The main question I asked the Minister was whether he had given consideration to the desirability of local electors having an opportunity of expressing their views as to how their local authority functions at more frequent intervals than they have been permitted to do in the past.</P>
    <P>At one stage, as mentioned, local elections took place every three years. The electors had this advantage, that they were able to indicate by their votes, when those elections were taking place regularly every three years, their confidence or lack of confidence, in the people who were elected.  It had the disadvantage, however, that the people who, for one reason or other, felt they no longer wanted to continue working on local authorities had the opportunity of not just resigning but of going forward instead of allowing other people anxious to take up that particular office to have this opportunity.  Of course, having local authority elections at now increasingly longer intervals means that in areas where the co-option to fill vacancies operates, not by any agreement as it does in Dublin Corporation&mdash;the arrangement there, in the case of a vacancy, is that the Party from whom the deceased member came nominates a successor&mdash;the filling of a vacancy is by the decision of the majority of the elected councillors.</P>
    <P>You can have the situation in such local authorities whereby the views of the electorate have been set at nought repeatedly because where a member of a particular local authority has resigned or died the vacancy is filled by co-option.  In many cases the person so co-opted has, as a result of the majority decision of some group in the council, been from a different political party than the person whose decease or resignation caused the vacancy. This, to my mind, whether it happens as the result of a Fianna Fáil majority, a Fine Gael majority or a Labour majority, flies directly in the face of what should be proper representation on such bodies.</P>
    <P>When you compare the period between local elections of five years, which is proposed in this Bill, with the <Col N="1474" /> possibility, as has been pointed out, that that is only the minimum period we, in this House, have little regard for the people whom we should be concerned about, in passing this Bill through the House.  This, whether we like it or not, may be convenient to each one of us.  I have no doubt it is.  It is much more convenient for candidates who are members of local authorities not to have to face the electorate more often than every five years.  It might be convenient for them, personally, not to have to face them for ten years.  In fact, it might be very convenient for the elected members of local authorities not to have to face the electorate more often than five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten years.  It might be very convenient for the person so elected but we are concerned not with the position of the elected representatives but basically with the local government electors; in other words, the citizens who have the right to vote, who have the right to express their views as to how their representatives do their work in a period of action.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister whether he has considered the decision to have local elections on a quinquennial basis good enough, particularly having regard to the fact that the quinquennial period is not the maximum.  It has now been stretched to six years and it is proposed to stretch it to seven.  It might, indeed, be stretched to eight years next year because of the factors which are making the Fianna Fáil Party very unpopular.  The Minister next year might say: &ldquo;We will have the elections in 1968.&rdquo;  I do not know whether he has got that far but it is a possibility.  I should like to know whether the Minister has considered this.  I do not suppose he will change his mind at this stage.  If so, I should like to point out some of the major problems faced by people who are elected on the basis of a three-year or five-year period.  The constituencies they represent have in many cases grown completely out of proportion, having regard to the electorate they represent and in whose interests they are supposed to be working.</P>
    <P>The Minister at this stage has not <Col N="1475" /> indicated that he is giving any thought to this matter.  I do not know if he will do so between now and 1967 but it would be quite inequitable, in so far as the area I represent is concerned, to have the quinquennial elections take place in June, 1967 and people elected at that particular time in respect of areas where the proportion and the number of citizens between one area and another have varied so tremendously since the last election in 1960.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has given any thought to that particular problem and, finally, whether he has given any thought&mdash;and perhaps this might not be the time to raise it but it is a question that has to be raised&mdash;to the problem that if we are going to have an election next June the people who are to contest those elections, those who are prepared to serve the interests of local authorities, corporations, county councils, and so on, have no assistance whatsoever by way of free postage.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Fitzpatrick in his criticism of the Minister's approach to various matters raised by Deputies in this House.  After all, regardless of what Party we belong to, we have been elected by vote of the people and the least we might expect from the Minister on our expressed views is courtesy and, shall I say, a civil tongue.  That we do not always get.  I suppose I would be a bit of an optimist if I expected anything different.  It is a tactic all along the line. He cannot give anything but a smart answer.  This is appreciated by the people outside.  He is not gaining any prestige for his Party in acting that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most unfair that the elections were not held at the appropriate time. There are many reasons one could advance for not having held the elections at the time the people expected <Col N="1476" /> they would be held.  Last year conventions were held all over the country, certainly by the Fine Gael Party, and people came from far and near to the various conventions at considerable inconvenience and great expense and selected their candidates.  It should be borne in mind that that is the normal process when putting forward candidates in the different areas for county council elections.  As the elections are of a local character, naturally the local people come from far and near and to vote in favour of one candidate or another.  Quite often there is a good spirit at county council elections.  These people have been inconvenienced and the plans made to contest the elections were thrown out of gear.  Therefore, the Minister showed disregard for the wishes and feelings of the people and he would prefer, as he always has done, to put Party interests before those of the people.</P>
    <P>Again, let me say this postponement of the elections shows disregard not alone for the Members of this House but for the ordinary people outside who take a deep interest in progress.  I noticed in County Mayo that there are a number of long-serving members of a council who are most anxious to retire because of their age, but they felt obliged to carry on despite their years.  They have discharged their duties well in face of difficult times. They are anxious to retire but have been obliged to continue only in so far as their duties to the people who elected them are concerned.  It is most unfair to those senior men who laid the foundations of this State.  They do not all belong to my particular Party but the Minister does not seem to care a hang so long as there is a question of furthering the interests of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The sooner we get back to reality the better, and the sooner there is a sense of fair play and we realise that in the present day and age there are greater educational facilities available, more modern means of communication and people are becoming more enlightened, the better.  The people see all the gags and tricks that are being played but they are wide awake.  When <Col N="1477" /> the time comes they will let the Minister know they are wide awake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael, as I said earlier, never seem to learn.  They think that if they repeat the charges they are making as to the necessity for this Bill often enough people will believe them.  I do not intend to let them away with that.  I repeat what I have already said in answer to the charges made by Fine Gael Deputies.  They do not seem to be able to appreciate the fact that they have not anything to talk about on this section but generally speak on things that are not applicable to the section at all.</P>
      <P>They want to get away with the story that this year the elections are postponed for purely Fianna Fáil political reasons.  They want us to believe that whatever might have been the reasons last year, with which they apparently agreed because they did not oppose the Bill postponing the elections a year ago&mdash;that whatever might have been the reasons at that time, they apparently agreed with those reasons and what I am saying is that the reasons this year are no different from what the reasons were last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While appreciating the views of Deputy Larkin as to the more frequent testing of public opinion in regard to the worth or otherwise of the members of his local authority or any other local authority, I can say that whatever may have been the intentions of the laws passed by this House for the last 40 odd years we find that since 1922 and up to 1966 there have been just eight local elections held.  This does not indicate in any way that we have departed recently from what is regarded by Deputy Larkin as the ideal, that is the three-year period.  The average for the past 40 years has been over five years.  We are not doing anything new in this particular case.  It has happened before and it happened at a time when, if there could be a case made today on the basis that Deputy Larkin has been following, I think a better case could have been made then for more frequent elections. A lesser case can be made today than <Col N="1478" /> might have been made 25, 26 or 27 years ago, before the managerial system, when, in fact, whatever services the councils were then providing &mdash;and certainly they were much less than they are today&mdash;they were responsible for whatever these minimum services were and, therefore, in a sense the period in those days could, justifiably, have been said to be required to be shorter than it might be today.</P>
    <P>I say further, from my own experience, a member of a local authority being elected for the first time&mdash;and everybody must be elected for a first time&mdash;without any doubt, anything less than five years will not be sufficient to enable that particular member to do anything worthwhile and see it through while he is there.  In that sense I am not only satisfied that five years is the least period; I believe that, indeed, the period could usefully be extended by the law of this House.</P>
    <P>The law of this House, whatever it is, whatever this House says, is only the law of this House.  We are passing something that changes.  Anything that we determine in this House we are entitled to change our minds about.  I am not saying that this Bill, in fact, could not be followed by another one and that circumstances could not arise when, in fact, the House would ask that is, the three-year period.  The average for the past 40 years has been do it they can do it.  This House is here to make laws, including electoral laws and there is nothing sacrosanct sent down the drain by postponing these elections.</P>
    <P>It amuses me to hear Fine Gael Deputies talking as if the people down the country, in their own counties or in my county, are so concerned about whether in fact the Fine Gael people or the Fianna Fáil people go out and show themselves and answer for their charge for the past five or six years in regard to local affairs.  Ninety per cent of councillors who offer themselves from one election to the next and appear at their meetings&mdash;and I make a special point of this&mdash;at least appear regularly at their meetings, will be returned year in year out as long as they <Col N="1479" /> want to go forward.  There are not many people who are prepared to give their time to council matters.  This is a known fact.  We all know it and I think the public know it, even though at times and by the returns of those who vote and the percentage poll that we see, one would think that the public may not appreciate it because they do not come out in any great numbers to vote.  Nevertheless, I think the public are fully aware that members of councils by an extension of a year or a number of years to the period for which they were originally elected, are not, in fact, getting anything out of it. They are giving the service if they are attending their meetings.</P>
    <P>I feel that all this worry in Deputy Fitzpatrick's mind, and indeed in Deputy O'Hara's mind, is a bit phoney to say the least of it.  I do not think it is a real fear and I do not think they are the slightest bit concerned whether or not there are local elections this year or were last year or whether there will be local elections next year. It is they who, in fact, are playing politics in this House in regard to this Bill and this particular section.  They well know that this is so.  Their inconsistency is displayed tonight and the last night that we talked on the Second Stage of this Bill as against their views when we were discussing the last Bill a year ago.  These inconsistencies are being shown up one after the other and the more they get up the more they are putting their feet into it and showing how inconsistent they can be.  I hope the public outside will discern that this whole business of discussing this particular section and making it out as if it were a general discussion on the whole electoral laws is being used by Fine Gael as a vehicle of propaganda to make the people believe that Fianna Fáil are keeping something good from them by not holding elections this year.  If the talk that is going on here is continued as uselessly as it appears to be so far, my own feeling about this matter would be to pull the Bill out here and declare the date for the local elections and, if I did that, half the people who are talking would die of fright.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am glad the Minister's tea seems to have left him in a more amiable humour and he is at least prepared to come into this House and have a fairly reasonable discussion on a measure. The Minister, in his last remarks, stated that the Bill fixing the date of the election is merely a law of this House which can be changed as often as we like and that the Bill we are now discussing, when enacted, will become a law of this House which can be changed again.  With respect, I submit there is something more in it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are here altering the date of the holding of local government elections and extending the life of existing local authorities during the life of those authorities.  I have no objection to this House altering the span of life of a local authority as often as it wants, as long as it is done before that local authority is elected and so long as the people know&mdash;when they are going to the polls to vote for that local authority&mdash;they are electing it for five years, for three years, or for any number of years.  It is the right of this House to do that and I concede it. But I say it is bad legislation, and it <Col N="1482" /> is not good for democracy that a county council should be elected by the people to serve for five years and during the currency of that five years &mdash;or indeed, as in this case, retrospectively after that time has expired &mdash;this House should take unto itself the right to override the decision of the electorate and confer on that local authority a life of seven years instead of five.  That is fundamental as far as I am concerned, and I hope it is clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to the Second Reading and in his reply to our remarks here today, has accused us of bad faith and of using phoney arguments in support of our opposition to this Bill.  I would ask the Minister, before we pass from this section, to tell this House, and tell it in clear terms, why he wants to postpone these elections, why he seeks to postpone retrospectively these elections from June last until June next.  In his introductory speech here on the Second Reading, he made some vague promises or forecasts about some change in the powers of local authorities which he will bring about by law.  It is gloriously vague; it is the first time we heard about it.  He told us in the same speech it was unlikely that the Bill would be enacted this year but he hoped it would be law before next June.  I hope I am not misquoting the Minister.  I say I cannot accept that as a reason for the postponement of these elections.  That reason was not given last year.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me to ask why the Minister, when he introduced his Bill last year&mdash;and he has accused us of having different points of view now &mdash;to postpone these elections for 12 months did not postpone them for two years, until 1967 instead of 1966.  I seriously invite the Minister to tell the House and the country why he is postponing these elections, why he did not want to hold them in June last on the same day as the Presidential election and why he does not want to hold them now instead of next year.  Speaking for my Party, I am quite prepared to accept the Minister's challenge&mdash;let him withdraw this Bill, <Col N="1483" /> let him hold these elections as soon as he likes and we will take up the challenge.</P>
    <P>He has accused us of being afraid to face the electorate, of having nothing to gain by the election and he has used what he thinks is a threat but, of course, it is merely a debating bluff in his last remarks by saying that if we are not careful, he will withdraw this Bill and go ahead with the elections. I invite him, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to do just that, to do it now and we will put up with the consequences whatever they may be.  If he is sincere in his condemnation of us; if he is sincere in his statement that if the elections had been held last June we would be here in fewer numbers, if he is sincere in his forecast that when the elections are held next June, Fianna Fáil will be here in greater numbers, I will repeat I am prepared to take up the Minister's challenge and have the elections now.</P>

There is no other way to look at it.  This is only a waste of the time of the House.  The Minister has brought in this Bill extending the <Col N="1486" /> period to next June.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I wish to make a point here that I could have made earlier but I decided to reserve it for this section.  Subsection (2) of section 6 gives retrospective effect to anything done by local authorities on or after 8th June last. This is retrospective legislation and within the past couple of weeks, on a Private Member's Bill, the Minister here denounced retrospective legislation. He said it was something that should only be tolerated when it could not be avoided, so to speak.  I put it to the Minister that there is no reason why this should be done retrospectively. This Bill could have been introduced in May and discussed then and enacted if the Minister had a majority to enact it.  Why did he allow it to drag on from May, 1966, to October, 1966, and then invite the House to enact retrospective legislation?</P>
      <P>The subsection reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act shall be deemed to have <Col N="1489" /> come into operation on 8th day of June, 1966, and anything done on or after that day and before and in anticipation of the passing of this Act shall be valid accordingly.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister has allowed local authorities to go on since 8th June doing things in anticipation of the passing of this Act.  He has taken the House for granted and regards it as a rubber stamp, as I suppose, with his majority, he feels entitled to do.  Why did he not introduce the Bill in May of this year, discuss it and pass it before 1st June, in the month of May?</P>
    <P>In case the Minister sees fit to sit tight, as he did after my previous remarks, I want to tell him that if he cannot give us a better reason, I suggest it was because he wanted to avoid a discussion on this Bill before the Presidential election.  He will have a job to convince the House, even the members of his own Party if they were free to vote as they wish, and he certainly will not convince the people, that he delayed the introduction of the Bill for any purpose other than to avoid discussing the Bill, in May, before the Presidential election.  The House is entitled to be taken seriously by the Government and should not be taken for granted.  The Minister should not take even his own Party for granted.  All Deputies are entitled to express their views on matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>If the Minister believes in retrospective legislation, let him say so.  If he believes it is all right to continue with an Act that has expired and then come along and assume that the Members, by a majority, will ratify actions taken in the past, let him say so.  I do not care whether this has happened before or not.  We are now in the year 1966 dealing with this Bill.  Many Deputies came into the House as a result of the election held on 7th April last.  I sincerely hope it will not become common practice to introduce legislation of this sort on the assumption that it will be passed.  The Minister is on record as denouncing retrospective legislation even when it was said to be necessary to clarify a flaw or ambiguity in an existing Act, unless it were held&mdash;I <Col N="1490" /> think he said&mdash;by the courts that the legislation did not carry out the intention of the Legislature.  I want to go on record for myself and my Party as deploring the fact that this Bill was, first of all, introduced at all, but if the Minister and the Government were determined to introduce it, I want to go on record as deploring in the strongest possible terms the fact that it was not introduced in April or May of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there might be misunderstanding, let me say that it was announced on 27th April that the Government's intention was to postpone these elections.  The Bill was introduced on 8th June, hence the date that now emerges from which the legislation should be retrospective.  The question of retrospection relates purely to the annual elections of officials of local authorities&mdash;mayors, chairmen and so forth&mdash;which normally occur during the last couple of weeks in June. All the Government meant was that mayors and chairmen would remain for another four months.  Some of them have remained and will remain until next June.  This provision refers to that particular operation only and does not apply to everything else that has been spoken of here.</P>
      <P>Again, may I say to Deputy Fitzpatrick that he is making an awful lot of noise about something in which I do not believe he has a great lot of belief?  He is living in the hope that this notice may convey to the public that something underhand is being done.  The public do not believe that and I think I am as likely to represent a cross-section of public opinion in these matters as anybody else.  A lot of people will not believe the sounds and the noises Deputy Fitzpatrick made are anything but political propaganda being peddled on this Bill and on this section in the hope of putting something across on the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I can usefully say on the section, except, perhaps, to warn the people who may be caught by this noise that it is nothing but propaganda being pushed through here, in the hope that some people will believe that Fine <Col N="1491" /> Gael, and nobody but Fine Gael, have any interest in the people at local level and that Fianna Fáil are perpetrating some crime on the country by this Bill. All this back-tracking about retrospective legislation means nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am giving one reply.  I am entitled to ask the Deputy a question while I am on my feet but he is not entitled to ask me one while I am on my feet.  Is Deputy P. Byrne adding his voice to that of Deputy Fitzpatrick in condemning me for coming before the House with part of a section that deals only with a small portion of the duties of local authorities&mdash;the election of mayors, chairmen and so forth?  By that action, I am merely regularising and legalising their election and in doing so, I offer no apology to Deputy Fitzpatrick or anyone else, any more than I do in regard to the Housing Act passed earlier this year which carries in it sections increasing housing grants to the farming community and giving those increased grants retrospective effect for more than two and a half years.  Do the two Deputies say we should claim back these retrospective grants, the extra £150 we gave to all those farmers?</P>
      <P>If that is their view, they should stand up and record that view.  If that was a proper thing to do, it is a proper thing now to regularise, as this section does, the position of mayors and chairmen pending the enactment of the Bill by the House.  It should also be remembered that the Bill, having been introduced on 8th June, was announced on 27th April&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Does the Minister mind my asking when was the Bill circulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do mind until I finish <Col N="1492" /> this matter off.  The Government's intention was to have this Bill dealt with and it would have been dealt with were it not for the fact that subsequent to 8th June last the business of this House, which apparently took priority over the Bill, brought about a situation in which it was not possible to take it before the Recess.  It was taken immediately we came back.  This was done last summer by agreement of the House and, I presume, by agreement between the Whips at the time.  As a Member of the Government, I have collective responsibility for what is in the Bill and I do not apologise to the House now for coming in at this time with a Bill which, by agreement between the Parties, was postponed from last term to this because of the urgency and the priority given to other business which apparently was regarded as being more important.</P>
      <P>That being so, the charge of Deputy Fitzpatrick does not carry any weight. Not only was the Bill introduced on 8th June but the text was circulated to Deputies on 10th June.  If Fine Gael felt so strongly about it from 11th June until the House rose, why did they not demand in the House that the Bill be taken, even by, if necessary, extending the session into the summer?  Instead of doing that then, why do they come along now crying out and accusing the Minister for Local Government and the Government of doing something underhand when all that is being attempted is to legalise the functions of local authorities in the election of officers? It just does not ring any more true than did the rest of the Fine Gael contribution.  It rings hollow and will be read as being hollow by the public whom Fine Gael would like to make believe otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister was serious when he spoke about retrospective legislation and gave us the analogy of housing grants under the Housing Bill.  I deny that the purpose of this section is to regularise the position in respect of chairmen, mayors and other officers of local authorities.  The first subsection states that the Act may be cited as the Local Elections Act, 1966.  Therefore, it is <Col N="1493" /> not confined to what the Minister said. I suppose we all have been guilty from time to time of supporting retrospective legislation when it was necessary to have such legislation, but in so far as the postponement of local elections is concerned, I do not think it was impossible to have introduced the legislation before the ordinary time for the holding of local elections, before June, 1966.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Government were neither fair nor honest, particularly to the Members of this House, and it is unfair to say that members of the Opposition did not question the desirability of postponing the local elections to next year.  The Minister and the Taoiseach must remember that they were questioned many times as to the Government's intentions in this respect. The Minister certainly tried the patience of the Members of this House &mdash;he tried my patience on many occasions&mdash;when genuinely we sought to know the Government's intentions. No matter what power the Minister may have in this matter, the peculiar thing is that it was not he who announced the postponement but the Minister for Justice, somewhere in the country, probably in Roscommon.  It was he, and not the Minister for Local Government, who announced that the local elections would not be held this year.  I take it the Minister took Deputy Lenihan to task for usurping his functions.</P>
      <P>This legislation means absolutely nothing.  A declaration in the first section to the effect that local elections will be held in 1967 means nothing because it is not this House that will decide in the initial stages whether or not we are to have local elections; it will be the Government, as they did in 1966.  What is dangerous about this legislation is that local elections may be postponed next year if the Government so decide and make an order to this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient for any member of the Government to say: &ldquo;You can raise an objection in this House; you can put down a Private Members' motion&rdquo;.  A Private Members' motion is not legislation.  Therefore, as far as <Col N="1494" /> the postponement of the elections is concerned, I believe that in accordance with our Constitution&mdash;and I am no constitutional lawyer&mdash;there must be, or, if not there should be, some stipulated period within which the announcement has to be made and when the legislation is to be introduced. If next year the Government Party, or any Government Party consider it is not opportune to go to the country in these local elections, they can so decide at a Cabinet meeting and make an order to the effect that the local elections will not be held.  It could be for Party reasons or for pure expediency.</P>
    <P>My complaint in this connection is that no matter how many times I questioned the Minister, he told me the Government had not yet made up their minds.  I was inconvenienced as an individual and as a politician.  My Party were inconvenienced.  I do not know what inside knowledge the members of the Fianna Fáil Party had; maybe they had none.  However, we all agree, and even the Fine Gael Party admit this now, that political Parties operate as such.  My Party and I always believed they should, because policies must be pursued even in the local authority, and we have always been prepared to pursue our own policy on housing and all the other matters with which the local authorities deal.  I was concerned with my arrangements for running an election. I was trying to get our machine working.  I do not think it was good enough that we should have had to wait for an unduly long period before the Government made their announcement.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Fianna Fáil members knew before we did that there were not to be any local elections this year.  I should say in fairness that we suspected there might not be, that the Government Party might find it more convenient and might have thought it more convenient for the country that the two elections be held on the same day.  Therefore, this legislation means absolutely nothing if local elections in any year can be postponed by Government decree <Col N="1495" /> or Government order.  It is wrong and somewhat dictatorial.  If local elections are to be postponed, I believe the legislation should be discussed here in Dáil Éireann and decided upon in Dáil Éireann at a reasonable time before the date for the holding of these elections.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to repeat that I believe there is a measure of retrospection in this Bill which is undesirable.  It is, in effect, rendering valid acts that have been done in June of this year.  It is unnecessary retrospection because this measure could have been introduced and passed in April or May of this year.  This Minister, in reply to these charges, has sought to give the House the impression that there was nothing ulterior about the date of introduction of this Bill or its circulation.  It is a fact, as Deputy Corish has said, that day after day in this House in the beginning of this year, the Minister was asked from these benches and from the Labour benches when the local elections would be held.  He refused to give them the information time and time again, even with a shake of his head and a smile.  I do not think I would be exaggerating if I were to say that the Minister treated the House on these occasions with contempt, and treated with contempt the Deputies who asked these questions and who were seeking information for Party purposes and for individual purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Presidential election was held on 1st June of this year.  This Bill was introduced eight days afterwards and circulated to the House, according to the Minister now, on 10th June.  Well the Minister knew early on in this year and well his Government knew when the local elections would be held, but they would not tell the House and they refused to introduce this Bill in April or May, and have it discussed.  Now they come along here and introduce retrospective legislation rendering valid acts done in June last. I say this is a bad precedent.  I said before, and I repeat, if the Government can by an Act of Parliament <Col N="1496" /> postpone these local elections, the Government in power, if they have a sufficient majority in this House, can postpone parliamentary elections by an Act of this House for one year or two years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am speaking on section 6, which deals with retrospective legislation. What the Government are prepared to do with a majority in this House in respect of local elections, they may well try in respect of parliamentary elections.  The Opposition Parties in this House would be lacking in their duty as an Opposition if they did not oppose this Bill and indicate the dangers enshrined in it.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Corish, he has misunderstood in regard to my chiding the Opposition for not taking up this matter.  What I was saying was that subsequent to the introduction of the Bill on the 8th and its circulation on 10th June, there was ample time and opportunity to take up the matter.  The Whips of the three Parties decided to leave it over until after the summer because of the greater urgency of some other business. I am not suggesting that nobody was talking about the local elections before that.  In reply to Deputy Fitzpatrick, he knew all about the postponement of these elections officially from me in this House on 29th April. He said he was not told in April or May&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well, or at least he should know and I am giving him the benefit of the doubt that he did know, that at column 730 of the Official Report for 27th April last, in reply to Questions Nos. 43, 44, 45 and 46, which with the permission of the Chair, I took together, I made the following announcement:</P>
      <P>I intend to ask the House shortly for leave to introduce a Bill to postpone until June, 1967, the local elections due to be held this year, and to make consequential provisions for the extension of the membership of existing members of local authorities, the holding of annual and quarterly meetings and other relevant matters.</P>
      <P>I then went on:</P>
      <P>As is customary, I shall give the reasons for my proposals when the Bill is moved for Second Reading.</P>
      <P>Surely that answer indicated not only a postponement but a postponement until June, 1967&mdash;which is what is in the Bill&mdash;that the Bill would deal with consequential provisions&mdash;which are also in the Bill&mdash;including the extension of membership of existing members of local authorities, the holding of annual and quarterly meetings and other relevant matters?  These things were indicated as early as 27th April last although the present law, which was an amending Bill of 1965, is still the law and continues to the end of December of this year the provisions set out in 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that, far from being accused of hedging and holding things back for too long, for the 12 months of 1966&mdash; the Bill of 1965 enabled the Minister to designate a day until the end of December, which is yet to come&mdash;the House was given formally a statement of my intention on 27th April, the fourth month of 1966.  They were given the indication clearly and without question, and the month and the year, and the consequential matters were listed out that would be covered by this little Bill.  That is what we are doing and the Deputies are entirely wrong, and Deputy Fitzpatrick knows that he is <Col N="1498" /> wrong when he talks about bringing these things along and doing them in a way that is not right and breaking great principles, established, no doubt, by Fine Gael, in this House.  I do not know about them but apparently they must have left their mark around here somewhere.</P>
    <P>I cannot comprehend all this talk, all this concern.  As I said earlier, I can only say that I describe the lot of it as a phoney effort by the Fine Gael people to perpetrate propaganda, using this Bill as the vehicle, for their own petty political Party ends, which is nothing new.</P>

      <P>In years to come anyone looking at the long Title of the Bill would never think that it was, in fact, postponing for another year the date on which elections should be held.  One might think that it was even bringing it forward to give the people an opportunity of expressing their views.  I just wish to comment that I think a more accurate Title to the Bill would be:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> I do not want to make a speech.  As far as I can remember, the Minister said in his opening speech that it would be necessary, and that he intended, to introduce legislation with regard to the machinery for elections, making certain changes, perhaps, in personnel or subsidiary bodies.  Will the Minister say briefly what these are intended to do and when the legislation will be introduced?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters like the possible extension of postal voting, for instance.  Some changes in the law, I said.  It would deal with disqualification also for membership of local authorities. This refers to questions like bankruptcy and some other things that did not make a great deal of sense.  I think I warned the House that the trouble is that while I have indicated that this is so and, indeed, for the benefit of Deputy Fitzpatrick, not for the first time, and there are a number of things in it which I would like to have through before the next elections, I do not see it as a great likelihood that they will, in fact, be through this House and law before the next elections.</P>

A lot <Col N="1500" /> of changes, yes, but they will be in line with the general recommendations of the Commission on Electoral Law, some of whose recommendations we have already had in some of the amending law we have dealt with. This will be another instalment of that and will deal with such things as qualification and disqualification for membership of local authorities.  It might deal with an extension of the postal vote.  I could not say how much more.  What I want to say is that while this is envisaged I am not terribly hopeful that it is likely to be law before next June.  That is all I say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When I ended on Thursday afternoon last, I was dealing with the question of children's allowances. We are probably the only country in the world that gives social assistance to millionaires.  It is quite possible for millionaires and such people to obtain children's allowances, without any offsetting factor being involved.  There should be a revision with a view to enabling the Exchequer to recoup from a section of the community in receipt of an income in excess, possibly, of £2,000 per annum at the present time.  This can be done by asking them to add to the income tax returns the full amount so obtained, which can then be recouped and passed on to families of low income.</P>
      <P>I mentioned also the widow with a large family of young children whose only source of income may be the non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  She would need quite a substantial income to preserve the family unit as it was before the death of her husband.  Sometimes the widow has to go out to work to maintain herself and then the children may be put into an institution at a cost per child each week of £3 or £4.  It is understandable that the widow would find it difficult to exist on the widows' and orphans' pensions.  If she got £5 or £6 a week in addition to the non-contributory pensions, I believe she would be able to remain at home to look after her family and a good job would be done by the State.  Probably another Department would be involved also but I would ask the Minister to think along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come when the contributory old age pension should be paid at 65 years.  At this stage, I see no valid reason why a person should <Col N="1505" /> have to wait until the age of 70 years. The normal retiring age in industry is 65 years nowadays.  If employers thought a man fit to continue in employment in an effective capacity until 70 years of age, I am sure most concerns would retain him.</P>

      <P>The Minister should consider that point.  At the moment, a man is entitled to disability and unemployment benefits, which give him something.  The difference is very slight between the contributory old age pension and the benefits in question. This would be an offsetting factor at the labour exchanges.  It would give relief to many hard-pressed civil servants and quite possibly would mean a reduction in their number if the pension were paid out, in the normal way, through the medium of the pension book.  It is a step that will have to be taken at some stage.  Now is the opportune time.  There will be no loss to the Exchequer, and, from that point of view, this is something that can be brought about with a minimum of disruption.</P>
      <P>With regard to widows' non-contributory pensions there is need for serious consideration.  If a widow with a non-contributory pension is in temporary employment for ten or 20 weeks, her earnings are taken into consideration for the purpose of reducing her pension during the remaining period.  This is a very serious situation. It causes a great deal of distress to those unfortunate widows.  Sympathetic consideration should be given to this matter.  There is a valid reason for altering the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for providing the moneys for school meals. An investigation should be carried out by the Department of Social Welfare to find out if this money is spent to the best advantage.  I am quite sure that any investigation would show that the children could have much better fare for the money provided.  The responsibility rests primarily on the local authority, but the Minister should have <Col N="1506" /> an investigation into the type of meals supplied and the wastage that occurs. Some new system should be evolved designed to provide a more palatable meal for these children.</P>
    <P>With regard to disabled persons, I raised a matter with the Minister for Local Government in connection with motor car taxation and he referred me to the Minister for Social Welfare. Where these people use cars for the purpose of their employment, they have to pay insurance in excess of 50 per cent and have to pay full tax.  The Minister for Local Government is not prepared to make any concession. These disabled persons are put to the pin of their collar to keep these cars running.  Where the cars are very small, the tax is only 5/-, but in other countries disabled persons pay a very low rate of tax, a tax which does not impose any burden on their incomes. The earning capacity of these people is limited because of disability and surely some allowance should be made to enable them to pursue their employment? The Minister might examine into this matter and make the necessary arrangements to have some allowance made to offset tax and insurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister provides the money necessary to make fuel available for necessitous families.  In many cases grave injustice is done to those in receipt of this fuel because they have to pay 2/- per bag, or perhaps 1/6 per bag, to have the fuel delivered, on top of the payment for the voucher. I believe a cash payment should be made to these people.  That would enable them to buy briquettes or coal and have it delivered at no extra cost. Some revision is called for.  I ask the Minister to have a look at this scheme and to ensure that the money is spent to the very best advantage of those in receipt of this fuel.</P>
    <P>No great publicity has been given to this scheme and there are people who could benefit under it but who are unaware of its existence.  Steps should be taken to publicise social welfare schemes.  The books published by the Department should be available in post offices or Garda barracks <Col N="1507" /> in the same way as the electoral register is available for examination. It is only when one reads the book that one becomes aware of the many types of assistance available.</P>
    <P>With regard to medical referees, there is a sum of £74,800 for travelling expenses, etc., in relation to the examination of persons by medical referees.  This is a matter about which I am not quite clear.  First of all, why is it necessary for these people to come before the referee if the certificate of the medical practitioner in the area is accepted?  Does it mean that the certificate will be accepted for a particular period?  Is there some other way in which the Minister can have the situation checked on?  To my mind, it is a terrible reflection on the medical practitioners who are submitting certificates week after week.  I should like to know how many cases are rejected by the medical referee and told to go back to work as a result of the examination by the social welfare officer.  If a man who is really sick is called upon to travel to the Custom House, or elsewhere, he gets his subsistence allowance and his travelling expenses but the journey could make him much worse than he was.  A more simplified system should be put into operation.</P>
    <P>I just cannot understand how a certificate can be accepted from a doctor for six, eight, ten or 12 weeks and then the man is told that he is fit to go back to work, even though the doctor has submitted a certificate to say that the man is unfit.  Where the logic is in that I do not know.  In such a case, is the doctor who submitted the certificate crossed off and are no further certificates accepted from him?  There may be a valid explanation for all this. I believe the Minister should be in a position to have, if necessary, his own medical personnel in a particular area who would be able to certify.  I cannot understand why we accept some certificates and do not accept others.</P>
    <P>There is at present the question of people who would have come in again under the social welfare code, due to the alteration in the ceiling.  When the <Col N="1508" /> ceiling was raised to £1,200, quite a number of people who were previously outside the limit came back in.  There is the case in CIE and elsewhere of people who have been in and out, due to the variation in the ceiling over a number of years, and who continued to pay voluntary contributions in order to be eligible for benefits they thought desirable and necessary.  After the last change in the ceiling, CIE would not bring in a certain section who were under that ceiling.  This is a very serious situation and one whereby many men can be deprived of the contributory old age pension by virtue of the fact that CIIE insist that it is only necessary for them to insure for widows and orphans.  In time to come, it is going to affect many people if they get away with this.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a case being made again to insure many of these people who are under £1,200 and are not fully insured at present.  I am sure the Minister and his Department would seek out any employer who failed to bring into the social welfare grouping people under that amount.  If these men are under £1,200, there is no reason why they should be debarred by CIE from getting the full benefits to which they are entitled.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this very serious situation which in years to come will affect many CIE workers who were outside the code and whose earnings now are such as to bring them in.</P>
    <P>I have in mind an urgent case and next year will be too late to do anything about it, the case of a man who if he is not brought in under the social welfare code by the full contribution, will not be in a position to have the necessary number of stamps to qualify for the old age pension.  I wonder would CIE make up the difference in that case?  I am sure they would not. They are not a very friendly group when approached about problems of this kind.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to come down heavily on them, if they do not face up fully to their responsibilities to the workers.</P>
    <P>Last week in the Dáil, I heard Deputy Dillon talking about a poor, friendless, homeless, hungry man and <Col N="1509" /> I was amused when I listened to him, but I would not be so amused today because I am aware now of a case which requires investigation.  It is a case of a young man who went to England, spent three years there, and then returned here because of a nervous breakdown.  During that period he was sufficiently thrifty to save a few hundred pounds, not enough to buy a motorcar, but if he had spent the money on drink or other forms of amusement and had no money now, he would be entitled to some form of assistance.  He lodged this money week after week with a building society.  He was only a labourer and, therefore, his earning capacity was not great. When he applied for unemployment assistance, his assessed means, after examination, were somewhere in the region of 50/- and on appeal the assessment was in the region of 40/-. Taken into account in that assessment were the free lodgings he had in his father's house.  He was not earning while he had these lodgings but he was deprived of assistance of any kind. He sleeps in the house but buys his food out.  He is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, due to his condition. His father has told him that unless he can produce the necessary means to exist, he can sleep in the house but cannot eat there.</P>
    <P>This is not an exceptional case and it is one that should be more closely examined.  I wonder if the man slept in the Iveagh buildings what would be the reaction to his case?  Would he then get assistance?  I am quite sure he would.  If the man had spent his money on wine, women or something else and had come back without any money, then the case would be different and they would be only too happy to help him.  Because he did not do that and because the money he lodged is assessed as means, he is deprived of assistance which he wanted only until he could get gainful employment.  I believe that he will not get gainful employment and if he does not end up in a hospital, he will end up in some kind of institution.  It seems to me that the simplest thing for him to do would be to take his money out of the building society and then if he applied for assistance, he would not be assessed <Col N="1510" /> on that amount.  This case may not have come to the Minister's notice but I would ask him to have the matter examined to ensure that justice is done. This line, which one must very often toe, causes very great inconvenience. We must approach the case more humanely.  I believe this regulation should be modified to a degree whereby one can get assistance when one is in need of it.</P>
    <P>The next section I want to deal with are the old age pensioners.  I believe one of the previous speakers indicated that delay in payment is a factor which causes some people to go into institutions. I have known only one case where the delay in payment meant the person going into an institution.  Those people become nervous while waiting very often six or seven weeks.  There may be a very valid excuse why the delay in payment occurs but there, again, it is purely a regulation drawn up with no human approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The very rigid line which one must toe should be examined in regard to those old people.  The interview by the investigation officer in regard to those people is very important.  It is a very delicate situation.  Old people are sometimes proud.  Sometimes old age pensioners should qualify for supplementary assistance but they fail to apply for various reasons.  If it is a question that additional payments are necessary it should be brought to their notice.  I know, on occasions, where old people were interviewed.  They were entitled to additional facilities but there was never any mention of those facilities.  The people in social welfare are only concerned about their own job and are not concerned about the supplementary assistance which those people obtain from various charitable organisations.</P>
    <P>A page should be inserted in the pension books indicating the supplementary assistance which old people can obtain.  The old age pensioner could consult this page in his pension book from time to time.  He would then know what he could obtain.  I would ask the Minister to have another word with the people in his Department who are dealing with old age <Col N="1511" /> pensioners.  Those old people are very dear to the hearts of all public representatives. Public representatives have indicated their desire to see that the problems of the old people are fully met.  Most of them feel that the assistance which those people should obtain should be given to them even at expense to the nation.  I am quite sure that no person would begrudge additional taxation if it made the lot of old age pensioners better than it is at the moment, particularly people on non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I have seen old age pensioners from Ballyfermot, Drimnagh or Crumlin walking to the post office, which very often is a considerable distance away, and empty CIE buses passing by. Those old people are unable to pay the bus fares.  CIE on many occasions have been approached and asked to provide free travel for those people during the off-peak hours.  This may be well away from the Estimate under consideration but I believe that the Minister could have some type of offsetting factor there by way of a voucher which could be issued to those people in the same way as the turf vouchers are issued at the moment.  They could then obtain free travel during the off-peak hours. I do not see why CIE could not provide such free travel, particularly as many transport authorities in other countries provide free travel for old people.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister gets rent of £15,000 from CIE.  He could very well raise that and see that free transport was provided for those old people during the off-peak hours.  In the centre of Dublin people can travel during off-peak hours at very reduced rates but where this is really required, in the perimeter areas of the city, no such concessions are available.  It is deplorable that we have a transport system here which does not give those facilities to old people who wish to travel during the off-peak hours when empty buses are travelling during those hours.  Those facilities should be available in the outer areas of Crumlin, Drimnagh, Ballyfermot and on the other side of the city at Coolock and Finglas.  If CIE expect the city <Col N="1512" /> service to pay at the expense of the old people we must have fresh thinking on this matter.  I would ask that some type of consideration would be given to this particular aspect.  This matter has been raised here before.  It has been raised at Dublin City Council and at every council throughout the country. I am quite sure there are no members of the Dublin local authority or of the national Parliament who would object in any way to any offsetting factor, even if it meant additional taxation, in order to meet the needs of the old people.</P>
    <P>Once again, I would ask the Minister to consider making available a list of social services so that people can consult it without having to go to the office and paying 1/6d, if it can still be obtained.  At one time this could be obtained in the Government Publications Office.  It is hard to expect old people to pay this money to know the services which they can obtain.  They are hardly likely to say: &ldquo;I will go down and get a copy and see what it is all about.&rdquo;  This could be made available in many ways.  It could be made available through the local press and also in the post office.  The post office would probably be the most desirable place because it is there that pensions are paid.  The people in need of additional assistance could consult such a list there.  I believe that an additional page in the pension book giving an indication of the different types of assistance that are available to old people, of which they are not aware at the moment, is something well worth considering.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to the question of disabled people.  I would ask him to provide some offsetting factor whereby disabled people can meet the high cost which often has prevented them from taking up employment where a car was necessary. The Minister should provide some assistance by way of relief in taxation.  He could consult with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and have the rate of taxation on cars for such disabled people reduced.  This would ensure <Col N="1513" /> that they could obtain different types of employment.  Disabled people suffer a grave inconvenience because of their disability and they are precluded from taking up gainful employment of the nature which can be carried out where there is no disability.  I would ask the Minister to consider that and to be mindful of the fact that there is in this city at the moment a section who are trying to deprive people of the benefits to which they are duly entitled under existing legislation.  No one such group should get away with that type of tactics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare and social security have in the past few years become the area of government in which the kind of attitude the Government have as their policy in social matters is most effective.  In recent years we have seen in this area a great deal of rethinking on the part of people interested in this subject and we have seen more enlightened European countries trying to bring this whole subject of social welfare on to a more scientific and impartial basis, a basis on which recipients are paid out of the State funds available according to the needs they are discovering are theirs.</P>
      <P>It has been discovered that this is not a strictly effective answer in relation to those pockets of poverty which occur in any society in any country. It is not sufficient to give attention to this problem only at election time.  It has been discovered that, intelligent and all as politicians may be, the solution to this problem should be left to scientific partners of one kind or another to solve.  This is especially so in the Council of Europe where a whole new universal discipline has come into existence in the social science field.  They have gone into the population census and tabulated the ages and numbers of people in the population to find out just at precisely what point in their lives they need the State's help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Party to which I belong have for many years as a basic tenet of social philosophy felt that this is something we cannot hold too dearly, the obligation of the State to the weaker <Col N="1514" /> citizens in the community.  We for our part have never felt it to be something that should be considered only at pre-election time or as an afterthought of a Budget speech by a Minister.  The biggest single global criticism we can make of the present social welfare arrangements in this country is that they are piecemeal answers to a problem which has not yet been fully tabulated in all its complexity and size.</P>
    <P>One could be very uncharitable and say that the payments we make to people in this bracket at the moment are payments that are called for because of political expediency at a particular time.  It can be said that the payments we make to certain sections in our society are motivated mainly by what was suitable in a particular year and at a particular time, a motivation dependent upon an impartial assessment of the needs of that section of the population.  If one does not make this impartial examination of the needs of the population over their lifetime, one would run the risk, even if one were spending very little, and indeed the amount this country is spending is little in this area, of its being, in fact, a waste of money in many cases.</P>
    <P>We are not helped in this country in coming to an impartial or full assessment of the complexity of this problem because all the graduates we have in social science in this country cannot get employment and it is a tragic fact that people who are skilled in this area &mdash; I am referring to University College Dublin &mdash; must get employment in Great Britain or Northern Ireland where, in fact, there are greater opportunities of employment for them.  It appears to me a great tragedy that social science people who graduate in this area cannot get employment in this country.  As a result, our services suffer from a lack of knowledge and knowhow. It is pretty clear that if this problem is not rescued from being merely a plaything of our politicians, it will never be solved in any satisfactory manner.  I think, to be perfectly honest about it, the only time this Legislature does anything serious about the plight of old age pensioners, or <Col N="1515" /> widows, or any of the groups that come under the heading of social welfare, is at election time, or in the aftermath of election time.  This is not strictly the time and it is not the spirit in which to approach this problem.</P>
    <P>We are just coming to the end of a year in which there have been a great many industrial disputes of one kind or another.  This is a mark of the barren nature and lack of effectiveness of our social security.  All sections of our population see that the only answer to their economic position is a pushing forward of the wage front and having their standard of living tied exclusively to this.  Other countries more farseeing have shown by their social welfare schemes that they see that social services can provide a distribution of income to that section of the population who suffer from a lack of it. They can also see them as a means of lessening the onslaught on the wages front.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that until we begin to see this problem in all its aspects, we will not get a real answer to it.  My Party would welcome this change in which this matter would cease to be a political plaything.  We would welcome an investigation into the needs of our population, into the needs of old age pensioners, into the needs of widows, and so on.  We would welcome an investigation to see where poverty occurs in our national life.  Too many of us are restricted in our viewpoint as to where poverty exists.  If we live in the surburbs and travel by car, or go through the well-off districts, we can pass through life without ever knowing that poverty exists in our midst.</P>
    <P>One is astounded sometimes to read that an old person has died in a room in which there was no fire and no money for a fire.  One is surprised and shocked that some old person has died alone to be discovered two or three days later by neighbours but if one looks at the amount of money old age pensioners are expected to live on and compare it with, say, the cost of living for an hour of some people in our society, one is no longer surprised. It is true that, in such a small country, <Col N="1516" /> there are sections in our society who go about blissfully unaware that their fellow citizens exist in real want.  This is not the lot of those who have been spendthrifts or who have been in any way profligate with their money but of people in the group of common or garden poverty.</P>
    <P>It appears to us in the Labour Party, and it is true that in many countries they consider that the State has an obligation to see that no person in old age exists in want.  There is an obligation on the State to see that old age pensions are not made merely the casual toss of political play in Parliament to be decided upon when other commitments have been met.  I recall the last Budget when the Minister threw the old age pensioners a small, tiny increase.  It appears to us that this is not the proper approach to the problem at all.  We feel that an inventory should be made of what an old age pensioner's needs are.  The Central Statistics Office should be got to use the various weightings they use in making up the cost-of-living index and apply that to the old age pensioner's way of living and see what, in fact, could give him a standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that an old age pensioner, any person living in that situation, at the mercy of the State, so to speak, without any kind of machinery whereby his payments from the State, his pension, are reviewed periodically, every time a round of wages occurs, has his standard of living by that amount reduced.  In other words, those citizens in our State who have spent a lifetime of labour in the State, when they come to the end of their days, have no trade union, no organisation, to protect their deteriorating standard of living and it seems the only time anything is done for them is either as a pre-election gimmick by a Government in power or post-election memories of a Government just having won an election.  This is a very tragic situation for old people in our country.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the Department of Social Welfare, however expert they may be in ladling out what payments <Col N="1517" /> there are there at the moment, is a fossilised institution, an institution which is rigid in its interpretation of what recipients are entitled to.  No winds of change have blown in the dusty corridors of the Department of Social Welfare for some years.  I would say the civil servants in that Department are more intent on seeing that the letter of the law is observed then that a spirit of Christian charity should motivate their actions.  Christian charity would not see any civil servant in that Department sure of his promotion.</P>

      <P>I commiserate with <Col N="1518" /> the Minister on the central heating but that also might cost money and I do not want to transgress the rules of this debate.</P>
      <P>Even affluent societies have discovered that this question of poverty exists in their countries and what I am suggesting is that what little money we are spending at the moment &mdash; I think Portugal is our only competitor in the amount of money we spend, and for a country that likes to consider itself developed, comparison with Portugal is not a very commendable one &mdash; might in fact be better spent if we examined the problem in its complexity and saw where, in fact, we actually need cash.</P>
      <P>It is an astonishing thing, and I have evidence of the lack of public interest in the real problems involved, that in a small country like this there should be some astonishment when we read of old people being found in ditches or found dead by their neighbours in blocks or flats even here in Dublin.  This calls for greater use of the social science people we have graduating from our universities.  It is a tragedy that such people, coming from our universities with all the up-to-date knowledge that has been discovered, find no employment in this country.  The Department of Social Welfare, to my knowledge, does not recruit many of these social science graduates in this particular area.  I do not know whether there are any special qualifications for someone coming into the Department of Social Welfare or if he just drops in as casually as civil servants drop into other Departments.  It appears to me that specialised knowledge should be necessary.  I would suggest also that the local authorities who play such a great part in this matter could, with great profit, also employ such social scientists to see how they could improve their particular service to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Deputy who spoke referred to the problems in CIE.  I can recall one hardy annual at any rate in this matter.  All sections of this House have repeatedly called for reduced fares for old age pensioners travelling <Col N="1519" /> on public transport.  The British Labour Government have done this in Britain.  It could certainly be done at certain hours of the day.  In Dublin and throughout the country, old people have to walk many miles in some cases around the country and even in Dublin to collect payment on a Friday.  They are asked to go intolerable distances, and I can recall during the last bus strike here in Dublin, old people who had to walk many miles to their local centre.  I do not think CIE would be at a great loss if some arrangement were made whereby old people could get reduced fares at a particular time of the day.  As I see it, this goes back to the heart of the question.  The Department does not appear to be concerned to get to the heart of this problem in all its complexity and to tabulate it as other countries have done, to find out what are the periods of need in an average family to enable the State to cater for this need and to rescue this whole problem of social welfare from being a political plaything before elections and after elections because this will never solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember when the realisation dawned on the conservative Parties in this country that there were votes in social security.  I can recall reading previous debates in this House when the stock answer of people who are now dripping with mercy for the social welfare recipients &mdash; with mercy, but not with any actual concrete results for them &mdash; to any demand by this Party for greater attention to such people was &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  It is many years since we said goodbye to that attitude, that it was worth votes to dole out charity before and after elections.  I suggest that there is a greater obligation than that on all of us who are responsible.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us to examine the problem, to see what are the main elements in the cost of living for an old person, say, at the age of 70, to ascertain the minimal heat required by such an old person because the present payment has scant regard for what should be the minimum <Col N="1520" /> essential.  We must discard this idea that the social welfare payment is to be the minimal requirement.  Social welfare is not merely the plinth or line but we should strive, as much as possible, to give them a decent standard of living.  After all, it is not too much to ask that an old person having worked most of his or her life, having reared a family and lived a decent life in our community be protected against some of the hazards of life.</P>
    <P>We call ourselves a civilised society and one of the features of such a society is that it makes provision for those who cannot provide for themselves. If tribes in Central Africa who are called uncivilised could make provision for their old people, why could not we, with our high claims to a rather important part in Christianity, have done something for our old people in this way?  What do we find?  The so-called pagan countries of Britain and elsewhere have shown us the way to deal with such people.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that we have got to get a large dose of humility into our systems in seeing just how we can tackle this problem properly.  If we do not get across to our people the idea that social welfare is every bit as responsible and important a section of Government intervention as, say, industry and commerce in economic life, we are making a big mistake.  There is still the idea &mdash; and we have got to get rid of it &mdash; that people who must seek social welfare are somehow the misfortunates or misfits in our society. I question whether anybody in our society &mdash; with the kind of weekly wages they have in many cases &mdash; can avoid, at some stage or other, falling into the clutches of the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the function of social welfare in this country is yet sufficiently understood.  The Department could do a great deal in letting people know what are their rights, under even the existing code, because this, again, is a field in which there are many self-styled experts, many of them politicians or aspiring politicians, who set out to be sea-lawyers in their interpretation of these Acts.  There are <Col N="1521" /> many people in our community &mdash; and my own union here in Dublin has discovered many members &mdash; ignorant of their rights under the different Social Welfare Acts.  I am aware that there is a booklet published once a year which sets out in a more or less legal form what people are entitled to.  I have seen booklets published by the British Government and other governments on the continent which explain fairly clearly to the people concerned just what their rights are in this respect. We cannot consider that we have, even under the present arrangement, a system which is fully understood by the citizens, unless we have this material.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare in its administration could be less intimidating to the public when inquiries are made.  Here I am not blaming any individuals.  I presume that the officials involved are, like other officials dealing with the public, overworked people with many things on their minds; but I have received complaints from time to time from constituents that they were treated in rather offhand fashion when they went to them with some little problem.  It is important to bear in mind here that the problem which seems to us to be trivial may, in the mind of the person facing it be the greatest facing him at that point in his life.  An old person of 70 with a family reared does not have so many occupations of the mind to engage in and a problem which he feels involves an injustice for him acquires very large proportions.  If it is not dealt with in a civilised humane fashion, we run the risk, again, of persuading these people that they are outcasts in our society.  Above all, we must try in our regulations to bridge the gap for those in our society who fall upon hard times: the idea that they are somehow poor relations of the normal members of our society must be broken down.  If, for example, we could get &mdash; in our payments to these people who are hit by poverty at different times &mdash; some relationship between the amounts paid to them and the amounts paid to people in productive industry, if, at least, there were <Col N="1522" /> some specific machinery whereby, year by year, these amounts could be reviewed in a constructive fashion and consideration of their plight removed from the mere shedding of crocodile tears by one Party or another we would be doing a good job.</P>
    <P>For too long the plight of old age pensioners and others has been the voting fodder of unscrupulous politicians. It is time that situation was ended.  Indeed, the Department could play a great role in ending the situation by undertaking the kind of study I have suggested, a national survey of real poverty, because this is, in fact, what we are setting out to combat &mdash; the pockets of poverty in our midst, poverty which, according to the manifestoes of different people, is the kind of ogre they are all setting out to defeat.  But poverty very often does not seek publicity.  There are people in our society who would prefer to be cold in the desolation and silence of their own rooms than look for what they consider to be charity.  It is important that we drive home the message to those people that to be poor is no crime, to be poor is no fault of theirs, and to combat poverty is one of the responsible jobs of a Government.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that we should say goodbye to this kind of complacency in facing this problem.  I do not refer merely to the present Minister but to any Minister for Social Welfare who comes into this House and believes that a good job is being done because rules are being adhered to or claps himself on the back because he gave 2/6d to the old age pensioners last year and, maybe, in four years' time gives them another increase, when, perhaps, there would have been three or four wage rounds in the intervening period.  A great French philosopher once said that the origins of pity were in the fact that we considered that perhaps the fate might some day be our own.  In that case, I would suggest that the present Minister would not want to be dependent upon what we give to the old age pensioners, even accepting <Col N="1523" /> that rather narrow view of the origins of pity.</P>
    <P>My constituency is not one in which I would be unaware of the problems of old age pensioners but I can say that I do not have to go very far to meet the misery really there at the moment.  I might say that in my constituency, and in other areas of Dublin too, there are people with <Col N="1524" /> very little to eat, people who have to consider very carefully whether or not they can buy one egg today or tomorrow, whether or not they can light a fire today or tommorrow.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 19th October, 1966.</P>
