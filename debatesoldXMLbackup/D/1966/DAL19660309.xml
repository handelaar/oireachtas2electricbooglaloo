      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that in all there are 52 rural areas in County Mayo all of which have been initially developed under the rural electrification scheme.  Under the revised post-development scheme, the following 15 areas have been re-canvassed: Bally-castle, Moygownagh, Lahardane, Ardagh, Attymass, Knockmore, Murrisk, Askillaun, Knock, Headfort, Dunmore, Bohola, Kilmeena, Belcarra and Hollymount; construction work has been completed in 11 of these and is in progress in the remaining four.  It is expected that the revised post-development scheme will be completed in about three years' time and that supply will have been extended to all applicants who have accepted terms in County Mayo and in the remainder of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that at present the supply of electric current by the ESB to the Skibbereen-Mizen Head district, County Cork is most ineffective; what plans the Board have for improving the supply; and when such plans will be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that during the past winter a blizzard and a very severe lightning storm caused considerable damage to the board's networks in the Skibbereen-Mizen Head area with subsequent interruptions of supply.  This damage was repaired as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>The board state that, in general, the supply position is adequate in the area but that strengthening of the network, where necessary, in certain locations is in hand and further improvements are scheduled in the coming months; that the board's district manager at Cork will investigate any case of poor supply if the necessary details are reported to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the network in that area requires strengthening?  This is not an individual complaint: it is general in the area.  The current is ineffective.  The power should be strengthened.  I should like the Minister to ensure that a more effective supply will be made available in a district where the present supply is anything but effective.  It is a general complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will state, further to a previous reply on the matter, when it is expected that electricity supply will be extended to the townlands of Sillertane, Pookeen, Inch, and Milane, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that they expect that the present rural post-development scheme should be completed within about three years and that all applicants in County Cork and elsewhere who have accepted the terms quoted will have received supply by that date.  It was intended that re-canvass of the Coolkellure rural area, which includes the townlands referred to in the Deputy's question, should commence early in 1967.  However, I am now informed by the ESB that because of the big increase in demand for electricity in the last year it is necessary to give priority to ensuring the maintenance of supply to existing consumers.  New connections may, therefore, be somewhat delayed.  In the circumstances, it will not be possible to commence the re-canvass of the Coolkellure rural area at the time originally scheduled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that he informed me 12 months ago that the likelihood was that the supply would be provided to these townlands during the current year if all the householders availed of it?  I understand the Minister to tell me now that they are being put back two years instead of being brought ahead, as one would hope, a few months.  Surely that is not a satisfactory position?  Surely it is a position which must be adverted to during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. In normal course a new Pension Order Book is dispatched to the widow of a person who had been in receipt of an old age (contributory) pension within a week of the receipt of notification of his death.  On occasion, but this is a very infrequent happening, some delay occurs because correct particulars of the pensioner's death have not been furnished or because the relative old age (contributory) pension order book had not been returned, or because there had been an overpayment of old age pension in the case. Even such cases can generally be dealt with and a new pension order book issued within two weeks.  I do not consider therefore that any special arrangements on the lines suggested by the Deputy are necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>While it may be taken that mergers of firms or associations between firms will generally aim at expansion of production and employment, the possibility must exist that, in particular cases, there may be some loss of employment.  The Government's manpower policy is designed to mitigate, through schemes for redundancy payments, resettlement allowances and retraining, the effects on workers of any measures to rationalise industry which give rise to redundancy.  In the particular case to which the Deputy refers, I understand that a small number of sales personnel was redundant in one of the companies involved, that alternative employment was available for some of the persons concerned and severance pay was paid to those for whom alternative employment was not available.</P>

Further, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Government's policy in regard to manpower and redundancy. Could he tell us when will we have concrete proposals before the House on this very urgent and important matter?  It seems to be becoming more and more urgent with the passage of time, because obviously more and more firms are going to disemploy people, by the looks of things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice what is the statutory age limit below which persons may not be served alcohol with a meal for consumption on a licensed premises; how strictly this law is enforced; and how many prosecutions were brought under this Act in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an offence for the holder of an intoxicating liquor licence knowingly to supply or allow any person to supply intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 for consumption by that person on the premises.  The fact that the liquor is to be consumed with a meal is immaterial.</P>
      <P>Separate statistics of prosecutions for this offence are not kept, but it can be taken that few prosecutions are brought.  Clear-cut cases rarely come to notice.</P>
      <P>Complaints are made from time to time, mainly in Dublin, that liquor has been served to young persons in particular premises and they are investigated by the Gardaí, but almost invariably the circumstances prove to be such that the licence holder obviously merits no more than a caution.</P>
      <P>The Gardaí in Dublin have been specially instructed to pay attention to the serving of liquor to persons under age, and licence holders, particularly those whose premises are situated near dance halls, are warned from time to time of their obligations under the law in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Garda never visit licensed premises in opening hours but after hours and, therefore, would not be in a position to know whether or not alcohol was being served to persons under 18 years of age?  One person under age is charged with murder as a result of having been served with alcohol.  We should have a more strict enforcement of the law in this regard.  It is not sufficient to say we do not have many prosecutions.</P>

      <P>A person who is insured under the Social Welfare Acts is entitled to hospital services at a charge not exceeding 10/- a day.  The actual charge, which may vary from nothing up to 10/- a day depends on the circumstances of the particular case.  If a person's normal income ceases while he is in hospital this factor is taken into account in deciding what, if any, charge should be made.  Account is also taken of the person's normal financial situation and the duration of the period of illness.  If the patient's normal financial circumstances are such that a reduction in his earning capacity over a short period would not be of serious significance, a charge of up to 10/- a day would not be contrary to the provisions of the Health Act, 1953.</P>

      <P>From preliminary inquiries made, it is clear that the abstraction of the information sought by the Deputy would involve health authorities in an inordinate amount of <Col N="1276" /> work.  The reason for this is that, in order to ensure the accuracy of the returns, it would be necessary to trace each individual account through to the actual payment or disposal of the account otherwise.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget this year is earlier than ever before.  In part this is because Dáil sittings in April will be restricted by the 1916 Jubilee celebrations as well as by the ordinary Easter break.  This is not, however, the principal reason. In fact, we are dealing this year with a supplementary rather than a new budget.  The need to adjust the 1965 budget and strengthen our financial position is so pressing that time must not be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What went wrong with the budget introduced last May?  The most obvious thing is that, instead of a balance being achieved, a deficit of as much as £8 million is now in sight. One can account for this deficit in various ways: revenue under certain heads failing to come up to expectations, expenditure on certain services being greater than was provided for, the allowance for &ldquo;errors or estimation&rdquo; not being realised.  But one cannot justify it on financial or economic <Col N="1287" /> grounds and that is why early correction is necessary.</P>
    <P>The deficit facing us in 1965/66 would not only be repeated, but would grow to £12 million in 1966/67 if nothing were done about it.  This would occur despite the measures of economy in current expenditure and the stabilisation of capital expenditure decided upon by the Government.  The extent of the efforts made to curb the growth of public expenditure can be seen from the White Paper figures.  The estimate of non-capital expenditure for 1966/67, at £262 million, compares with an expected total for this year of £248 million.  Expenditure on the public capital programme, which had doubled since 1960 and, reinforced by the upsurge in private capital outlay, was a potent factor in causing the excessive deficit in our balance of payments, has now been levelled off and brought closely into line with the Second Programme projection.  For next year, expenditure on the public capital programme is fixed at £98 million which compares with an expected £101 million this year.  Adding the expenditure on temporary aids to industry, we are comparing a prospective total expenditure, current and capital, in 1966/67 of £362 million with a total of £351 million expected to be incurred this year.  The increase is only 3 per cent, which is within the expected growth rate of the economy.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all this, there are still weaknesses in our financial position which we cannot allow to persist. The enormous deficit on current account is the most obvious of these. The £12 million deficit in prospect for 1966-67 is attributable mainly to the cost of improvements and extensions of public services decided upon this year or earlier and reflected in the published Volume of Estimates.  For example, subsidies on dairy products show an increase of almost £2 million over the current year, while the Exchequer grant in relief of rates on agricultural land will rise by over £1 million; the current provision in the Vote for Agriculture will be £23.4 million.  Likewise, the cost of Social <Col N="1288" /> Welfare payments is expected to be about £3 million higher because of the higher rates of benefit and the more favourable means test for small holders announced in last year's budget.  Other significant increases in expenditure include building grants to secondary schools and the raising of the grant to health authorities consequent on the Government's decision to keep at the current year's level the portion of the cost of the health service borne on the local rates.  There are not many instances of new services in the estimates for 1966-67 and those which do appear, such as the Census of Population, World Food Programme and An Chomhairle Traenála, must be regarded as essential.  Various desirable improvements have necessarily to be postponed until the means of paying for them can be more readily found.</P>
    <P>The tax revenue made available to meet the extra cost of current services has proved quite deficient.  Thus, as compared with 1964/65, we could expect, at present tax rates, to have £26 million more revenue next year; whereas, current expenditure, already £26 million above the 1964/65 level this year, will be £40 million above it next year.</P>
    <P>Amongst the principal headings under which this £40 million increase in current expenditure, as compared with 1964/65, has occurred are:</P>

    <P>The inclusive figure for remuneration is £5 million more than in 1964-65.</P>
    <P>We must overtake these increased commitments before we can rationally contemplate entering into new ones.  A deliberately arranged deficit in the current budget can in times of serious economic depression be justified as a <Col N="1289" /> means of reactivating the economy.  No such justification for what is called &ldquo;deficit financing&rdquo; exists in this country today.  On the contrary, the one thing that all the recent economic commentaries emphasise is that we are suffering, not from economic depression, but from inflation &mdash; from such pressure of spending by Government and people that we have outrun our resources and are incurring too big a deficit in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Private spending may strain the balance of payments if it arises from increases in money incomes not related to the rise in national output or from credit increases not based on current savings.  Public expenditure may cause a deficit in the balance of payments if it exceeds what the private sector surrenders in taxation and makes available in current savings. The link between the deficit in the budget and the deficit in the balance of payments is direct.  By the &ldquo;deficit in the budget&rdquo; I mean, in the wide sense, not only the deficit between current revenue and expenditure but also the deficit &mdash; which has become substantial &mdash; between normal capital receipts in the form of domestic savings and total public capital expenditure. Quite clearly these deficits can be financed only by special forms of borrowing. The borrowed funds cannot be supplied by domestic sources alone with the result that recourse must be had to external sources as well.  Spending which exceeds the resources drawn from current domestic incomes, whether as taxation or savings, and has to be met by drawing down external reserves or incurring external debt, is a cause of inflationary pressure and both higher prices and a balance of payments deficit are the outcome.</P>
    <P>We are now in the position that continuance of the public capital programme, even at its stabilised level, is impossible without the support of external capital.  The deficit on the capital side of the budget is so large that all our borrowing capacity must be reserved to meet it.  As I explain later, even this may not guarantee the continuance of the public capital programme at its present level.  The plain <Col N="1290" /> fact is that if we run a deficit on current account, the borrowing incurred to finance it will subtract from our capacity to finance capital expenditure. We are, therefore, faced with a harsh choice &mdash; either we must raise taxation to close the gap in the ourrent budget, however distasteful such taxation may be, or we must cut down drastically the public capital programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with all this means in terms of unemployment and of slower economic and social development.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's view that the first choice is the better one to ask the community to make.  For the community this means accepting increased taxation this year and foregoing, for the present, expectations of aids and improvements for which there would otherwise be the strongest justification.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Taxes</i>
      </P>
      <P>In deciding what taxes to increase, the choice lies, in effect, between a wide range of increases in indirect and direct taxes, and a straightforward doubling of the turnover tax.  I have chosen the former course for two reasons: first, because I think it gives a better distribution of the burden in present circumstances and, second, because it minimises the effect on consumer prices.  I calculate that consumer prices will be raised not more than 1 per cent by the tax increases I am about to propose, whereas a doubling of the turnover tax would of itself give rise to an increase of about 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>I find it necessary to propose extra taxes on drink, tobacco, private motor vehicles, petrol and dances, as well as on income tax.  The specific proposals, and the expected yield in 1966/67, are:</P>

      <P>In determining the precise additions to the taxes on commodities, I have allowed for the price effect of the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>I am modifying the incidence of the income tax increase by providing an extra allowance of £30 for every child over 11 years of age and this reduces the yield to £4.2 million.  Since I can afford only a small adjustment, I consider it can best be given in aid of the heavier education expenses falling on married couples with children of secondary school age and over.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Estate Duty</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another tax adjustment I consider it necessary to make this year recognises that the specific relief from estate duty for widows and dependent children provided in the 1965 Finance Act does not go far enough.  I propose to extend the relief given by Section 29 of last year's Act by advancing the limit on the value of estates within which the provision will operate from £15,000 to £25,000, with appropriate marginal relief; and also by increasing the amount of the abatement of duty from £250 to £350 in the case of a widow and from £150 to £250 in the case of each dependent child.  The effect of this may be illustrated by saying that, where the deceased leaves all property to his widow and there are no dependent children, an estate of up to £8,750 will escape all duty.  If the widow has one dependent child, liability to duty will not arise unless the estate exceeds £10,200.  If there are two children, this figure will be <Col N="1292" /> £12,600 and, if three children, £13,750.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will also contain a general provision amending the Finance Act, 1894, so as to bring payments made ex gratia on death under a superannuation scheme or arrangement into liability to Estate Duty. Gratuities affected by this change in the law will include an amount paid under the Superannuation Acts to the personal representatives of a deceased civil servant and also an annuity secured to the widow of a civil servant by the surrender of a part of his pension.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxes with Protective Element</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the case of most of the duties I have mentioned there are certain differences in the effective rates for homemade goods and for imported goods, affording a measure of protection to the home manufacturer.  Under the Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom such discriminatory elements must be removed as regards United Kingdom goods either by the end of 5 years from 1st July next or in ten equal annual instalments from that date.  The manufacturers of the various articles have been consulted on the choice of alternatives and, where agreement has been reached to reduce by ten instalments, I have included in the relevant Resolution a provision giving effect to the first instalment on 1st July next.  In the case of Irish-made wine there is no duty at all at present whereas British-made wines are liable on import to ordinary wine duty.  We cannot afford to give away any of the duty on imports and accordingly an excise duty equivalent to the customs duty chargeable on British wines must be brought into effect inside the five-year or ten-year period.  The Irish manufacturers have opted for the ten-year period and I am proposing a Resolution to impose an excise duty on Irish wine from 1st July next at rates equal to one-tenth of the rates applicable to imports of British-made wine.  The duty chargeable from that date will be equivalent to about 2d. per bottle for Irish wine of ordinary strength.  The revenue yield from this will be trifling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" />
      <i>Timing of Tax Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The budgetary increase in the beer, spirits, table waters, tobacco and oil duties will take effect at once.  The change in the standard rate of income tax from 6/4d to 7/- in the £ will become effective from 6th April this year.  New ready reckoners for Pay As You Earn will be made available to employers before that date.  The new rate of deduction under PAYE will be 5/3d for earnings of not more than £2,000.  Where a taxpayer has claimed an allowance on his return for 1965-66 for a child who will be over 11 years of age on 6th April, 1966, a revised certificate of tax-free allowances will be issued by the tax office as early as possible.</P>
    <P>The increase in the turnover tax on dances to 10 per cent will be effective from 1st May next.  Promoters of dances will be classified in a special category for tax purposes and the ordinary registration and collection procedures will no longer apply to them.  Instead, they will be required to notify the Revenue Commissioners in advance of proposed dances and to remit the tax within a week of the date on which the dances are held. Where the tax applies it will be illegal for the proprietor of any premises to hold a dance or to allow a dance to be held in them unless he has been notified by the Revenue Commissioners that they have received the required advance notice.  There will be an exemption for dances where the attendance is limited to a small number of persons and the admission charge does not exceed four shillings.  Apart from this there will be no reliefs, reduced rates or exemptions.  The tax will apply to the full charge for admission.</P>
    <P>As regards the road tax increase, which applies only to private motor vehicles (including motor cycles), those who have already taxed their vehicles will not have to pay any more for the duration of their present licences but the increase of 25 per cent will apply to all new licences issued to take effect from 1st April onwards.</P>

      <P>I am taking advantage of this change in road tax to reduce the tax on tractors owned by co-operative agricultural societies to the same level as the tax on farmers' tractors, which since 1962 has been £2.10.0d.</P>
      <P>Two other changes are being made towards meeting the cost of the relevant services, rather than to raise revenue for general purposes.  The present rates of duty on firearm certificates have remained unchanged since 1949 while in recent years the State has been providing increasing financial assistance for the preservation of game resources. The increases which I propose will come into effect on 1st August and are estimated to yield an extra £40,000 in 1966-67.  The fees charged in Court Offices and the Land Registry are being reviewed to take account of increased operational costs since they were last fixed several years ago. The additional receipt from this source is estimated at £240,000 in the coming financial year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Surtax Directions</i>
      </P>
      <P>The absence of a time limit for taking action under Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922, as regards sur-tax on the undistributed income of closelycontrolled companies has been the subject of criticism from time to time. On the Report Stage of last year's Finance Bill I dealt with the difficulty of fixing a specific time limit for the making of sur-tax directions.  Since then I have given the matter further consideration and I think that the criticism can best be answered by a provision under which a company which had delivered accounts and any other necessary information could, on application, require the Revenue Commissioners to decide within a specified period whether action under the section was contemplated.  A provision on these lines will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Yields</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the few weeks from now to 31st March, those taxes which come into force at once will not, I am afraid, produce much towards reducing the <Col N="1295" /> present year's deficit.  But the full range of increases is expected to yield a net £12.58 million in 1966/67, which is the sum required to bring revenue into line with non-capital expenditure, after two additions to the expenditure side, which I shall mention in a moment, have been taken into account. I am, therefore, not budgeting for a surplus but simply for a balance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Certain Social Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>Though prices have not risen since May last, when I announced substantial increases in benefits in the budget, some social welfare recipients, particularly pensioners, would find life harsher as a result of this budget if no gesture of relief were made.</P>

      <P>I cannot, however, do very much with the extremely limited means available to me in spite of the increase in taxes.  The £¼ million, which is all I have available, will, however, finance an increase of 5/- a week, from 1st November next, for persons with no means, in non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and in the personal and adult dependant rates of unemployment assistance.  It will also cover a similar increase from that date in the infectious diseases and disabled persons maintenance allowances administered by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Small Western Farms</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, particularly since the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Small Western Farms was published in 1962, the Government have introduced or improved a number of special schemes designed to raise farm and non-farm incomes in the West.  The measures taken include strengthening the powers of the Land Commission to increase the size of farms, a 50 per cent increase in the agricultural advisory services, the selection of 12 pilot areas for special development, an increase in land project grants, the provision of unsecured loans for small farmers and <Col N="1296" /> the introduction of grants for hill farming. The easing of the social welfare regulations has greatly increased the amount of assistance for small farmers who can now increase their farm output without jeopardising their eligibility for such assistance.</P>
    <P>Industrial growth in the West has, of course, benefited since 1952 from higher grants and the recent decision to make Galway city a development centre is clearly of great significance for the West.  Additional funds have been made available to Gaeltarra Éireann and its financial obligations have been reduced.  Grants are given for the establishment of hotels, holiday camps and other forms of tourist accommodation.  Special steps are being taken to develop farm-house accommodation for tourists.  Nearly one half of new forestry plantings are in the West, and energetic measures have been taken to promote sea and inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>The time has come to draw all these measures together into a comprehensive programme to exploit the possibilities in each western county.  For this purpose the Government reconstituted last year the County Development Teams under the chairmanship of the county manager, the other members being the chairman of the county council and leading officials in the county.  At the request of the county managers I have agreed to provide a full-time official in each western county for this work.  The teams, which are aided by Government and State sponsored bodies, have instructions from the Government to work closely with all voluntary bodies in their areas.  I believe that, with the help of local leadership and using all the public services in each county, an effective programme of action can be organised.</P>
    <P>As a further indication of the Government's intention to be flexible and helpful in dealing with the development needs of the West, it has been decided, even in the difficult circumstances of this year, to arrange to vote a sum of £100,000 which could be drawn upon for special schemes for small western farms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" />
      <i>Farm Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>During last month the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries carried out the annual review of the position and prospects of agriculture with the National Farmers' Association and the Government have had the result of this review before them when considering the budgetary situation. Although there has been a great increase in recent years in State aid for agriculture, agricultural incomes in general remain lower than incomes in other sectors of the economy.  The Government have undertaken to do all they can to narrow the gap.  The benefits secured by the recent Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement should make a significant contribution.  The review of the prospects for 1966 suggests that global and per caput farm income should, at any rate, increase sufficiently to maintain the relative income position of farmers in the economy, provided the growth of money incomes in the non-agricultural sector is moderate, as the Government consider it must be.  Should, however, the income position of farmers deteriorate during the year the Government will review the situation in the light of all the circumstances prevailing.  The Government would have liked to take further positive steps to improve the farmers' position but the serious deficit situation and the necessity for controlling the wages/prices spiral have prevented them from doing so.  Apart from the special allocation for small western farms and the reduced tractor tax, a number of matters discussed during the agricultural review are being attended to and the decisions will be announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the course of the budget debate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Import Levy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The special import levy imposed last November was due to expire on 31st March but, as the balance of payments is still excessively in deficit, the Government have decided that it would be premature to allow the levy to lapse on that date.  They have decided to continue it in operation in its present form until 30th June, 1966.  The position <Col N="1298" /> will then be reviewed.  While the Government have never envisaged the levy as other than a temporary measure, and with to dispense with it at an early date, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to remove it altogether until later in the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effect of British Corporation Tax.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In my Budget Speech last year I referred to the new United Kingdom Corporation Tax and indicated that official discussions would be held as soon as possible on the effect of this tax on our double taxation arrangements with the United Kingdom.  It appears as a result of the discussions that a revision of those arrangements may not be necessary, for the time being at any rate.</P>
    <P>The Corporation Tax will apply to the United Kingdom profits of Irish companies and I propose to give full relief in respect of this tax by allowing, as a credit against Irish Income Tax, the amount which cannot under existing law be allowed by way of credit against Irish Corporation Profits Tax.  I propose that the extra cost to the Exchequer of granting this relief will be recovered by an appropriate increase in the rate of our Corporation Profits Tax.  This increase, in the case of companies effectively liable to Income Tax in Ireland, will be negatived by allowing Corporation Profits Tax as a deduction from profits for Income Tax purposes.  So far as United Kingdom companies are concerned the amount paid in Corporation Profits Tax will be allowable as a credit against Corporation Tax under existing arrangements.  Thus the increase in the rate of Irish Corporation Profits Tax will not affect the net tax liability of companies operating here.</P>
    <P>In brief, the aim of these adjustments is to obviate any worsening of the position of British companies operating here or of Irish companies operating in Britain as a result of the new British Corporation Tax.</P>
    <P>Since the rate at which the Corporation Tax will be introduced is not yet known it is not possible at this stage to say precisely what will be the amount of the proposed increase in <Col N="1299" /> the rate of Irish Corporation Profits Tax but the necessary provision will be made in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from the charge of Corporation Tax on the profits of United Kingdom companies, United Kingdom Income Tax will also be deductible by these companies on payment of dividends. The existing procedure under which United Kingdom Income Tax is repayable will continue in force in the case of Irish residents holding investments in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Burden</i>
    </P>
    <P>The new taxes proposed in this budget will add £12½ million to an already high figure but, at the same time, will be not much more than one-quarter of the expected value increase in gross national product.  There is a universal dislike of taxation but the reason it has to increase is that expenditure on public services has been mounting here, as in most countries, to give effect to accepted social and economic policies.  The proportion of the gross national product which taxation of all kinds, central and local, represents has not risen greatly over the last decade.  It was 22.4 per cent in 1956/57 and will, I estimate, be 24.6 per cent in 1966/67.  There are many countries in which the percentage is higher.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>I hope the effect of the increased taxation in this budget will be to reduce less-essential consumer expenditure rather than savings because the decline in savings last year has had a direct bearing on our economic difficulties. It was suggested by the National Industrial Economic Council in their November report that the possible explanation of the fall in savings is that, in face of rising prices, there has been an attempt to maintain real consumption at the level it reached following the general increase in money incomes in the first quarter of 1964.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions in other quarters that a substantial increase in the interest rates payable <Col N="1300" /> on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks would lead to a worthwhile addition to the amounts available for capital development from these sources.  This may be true.  There is considerable doubt, however, whether this would mean an effective addition to the general pool of savings or merely result in a switching from one savings medium to another.  I should stress here that the various savings media operated under the auspices of the State are complementary to each other. They are not in competition.  The Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks provide a service for small savers who want to have security for their capital as well as having their money at call.  Savings certificates, on the other hand, are designed for those who are prepared to leave their money on deposit for medium or long periods. The investment is assured of a high tax-free return if the certificate is held for its full life.  A smaller return is available if the certificate is cashed before maturity.  In the case of prize bonds the investor is prepared to forego interest altogether in the hope of obtaining a large prize at one of the half-yearly draws.</P>
    <P>In considering whether interest rates should be increased, the cost-benefit equation, as I might put it, is of prime importance.  As I pointed out in reply to recent Parliamentary Questions, an increase of one per cent per annum in the interest rate on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks would cost £1¼ million per annum without any corresponding certainty of an overall addition to the pool of savings.  Having regard to the demand nature of these deposits, the rate of interest payable does not seem unreasonable when account is taken of the fact that the first £50 per annum of such interest is free of tax.  What this means for husband and wife is that between them they can have up to £4,000 on deposit in Savings Banks, or indeed, in the Commercial Banks, without having to pay any income tax on the interest.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that in July of last year I set up a representative <Col N="1301" /> Working Party to consider what steps can be taken to increase savings generally.  I hope to have their report soon.  If, as a result of the deliberations of this body, a scheme can be worked out by which overall savings can be increased even at some extra cost to the State, I will give it earnest consideration.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, one savings medium which can be improved with reasonable hope of an overall increase in saving, and without undue risk of switching from other media, is savings certificates.  The present issue was introduced in 1956. It gives a tax-free yield at maturity in 6 years of 4? per cent.  I now propose to withdraw this issue and to replace it with one having a life of 8 years. Interest at the end of the first year will be at the rate of 3? per cent and will increase each year until it becomes 5¼ per cent, tax-free, when the certificate is held for the full 8 years. For a holder liable to income tax at the new standard rate this is equivalent to a gross yield of over 8 per cent. A unit certificate costing £1 will at the end of 8 years be valued at 30/-.  The present issue will be withdrawn on Saturday next and the new certificates will be available for purchase as from Monday next, the 14th March.  I am hopeful that this new issue will help to give an impetus to the savings campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prices</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am convinced that nothing could be more conducive to a renewed interest in saving than a slower rate of increase in prices.  I hesitate to say &ldquo;price stability&rdquo; because, in the strict sense, this is something which has eluded most countries since 1939. Everywhere people have grown accustomed to a rising price level and are probably prepared to tolerate a small annual increase.  But continued increases as big as the 5 per cent we experienced in Ireland last year are not tolerable: they are evidence of an inflationary trend which is socially undesirable and economically dangerous. I have looked at our comparative position, as shown by OECD statistics, and I find that the annual average <Col N="1302" /> percentage increase in consumer prices over the period 1960 to 1965 was 4 per cent, which gave Ireland the doubtful honour of sharing, with Austria and Norway, the fifth highest place in the OECD table.  Our average was raised by the fact that we experienced increases in prices in 1964 and 1965 which were considerably higher than in most other OECD countries.  The causes&mdash;excessive increases in money incomes, in credit and in public expenditure and loss of output through industrial disputes &mdash; have been pinpointed by the NIEC or other commentators.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's aim to keep prices under stricter control&mdash;not by an intensification of legal and administrative regulation but by more fundamental and effective means, namely, by keeping inflation under control, which means bringing money incomes and public and private spending more closely into line with the growth of national production.  The more intense competition, which the progressive freeing of trade with Britain will bring, will operate to prevent profiteering.  Consumer prices have been virtually steady since May last.  The prices of a small range of less essential goods will be affected by the necessary increases in taxation I have just announced.  There may be some pressure to increase prices in particular concerns to meet current wage demands but it is the Government's view that increased costs of this kind must be met in the first instance from increased productivity or from profits; only in exceptional cases and to the minimum degree will price increases be permitted.  There are many enterprises in which substantial profits are being made or in which productivity is rising at more than the average rate; in these, charges could be reduced and this would help to maintain the overall stability so necessary both to encourage personal savings and to facilitate expansion of exports.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>On incomes, the long debate in this House a few weeks ago provided an opportunity of stating fully the Government's <Col N="1303" /> policy, which in all essentials coincides with the views of the NIEC. In particular, emphasis was laid on the need to keep money income increases in line with the growth of national production so as to avoid further price and cost increases, diminished competitiveness and intensified balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>The NIEC has since considered the estimate of increased national production and other relevant forecasts provided for it by my Department.  The Council has, in effect, accepted the main forecast which was that, if the total wage and salary bill were to rise by not more than 5 per cent, consisting of an average increase in earnings of 3 per cent, an allowance of 1 per cent for &ldquo;drift&rdquo; and an allowance of 1 per cent for increased employment, national output could rise by 3¾ per cent, the rise in prices might be 1¾ per cent, most of which is unavoidable, and the balance of payments deficit could be reduced to about £28 million. This forecast, if realised, would constitute a non-inflationary pattern of economic activity for 1966 and would lay the foundation for faster growth, more in line with the Second Programme targets, in 1967.  The assumed average increase in earnings of 3 per cent would cover not only increases in basic wage and salary rates but also the cost of any additional &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; benefits or reductions in hours of work.</P>
    <P>The Council also examined the economic effects of a higher increase in total wages and salaries and concluded that both prices and the balance of payments deficit would be increased substantially.  Indeed, the Council warned that the rate of deterioration in the economic prospects for 1966, as compared with the Department of Finance projections, might tend to accelerate according as the difference widened between the rate of increase in aggregate money incomes and the rate of increase in national production. The Council repeated the recommendation in its November report on the economic situation to the effect that the Government would need to take fiscal or monetary action to limit the <Col N="1304" /> rise in demand caused by an excessive increase in money incomes.  But as the Council recognises, and as I explained in the Dáil, fiscal or monetary action after the event is at best only of limited utility and itself carries certain dangers.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, issued a statement confirming their view that it would be harmful to the national economy if the average increase in personal incomes over the coming year were to exceed 3 per cent. As I have already indicated several times in this House, within a total increase in incomes consistent with this average the Government would favour special consideration being given to lower-paid employees.  They are urging, in fact, that, to make this possible, no increases should be sought or expected this year in the higher ranges of income, from £1,200 up.  The Government will follow this line in dealing with pay claims in the public sector.</P>
    <P>In the statement issued last evening the Government have also emphasised that, in negotiations for wage and salary increases and improvements in earnings, the foremost consideration in the minds of negotiators and arbitrators should be what the economy can afford without raising prices or endangering employment and production.</P>
    <P>I cannot overstress the importance to Ireland's economic future of heeding the advice of the NIEC on incomes. We know from our own experience in the years 1958 to 1961 how great is the stimulus to real economic progress, without price inflation or balance of payments difficulties, when money incomes stay close to the rate of growth of national production.  We know also from more recent experience how great is the dislocation of progress, accompanied by price and cost increases and balance of payments trouble, when money incomes run ahead of national production.</P>

      <P>Our propensity to import is high: on average, every £10 of money income results in £4 of imports. We are in a world in which trade is becoming freer and more intensely competitive.  The first of the ten tariff <Col N="1305" /> reductions which will end in completely free trade with Britain under the recent Agreement is to take place in July.  We must, therefore, plan our affairs so that no more will be spent on current imports than is earned from exports of goods and services; and that we will earn as much as possible by ensuring that these exports are competitive.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Current Expenditure Trends</i>
      </P>
      <P>Before turning to capital expenditure, I should like to remind those who are critical of the size of current Government expenditure that, by reason of its composition, it is particularly difficult to effect any significant reduction in it.  Remuneration and the cost of servicing the public debt between them constitute about half the total.  Social services, namely, social welfare, health and education, make up a large part of the remainder.  Basic services and economic aids have also to be taken into the reckoning.  Current expenditure, indeed, has a built-in tendency towards growth.</P>
      <P>This year, it will be noted, I made no deduction for errors of estimation when drawing up the current budget. To do so would not have been justified having regard to recent experience and the present critical need to achieve a balance.  Indeed, at a time of unsettled conditions, it is scarcely reasonable to expect that budgetary arrangements made in March or April will continue to fit the year's needs, both financial and economic, until the following March or April.  Last year's experience shows how far off balance a budget can be swung by unforeseen changes. There is also the consideration that the budget is supposed to act as a regulator of the economy&mdash;a function it cannot well perform if action must be frozen for as long as twelve months at a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred a moment ago to the NIEC advice that, if aggregate demand were being pushed too high, fiscal or monetary action should be taken to limit it.  Apart from &ldquo;demand management&rdquo;, as the Council calls it, the possibility has to be faced that, as a result of a general increase in outside <Col N="1306" /> pay, the Government as employer and paymaster may have to find more money than is provided for in the budget.  Other contingencies may arise beyond the capacity of even a buoyant revenue to finance.  For these reasons, and because it is so important this year to avoid a deficit on the current budget, I must give notice that if I find it necessary during the year I shall come back with proposals to raise more revenue. I know this would not be welcome, but to shirk my duty would be indefensible and this requires that I should not countenance the payment of salaries, subsidies or social welfare benefits out of borrowed moneys.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Civil Service Organisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Because of the weight of remuneration in current expenditure, continuing attention is being given to efficiency and economy in administration. The growth in the numbers of Civil Servants is a consequence of the constantly increasing range and complexity of the services required by the modern community.  By increased use of mechanical aids and by reviewing organisation and methods, growth has been restricted, but even restricted growth can add substantially to the already heavy cost of administration. The Civil Service has shown a remarkable capacity to adapt itself to new functions and has been doing its work with great skill, devotion and integrity. Its good qualities are founded on the statutory requirement of open competitive recruitment.  At this stage in the evolution of national policies, when the Service faces responsibilities and tasks going far beyond the earlier concepts of administration, and Departments are expected to become more active agencies of development, it seems timely to arrange for a review of the existing organisation at administrative level.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since any general look was taken at how the Civil Service is functioning in a changing world.  Every organisation can benefit from periodic review.  If a review of this kind is to be done well, it will take time.  Its procedure must be flexible.  Close contact must be maintained with both management and <Col N="1307" /> staff concerned.  A blend of experience of high quality of the working of both the public service and of business will help to make it apt and effective.  It would to my mind best be conducted by a special group combining representatives of the business and professional world and persons no longer serving who have had broad experience in the Civil Service and in State enterprises.  I hope to assemble such a group during the coming months.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Capital Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The public capital programme for 1966/67 has been fixed at a maximum of £97.78 million.  Although this maximum exceeds the Second Programme projection by £3½ million, it is about £3½ million below the expected level of expenditure this year and corresponds with the actual expenditure of 1964/65.  The aim is to stabilise the programme until the resources for it grow sufficiently to enable expansion to be resumed.  To achieve this levelling-off in capital expenditure was difficult and disagreeable; difficult because the upward trend was strong&mdash;expenditure had doubled in five years&mdash;and disagreeable because necessary and desirable projects had to be postponed or restricted.  As was explained, however, in the White Paper issued last October, and as is clear from the state of the balance of payments and the difficulty and cost of raising capital abroad, there is no alternative to arranging a closer balance between expenditure and resources.</P>
    <P>Even though full particulars have been given in the White Paper and in the Capital Budget booklet of how public capital expenditure is financed, there may not be adequate realisation of the extent of the financial problem. I would summarise it this way.  After using all the money provided by depreciation funds, repayments of old loans and other internal funds and after borrowing directly from the public in the form of small savings, national loans and otherwise, there remains a substantial deficit on capital account which can be financed only by borrowing from the banking system <Col N="1308" /> or from external sources.  To this deficit there must be added any deficit incurred in the current budget.  In 1964/65, the combined deficit was covered by borrowing £13½ million from the banks and £5½ million from external sources.  In the year just ending, the combined deficit will have been covered by borrowing no less than £31½ million from the banking system and £15 million from external sources.  Next year, with capital expenditure reduced, the current budget in balance, and, I hope, normal domestic sources making a larger contribution, recourse to the banking system and external borrowing should not have to exceed a total of £28 million.</P>
    <P>A contribution by the commercial banks to the financing of public capital expenditure is legitimate, because in Ireland these banks receive a large part of the current increase in public savings. But I would not seek to defend a situation in which the new resources of the banks were claimed almost exclusively by the public sector and credit had to be unduly curtailed for productive private needs.  It must be acknowledged that over the past year or so the Government and public authorities have been making a disproportionate call on commercial bank resources.</P>

      <P>It was partly in consideration of this that the Sterling-Deutschemark loan of £7 million and the IMF drawing of £8 million were arranged.  The finance which the Government obtained, during the past year, from the banking system included special assistance of £20 million from the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The external borrowing of earlier this year, to which I have just referred, is needed to finance the capital expenditure of 1965/66.  When market conditions look favourable, the Euro-dollar loan, which was postponed last December on the advice of the <Col N="1309" /> managers of the issue, will be proceeded with.  The possibility of raising capital funds elsewhere on acceptable terms may also be explored.</P>
      <P>I am determined, however, that, as soon as possible, there should be a significant lessening of the dependence of the public capital programme both on bank resources and on foreign borrowing.  I am anxious that this should take place without drastic cutting-down of the programme but, if current savings do not improve sufficiently, this may become unavoidable. In any event, I consider that the programme for 1966/67 has been fixed at a level which could not be raised without grave risk of non-fulfilment through shortage of capital.</P>
      <P>On the principle of foreign borrowing, I might add a few words.</P>

      <P>There can be no reasonable objection to supplementing, within moderation, our current domestic savings in order to finance a well-balanced domestic capital programme. The qualifications are, however, important and must be kept in mind.  A &ldquo;well-balanced domestic capital programme&rdquo; is one in which directly productive expenditure bulks large. &ldquo;Moderation&rdquo; must be measured in relation both to the extent of the deficit already existing in the balance of payments and to the prospect of being able to continue to borrow these supplementary needs on acceptable terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland already benefits from a large inflow of investment capital and the Government's shortterm aim is to reduce the deficit in our external payments to a level corresponding to that inflow.  We must ensure, therefore, that the way in which the public capital programme is financed contributes to the achievement of this aim and to the eventual replenishment of our external reserves. To keep direct foreign borrowing over the next few years within a moderate annual limit is desirable both for this reason and because such borrowing, <Col N="1310" /> owing to the world shortage of capital, is both difficult and dear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Public expenditure and incomes I have already dealt with. The third main factor in the inflation from which we have been suffering is bank credit.  it is obviously essential to keep credit increases under restraint in order to achieve the policy objective of a substantial reduction in the balance of payments deficit.  I have, therefore, raised no objection to the terms of the advice conveyed a few days ago to the Associated Banks by the Central Bank.  This advice, which is subject to periodic review, envisages a maximum credit increase of 6 per cent in the year ending March, 1967, and reiterates the need for priority to be given to applications for productive purposes, especially those directly related to the expansion of exports of goods and services.  I have requested the Central Bank to communicate with me when the Bank is reviewing, in the light of the budget and other developments, the question of the degree of credit restraint needed to achieve the objective of a reduction in the balance of payments deficit for 1966 to about £30 million.  Experience has shown that, even if no immediate balance of payments problem existed, it would still be necessary, for good management of the economy, to have a smooth and well-planned development of credit under the guidance of the Central Bank, rather than allow fluctuations in the supply of credit to accentuate other influences making for instability in the economy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Decimal Currency</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent announcement by the British Government that a decimal currency based on the pound is to become effective in Britain from February, 1971, has prompted inquiries about the position here.  Deputies may recall that, having considered the report of the 1959 Committee on the Metric System and Decimal Coinage, the Government, in February, 1962, decided in principle that a decimal system of coinage should be adopted <Col N="1311" /> and that a Working Party should be set up to advise on the appropriate time for the change and the steps necessary to effect it in the most economic way.  The Working Party, whose report was published in May, 1965, recommended the introduction, as soon as possible, of the 10s-cent system.  The Chairman, who was the representative of the Central Bank, recommended in a reservation that, in the event of a change-over taking place in Britain at the same time as here, we should adopt the same system as the British.</P>
    <P>If a decimal currency, whatever its basis, comes into force in Britain in 1971, a synchronised change-over to a decimal currency here would be desirable.  While convenience would suggest the adoption of the same basic unit as the British, a 10s-cent system has technical advantages and I propose, in consultation with the Central Bank, to give further consideration over the coming months to the question of the basic unit which would be most suitable for introduction here in the circumstances envisaged.  Any further views which representative organisations may wish to express on this point would be welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It has had to appear one-sided&mdash;all &ldquo;take&rdquo; and very little &ldquo;give&rdquo;&mdash; simply because the giving had all been done already.  I have had to reject, at least for this year, even the most deserving claims.  Deliberately, I have given the plain facts, convinced that honesty is not only the best policy but also the policy which calls forth the best from our people. As a community, after a long spell of sluggish and erratic development, we entered on a phase of encouraging growth some years ago.  Perhaps the most significant measure of the <Col N="1312" /> advance we have made since 1958 is the rise of one-third in our standard of living.  Other remarkable gains are the increase of industrial output by two-thirds, of employment in industry by 20 per cent and of exports by 70 per cent.  If we have in the past year or so temporarily over-reached our-selves, it was in a natural desire to continue this forward thrust.  We have now to make some adjustments, none of them calamitous, though all, of course, unwelcome. We need not &mdash; and must not &mdash; exaggerate the situation.  This would not merely do us no good; it might do us serious harm.  I could mention quite a number of countries, more advanced than we are, which have been going through a more acute phase of financial and economic difficulties. They take it in their stride.  In a world of trouble, this is still one of the most favoured and comfortable countries to live in.  We are not headed for disaster.  On the contrary, we are moving back to a strong economic position and this budget is designed to help that progress.</P>
      <P>I considered it unnecessary, in view of all the recent documentation and comment on the economic situation, to include any formal review in this speech.  The facts should now be well known and they constitute the back-ground to all I have said.  Since realism is the keynote of this Budget, I would, however, like to refer to what is said on the need for review of the Second Programme targets for 1970 in paragraph 63 of the Progress Report for 1965.  The necessary studies are being undertaken to assess whether, in view of the setback which has occurred over the past year or so owing to internal and external developments, the attainment of these targets is still feasible.  I remain hopeful that they can be achieved, at least in most cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, a word on the immediate outlook.  In the second half of 1965, the economic position already showed signs of improvement.  Inflationary pressures were abated and prices became more stable.  The adverse trend in the balance of trade was reversed. Both agricultural and industrial exports <Col N="1313" /> rose above the levels of the corresponding period of 1964 and the rise in imports slowed down.  This improvement is expected to continue into 1966 and to lead to a higher growth rate and a smaller balance of payments deficit.  To ensure that this expectation will be realised, we must keep, within <Col N="1314" /> the limits we can afford, the three critical forces: public expenditure, incomes and credit.  If we do this, we should not have long to wait before a higher rate of growth is resumed and the further improvements we desire in both economic and social services become possible.</P>

      <P>This is a case of reaping the whirlwind.  This Budget is, in our view, contrary to the requirements of the national economy at the present juncture, and is indicative of the dangerous financial situation into which the Government have led the country.  One of the major responsibilities of any Government who knows their business must be to ensure that their budgetary and financial policies are in accordance with stipulated economic aids.  However true this may have been in the past, it is much truer in the present circumstances in which competition and challenges affect our community from outside.  We all know that it is conceded now that serious mistakes were made by the Government in 1964.  In that year there was a disregard of the country's real credit position and a complete lack of discipline by the Government in their management of economic and financial affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money was readily, available and there was no awareness on the part of the Government, as there should have been, that money incomes had risen dangerously beyond the increase in production and that an unusual and abnormal inflow of foreign capital was concealing as growing, deficit in our balance of payments.  Corrective measures had to be applied when it became apparent last year that these circumstances had led to a situation of serious inflation.  These corrective measures were applied by the Government last June.  There was a credit squeeze; there was retrenchment in expenditure; there was a series of import levies and the cutting back on investment, hire purchase control and so on.  All these measures were deemed by the Government last year to deal with a situation which had arisen, <Col N="1330" /> however it had arisen.  These measures have been in operation since.  They were deflationary measures intended to curb money demand and would have, and did have, the effect of depressing the economy.</P>
    <P>The result of these measures is apparent now in the review of economic progress over the past year.  We have achieved a growth rate of just two and a half per cent compared with four per cent in the previous year and to be contrasted with the 4.3 per cent envisaged in the Second Programme. There was also in the last year a situation in which employment dropped to 1,050,000 people, the lowest recorded figure ever in the history of the country, and in fact the immediate prospect for 1966 is a further drop down to 1,046,000.  These are serious considerations when we find that our present position is that there are at work the lowest number of people in recorded history and when we consider that under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Development</i> it was envisaged that by this year we would have had at work 1,090,000 people.  The actual position now is that there are 1,046,000 people at work and there are 44,000 jobs that apparently have just disappeared.  That is bad enough, but when we realise that now in the third year of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Development</i> of there are 10,000 fewer people at work than there were in 1963, it appears that instead of going forward we are clearly going backwards.  These are some of the facts that must concern and trouble us in relation to the events of the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Corrective measures were applied. They have had the effect of depressing the economy, retarding economic growth and lowering employment.  But they have this effect also: they have apparently started to correct the bad trend in our balance of payments. Apparently, the final deficit this year will be of the order of £44 million instead of the anticipated deficit of £50 million.  It is in the light of the effect of these measures that we must have regard to the Department of Finance's Progress Report on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and <Col N="1331" /> on the prospects for 1966.  This report, which has been circulated to Deputies, looks forward this year to the beginning of a recovery, to a situation in which the depressing effects of last year could be left behind and the country begin to recover.</P>
    <P>The report envisages an economic growth next year of 3¾ per cent in place of the 2½ per cent achieved this year and a reduction in the size of the balance of payments deficit of £28 million.  That prospect, which is a welcome one and which would give some indication of economic recovery, is, however, based on certain assumptions. One of these assumptions is that there will not be this year an abnormal increase in money incomes.  May I say, despite the strong condemnation expressed by the Minister some time ago of the proposal of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for £1 increase, there has been no indication&mdash;in fact, the indications are all to the contrary&mdash; that there will be any irresponsibility with regard to wage demands.  I have little doubt that those in charge of the trade union movement, as, indeed, everybody else in the country at the present juncture, are as aware as is the Minister or anyone concerned of these matters.  The assumption was made that there would not be this year an increase in money incomes beyond 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The second assumption made for economic recovery is stated in paragraph 51, that in making the projections as to what might happen in 1966 existing budgetary policies are assumed.  It is clear that in the Department of Finance Progress Report it is assumed if economic growth is to recover this year that there would not be a change in budgetary policies and that there would not be an increase in taxation.  In fact, the report goes on to indicate in paragraph 57 what would happen if existing budgetary policies were not continued and if action were taken by the Minister to impose considerable increases in taxation.  The report says:</P>
    <P>Such action would, however, react on output and employment so that <Col N="1332" /> the 1 per cent increase in employment projected would not only not be attained, but there might well be a fall in employment.  Moreover, such action could not reverse the increase in prices and costs following the excessive rises in incomes so that the disimprovement in competitiveness would persist and restrictive measures would have to be prolonged beyond 1966.</P>
    <P>There is an indication in that report of what the economic requirements of this country are at the present juncture. The economy, given a fair chance, according to this objective report can stagger out of its difficulties.  Growth can commence again next year and in 1967 we might be going ahead as rapidly as possible provided there is no more taxation, which would have a depressive effect and would have an effect on output and employment.  It is in the light of that we are justified in saying that this Budget is contrary to the economic requirements at the moment and has been brought about because there has been grave mishandling by the Government of this country's financial affairs.</P>
    <P>Last year's Budget ended with a record deficit of £8 million.  That was brought about because the Minister underestimated revenue buoyancy, because he failed to effect savings in the Budget he had anticipated and because there was not an effort made, as he said would be, to control expenditure. The result was that at the end of the period dealt with in the last Budget £8 million was not provided for and had to be borrowed.  It is regrettable that the mismanagement last year was not confined merely to the Budget.  A great deal more of unanticipated money had to be found by the Minister.  He had to find £5 million because there was a shortage in small savings.  He had to find another £4 million because of a shortage in Departmental funds.  He had to pay £3 million to cover the overdraft on State borrowing caused by the credit squeeze.  He had to find £5½ million to pay back to the general public, who were not willing to continue lending to the Government on exchequer bonds. <Col N="1333" /> He had to find £4.3 million for a subscription to the International Monetary Fund.  On top of that, he found his Budget in deficit and he had to borrow £8 million to pay for that.  The result was that last year close on £30 million had to be raised by borrowing&mdash;£20 million from the Central Bank and, the last straw, we had the mission abroad to raise money in America, which failed, and subsequently the money had to be raised in Germany.</P>
    <P>That is the sad record on the financial front in the past 12 months.  The result of all that is that now at this juncture, when the economy is beginning to show sings of recovery, the Minister has forced himself into a situation that he has come in to raise £12½ million extra taxation&mdash;the highest recorded increase in taxation in a single Budget&mdash;at a time when his advisers and everybody else indicate this is just the wrong thing to do.  I do not know what the outcome of this will be.  I am sorry the Minister should find himself in this situation.  It is depressing enough for the country.  It is depressing that things done last year had to be done.  I can see, as can anyone else, circumstances in which it may be justifiably proper to borrow abroad, but I can see no basis for the manner in which the borrowing took place last year.  The public relations end of the Minister's Department was deplorably bad.  In fact, the effect of seeking the dollar loan and subsequently the German loan was such as to shake internal confidence in the country itself and in the economy, as I believe, without justification.  So far as we are concerned, as we have often said from these benches, we have no doubt that the economy is as sound as a bell.  We believe that, given a chance, we can proceed with a satisfactory economic growth.  The only difficulty has been the manner in which those at present in charge are handling the finances because there has been mishandling of national finances with a Budget which is economically unsound now being forced on the country.</P>
    <P>This taxation is bad.  Eightpence on income tax is a wage cut and nothing <Col N="1334" /> else.  That means that the take-home pay of every worker will be reduced. The Minister gave a warning in the debate on prices and incomes here some weeks ago that if there was an exaggerated, abnormal or unjustified increase in money incomes, he would bring in taxation to take away the excess.  He seems to be doing that now, although there has not been an increase. In fact, the object and purpose of this is to reduce money incomes, and the effect of this is to cut wages.</P>
    <P>The other taxation imposed will also have a serious and depressing effect, for instance, beer at 2d a pint. I do not want to go over again the old arguments we had about that, but certainly that taxation will add considerably to the difficulties affecting working people.  It is well to remember that in the past 12 months the Minister for Industry and Commerce attacked the licensed trade in relation to the price of stout and beer.  What was it all about?  Beer is now being taxed again, and that, in my view, will have a very bad effect.</P>
    <P>The other taxation to which I want to refer is the tax on motor cars.  This is another excessive item of taxation on what cannot be regarded as a luxury.  The private motor vehicle is now the essential means of conducting the employment of many people in this country.  This taxation will have the effect of bringing costs for beyond the one per cent indicated by the Minister. On top of an increase in motor taxation, there is once again an increase in the tax on petrol and oil. That will have a serious effect on many people in the way of transport and travelling around and will also affect distributive costs.</P>
    <P>All of this taxation has been rushed into in a panicky way by the Government. They have been appalled by what took place last year and they have taken panicky decisions.  They have rushed into this record Budget without properly considering its likely effect on the economy.  The effect will be in many ways disastrous.  In a Budget now sufficiently removed from the last general election, it might have been possible, if things had been well handled, to do some of the things <Col N="1335" /> that all of us said we hoped would be done when the people were last consulted.</P>
    <P>Here again is a Budget with no provision for an improvement in health services; no provision for an improvement in education.  There is nothing for agriculture.  There is nothing in this Budget to provide for an era of free trade which is going to be ushered in shortly.  There is nothing in this Budget to protect or expand employment. There is one very small provision made for social welfare, postponed again until next November. When are we going to end this?  One of the difficulties in which the Minister finds himself in relation to last year's Budget is that this year, in a full year, he has to pay for the social welfare payments promised in the last Budget.  Again there is this token of a social welfare adjustment, an increase postponed to the end of the year so that the cost in the current year will be insignificant.  These things are bad, and I believe they indicate the mismanagement of our financial affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the outcome of this Budget will be.  The Minister says we cannot afford a further deficit.  I am certain that is so.  I cannot see, as things are at the moment, how we could have a continuance this year of the pre-empting by the Government of all available credit in the country.  If that were to happen again in this coming year, the economy would certainly go on the rocks.  We cannot afford to let that happen and I certainly can understand the Minister saying that this year's Budget must be balanced.  That would be a novel experience for a Fianna Fáil Minister for Fianance, because the Budget for 1965-66 is just the same as each previous Budget for the past six years.  Each Budget was in deficit and the result was that over the past six years there has been an accumulation of Budget deficits coming to £20,500,000, all of which had to be met by borrowing.  Therefore, the problem is a serious one and, as the Minister indicates, we cannot have a deficit this year.  Whatever happens, I hope he will be able to restore order to the national finances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> It is depressing, and is also indicative of the very serious financial situation we are in, that the Capital Budget this year contains in paragraph 20 an admission by the Government of the possibility that it will not be able to finance that Capital Budget.  That is certainly indicative of a very strange bit of mishandling of the nation's finances.  I think I should not sit down without reminding the House that we also have in this Budget Statement an indication that this may not be the end of it.  I should have thought that a Budget enjoying additional taxation to the extent of £12,500,000 would be the end of the story, but no.  So serious is the financial situation that the Minister has had to say that he may have to come back again in the autumn to blister the people more.  It certainly seems to indicate that we are still a long distance away from a Just Society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget is no help whatever to the country in its present difficulties and, listening to the Minister and glancing over his speech which he furnished to us, I regard it as an abject confession of failure on the part of the Government.  It is regrettable that a decent Deputy like Deputy Jack Lynch should have to come into the House as Minister for Finance to make this abject confession of failure.  There are no guidelines in the Budget speech which the Minister for Finance read out here today.  This Budget is merely being used as a money-collecting machine.</P>
      <P>I frankly admit that one of the main functions of the Budget is to impose taxes and to make allowances in certain directions.  The only message in this Budget is: &ldquo;Give us the money&rdquo;&mdash;to the extent of £12½ million.  There is no indication to me as to what the Government propose to do within the coming 12 months.  We are told by the Minister that the outlook is bleak, so bleak that it may be necessary for him to introduce a Supplementary Budget some time later on in the year.  I presume that this Budget would have been far worse but for the fact that two elections&mdash;one, at least&mdash;must take place this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had plenty of advice in this <Col N="1337" /> Budget as to what we should do but there is no positive advice.  Every single piece of advice contained in the document read out by the Minister was restraint, restraint, restraint.  I believe there is necessity for restraint in some quarters but if the country is to get back on its feet again, I think there should be some positive direction, some positive lead, by the Government, and that is absent in the document which the Minister read out to this House today.</P>
    <P>This, I said, is merely a device to collect money in order that the deficiencies in Government policy over the past few years might be paid off.  I think we should contrast this situation with the optimism shown in the Budget speech of 1965.  There was indeed optimism in it, even though it did happen to be after an election when the country was told it could now look forward to increases and improvements in all sectors of the economy.  But the Government have been, in a sort of side way, taking refuge in outside influences and outside factors.  They have talked on occasion about the British import surcharge, although the Minister for Industry and Commerce was honest enough to say that it did not have the effect it was anticipated it would have when it was first imposed.  There was also the excuse of the levelling-off in the rate of expansion in Britain.  That seems an abject admission by the Government&mdash;and, if it is so, then they should say it clearly&mdash;that our economy is not independent, that our economy is dependent on the British economy.</P>
    <P>When things go right for the Government, they claim credit for it.  They have done so.  Things went right for them in 1962, 1963 and 1964 because world conditions were favourable to improvement in every single country, particularly in Western Europe.  But, when things go wrong for the Government, they try to find someone else to blame and there is nobody better to do that than the Minister for Transport and Power.  His target seems to be the trade union movement at the present time.  Other Ministers have taken their own targets.  They never <Col N="1338" /> admit they have made mistakes, although they certainly have made mistakes in the past two or three years. Therefore, they stand accused, as a Government, of incompetence.  Most good things that happened in the past two or three years would have happened, anyway, no matter what Government were in office.  We have always complained, from this side of the House, that while the Fianna Fáil Party were pretending to be somewhat progressive, left or socialist, they did not give a positive lead.  They gave out inducements so that certain things could happen and, as I have said, they were fortunate in 1962, 1963 and 1964.</P>
    <P>Here, we are now in a position that there is a shortage of money, not alone for capital purposes but to pay for the State services.  I think, again, the Government can well be accused of not spending money prudently in certain directions.  About three years ago, the Taoiseach said, in the course of many of his speeches at that time, that there was plenty of money for capital projects.  Particularly during election times, he said that no matter what project was put forward by a local authority or any group of individuals, money could be found for it.</P>
    <P>Money has been dissipated in recent years.  The Government were foolish to expect that the inflow of foreign money would continue.  They should have anticipated that it would dry up. They were caught on the wrong foot when it dried up unexpectedly in 1965. They made many mistakes prior to by-elections.  It was often said that Fianna Fáil were honest in their presentation of the facts but I say that that has not been so in recent years, particularly at times of by-elections and general elections when they made commitments, many of which they could not honour.  To their detriment, it can be said that they have dissipated a lot of money.</P>
    <P>An artificial boom was created. Members of the Government Party, not necessarily members of the Front Bench but members of the back benches and those in the Fianna Fáil organisation, went so far as to say that it was at the Government's behest that the 12 per cent was given on <Col N="1339" /> wages in 1964.  The Minister for Transport and Power now cries over that 12 per cent but it was used in two by-elections and general elections as a means to get votes for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told at the last election that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, the boom would continue.  I do not want to dwell on the subject of slogans: we all have slogans during election times.  However, we were told that the Fianna Fáil Party were the only Party in which the people could repose confidence and they were returned to office on the basis of the promises they made to the Irish people.  Now, I think we can say that the danger signals we stressed have become very real indeed.  I do not expect the Fianna Fáil Government or members of it to take heed of what the Labour Party say in respect of this, that and the other.  One of the unfortunate things about the Government is that while they state they accepted certain recommendations and proposals from the NIEC, they merely accepted them in principle and, since these reports were made to the Government, I do not know in many cases whether the Government took positive action to implement these worthwhile proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that is stressed in this country is the importance of increased production.  One of the big factors in increased production is a utilisation of the manpower of this country and the Government have failed completely in that.  Not alone have they failed to give Irishmen and Irishwomen an opportunity to work in this country but they have failed to utilise them in order to produce more and, as a consequence, to export more.  We are not using the manpower that is available here as far as the recommendations of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> are concerned.  The policy in respect of employment has fallen flat on its face as, indeed, have all the other targets in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> We, on these <Col N="1340" /> benches, repeat what we said when the Programme was first introduced, namely, that it was merely a forecasting and a programming.  Whilst certain efforts were made in certain directions, there was no thrust to ensure that these targets would be reached in the industrial and agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>This chart in the report of the NIEC shows that in respect of practically all of these things, we do not seem to be any nearer the targets than we were two or three years ago and all the indications are that we will not achieve them by 1970.  It is time the Minister for Finance made the announcement he made today that the Programme would be re-examined to set new targets.  If the targets will be lowered, it does not augur well for those who expect to be employed here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned employment. I want to talk about it as well.  Despite what the members of the Fianna Fáil Government say, despite the boom that has been boasted about, is it not amazing that, in 1965, 2,500 fewer people were in employment here?  What is the use in talking about the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> or in Ministers talking about the new factories that have been established when the plain fact is&mdash;and this is the test&mdash;that over four years 2,500 fewer people are employed here?</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made to explain to the House and to the country why it is that in the past year 14,000 people left the land of Ireland.  The Department of Finance did not attempt to explain that fully in their report circulated to us recently.  As a matter of fact, the NIEC cannot explain why 14,000 people left the rural parts of this country in order to try to get employment in the towns and cities or, unfortunately, to get it across the water. The result was that last year, despite the much-boasted efforts of the Government, we lost 7,000 people from employment. One of the worst features about the whole situation is that the National Industrial and Economic Council forecast is that there will be a further drop of 4,000 in employment. <Col N="1341" /> Did anyone anticipate when the First Programme was introduced&mdash;granted it was an experiment&mdash;but did anyone anticipate when the well-prepared Second Programme was introduced that four years afterwards there would be fewer people employed in the next four years?</P>
    <P>There have been no specific proposals in regard to a manpower policy. Here we have one of the most valuable assets that any country in western Europe would be glad to have, a surplus of manpower, skilled people who want to work for their country and in their country and who, because they have not the opportunity to work in industry, must remain idle on unemployment assistance or emigrate. We have a similar serious situation in regard to emigration and the trend in unemployment indicates that it has been on the increase for the past four years. As far as I can gather from these figures, they show that the increase in unemployment from June to December in the past four years was the highest in 1965.  Those who look at these statistics every week will see that the upward trend in unemployment is increasing this year.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister and by the Department of Finance that a three per cent increase in earnings is all the economy can afford.  After two years of a wages standstill, are we now to be told that a man with £10 a week should be offered 6/- a week increase in lieu of the increase in the cost of living?  Is it seriously considered that this man is going to be able to maintain his 1963 or 1964 standard of living by getting an increase of 6/- per week, or that the man with £8 per week should be satisfied with an increase of 4/9d.?  It appears to me that it is the old, old story, that this is the type of person who is still being asked to bear the burden and make the sacrifices.</P>
    <P>If new taxes are to be imposed or taxes are to be increased, these taxes and these increases should be imposed on those who can best afford them. The 2d. on the pint and the 2d. on the glass of whiskey are not going to affect a certain section of the community.  The tax on cars is not going to affect the <Col N="1342" /> person in a certain income bracket. Surely the Government, with their experience&mdash;they have been there for 25 or 30 years&mdash;should be able to devise a system of graded taxation and not have the burden placed on every single person to such an extent that the cost of living will increase.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Government should be able to so manage the affairs of this country that more than 4/9d. per week could be offered to the man with £8 per week.  People in this city are inclined to think in terms of people earning £20, £25 or even those with £15 per week but when we talk of a man working in a factory in a rural area, we are talking of a man with a wage of £8, £9 or £10 a week and that is the type of man to whom it is proposed to offer increases of from 4/9d. to 6/- per week.  An increase of so little on such a small sum is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>We have all the old reliables taxed in this Budget.  The predecessor of the present Minister, Dr. Ryan, said that these things could not be taxed any more.  He said that their taxation had reached the point of diminishing returns, that they had reached saturation point.  He gave that as the reason, or some of the reason, why he should introduce a turnover tax.  I am glad to see that the Government have been dissuaded, except in the case of dance-halls, from increasing that turnover tax.  The introduction of that tax was to a large extent responsible for the dilemma in which we find ourselves at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase road tax by 25 per cent.  I remember the sneers and jibes of the Fianna Fáil Party when they accused an Inter-Party Government of raiding the Road Fund. This was one of the principles on which Fianna Fáil stood fast, not to raid the Road Fund.  Now the Minister for Finance is going to get 25 per cent, perhaps £1¼ million, and he knows in his heart that that money is needed to ensure that our roads are put in proper repair and that we will have good roads.  And the Taoiseach stands idly by and allows this to happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> There are many people who tax their cars for the whole year and, for this year at least, this tax will hit only the poor man.  Those who tax their cars in January and tax them for the full year will not mind about this but the man who has to tax his car every quarter, the small farmer and the man who has to use his car to go to work, will have to bear the burden this year. And this tax is to be taken for Exchequer purposes from the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>It is time that Fianna Fáil became converted to the idea of a tax on dancing.  This was a tax to which we subscribed when we were members of the Government but for some peculiar reason this tax was taken off.  Now they have introduced it as a turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The social welfare classes are to get 5/- per week.  The Minister hopes to get £12.5 million from this new taxation. He hopes to have a quarter of a million over with which he does not know what to do and it is to be thrown to the dog again.  His outlook is to look after everybody and then, if he has anything over, he will give it to the old age pensioners. I give full credit to the Minister for what he did last year and the 5/- is welcome but it does not sweeten the pill of the Budget.  It is operative only from 1st November.  The usual time for this was 1st August but in order to save about £100,000, he is putting it up to November.  These are the type of people who do not expect to live for so many years.  They are people of 70, 75 and 80 years of age and to ask them to look forward to an extra 5/- from March to November is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this is an honest statement.  Perhaps it is, because I believe the Minister is an honest man, but it is a pity the Government were not more honest with the people since 1957.  It is a pity they gave the impression that everything was just right and that people then had to be pulled up so quickly in 1965/66.  This Budget takes no account of those of modest means, because the bulk of it as indirect taxation will fall on those who can ill afford to pay it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> The Minister for Finance said, as far as I could gather&mdash;perhaps he gave a firm figure&mdash;that these proposals would mean an increase of about one per cent in consumer prices.  I should like to remind him that the National Industrial and Economic Council forecast an increase of 1¾ per cent in consumer prices, that is, if nothing happened as far as Budget proposals were concerned.  The Government will have that problem again this year, a problem they have created themselves. Because this Budget holds out no hope for the coming year, we do not believe it is a good Budget, but more particularly do I say this because no direction is given, no specific proposals are contained in the Budget for increasing employment and consequently increasing production.  It is a bad Budget, a bleak Budget and an abject admission of failure by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That income tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1966, at the rate of seven shillings in the pound.</P>
      <P>(2)  That sur-tax for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1966, shall be charged in respect of the income of any individual the total of which from all sources exceeds two thousand five hundred pounds and shall be so charged at the same rates as those at which it is charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1965.</P>
      <P>(3)  That the several statutory and other provisions which were in force on the 5th day of April, 1966, in relation to income tax and sur-tax shall have effect in relation to the income tax and sur-tax to be charged as aforesaid for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions <Col N="1345" /> of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose this proposal because, as Deputy O'Higgins said an increase in income tax under PAYE can only be regarded as a wage cut.  Under PAYE the net has been widened to catch a number of people who formerly were not liable to tax and in view of the advice which was given in the report prepared by the Department of Finance and the NIEC comments on it in which it was suggested no changes were necessary, this attempt to raise a total of £4.2 million in additional taxation, arising from an increase of 8d. in the standard rate of tax can only be regarded as penal, as equivalent to a wage cut, as contrary to the interests of the economy, as depressing in its effects and as contrary to the expressed views of those who had considered it first, in the Department of Finance and secondly, in the NIEC.  We regard it as bad, as excessive in the circumstances and contrary to the incentives which are necessary if we are to recover economic confidence and make the improvements which are necessary and for these reasons we propose to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We also oppose this because apparently the Minister did not have the knowledge that he told us the week before last he would have, when we were discussing the cost of increasing income tax allowances for lower paid people.  It is quite <Col N="1346" /> obvious the Minister has taken the easy way out and put a tax on all round with no attempt to level off the situation. The £30 additional allowance for each child over 11 years, as the Minister surely appreciates, will represent about £8 a year in the case of persons paying full tax.  Does he consider that makes any worthwhile difference so far as taxation is concerned?  Incidentally, for most of those people who are trying to run an old jalopy it means they will be paying more than that amount in additional road tax for the car for the year.</P>
      <P>With the increase in tax all round, the increase in taxation will hit the unfortunate farm labourer earning £8 odd per week, who is possibly a man looking after a mother or a sister who is house-keeping for him, and who will now have to pay tax on £2 odd.  Surely the Minister does not think that is the correct way to tax people according to their means.  At the other end is the person, as we pointed out the week before last, who is running a car from some 40 or 50 miles away into Dublin every day for the purpose of doing a day's work and going home each evening, paying for the upkeep of the car, paying for meals in town and paying tax and now having to pay additional tax.  The Minister makes no extra allowance for such people.  They are still in the same situation.  Then he brings in this Budget and expects this House to accept it.  We oppose the resolution.</P>

(2)  That the duty of customs imposed by section 1 of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 4) Act, 1931 (No. 43 of 1931), as amended by subsequent enactments, shall, in respect of mineral hydrocarbon light oil chargeable with that duty, be charged, levied and paid as on and from the 10th day of March, 1966, at the rate of 3s. 8d. the gallon in <Col N="1349" /> lieu of the rate specified in subsection (2) of section 14 of the Act of 1965.</P>

    <P>The effect of the Resolution would be to add three and eleven-twelfths of a penny per gallon on petrol and diesel road fuel, the differential permitting an increase of fourpence and taking into account turnover tax.  As usual, it will not affect the public road transport service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if this gives any extra margin to the trade or is it all absorbed by taxation? We are opposed to it in any event because it will raise the cost of distribution and impose a heavy additional burden on transport generally.  Leaving aside the diesel exemption, it applies to lorries and private transport, which are already being caught by increased taxation.  It will add to distributive costs as well as to the costs of transport for those using their own cars to get to <Col N="1352" /> and from work.  Consequently, we are opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are also opposed to it because 4d. per gallon makes a mockery of the Minister's suggestion that all the Budget increases will represent only 1 per cent on consumer prices.  Distributive costs alone will be increased by that much as a result.  In addition, the comment I made earlier in respect of income tax applies here also.  People now use motor transport to drive very much further to work.  Apparently, the Minister does not appreciate this.  Every time the cost of driving to work goes up, the wage goes down.  If the Minister would only appreciate that, he might have taken a different decision in this case.  This is something we feel we cannot support in principle.</P>

    <P>(4)  That the expression &ldquo;hard <Col N="1356" /> pressed tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Part II of the Schedule to and the next paragraph of this Resolution has the same meaning as it has in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1940 (No. 14 of 1940).</P>
    <P>(5)  That the expression &ldquo;other pipe tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Part II of the Schedule to this Resolution means manufactured tobacco of kinds normally intended to be used in pipes, not being hard pressed tobacco.</P>
    <P>(6)  That, subject to the provisions of paragraph (7) of this Resolution, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th day of March, 1966, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    <P>(7)  That the duty provided for by paragraph (6) of this Resolution shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th day of March, 1966, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership or possession it was at that time; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  it was at that time held as <Col N="1357" /> retail stock in premises used for selling tobacco by retail; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  it was at that time in transit from seller to buyer under a contract of sale:</P>
    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to have been fully prepared for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(8)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 16th March.  1966, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th day of March, 1966, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (8) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>(b)  render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th March, 1966.</P>
    <P>(10)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution or on the 16th day of March, 1966, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in this <Col N="1358" /> Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th day of March, 1966, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the 1st day of November, 1966, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(11)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (9) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(12)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for by paragraph (6) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (6) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>
    <P>(13)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

    <P>I should like to explain this in view of the complications involved by reason of the Agreement with the United Kingdom which was recently signed. The effect of this Resolution is to raise the duties on tobacco by the equivalent of 2d. per packet of 20 standard size cigarettes (minus a margin for turnover tax).  It also proposes to impose a special excise duty at an equivalent rate on all duty-paid stocks of manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco held by tobacco manufacturers at 5 p.m. today.  There is also a provision to implement, as from the 1st July next, certain provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement by (a) applying special reduced rates of customs duty to cigarettes and other manufactured tobacco products of United Kingdom origin and (b) extending, in part, the rebates on home-manufactured hard pressed and other pipe tobaccos to similar imported products of United Kingdom origin.</P>

      <P>No.  We have special reduced rates of excise duty which would be regarded as preferential <i>visá-vis</i> tobacco imported from Britain, and under the Free Trade Area Agreement, we will not affect these duties so as to avoid the preference being extended to Irish-made tobacco products. The tobacco manufacturers in Ireland opted for the application of the rebate as to one-tenth over a period of ten years, and part of this Resolution applies that one-tenth rebate to British tobacco.</P>

      <P>On this Financial Resolution, I want to say I do not think this House knows the nature of what it is doing.  You cannot take Financial Resolutions, as we are doing here today, one after another and treat them in isolation.  I ask the House to pause for a moment to consider what these Financial Resolutions will mean to a man earning £10 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one Financial Resolution.  We can discuss some of them now, which the Taoiseach will not like.  Have we reached the stage now in this country that we lay it down in the sovereign Parliament of this country that anyone who earns £10 a week is indulging in reprehensible self-indulgence if he smokes one packet of cigarettes a week?  We are to be asked to deal not with one Resolution but with one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine separate Resolutions. I admit that when we deal with the firearms Resolution, we are not concerned with the circumstances of the ordinary citizens of this country.  But I want to submit to the House that, as we proceed to tax, in this Resolution, tobacco, having taxed petrol and raised income tax, including that payable under PAYE, already by some other Resolutions, we are building up a burden to be borne not by the rich of this country but by the ordinary citizens, in an effort to raise funds, unless Dáil Éireann is proclaiming the doctrine that any ordinary citizen can legitimately be called upon to deliver himself from the impact of this tax by abstaining hereafter from the consumption of tobacco, beer, spirits and his children from lemonade.  I remember that last year this House was called upon seriously to account for its failure to discuss adequately the Financial Resolutions.  I know that we have tomorrow in which to discuss the Budget but it is no harm for the House to open its mind to the facts now of the details as they come before us of <Col N="1363" /> the whole instrument we shall be called upon to discuss tomorrow.</P>

I challenge him to defend his record.  He has a duty to do so.  I have retired.</P>

      <P>The Chair is the ultimate authority and on him only I must confidently leave my right to debate any matter in this House.  I propose to debate tobacco for some time and I am sure I will have your full and happy co-operation, Sir.  On whom do Deputies opposite think this tax will fall? How far does Deputy MacEntee think this tax will affect the ordinary man? What proportion of our people use tobacco?  I have been present at 32 Budgets in this House.  In a great number of these, a change has been made in the tobacco tax.  I do not think I do Deputy MacEntee an injustice when I say that in every Budget he introduced in this House in which he <Col N="1368" /> increased the tax on tobacco, he added: &ldquo;But as I do not wish to put a burden on the old age pensioners, I include a provision in this exempting hard-pressed tobacco&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think this is the first or second time in my recollection that the Minister has come in here and said that our circumstances this year are so desperate that he could not continue that concession. In this tax we make, and rightly make, a special provision for the protection of Irish industry in so far as it is engaged in the tobacco industry.  For the first or second time in my recollection in 32 years in this House, the Resolution to tax tobacco contains no concession for the old age pensioner.</P>
      <P>It is true that in a later part of his Financial Statement the Minister has provided an increase of 5/- per week. In case Deputy MacEntee should labour under the delusion that that is designed to cover every old age pensioner who has to pay the tax, I would call his attention to the sentence in the statement which says: &ldquo;That concession is designed only for old age pensioners who have no means.&rdquo;  Deputy MacEntee and I know rural and urban Ireland well enough to realise that the old age pensioner who has no means constitutes a very small minority of those old age pensioners who will be badly hit because they will have to pay this tobacco tax.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to wake to where they are going. They have sunk lower than I have ever seen a Party sink before in this House and their humiliation is such that they are dragging us down with them.  We will talk about that in greater detail on the General Resolution but let every Deputy who votes for this tax know that he is not only voting for a tax on tobacco but also to tax every old age pensioner, with this exemption that we will compensate those of them who are utterly destitute and have no means of livelihood at all by 5/- a week as from next November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember that these people will have to come in hat in hand and proclaim themselves destitute before they qualify for the compensatory payments <Col N="1369" /> designed to offset the levy their neighbours are now called upon to pay. Cheer that one.  I say to the Fianna Fáil Party: &ldquo;Cheer that decision if you dare.&rdquo;  I am ashamed of you.  I am ashamed of the degradation into which we are all dragged down today. I am perhaps hypersensitive because I remember better than a great many Deputies in this House the contemptuous prophecies that were made that, given the right to control our own destinies, we would disgrace ourselves. I do not believe that is true but I am ashamed that we are taxing the tobacco of the poor.</P>

The smokers of the country are entitled to know what they actually pay to the State when they buy a packet of cigarettes or tobacco.  I should like the Minister to tell us the total tax, including the turnover tax, on those four items, 20 standard cigarettes, 20 tipped cigarettes, an ounce of pressed tobacco and an ounce of non-pressed tobacco.</P>

      <P>First, I should deal with the hysterical intervention of Deputy Dillon who made it appear that for the first time we are imposing a tax on tobacco.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when in 1956 the increase imposed was twice as much, 4d on the packet of 20, which perhaps would represent 6d at the present time. This beating of breasts for people who smoke cigarettes and tobacco sounds a bit hollow coming from people who themselves imposed and voted for these tax increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Murphy, the increase <Col N="1370" /> on the packet of 20 standard cigarettes will be 2d which will include an allowance for turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will vary according to the quality and brand of tobacco. It would be about one and three-fifths of a penny.  The differential between hard-pressed tobacco and flake tobacco &mdash;which is the other kind generally smoked&mdash;is about 1/6d per ounce. That cannot be the same in all cases because the differential varies with the price of the particular brand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

The Minister mentioned 1/6d an ounce on hard-pressed tobacco&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it was much more than that before the Budget so that the Minister's figure must be incorrect.  Am I right in saying the Minister has not got the information and that the tax on non-pressed <Col N="1371" /> tobacco will be in the region of 3/8d per ounce?  Instead of the Minister giving me the figures, I am giving them to him.  Somebody going into a shop for an ounce of hard-pressed tobacco&mdash; and that is 86 per cent of the pipe smokers, according to the Minister&mdash; will be paying the State 3/8d on average, with slight variations according to brand.  Perhaps it would be better to let the Minister give the figures officially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinary cigarettes are going up by 2d for 20 and tipped cigarettes by 2d also.  If I heard correctly, the tax element is one and <Col N="1372" /> three-fifths of a penny which goes to the Government but who gets the remainder of the 2d in the case of the tipped cigarettes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to answer these questions now or even as Parliamentary Questions because the duty on tobacco is paid on leaf in bond and when the leaf comes out of bond, it goes into the manufacturing stage.  It is not possible to know exactly to what extent tobacco goes into the tipped cigarettes.  The Deputy asked what part of the 2d is for taxation purposes.  All of the 2d, less the turnover content of the 2d, is for taxation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister does not get the point.  If ordinary cigarettes go up by 2d on a packet, and if a tipped cigarette with less tobacco in it also goes up, the Government will not get the full 2d.  Who is getting the balance?  Is it the cigarette company? If so, what arrangements have been made with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when there is price control, because it is not an even 2d the Government will get? Will it be the cigarette company or the retailers who will get it?  We are entitled to know who will get it.  If the Minister does not know, he should know.</P>

      <P>Am I now?  I can listen to other arrogance and I do not hit back too hard.  I am trying to explain that the imposition of tax is on leaf as it comes in.  It is very difficult to follow all the manufactured uses of tobacco thereafter but the new tax will relate to the issue at that stage and I am only trying to relate it to that.  It will be roughly about 2d on a packet making due allowance for the turnover tax and other increases on hard-pressed <Col N="1373" /> tobacco and so on that I referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am either expressing myself very badly or the Minister's skull is as defective as my own.  Since the amount of tobacco in tipped cigarettes will not be the equivalent of the 2d, have the companies been given the privilege by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to keep portion of the 2d?  They will increase the price by 2d and there will not be 2d worth in the packet.</P>

The Minister in his Budget speech on page 7 spoke about specific proposals and dealt with the specific <Col N="1375" /> proposals and the expected yield and then he went on until he came to tobacco and the specific proposal as far as tobacco was concerned was the equivalent of 2d per packet of 20 cigarettes and the yield was £1.10 million.  The impression the Minister has given, whether he intended it or not, by the particular phrasing is that on every packet of 20 cigarettes there is going to be an additional tax of 2d.

      <P>I am doing so at the urgent request of Deputy Dunne.  It is all very well for the neophytes in the Labour Party, like Deputy Norton and others, to misunderstand the procedure of this House.  What we are now discussing is not what was in the Minister's speech but what is in Financial Resolution No. 3.  Financial Resolution No. 3 leaves no room for doubt in the mind of any Deputy who can read and understand.  The proposal before the House is to put a duty on tobacco by weight and not by number.  If the Deputies who are puzzled by this will take the trouble of reading the White Paper circulated, they will see that unmanufactured tobacco will be chargeable by the pound.  Manufactured tobacco is similarly to be chargeable by the pound.  The tax is not levied per unit on the packet.  It is levied on the tobacco by weight.  I hope you will understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister in this Resolution is asking the House to impose a tax on tobacco.  The House is entitled to the benefit of his assistance as to what the effect of this Resolution will be.  It would appear from the Minister's speech that he anticipated the effect of the Resolution would be to increase the price of 20 cigarettes by 2d.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether he believes as a result of this Resolution the price of 20 cigarettes will be increased by 2d and if he will approve of that increase.  The next <Col N="1377" /> question I want him to answer is: does he believe that 2d per packet of 20 non-tipped cigarettes is an adequate price to cover the tax?  If he does, it follows as a matter of course that 2d per packet of 20 tipped cigarettes will be more than adequate to cover the tax.  What the House wants to know is what is to happen the excess over the amount necessary to cover the tax on 20 tipped cigarettes.  Those are two simple questions I would like the Minister to answer.</P>

      <P>As I tried to explain and as Deputy MacEntee pointed out, the duty is imposed on leaf tobacco at the rate of 3/5d per lb.  I said in the course of my introductory statement that it would be the equivalent of 2d on 20 cigarettes.  I meant that to apply to the standard type of cigarette.  Everybody knows what the standard type of cigarette is&mdash;untipped, uncorked or without any other kind of tip.  There are larger cigarettes than the standard type.  Naturally, these would carry what would be a higher increase than 2d, while cork tipped <Col N="1378" /> cigarettes would carry a lesser increase than 2d.  Again, I am not able to say exactly what the increase on all brands of cigarettes will be because it will vary with the size and with the type of tip.</P>

    <P>(4)  That there shall be allowed and paid on the exportation as merchandise or the shipment for use as stores of beer on which it is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, that duty at a rate provided by paragraph (2) or paragraph (3) of this Resolution has been paid, a drawback calculated according to the original specific gravity of the beer, at the rate of seventeen pounds, nineteen shillings and eight pence on every thirty-six gallons of beer of which the original specific gravity was one thousand and fifty-five degrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution increases the duty on beer by 2d a pint. This must be considered in the light of an inquiry held last year into beer prices.  This proposal makes a complete mockery of that inquiry.  As a result of the inquiry, an order was made directing a reduction of 2d a pint and this applied irrespective of whether any increase has been made in the price of drink.  It was inequitable and unfair in so far as it applied to publicans whose prices had not been increased as well as to those who had increased prices. Now, the Government propose to raise the price by the equivalent of the reduction made in the order.  As well, the licensed trade, in common with other trades and businesses, must meet increased rates and other demands, a variety of additional charges, including distributive charges because of increases in the price of petrol and oil.</P>
      <P>We feel this tax also is unnecessary. When the turnover tax was introduced, one of the reasons given was that the traditional sources of revenue were incapable of bearing additional taxation. This Budget now imposes taxation on traditional items by a further £12½ million.  It seems the traditional sources not merely were not incapable but have borne very substantial additional taxation and that beer and spirits have borne more than a fair share.  There are considerable numbers of people employed in these trades, apart from owners of licensed premises and their employees, and their interests may well be adversely affected by this. We feel it is unnecessary, that it is contrary to the advice given in the Report of the Department of Finance and the NIEC comments on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Leader <Col N="1385" /> of the Opposition has reminded the Minister that his predecessor came into office to justify the turnover tax.  The principal ground on which he justified it was that the traditional sources of revenue&mdash;tobacco and petrol&mdash;were no longer available to him and that an increase in taxation upon either of these items would have the result of diminishing returns.  This Budget, and the one that went before it, of course, reveal that that claim was a shameless falsehood.  I freely admit that the Minister was not then the Minister for Finance.  He will not however, wish to divest himself of his joint responsibility as a member of the Government.  The Minister made that affirmation in the House in the hearing of those then present.</P>
      <P>I wonder, when we tax beer, as we propose today, to the tune of £2¼ million, if we ask ourselves the question: Who is to pay it?  It will certainly not be paid by the wealthy in this country because they simply have not got the capacity to absorb the beer to produce £2¼ million.  From the very estimate we give of the probable yield of this tax it is manifestly based on the conviction that it will be consumed by those who cannot afford to consume spirits or wine but who feel it no extravagance on occasions to drink beer.  I see now, and I am not surprised, that the Minister is left alone in the Fianna Fáil benches with the distinguished exception of Deputy Kennedy from Wexford.  That valiant soul should be remembered.  Even Deputy MacEntee has fled the scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in discussing a previous Resolution, justified what he did today by the fact that the same was done in 1956.  Did he advert to the fact that the tax he is putting on today is on top of the tax established in 1956 plus the tax put on by his colleagues in successive budgets since then, plus the turnover tax and now the tax in the Financial Resolution we are considering today?  Does the Minister appreciate that the tax put on commodities such as beer and tobacco are cumulative taxes?  In any case, whether or not the Minister realises it, one fact is self-evident from <Col N="1386" /> the volume of revenue the Minister seeks to derive from this tax and that is that he intends to levy it on everybody.</P>
    <P>Is it extravagant for a working man to consume a bottle of stout per day? Let us face the fact that for any man who does, this Financial Resolution is designed to collect at least 6d. a week, assuming that he abstains on Friday. I often wonder, when Deputies of this House are confronted with a Financial Resolution&mdash;upon which Deputy MacEntee is so anxious that we should concentrate our attention&mdash;if we forget the implications of our action? Did anyone believe, when Fianna Fáil were campaigning in the last general election, that they were campaigning for authority to levy 6d. a week on every man who drank beer and voted Fianna Fáil?</P>

I should be very interested to hear what they will tell the neighbours when they go home.  How will they explain that they did not know 12 months ago, of their intentions to levy these taxes?  What has happened since they were on the hustings urging the people to &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I must give them this credit.  The advertisement, as I read it, was: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  It did not say where&mdash;to damnation or to salvation.  In the eschatological sphere, I suppose it is the quintessence of free will that you should be free to choose damnation.  I suppose in politics, it is the quintessence of individual liberty that you should be free to choose Fianna Fáil but at least we are delivered from damnation.  The fault I find with the Fianna Fáil Party is that they not only forebore telling the people where they would lead them but that they positively led them to believe that nothing was more likely than that &ldquo;Lemass would lead on.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We cannot have a general debate on this Resolution which refers only to beer. The Deputy should stick rigidly to the Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sticking rigidly to it.  I am referring to a placard asking the country to &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo; and I am asking if that placard meant that they should let Lemass lead on to a tax on beer.  I do not think anybody told that to the electorate.  In fact, that is what the placard has turned out to have meant and I am making the <Col N="1388" /> Fianna Fáil Party, for whom the Minister for Finance speaks, responsible for this Resolution.  I want, in respect of each of these Resolutions, to declare the fraud they represent in the Fianna Fáil claim to &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I believe they concealed deliberately from the people the knowledge they must then have had that they were leading the people into a catastrophe which would make a Financial Resolution such as this necessary in this Budget.  They cannot pretend that this was absent from their minds because they were abundantly warned of it from the public platforms.  They strenuously denied this and the present Minister for Finance and his colleagues declared that anybody who warned the people 18 months ago was undermining the economic future of the country.  I charge the Minister for Finance with having persuaded the people to believe that the very reverse of what was inevitable was going to come to pass.</P>
      <P>I would like the two Parliamentary Secretaries and the Deputy from Wexford present at the moment to state if they knew that a Financial Resolution of this kind was going to be proposed.  I ask them to state did they anticipate that a tax of this character would appear in the Budget of 1966?  If they did, I ask them did they conceive themselves to be under a duty to tell their constituents of that?  If others told their constituents that the inevitable consequences of Fianna Fáil policy would be this, did they tell the people that prognostication was false?  If they did, what are they going to tell the people now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of consequence to all of us that people should be persuaded that public men in this country do not deal in falsehoods.  If the Government Party in this country can be clearly convicted of that course, it redounds to the discredit of all of us.  We hear people speak with contempt of politicians and not infrequently it is the technocrats who speak so eloquently in this way.  Does the Minister make the defence that he was misled by his own technocrats?  Does he tell us that he was persuaded by his own technocrats that this present condition <Col N="1389" /> in which we find ourselves would not come to pass?</P>

If he did not go to Kildare and tell that story to the people there, he went to Cork and the story he told there was that he had to put on the turnover tax because he could not tax beer.</P>

He has now pledged the solvency of the State on his confidence that he will get £2¼ million from beer this year.  He has made his Budget so tight that for the first time he makes no allowance this year in his Budget for any percentage of expenditure allowed for in the Budget but not likely to come in course of payment during the year.  This £2.25 million must be realised or we must have a supplementary Budget in the autumn.  Will the Minister tell us how he can reconcile that confidence with his statement in Cork that the turnover tax was justified by the fact that the Government could not get additional revenue from beer?</P>

      <P>I admire the Minister for not getting cross.  It is not necessary for anybody to get cross for the purpose of effective debate.  I am discussing the impact of this Resolution on the ordinary men and women of the country, and I am interested in nothing else.  I think it would be well for all of us to avoid excogitation about our various professional occupations.  The matter at present under discussion is a tax of 1d a bottle on beer and 2d per pint on stout.  I believe that to be a very burdensome tax on the masses of the people, a tax on people in very modest circumstances who can ill afford to pay it.  I believe it to be a tax of which Fianna Fáil gave no hint &mdash;far from it&mdash;in the whole course of their campaign which was designed rather to persuade the people that the likelihood of their doing anything like this was extremely remote.  I ask the Minister to justify the burden, to justify the misrepresentation of which I believe his Party were guilty and to tell us if he sees any prospect of a remission of these taxes at any time, or does <Col N="1393" /> he intend to go on letting the ordinary people pay?</P>
      <P>Lastly, I ask him to tell us honestly: does he really believe this tax will make no difference to the cost of living of the ordinary family?  I am warning him of the vicious circle of rising costs which some day somehow must be broken. Where is the start of stability to begin?  Does the Minister believe it is reasonable to say to those who can least afford it: &ldquo;You must pay more but you must do with less&rdquo;.  I find it hard to see the justice of such a requisition on the masses of the people and I should be interested to hear from the Minister how he believes it to be possible to get that stability in prices and wages in industry which he says is indispensable to our economic survival, if this Resolution, designed to net £2¼ million from the masses of our people, is to form part of the Budget.</P>

      <P>As I say, what is sauce for the goose.  There are two other television appearances by the Opposition Parties.  Perhaps they can be cancelled just as well.  However, I want to say this.  We on this side of the House are entitled to claim the same motivation as Deputy Dillon ascribes to himself, when we entered politics as when he entered politics, and we did so with the intention of serving to the best of our ability, and to the capacity we have got, and as objectively as we can, the people of the country, without having all forms of degradation ascribed to us.  I try to do my job as well as Deputy Dillon or any of his colleagues did when they were on this side of the House.  We may have our limitations but certainly we do our job as honestly and as objectively as possible and it is disgusting to hear a man, who attributes such high praise to public service as Deputy Dillon does, pour contumely on those who do not agree with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the virtues do not all lie with those who agree with Deputy Dillon.  It is true that the proposed tax will net something in the nature of £2¼ millions.  I know that it is going to be an impost on ordinary <Col N="1395" /> people, not only on the people who cannot afford wines and spirits.  I know many people who drink pints and bottles of stout who would not care twopence for the best bottle of wine that Deputy Dillon could provide for himself in his favourite club.  Similarly with spirits.  I am not saying that this is the reason for imposing the tax.  The duty is necessary to provide taxes for the running of the State generally.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on the turnover tax in my constituency I justified it on the basis that the media for taxation on which this State had to depend were too limited in their scope and it was desirable that the scope of these taxable items should be broadened without having over-dependence on what have been called the old reliables.  It was probably valid for my predecessor, Dr. Ryan, to say in 1963 that the revenue from these old reliable sources had reached saturation point.  It was relative in the circumstances then prevailing but as standards of living improve, as incomes improve, that may no longer be relevant, as was shown last year when increases in certain taxation produced worthwhile increases to the Exchequer.  In answer to Deputy Murphy, in regard to the increase in beer&mdash;the term includes stout, porter, ale and lager&mdash;in the case of stout, which as the Deputy is aware, accounts for the bulk of the consumption of beer, the increased duty adds twopence to the present duty element per pint.</P>

      <P>No, 9.5 pence per pint to 11.5 pence per pint.  In the case of porter, sales of which are very small, and porter being of lower gravity, the duty will add about 1.7 pence to the present duty element of 8.1 pence per pint.  The gravities of the other beers to which he referred, a variety of ales and lagers, vary to a considerable extent, as the Deputy probably knows, but on average the gravity tends to be half way between that of stout and porter and on average the duty element of 8.6 pence per pint <Col N="1396" /> on ale and lager will be increased by slightly less than twopence per pint.</P>

      <P>It is lamentable that the Minister has been forced to introduce an additional tax on beer because the people who drink beer, particularly stout, are mainly people in the lower income group.  In the rural parts&mdash;the same can be said for the rest of the country&mdash;having a drink is traditional.  We have publichouses scattered all over rural Ireland and it is not unusual for people to gather, when their day's work has concluded, in the local publichouses to discuss the day's work, over what are termed a few pints.  Mark you, that is the only thing which many of our rural people enjoy, having this discussion in their publichouse if not every night then on a few nights during the week or on a Sunday evening.  By imposing this additional twopence on the pint we are making it very difficult for this group of people because we know that there is a very wide variation in incomes at present and that variation has been made a great deal wider in the immediate past as a result of Government policy of pushing up salaries that were already high and keeping depressed salaries that are entirely inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that the man working for the Cork Corporation or the county council or the Department of Lands, married or single, has to make do with a wage in or around £8 per week and his take home pay for a full week's work is not more than £7.10 0d in his own county of Cork.  It may be more in the city but in the rural parts of Cork his take home pay at present is not more than £7.10. 0d.  These are the people who enjoy their pint occasionally and it is the only recreation, if I may use that word, which they have, meeting in the publichouse.  It is unfair for the Minister to ask this group to give him an extra £2¼ million to measure up to his Budget requirements particularly having regard to the fact that their incomes have been allowed to continue in a depressed state and when only in the past few weeks we jerked <Col N="1397" /> up the salaries of the higher grades by £895,000.</P>

      <P>As a publican and a person who has a reasonably good idea of rural life, I am satisfied that the main drinkers of beer come from the lower-income group, such as the workers I have mentioned, self-employed farmers, shopkeepers and others, and we are asking too much of these people.  We are asking too much of the working people in asking them to give us 2d more.  Is it unreasonable for them to ask us: &ldquo;Why should we give you 2d more?  You have given us no additional income, nor do you propose to give us any additional income in this Budget.  Why not ask the people who were given status increases of £1,000?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am aware of that.  This is asking these people to pay another 2d per pint for beer, a penny per bottle of stout and so on.  I will not deal with table waters.  It is lamentable, having regard to the incomes of the main consumers of stout, that we should ask them to pay another <Col N="1398" /> 2d per pint.  We in the Labour Party do not subscribe to that proposal.  We oppose it vehemently because we are satisfied the people we represent throughout the country cannot afford to pay that increase.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over statements made by previous speakers but Deputy Dillon pointed out that the Minister's predecessor, Dr. Ryan, said two years ago that beer could not bear any further tax and that the law of diminishing returns would apply, if it were taxed any further.  Despite that, we now have this further tax on beer.  I think I express the views of every member of this Party when I protest against this imposition which I consider reprehensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against the increased price of beer.  In 1964, we were told by the then Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, that beer could carry no further tax because it would affect consumption.  In 1964, there were more people in employment and more money in circulation than at present.  The prices of beer and spirits were increased by last year's Budget and we are increasing it further this year.  Last year it ended up with a costly inquiry, and the Minister will have to have another inquiry after this increase.  If he wants to get a firm price without profiteering he should fix the prices of beer and spirits in the various parts of the country.  We know what happened last year.  Following the inquiry, a percentage of the publicans reduced the price, but others did not. In increasing these prices, I believe the Minister is thinking of the tourists and not thinking of the people in rural Ireland particularly in the constituency I represent in places like Roscommon and Leitrim.  These unfortunate people cannot afford to pay any further increase in the price of beer and spirits.  Even prior to 1964, when the turnover tax was introduced, the present Minister for Justice, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, told the people at a Fianna Fáil meeting in Boyle that they would put a tax on fur coats and expensive jewellery.  But they came back and put the turnover tax on <Col N="1399" /> essential foodstuffs.  They said at that time they could not tax the usual commodities, but in two successive years, they increased the price of beer and spirits.  It is time they asked themselves where they are going and who is going with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with others who have made their protests on behalf of the drinking public affected by this almost perennial imposition on beer, wines and spirits.  The first thing to be remembered about this tax is that it is a tax upon a tax.  It is a complete unit imposed in each succeeding year on the tax already there.  While I join wholeheartedly in the protest on behalf of the consuming public, I want to say further that I think within the ambit of this Resolution there come many more considerations.</P>
      <P>Publichouses can be divided into many categories for the purpose of argument against this imposition.  I shall divide them into the rather big Dublin and provincial town publichouses, probably owned by a company, then the less big ones in provincial towns, but, above all, I want to refer to the small family publichouses in smaller towns, in villages and at crossroads, where the sale of drink in conjunction with other articles such as hardware and grocery, is a matter of a livelihood.  An increase in tax, for a time at any rate, necessarily means a decrease in drinking.  A decrease in drinking means a decrease in turnover, with a consequent drop in profits.  For the bigger publichouses of this city and the other cities and large towns, this must constitute a threat to employment.  Once people find it difficult to make ends meet, the first to suffer are those who are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you come to the family publichouse. Some of them will probably work out all right&mdash;those on a sounder basis with a bigger turnover where a decrease in business would not involve so much.  But to the average run of publichouses in the small towns and villages, this increase in taxation will mean a decrease in drinking, a consequent decrease in profits and, of <Col N="1400" /> course, a threat to the family business. It is difficult enough at present for people engaged in any type of business; but for publichouses, which are by and large unpaid and unofficial tax gatherers, to be inflicted in this manner with an imposition of this kind is something to which regard must be had sooner or later.</P>
    <P>There was a time a few years ago when it was being argued in favour of the turnover tax that the traditional sources of revenue were drying up and could not be looked to with any degree of confidence to provide a return, but that argument appears to be dropped now and we are back again at the old business of attacking the traditional sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>This imposition is a mistake.  It is a mistake, first of all, because it will create hardship for the less well-off sections of the community who depend, to some extent at least, upon beer and stout as part of their staple food.  It also imposes a hardship on the old who must have their traditional tot.  Then there is the question of employment in the bigger publichouses, which is a very serious matter, and the most serious matter of all is the one to which I referred last, the family publichouse which is depending for its upkeep and the rearing of a small family on its sales of drink.  It is far too much to ask these people, as each year passes, to become once more the tax-gatherers for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Government that the price at which the licensed trade are buying drink now, is the price at which they were selling it in 1960, and that in a period of five years the Government have taken all this money.  In Ireland we are looking for new industries all over the place.  We have encouraged outsiders to establish industries here which have been a complete failure whereas, between exports and imports of drink, the balance is £4,700,000 on the right side.  This profit is from an industry which is the only non-subsidised industry in the country.  There are no gimmicks attaching to this <Col N="1401" /> profit.  Beer is by far the greatest profit-making drink, because we import a lot more spirits than we export. There is a figure of £6 million or £7 million for beer.  If the Government are going to tax this drink there will be less consumption.  If there is less consumption each item will cost that little bit more.  If there is greater cost per item it means that what we can sell on the export market will be greater in price.  The person who produces in Ireland must increase the cost or get rid of staff.  When we hit the pint of stout and the pint of beer we are hitting the poor person.  There will certainly be a reduction in consumption and if there is a reduction in consumption there will not be the same balance from exports.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this Resolution appears to be to collect approximately £3½ million from the sale of intoxicating liquor.  The effect of increasing the price of the bottle of stout and the bottle of beer will be to put up the cost of living for the working man.  The day is past when a bottle of stout or a bottle of beer is a luxury.  As has been pointed out here this evening, it is one of the simple recreations of the working man.  The effect of taxing this leisure will be to leave less money to the working man's wife to provide the absolute necessaries of life, will be to reduce the effective value of the wages which the working man brings home on Friday evening.</P>
      <P>The result of this increase will be an inevitable demand for an increase in wages.  Unless the working people of this country are to take the pledge and I do not think they will&mdash;if they do the real object of this Resolution will be lost&mdash;there will be less money for the necessaries of life.  Housewives will make it plain to the men of this country that they cannot carry on and run a house on the wages handed up to them.  The result of that will be that the men, through their trade unions, will demand an increase in wages.  That will lead to demands all over the country for increases in wages. It will lead to industrial strife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a report which has been published <Col N="1402" /> by the National Industrial and Economic Council for consideration in conjunction with this Budget, it has been clearly pointed out that if things are to go on anyway smoothly and if the economy is to be got back on the rails, it can only be achieved if there is no abnormal industrial strife during the year, if there are no strikes in the country, if there is no demand for higher wages.  By introducing this Resolution the Government will make it impossible to maintain the condition precedent set down by the NIEC in its recent publication.  I wonder if the Government have throught about that and if the Minister for Finance has thought about it.  This will start a spiral of events like the turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter of considerable importance in reference to this tax to which I wish to refer.  It is intended by this to put a <Col N="1408" /> rather onerous addition to the taxation of whiskey.  I wonder if the effect that this will have on the industry, a very old-established industry in this country, has fully been adverted so far as the export trade is concerned?  This is a matter to which very serious consideration should be given.  We are listening every day to exhortations by Ministers, by the Government and by various people to increase our exports.  One of the industries that has had the greatest difficulty&mdash;I think we ought to say it in their favour&mdash;in creating new export markets is the Irish whiskey industry. They had very great difficulties to overcome.  They had to enter a market that had practically been captured by the very rich distillers of Scotch whisky and they had to overcome&mdash;certainly on the American market&mdash;a taste that had been acquired for Scotch whisky as against Irish whiskey.  I think this industry has been over-taxed throughout the years.  It is one of the oldest industries in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in office, my colleague, the late Deputy Norton, made superhuman efforts to get Irish whiskey well-known in the United States and to increase its market.  I think Powers, Jamesons, the Cork Distillers and the Tullamore whiskey people have done their best to create an export market for this country.  It is a very valuable market but a very difficult one to get into.  The Government will cripple this industry by imposing additional tax. If the Minister will look at the history of the taxation of whiskey, he will find that, above all the other beverages, it has suffered a greater impact from the point of view of taxation than possibly beer, tobacco or any of the ordinary sources of revenue.  I would press on the Minister the urgent necessity to refrain from crippling this industry.  If he will not reconsider this tax of 4d a glass which he now proposes, he should at least consider giving some additional incentives to the industry in the Finance Bill.  It is very necessary to give the industry incentives of some kind to increase its export trade and to help it to gain some advantage, in the light of the difficult problems facing it.  It is of urgent importance that this matter should not <Col N="1409" /> be allowed to pass in this House in silence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow the Deputy in his argument that the increased tax on the home comsumption of whiskey will dimish this industry's prospects of expanding its exports.</P>

      <P>The consumption of whiskey has gone up.  Last year the consumption of Irish whiskey was higher than ever before, but, of course, Irish distillers exporting to Britain have to bear higher taxation in that market than they will here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This industry is doing its best to increase its exports. It should be helped in that, but putting an additional tax on the home market will cripple it.  The last time an additional tax was put on whiskey, I saw an interview in the newspapers with representatives of the industry in which they made the point that I am now making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Resolution No. 5, like Resolution No. 4, indicates that the Government are leaning very heavily on the drinking public for tax revenue.  On the one hand, the Government tell the people to save and the saving they are asked to make is not to drink to any great extent.  If the drinking public should take that advice, where is the taxation from drink to come from?  I think it very peculiar that in this country the Government are forced to lean so heavily on drink to bring in a big percentage of their revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as whiskey is concerned, there is some difference as against beer.  It may be said that a certain quantity of the whiskey consumed here is consumed by the affluent section of the community, that section which has benefited from Government policy.  It is reasonable to assume that those people who have been so generously dealt with by the Government, who have got increases of salary up to £1,000 a year, will not be caused undue <Col N="1410" /> hardship by Resolution No. 5.  They will be able to find the additional 4d a glass imposed under the Resolution. However, there is another section of the community that would like the little half-one, the old age pensioner.  The old woman, after she collects her pension on a Friday, likes to have her half-one or two half-ones.  Fianna Fáil have now taken that luxury from her. No longer will it be possible for any of the lower-income groups in this country to drink whiskey.  The old age pensioners must forget about the half-one and the old woman who draws her pension on Friday must also forget about it.  Fianna Fáil have put the half-one beyond them.</P>
    <P>This Government, despite statements made in the past that drink should not stand any additional taxation, are now leaning heavily on the drinking public. There is something wrong in a State which draws such a substantial portion of its revenue from drink.  On one hand, the Taoiseach advises people to save and on the other, he hopes that they will continue to drink so that the Minister for Finance can balance his Budget.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are really asking the people not to take their advice, not to reduce their drinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your advice, Sir. Resolution No. 5 will have an adverse effect on consumers of spirits but it will also have an adverse effect on many people who derive their livelihood from the sale of drink.  There are a big number of publicans who contribute daily to the economy of the country and the distillers provide a big employment content.  If, as a result of these impositions of Fianna Fáil, consumption of spirits is reduced, will that not affect the livelihood of a number of our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have much stronger feelings on Resolution No. 4 but it must be admitted that one of the sections of the community contributing most to general taxation is the drinking public. They may be despised by some people and it may be said that they are no <Col N="1411" /> great advantage to the State, but that is completely false.  Resolution No. 5 imposes on the consumer of every glass of whiskey a tax of almost 4/-.  Even though this group may be looked down on by other sections of the community, they are contributing in a big way towards the revenue this country so badly needs and are contributing an undue proportion of that revenue.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If I were to discuss the general effect of this Budget on the tourist industry, I would be out of order, but it would be wrong to allow Resolution No. 5 to be disposed of without pointing out to the House its likely effects on the tourist industry.  We are spending considerable sums in endeavouring to attract foreign tourists here.  We have set up various tourist boards and appointed many civil servants and quasi-civil servants to advise them.  At the same time, we are doing everything possible to price ourselves out of the tourist market.</P>
      <P>One of the things we had in this country to attract the tourists was the comparative price of cigarettes, whiskey and things like that, but we are gradually closing the gap, making the country less attractive to the tourist. The weather here is doubtful, to say the least of it, but one of the attractions for tourists was that they could get spirits very much cheaper than they could buy them at home.  Therefore, we are doing a bad day's work for the tourist industry by increasing the price of spirits by 4d a glass.  That is one of the things, perhaps, that the people who are making forecasts of the economy have overlooked, that this Budget is calculated to damage considerably one of the best methods we have of righting our balance of payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention something which may not be very nice for the people of this House because when somebody talks now about the agricultural community, it is like mentioning hell.  The price paid for a luxury article such as malting barley is the very same today as in 1948.  The publican has got an increased margin; the <Col N="1412" /> workers have got their increases; but the farmers have got nothing in this famous industry Deputy Costello spoke about.  One of the excuses given, when there was all the talk about the export market, was that we could not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry's reference to barley was not altogether irrelevant.  The price of malting barley is too low but I do not think the way to increase it is to increase taxation on the end product.  The case has been made by Deputy Costello that this industry is also overtaxed.  They have been making an effort to expand their exports.  We have evidence in today's papers that there is now a determined effort on the part of the distillers to come together and make a real export drive.  It is very unfortunate that just at this time the Government should decide to increase taxation on the industry.  This is a time when the industry will need all the money it can find to make this export drive effective.  The purpose of an increased tax on spirits is to raise extra revenue but it is very doubtful if it will have that effect.  We had evidence on at least two occasions previously that when spirits were overtaxed, revenue was reduced.  It is likely this increase will mean decreased rather than increased revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce a question, as he is sitting there?  I believe there is an application before his Department by the brewers and distillers to have the price which they can charge the trade increased.  Has he come to any conclusion about this application?  Shall we find that having voted against an increase in the price of spirits tonight, perhaps next week <Col N="1413" /> the price will be raised again when the Minister decides to grant the application? Would the Minister avail of the opportunity to make some comment or has he reached any decision on the matter?</P>

      <P>We will call it a halfpenny. I want to remind the Minister for Justice of the occasion to which Deputy Reynolds referred when he came to the electors in Roscommon to reassure them on the eve of a general election that they could dismiss from their minds the thought that a Fianna Fáil Government would levy taxes on the children, on the poor and indeed on the people&mdash;that their only concern was to tax furs, jewellery and expensive motor cars.  Look at them now, sitting like a rose blooming in the back benches, putting a halfpenny on <Col N="1418" /> the glass of lemonade.  They have no shame.  This I will concede for them: brass they have in abundance.  If the Minister would show as much solicitude in respect of the Mafia in this country who can blow up Nelson's Pillar as he does for the glass of lemonade he is concerned to tax, he would be giving better value for the public money he is in receipt of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We made a point earlier on and I want to repeat it that we believe this will be a very savage impost on working people.  Are the Government taking into account the fact that this increase will operate on two kinds of people?  There are those who are in a position to tax their carefully for a year and those who cannot do that.  Those who can tax their <Col N="1427" /> cars annually will be covered for 12 months but those who cannot do so will be caught almost immediately. Many people using cars now are not members of the affluent society we have heard so much about.  They are ordinary working people who need their cars to go to work.</P>
      <P>There was a great song and dance about the £30 allowance to certain people under the income tax code. That represents about £8 in real money and most of that £8 will be used up in this extra taxation.  What the Taoiseach is doing here is making a much stronger case for substantial wage increases.  Let the Taoiseach have no doubt about this.  If he does something which leaves the workers' take home wage packets smaller than before, then the money must be found somewhere.  The Taoiseach says that there is an affluent society which can afford to pay extra taxation but there are some people who are paying more than they can afford and a lot of them will be caught on this tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fundamentally unjust tax.  It affects two classes of people, those who pay their tax annually and those who can only afford to tax for a quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has no bearing on the case.  The man who can only afford to tax his car for a quarter has to use that car to go to work in the factory.  Now we will put him in a different classification and say that he must pay that tax immediately.  That creates two different classes in our society and that is unjust.  In the case of a man who has 40,000 miles a year on his car, even if the increase was 100 per cent, it might be of very little consequence to him.  If he is a commercial traveller and is getting his income from travelling in his car the impost will not be a heavy one to him and it will certainly not be as heavy as the new taxation will be to the man who can only tax his car for a short <Col N="1428" /> period and who needs it to go to the local factory to his work.  When he pays his income tax by PAYE he will not get any credit for the fact that he has to use his car to go to work but the company director and the commercial traveller can claim the costs of their cars.  This is an unjust tax and one to which sufficient thought was not given by the Minister and his officials.</P>

Seeing that there is a complete departure from normal practice, I think the Minister for Finance or his Deputy &mdash;whether it is the Taoiseach or the Minister for Local Government; I do not know which&mdash;should explain this change in policy so far as motor taxation is concerned.  We are asked to vote an imposition of £1.3 million extra on those owning private cars in this country.  We are told that the money is not to be channelled into the usual source, the road fund, but is to be channelled towards the relief of the Exchequer.  I will repeat again&mdash;the Taoiseach need not look at me&mdash;that possibly it is to help to pay the £1,000 status increases.  That is the only conclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It concerns the non-Irish assembled car.  I want to protest against this tax, in addition to what has been said by Deputy Donegan and Deputy Murphy.  It seems to me that the approach here is unbalanced and unfair to the weaker section of the motoring community.  The position which is put before us by the Government in their proposal is that anyone who was financially in a position to pay his tax altogether and who has already paid it is relieved so far as this House is concerned, of the 25 per cent increase.  But the person who found it difficult to tax his car, who found it difficult to get the money together to pay down the tax altogether, and who, accordingly, is taxing it by the quarter&mdash;and who has to pay more, in the event, already, by taxing it by the quarter but who cannot afford to tax his car all in one go&mdash;is going to get a double blow from the Government in this.  He is already paying more because he is taxing his car quarterly and now he is caught this year for the increase of 25 per cent whereas the person who has taxed his car for the full year does not have to pay anything extra this year.  I think <Col N="1432" /> that that approach is unbalanced.  I think it is the poorer and weaker sections of the motoring community who will be hit heaviest by this tax.</P>

      <P>Following on what Deputy O'Higgins has said, it has been customary for people, particularly people who need not use a car in connection with their business, to refrain from taxing it for the first quarter of the year and then to tax it in or around Easter.  As a result of a regulation introduced on the 1st of this month by the Minister for Local Government, it is now possible to tax a car for 12 months.  People who purchased cars since 1st March and people who had cars but who had not taxed them and who now are taking advantage of the Minister's regulation and have taxed their cars since 1st March, do so not to the end of the present year but until the end of February of next year.  If we have a Budget, say, in the beginning of March next year, and supposing this penal tax which is now put on will then be taken off, these people who have taxed their cars to the end of February next year will not be caught by it at all and they will have escaped paying this additional 25 per cent.  If the Minister was aware of what his colleague, the Minister for Finance, was going to do, surely it would have been proper to refrain from making the order permitting a person to tax his car for the entire 12 months until 1st April next?</P>

      <P>Of course this is a Fianna Fáil device for raiding the Road Fund.  I know all about raiding the Road Fund.  I remember in 1956 the Government led by Deputy John A. Costello raided the Road Fund for one year for half a million pounds.  We came into Dáil Éireann and said to Dáil Éireann: &ldquo;The financial situation demands that in this financial year we should take half a million pounds out of the Road Fund&rdquo;.  We asked expressly for the sanction of Dáil Éireann for that one draft on the Road Fund.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said today that he is levying £1.3 million on motor vehicles.  Deputy P. O'Donnell points out that one person might escape on the assumption that this was but a year's operation and the Taoiseach laughed.  Deputy Murphy is right.  For as long as I remember it, the revenue from motor taxation has been appropriated on one side of the Exchequer and has come out on the other side into the Road Fund.  Sometimes the Government have been forced by circumstances to ask Dáil Éireann not to change the entire procedure in relation to the Road Fund but for one year only.  The Taoiseach now announces calmly that this is not a raid for one year for £1.3 million.  This is a permanent change.  Did he not tell Deputy P. O'Donnell a minute ago it was all cod?</P>

      <P>What I have got to say will be brief and to the point.  When the tax impositions were announced this evening, I heard a murmur from the public gallery that this would put the country on its feet.  That is literally what it will do because very few people can afford motor cars.  I speak particularly of the tax on motor cars as a Deputy living beside the Border.  Motor taxation here is £20 for a 10 hp car, £22 for a 12 hp car, £28 for a 14 hp <Col N="1436" /> car and £30 for a 16 hp car.  This is to be increased and it means that while a worker with a car in Northern Ireland pays only £17, his counterpart in this part of the country has to pay double that amount or more.  In free trade conditions, how can workers in Donegal compete with workers in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> A point that can be made is that the Taoiseach seems to be rather confused about the implications of this Resolution and the equity of it.  He seems to think that because you can tax your car for one year any day of the year now, that makes that Resolution equitable.  It does not.  I have my car taxed for 12 months and in fact this Resolution will not hit me financially until 1st January next year.  I can enjoy the old rate of tax.  But somebody else&mdash;and there are many of them in the country particularly those who drive to work&mdash;may tax his car quarterly and that person comes in on the 1st April to tax his car for the remaining threequarters of the year and he will have to pay £32 where I have to pay £26.  That is neither fair nor just.</P>

      <P>Concerning the final part of the question, the subscriber asked for a list of trunk calls which had been incorrectly charged but, in fact, there were no such calls.</P>

      <P>The compiling of this information would involve the deployment of a large number of staff over an inordinate length of time.  I am satisfied that the disruption of the ordinary work of the Department which this would entail would not be warranted.  Arrangements are being made whereby in future years the statistics for each school will be put on punched cards.  This will enable more varied information to be obtained in a relatively short time.</P>

    <P>Every effort is being made to complete it as soon as possible this year, but I cannot, pending its publication, anticipate such decisions as may be taken in the field of higher education as a result of it. <Col N="1283" /> I am satisfied that the university facilities in 1966-67 will meet the demand for university education in that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scholarship schemes of the various local authorities are not so framed as to permit of all the statistics being furnished as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the vast majority of scholarship schemes, reservations are made not by reference to numbers but by reference to the money being provided.  A tabular statement is attached showing in each case the total money being provided for scholarships in 1965 and the amount of that total reserved for small schools.</P>
      <P>Threequarters of the total moneys provided under each scheme is reserved for candidates whose parents' income complies with the means test'.  One quarter is for open competition.</P>
      <P>The number of scholarships provided in 1965 in areas controlled by corporations was 561.  No borough council administers a scholarship scheme.  The same income limits apply to each reserve clause of a scheme as apply to the scheme generally. Normally the income limit is £800 with due allowance for dependent children.</P>

      <P>Excluding schools with secondary tops, there are some 1,570 national schools having a staff of three teachers or more.  While in 599 of these, the principal teacher is a woman and the teaching of algebra and geometry is therefore, optional, nevertheless, algebra or geometry is, in fact, taught in many of these schools.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education when a decision was taken to allow children to commence post-primary education at age 12; if such commencement is independent of obtaining primary school certificate; and if he will give an estimate of the numbers so affected in the year 1965-66 and 1966-67 on present class enrolments.</P>

      <P>I should remind the Deputy that there has always been a provision whereby pupils may enter secondary schools at age 12, whether or not they had obtained the primary school certificate. I announced some months ago that it was my policy to give a three year post-primary education to all our children. It is also the intention to raise the school-leaving age to 15.  I would hope that the three year post-primary course would be completed within the period of compulsory schooling. <Col N="1286" /> Accordingly the Deputy will appreciate that there is no change in relation to secondary schools.  As far as vocational schools are concerned, it is my intention to bring the conditions of entry into line with those of secondary schools.  The question of giving an estimate of the number of pupils concerned does not arise in relation to 1965-66.  In regard to 1966-67 I could not offer any reliable estimate but I would say that the number is likely to be in hundreds rather than in thousands.</P>
