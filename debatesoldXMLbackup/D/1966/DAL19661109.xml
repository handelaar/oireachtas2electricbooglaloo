      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

      <P>Apart from the question as to whether the European Economic Community would be prepared to consider any application in advance of one for Britain, it is clear that it would not be realistic for us to take a step which would result in the erection of a trade barrier between ourselves and the market which takes around 70 per cent of our exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason for the increase of over 2,800 persons in the number of unemployed between 14th and 28th October, 1966.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to his similar question addressed to me in this House yesterday.  The factors indicated in that reply apply generally to the period now mentioned and were offset by some increased employment&mdash; principally in sugar manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told me yesterday that the increase in the previous fortnight of 2,300 unemployed was offset by increased employment in the sugar industry.  The fact remains, however, that the net increase in unemployment was 2,300. In the fortnight referred to here, the net increase is 2,500, after allowing for what the Parliamentary Secretary says is increased employment in the sugar industry.  Do all these excuses which the Parliamentary Secretary gives explain the increase in the number of unemployed since 16th September of 6,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the period 14th to 28th October.  The principal increases in the live register in that period were (1) dockside employment at the different ports, which showed a disimprovement, with the exception of Sligo; the net decrease is 369; (2) a seasonal slackness in agriculture, which accounted for 241; a seasonal slackness in hotels, 153; Bord na Móna, which is, of course, seasonal, 240; county council employment, also seasonal, 132; and a lay-off in the Hospitals Trust of temporary staff, 61. That was offset by a net increase of 68 in the number of people employed by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>I would refer the <Col N="536" /> Deputy to my reply to the questions put down by Deputies James Tully, Seán Dunne and Michael P. Murphy on 2nd November, 1966 in which I stated that I had authorised the ESB to proceed with connection in rural electrification areas in cases where houses are already wired and a firm commitment has been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>Does the Minister think it realistic to ask a smallholder, when he applies for a connection or an extension, to pay down from £350 to £400?  Is it not a joke to ask him to do this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask if the Minister does not agree that we have reached the zenith of futility when the Government owe the ESB £2½ million and the ESB say they have no capital wherewith to install electricity in small farmers' homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained the position.  The ESB and other State bodies who raise large sums of money invariably invest this money temporarily with the Minister for Finance.  This is a perfectly normal matter which always occurs.  In this case the capital has been found to continue the programme to the end of the financial year.  The Deputy knows the capital is strictly taken care of by the Minister for Finance.  The position has been made absolutely clear and now the money is being made available for these connections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the word &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; not the operative word in the Minister's reply?  If the Minister is right in saying that these advances are made temporarily to the Government, it is clearly envisaged that where the money is required by the ESB to discharge their statutory duty, which is <Col N="537" /> to connect an applicant whose application has been approved, the Government should make available to the ESB repayment of so much of the loan as is requisite to carry out their statutory duty.  If it is only a temporary loan, why do the Government not pay back that part of the loan now required by the ESB to discharge that duty?  The answer is that you have not got it.  Now I have to ask the questions and answer them myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the general anxiety throughout the country by people who have applied for ESB extensions and cannot get them?  Will the Minister take steps to meet the requirements of these people by providing an ESB service on the same scale as heretofore? May I ask Deputy Lynch, the Minister for Finance and the new Taoiseach, to give back to the ESB the £2½ million which he has borrowed from them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, when he says that it is quite clear the ESB can now carry out their usual capital programme, if he will make it clear to the people who are anxious to get connection in rural Ireland that they have no hope of getting it for the next 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a programme arranged for rural connections on the basis of the values known to us last year.  The existing programme will be completed about 1969 or 1970.  The programme has to be revised in the light of increasing costs to the ESB and the general capital position.  I may say that nearly 84 per cent of all rural dwellers are now connected and I regard that as fairly good progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Is it not a fact that letters are being sent out from every district office of the ESB saying that it has been found necessary to slow down the rate of new connections because of lack of capital?  If that is so, why does the Minister not get back his £2½ million <Col N="538" /> from the Government and get on with the programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems arises from the fact that the domestic demand for current has risen faster than was anticipated because the people in the rural districts are now able to pay for more power.  Consequently system improvement has taken the greater part of the capital allocated for rural electrification generally.</P>

      <P>Particulars of the sick pay and superannuation schemes at present in operation were given by me in reply to questions on 30th November, 1965 and 2nd November last.  It is the practice of my Department to maintain such benefits at a level not less favourable than that applying to comparable workers outside the State service.  The question of extending benefits in the light of developments in outside employment is under consideration.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 11th October, 1966, on the subject. This year, in order to make increased provision for services essential to the development of the economy, including measures to develop productivity and raise farm and non-farm incomes in the western counties, and in rural areas generally, the provision for a number of services, including the schemes financed from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote, has had unavoidably to be reduced.  To ensure priority for the most needed works the allocation of grants for minor road and drainage schemes on a purely relief basis has been discontinued and all grants are now being channelled through the contributory rural improvements scheme.  Employment at local level has always been casual and short term.  Employees of local authorities are not engaged full-time on these schemes.</P>

I know that forms are not even being sent out at present.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that in the West there are people who are not going to have one penny for Christmas?  I am aware of permanent employees of Sligo County Council who will be laid off work because the minor employment and bog development schemes have been discontinued.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilhawley should be aware of the fact that the number of applications from County Sligo which have been examined and offers made in regard to them have been very small.  Indeed, the proportion of acceptances to offers in County Sligo is only about 16 per cent.  I am sure the Deputy cannot be unaware of the many measures in last year's Budget which were designed to alleviate the situation in the western counties, and especially in Sligo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has information on the progress made by local authorities in completing their development plans; whether satisfactory progress has been made by Dublin Corporation; and whether his Department will consider the secondment of suitable planning personnel to <Col N="546" /> any local authority at present in difficulty in meeting the deadline set by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had under close review the progress of planning authorities towards making their development plans under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and I am satisfied that, in general, good progress is being made.  There are, however, a number of areas in which a much intensified effort will be needed in the months ahead to meet the statutory deadline of 1st October, 1967, for the making of the plans.  I am arranging to remind all planning authorities of their responsibilities in this regard and of the programme which they will need to observe to ensure compliance with the prescribed procedures, including publicising of draft plans and consideration of public representations.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been taking place between officers of my Department and of the planning authorities for Dublin city and county on progress with the development plan programme in those areas.  There are important development sectors&mdash;for example, roads&mdash;in which specialist studies are in hands in Dublin and elsewhere, and it may not be possible to incorporate full conclusions relating to these sectors in the first plans.  The current discussions include consideration of the manner in which this situation will be met in the initial plans, which must provide for the development needs of the years immediately ahead and will be subject to review in the light of new information and new needs as part of the continuing planning process.  I hope to be in a position to tender further detailed technical advice when the report of the Dublin region planning consultant whom I have appointed becomes available at the end of December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning authorities have had the benefit of a wide programme of central assistance and advice in overcoming their difficulties&mdash;mainly the scarcity of qualified planners&mdash;and in making progress with their plans.  This programme will be continued and intensified <Col N="547" /> in the coming months with detailed advice and model plans being made available.  I believe that in this way planning authorities will draw on the resources of the Department to the best and widest effect consistent with full observance of their own statutory responsibilities and functions in the matter.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While the Factories Act, 1955, does not require a register of safety committees to be kept, a record is compiled from the reports of the factory inspectors.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reason for the Land Registry's opening to the public daily half an hour later than the Registry of Deeds; and, if having regard to the proposed transfer to the Land Registry of much of the business hitherto handled by the Registry of Deeds, steps will be taken to open the Land Registry at 10 a.m. daily for the convenience of the public.</P>

      <P>The reason is that, whereas in the Registry of Deeds all memorials for registration must be lodged by hand, dealings may be lodged in the Land Registry by hand or by post.  Dealings must be dealt with in the order in which they are received and, accordingly, it is necessary to ensure that dealings received by post each day in the Land Registry are given precedence over dealings lodged by hand on that day.  This can be achieved only by allowing sufficient time each morning to deal with the incoming post and to record the dealings contained therein before accepting dealings lodged by hand.</P>

    <P>Employees in the following grades are not eligible to receive pensions when they retire. However, they are paid retirement gratuities if they have at least seven years service.  The gratuity for full-time officers is calculated on the basis of one week's pay for each year of service up to 15 years and two weeks' pay for each year in excess of 15.  The gratuity for part-time officers is based on ¾ of a week's pay for each year of service.</P>

(c) It is not the practice to disclose the nature of recommendations made about applicants for subpostmasterships.

      <P>I do not think any change in the binding would obviate the damage to which the directory is subject in booths.  The binding on the telephone directories was carefully considered before a decision was taken. The same binding is used in the United States.  We replace directories in public booths whenever necessary.  We even replace them free of charge for subscribers who make complaints, but such complaints are very few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received communications from both the Dublin Radio Branch and the Irish Area Council of the National Union of Journalists.  It is clear to me from these communications that the National Union of Journalists are under a serious misapprehension as to the scope of the responsibilities of their members who are employed by RTE on the preparation of news bulletins. The RTE Authority is statutorily responsible for the conduct of the national broadcasting service as a whole, and is specifically required to ensure that its broadcasts of news or of features concerned with matters of public controversy are presented objectively and impartially.  It follows that the responsibility for such broadcasts rests with the Authority and not with the journalists employed by it, and I understand that the Authority is taking steps to make the position clear to these employees so as to remove any grounds of future misunderstanding.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>) asked the Minister for Education if he will intimate to Cavan Vocational Education Committee immediately that he is prepared to sanction the employment and payment of two part-time teachers in Glangevlin vocational school so that the common intermediate certificate course may be provided in that school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems arising from the desire to provide a full three-year intermediate certificate course for both boys and girls in a two-room school at a smaller centre such as Glangevlin are more far-reaching than can be solved simply by the employment of part-time teachers for the first year of the course.</P>
      <P>In the case of Glangevlin, I am having the matter examined by an inspector in consultation with the chief executive officer and will communicate the result to the Deputy and to the vocational education committee.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Is the Minister aware that, for the time being at any rate, the committee would be satisfied with the provision of the first year course?  That has been arranged in another school in Cavan and is quite satisfactory.  Furthermore, Glangevlin is an exceptional area which should be entitled to exceptional treatment.  Is the Minister prepared to take the necessary steps now to sanction the employment of these two teachers to enable the first year course to go ahead at once?</P>

      <P>The committee has not proposed to me the appointment of any new part-time teachers.  If and <Col N="578" /> when such a proposal is submitted to me for approval, it will be considered on its merits in the light of my inspector's report.  However, I agree with the Deputy that a unique position arises in this school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No request has been received from County Cavan Vocational Education Committee to sanction the appointment of two part-time teachers, as the Deputy suggests.  However, the Deputy seems to be just as well informed as, if not better than, I am.  He is quite right in implying that I did ascertain orally from the CEO that a proposal will be placed by him on the agenda for the next meeting of the committee which will take place on 21st November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The press report of <Col N="581" /> October, 1966 mentioned by the Deputies has reference to a project by an American firm for the erection of a new factory at White's Cross for the production of garden implements for export.  The press report of December, 1965, referred to the association with an existing industry of the same American firm.  While the same American firm is involved, these are two distinct and separate projects.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to give employment figures in relation to individual firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As is the practice, announcements about new firms give details about the employment envisaged at the beginning and ultimately, with improved production.  It is not the practice to give details of the employment in an existing firm at any given time.</P>

      <P>The volume of complaint in this regard is very small.  In the past year, we have had only two or three complaints about it.  Any such complaints are investigated.  The Deputy will be aware also that there is a form of control involved, to the extent that a restaurant is attached to a hotel and comes under the Bord Fáilte regulations.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, in resuming one's observations in a debate on an Estimate such as this, it is necessary to ask one's colleagues in the House to bear in mind that one's concluding remarks must be read in the context of what one had to say in opening one's speech on the previous day and I would ask my colleagues to bear in mind now that these concluding remarks are to be read in the context of yesterday evening's contribution.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a very significant table of figures arising out of the general topics on which I touched yesterday in connection with the Department of Labour.  I venture to suggest to the House that we in this country had a fundamental decision to take: that was to be rich as the province of a wealthy industrial nation or relatively poor in freedom.  We elected to be free and to live within the standard of living the resources of the country would make available to us.  Certain consequences flow from that decision.  If we chose to sell our freedom for the fleshpots of Egypt, then to tell the truth, I do not give a fiddle-de-dee what you do and I do not propose to pursue the consequences that would follow on such a procedure.  If we elect to remain a free and sovereign state, and a free people in our own country, there is immense significance in the publication produced in the current number of <i>Trade Union Information</i> issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions research services, October, 1966, page 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the elements determining <Col N="588" /> ability to sell abroad is price though price-competitiveness is only one of the factors that determine the level of export sales.  While international cost comparisons are notoriously difficult to make it is possible to calculate the changes over time in certain of the costs entering into the prices of industrial products in different countries.  A comparison of these changes in costs for various countries gives some indication of cost-competitiveness.  The most usual subject for such comparisons is the labour cost involved in the production of industrial goods.  Thus by relating changes in output per man-hour with changes in hourly earnings, a measure of the change in unit labour costs (i.e. labour costs per unit of output) can be got.</P>
    <P>Then a table is set out and I ask the House to note carefully that that table deals with the percentage changes between 1963 and 1965 in output per man-hours, hourly earnings and in unit labour costs as defined in the extract I have just read to the House.  The change in the Netherlands is an increase of 9.5 per cent; the change in Belgium is 8.7 per cent; in Austria it is 6.9 per cent; in Ireland it is 5.6 per cent.  Listen now to the list of countries in which change is less: Switzerland 5.1; United Kingdom 5; West Germany 4.7; Norway 2.4; France 1.7; Sweden 1.6; in the United States of America there has actually been a reduction of .8 of one per cent in the unit labour cost of its industrial production. These are figures of deadly significance to this country.</P>
    <P>On the day that the turnover tax was introduced here, I remember warning the Taoiseach, and the members of his Party, that they were detonating a dialectic of inflation that would ultimately destroy our competitive capacity in foreign markets.  I remember saying to them on that occasion: &ldquo;Remember, there is a general election proceeding in the United States of America.  There is a general election proceeding in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  In both these countries inflation is being promoted for purely political reasons. <Col N="589" /> When these elections are over, they will be followed, whatever government is elected, by a sharp deflation to bring down unit labour costs&rdquo;&mdash; unit labour costs as defined in the extracts I have read&mdash;&ldquo;and when that time comes, your turnover tax here will operate in exactly the opposite direction.  Our unit labour costs will go up.&rdquo; The consequence will be that the industrial potential of the country will be ground between the upper and the nether millstone of the two greatest industrial countries in the world on either side of us.</P>
    <P>Look at Germany and the Common Market, and Sweden and EFTA, both operating on equal terms, in EFTA on preferential terms and in the European Economic Community as against Ireland.  There is no means on God's earth of correcting the unfavourable consequences offered by the competition of these two great bodies except that the Minister should succeed in persuading our employers and trade unions to sit down together, if necessary with him, and take the fundamental decision: do we want to stay free?  If we do not, then we ought to sell out to the highest bidder but let us be sure, if we are going to sell our souls, that we get the best price for them.  I would be happy to think that I will not be present when that transaction is consummated.  But if you take the decision as between labour and capital and the community represented by the Minister, that you desire to remain free, will you get that table brought up to date?  If we are not prepared to bring ourselves nearer to the bottom of that table with Sweden, the United States, France, Norway and Germany now, then the industries of this country and the employment they provide are doomed to extinction.</P>
    <P>These are the ugly facts of life that most people want to shy away from, and it is because we have been shying away for base political purposes from these facts since the day Fianna Fáil bought the Cork and Kildare by-elections, because we have turned our backs to these facts, that we are in the desperate situation in which we stand today.  Let no Deputy underestimate the gravity of the situation in which <Col N="590" /> we are.  I warn the House now that things in this country are going to get worse before we can hope to see them get better.  I warn the House that we are in a situation at the present time in which we are living from hand to mouth, in which we have no reserves, actual or potential, and God deliver us from any unforeseen emergency.  If such an emergency should come upon us, we should have to beg for charity in a world where charity is very rarely available at the present time.  Since this State was founded that has never been the case before.</P>
    <P>I want to recall again that in 1956, when Deputies Bill Norton and Michael Keyes, God rest them both, and Deputy Brendan Corish who is still with us, were joined with us in an inter-Party Government, when we were using the same criteria of finance the Government of today are using, we had a reserve of between £150 million and £200 million and yet we put on the levies to prevent the situation ever arising in which we find ourselves today.  Deputy Everett is still a Member of this House.  He was with us and he knows as I know how anxiously we weighed the question: should we continue to run into balance of payments difficulties or should we take precautions so as to keep in bond the reserves to provide against contingencies? We took the hard decision, and politically perhaps we paid for it but we have it to tell that we handed over to our successors in Government a favourable balance of payments the first year they were in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's job is to try to explain to the trade unionists and employers of this country the nature of the decision they have to take.  The whole theme of my discourse today is based on an exchange which took place at a meeting in Ballina when I was expounding a prices and incomes policy, and a man asked me: &ldquo;What would you do if they will not play?&rdquo; The answer was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" />&ldquo;I shall have failed.  If they will not voluntarily help but elect to cut one another's throats, there is nothing I or anybody else can do about it.&rdquo; If we are to get people to collaborate with the Minister on the work he is appointed to do, they have got to know the facts and have to have them explained.  They have got to be told that what the inter-Party Government did in 1956, that what Deputy Bill Norton and Deputy Michael Keyes agreed to do in 1956, was done for the protection of the working people of this country, and that has not been told often enough.</P>
    <P>Signs on it, in 1957, when we handed over to our successors, this country was standing on a rock, with abundant reserves and a favourable balance of payments.  But this Government, the Fianna Fáil Government, when they made up their minds to buy Cork and Kildare, launched the country into a dialectic which leaves us today with an appalling deficit in our balance of payments, with immense domestic debt due by the Government, with debts due to the Federal German Government in Bonn, with debts in Washington to the International Monetary Fund, with debts due in London, not to willing lenders but to underwriters who had to take up £4½ million of a miserable £5 million loan which the sovereign government of the Irish Republic offered for tender.</P>
    <P>Can you not see the emergency that threatens the country?  Can you not see that if you cannot carry conviction in these highly complex matters and explain them to the average trade unionist on the one hand and to the employers on the other, and I may add that some of the employers can be just as obscurantist as the average trade unionist, then there is no means of solving the problem.  I do not deny that one of my great difficulties in leading the Fine Gael Party at the last general election was that I knew the issues were so complex that to explain them to the people was extremely difficult. I could have taken the course, the Fianna Fáil course, of denying that they existed but I knew it would be a lie to do so.  I know it was a disgraceful <Col N="592" /> falsehood to ask the people to let Lemass lead on when he had no intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>I rejoice in his announcement that his retirement is for political and not for health reasons.  I rejoice that he has taken a leaf out of my book and laid down the burden before his health was impaired.  He has my sincerest good wishes in his retirement and I hope that his decision to leave down the burden will lengthen his years.  May he have plenty of them in happiness and prosperity.  But I knew it was a falsehood.  I knew he was leading the country into the position in which we now are and I tried to tell the people. I know that in large measure I failed to carry conviction to the ordinary people.  I know that many relatively sophisticated members of the audience did not understand.  All they could say was &ldquo;he is playing the same old gramophone record for the fourteenth time&rdquo; because they could not grasp it. They thought they were sophisticated but they were not.  I sympathise with the problem that lies before the Minister in trying to get both sides to understand it now, but that is the key of the whole problem and it all goes back to the fundamental decision: do we want to be rich and in bond or relatively poor and free?</P>
    <P>It is time Fianna Fáil examined their own consciences in regard to that. One of the blessings of sitting on the back benches is that one can sometimes speak more frankly than when one is the mouthpiece for a large Party. I committed my Party, when I was their Leader, to every pronouncement I made, but speaking in my present position I commit nobody.  How wise is the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, to follow my prudent example and acquire the freedom which I did so timely for myself.  I hope his contributions in the House hereafter will be as valuable to our deliberations as mine manifestly are.</P>

      <P>Diffidence is in vogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point of diffidence at my time of life?  I do not give a damn, and I am not giving the Minister a short answer.  When Deputy <Col N="593" /> Treacy was talking yesterday, one of his questions was a very relevant one. Where are the jobs for the trainees, Deputy Treacy asked.  If I could engage the Minister's attention for the moment I think this is an important question. I want to suggest that Deputy Treacy's question might be more appropriately addressed to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions rather than to the Minister for Labour.  I have known occasions when I went to look for jobs for fellows who had received training and I was told that the union would not give them a card.  I even know of unions who wanted to know was the father in the trade.  I have known of trade unions who claim for their progeny rights that the most reactionary duke or duchess never dreamed of claiming in the corrupt ages of the British aristocracy.  Am I unjust when I say that there are certain qualifications for entrance into certain unions? Is that not so?  In other cases are there not other strict restrictions on admissions to unions based on the total number of the union's estimate of jobs available related to the total number of its membership, efficient or inefficient?  In regard to Deputy Treacy's question, we must also ask ourselves where are the trade union cards for the trainees?  If we train the boy, can we be assured by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that if he reaches the appropriate level of skill to qualify, he will be guaranteed admission to the trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want trade unionists to think that that rebuke is directed exclusively to them.  The professional organisations have suddenly twigged to the trade unions' restrictive practices. When I entered the profession to which I belong, all one had to do was to pass the final examination and get called. Of course, there are never any restrictive provisions attached to admission to such exalted circles.  What happens is the standard of examination begins to rise and rise and rise, and you suddenly discover that in the first year only 70 per cent of the entrants passed the examination and in the following year, the same level has been maintained and if necessary, the level of <Col N="594" /> entrants drops.  This is not necessarily only in law; there are other professional organisations.  This is something the Minister for Labour might think about.  It is extremely difficult to resolve.  If a professional organisation says: &ldquo;Certainly, the doors are wide open but there is a qualifying examination which must be passed&rdquo;, that qualifying examination can be turned into a competitive examination.  Therefore if we say to the trade unions: &ldquo;Open your doors subject to a qualifying examination&rdquo;, which I would be quite prepared to admit was a just requisite on the part of a craft union, then at what stage does the qualifying examination become a competitive examination?  When the trade unions can reasonably answer that question it will be appropriate for Deputy Treacy to address this question to the Minister for Labour of the time being.  It is a matter primarily for the trade unions and it should continue to be a matter for the trade unions because they represent the men and they are the protectors of the rights of the workers and they should be worthy of the trust that they will protect the legitimate interest of the trainee.</P>
    <P>I would go into greater detail in regard to this question of admission to jobs but I understand that my Labour colleague wants to contribute to this debate but that he has an appointment elsewhere.  I shall therefore confine myself to wishing the Labour Minister luck in his new assignment.  However, I want to tell him that I believe he is merely a gimmick, like the meeting between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the farmers.  He is being created as a kind of general alibi and diversion as the Government's camouflage for the mess in which they are in.  I want a lot of convincing that he is anything more.  I hope he will be able to convince me and I agree with Deputy Treacy when he says that the Labour movement as a whole welcomes the appointment of a Minister of Labour but I have grave doubts as to the probability of his providing the solution of all the problems that confront him.  He may be successful in the task to which he professes to set his hand.  If he is, I shall be the first to <Col N="595" /> congratulate him but if he is not, I shall remind him&mdash;I hope&mdash;this time 12 months of the prophecy I made today, and I am gravely apprehensive that the event will justify me as amply as it has done in connection with the prophecy I made on July 8th.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon was making a very practical statement which was constructive in some respects and if he had continued in that vein, I would have congratulated him but he destroyed a good speech by adopting a pessimistic note and prophesying the failure of the Ministry of Labour in 12 months' time, saying that it was just a Fianna Fáil ramp and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what our calling in life is, if we do not take the initiative, nothing is done.  The Minister for Labour now has the task of trying to restore peace and improve relations between employer and employee on the industrial front.  He must also try to ensure that both young and old <Col N="596" /> secure the employment they are anxious to get.  It is a huge task and I am very pleased that the Minister was appointed to this post.  He will find as time goes on that he has done a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>As an old negotiator between employers and unions over a long period, I want to offer my sympathy and co-operation to the Minister in facing the problems confronting him. I would prefer co-operation between employers and unions.  I am a great believer in getting people together and hammering out an agreement rather than having legislation to compel them to do something.  When the Industrial Relations Act was going through the House, I resisted any compulsion because I felt, and I still feel, that the good that has been done through getting employers and employees to agree to a certain course or settlement in disputes in a spirit of harmony and goodwill far outweighs the few strikes that occur from time to time and make headlines.  I have had experience of dealing with CIE strikes and hotel strikes and others, with which I do not want to bore the House, but what I found was responsible for strikes on a number of occasions was bad human relations, especially in the big semi-Government bodies.  I should much prefer to have five volunteers working with me in a spirit of goodwill than have 20 working for me because they were compelled to do so under an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my colleague to move slowly in order to go more quickly. In that way he may be able to build up goodwill between the two sides.  He will no doubt get reports of cases of bad human relations in certain firms and cases where individual bosses or work study groups in certain employments I shall not mention are responsible for disputes arising.  I believe such factors are responsible&mdash;that has been my experience&mdash;for a good deal of the unpleasantness and strikes we have had.  A boss may get on a man's nerves but if a man is no use and will not pull his weight, no boss should be afflicted with him.  In certain firms, <Col N="597" /> bosses may not like certain individuals and have prejudices against them.  That may happen in a newspaper office or here in the Dáil, and I often feel it is a great pity that there should be a lack of training in human relations in men responsible for maintaining goodwill between employer and employee. That is a matter of deep concern to me and has been for a long time.  I think we should examine the position and see if we have the right people as labour relations officers and the right people as chairmen dealing with labour relations.  The Minister should begin by building up goodwill and understanding so that people will respect their bosses, so that bosses will get the co-operation and respect of their men.</P>
    <P>I often receive complaints from my constituents on both sides.  Sometimes it is an employer who has an unsatisfactory worker and cannot get rid of him.  On the other hand, there are employees who are unjustly dismissed. There is a case to be made on both sides.  Some bosses think very little of sacking a man.  The Minister has a very big problem on his hands.  I would ask him to inquire specially in regard to semi-State bodies where there are a large number of employees and where there is a lack of human relations. It is extraordinary that certain junior bosses who have come up from the ranks, who were trade unionists themselves, think nothing of sacking fellow workers, sometimes for very little.  They are not concerned whether they have a wife and family.  Heads of firms have said to me on a few occasions: &ldquo;I have to transfer them to some other part of the firm.  They have created chaos because they want to boss immediately they get promotion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department will have to tackle this problem of human relations: are we putting the right men into control?  It would not be possible for the Minister to go to a firm that employs 500 people and say: &ldquo;Are you putting the right man in charge?&rdquo; However, when disputes arise, the Minister will have an opportunity of examining this problem.  I am not so keen on all this work study business, especially in some big firms like CIE.  If John Jones has a job to do, <Col N="598" /> it is undesirable to have somebody watching him to see how long he takes to lift the hammer, how long he spends driving in the nails, and so on.  It causes a great deal of nervous tension when workers are being watched like that.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister and his Department to solve all these problems in a human way and if any worker will not co-operate, then there should be some other way of dealing with him than just saying to the remainder of the workers: &ldquo;We shall have to watch you as well as him.&rdquo; The whole kernel of my address to the House is the necessity for better human relations in all industries being built up through the employers' federation and the trade union movement.  I hope the trade unions and the employers' federation will co-operate fully with the Minister in the job he is doing.  The Minister has the toughest Ministry in the Cabinet. No matter what he tries to do, he will be up against snags.  However, my advice to him is to hasten slowly in regard to this very serious problem.  In the words of another&mdash;I was going to say in the words of the Gospel but I shall refrain from that in case Deputy Seán Collins may say something to me: &ldquo;They hate you and they do not know why and they will hate me and they do not know why.&rdquo; The Minister for Labour has the most ticklish Ministry and labour relations are the most difficult matters to deal with.  I have the utmost confidence in the Minister's ability to do the job.  I wish him good luck and hope that God will bless his work.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I shall not be in quite the &ldquo;benediction&rdquo; mood that Deputy Burke was in but I would not be honest if I did not say that, fundamentally, I wish the Minister every success in the task he has undertaken.  However, it is necessary to get certain aspects of that task right and on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we are going through what I have time and again described as an avalanche of whitewash, an avalanche of ministerial speeches preaching certain doctrines while the Government are carrying out the <Col N="599" /> direct opposite.  As a consequence of the repetition of governmental claptrap, the situation in industrial relations for a period worsened to an extent that became alarming.  We had the extraordinary situation that there were all kinds of preachings in relation to restraint while in so far as the Government were master of certain situations, no restraint at all was being exercised. Before the creation of this Ministry, the situation had developed where we were heading for chaotic conditions in industry.  It is in that situation that we had a new Ministry and have brought into charge a person like the present occupant of the office, Dr. Hillery, who has, I hope, and have always believed, a capacity and flexibility that enable him to exercise a human control over issues and who has sufficient steel in his make-up to be able to hold a definite situation.</P>
    <P>What difficulties face him, outside the question of his own capacity, his personal ability which, in fairness, I say we do not question on this side of the House?  Nor, indeed, would we for a moment question the sincerity and strength of purpose that he will bring to the job.  He is up against this difficulty, that we have a situation in which things are becoming more difficult, where the earning capacity of the general worker is losing the battle against the increased cost of living, where the atmosphere is being conditioned for more and more demands for increases.  While we get lengthy verbal gestures suggesting what should be done, we are still in the situation that even though many of the increases that have been given to various State servants, whether they are civil servants or persons allied to them in local authorities, or in the Garda, the Army or any of the Forces, might be well merited, they seem inopportune and certainly not in the pattern of an effort to encourage restraint among the workingclasses and among the more lowly paid sections of the community generally.</P>
    <P>The time has come, if the situation is deteriorating, for somebody to have the courage to say that this general <Col N="600" /> situation is not to apply only to the working-class people, only to trade unionists.  The time has come when somebody must have the courage to enforce the overall restraint or retrenchment on everybody in a voluntary, understood, national effort to rectify our economic situation.  While I have tremendous sympathy with the Minister for Labour, I think he will have to exercise tremendous influence if he is to get the kind of goodwill that is necessary to get employer, employee and, indeed, State employee, to accept the situation that certain voluntary restraint must be copperfastened on all sections of the community to enable us to stabilise the economy and to grapple with the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a complex situation. We have to gear up the capacity of our industry, we have to gear up productivity to make our end product competitive in increasingly highly competitive markets.  I know the difficulty the Minister is up against in trying to get greater output from skilled workers, if at the same time he has to tell them to postpone any claim for increased payment for their efforts to enable us to get our end products, particularly exports, into the market at competitive prices.  There would be a far better atmosphere in which to do that if at the same time the Minister can persuade the owner, the stockholder, the shareholder, the dividend recipient to accept restraint so as to enable the reserves of individual companies, like the reserves of the nation, to be stabilised and increased.</P>
    <P>I say this to the Minister in all earnestness, because there is nobody who would be more anxious for his complete success in the creation of a proper atmosphere for continued industrial expansion and development than I, that it cannot be done unless all elements are brought into the circle and all elements are prepared to make their voluntary, reasoned contribution on the basis of understanding and knowledge.</P>
    <P>I say, as emphatically as Deputy Dillon made his point, that I do not subscribe to the belief that the country <Col N="601" /> is as badly off or is going into as bad a situation as some people envisage.  I feel that it is lack of understanding, lack of appreciation of the situation that makes people at times make unwarranted predictions of bankruptcy or inevitable doom.  In spite of Governments, Fianna Fáil or otherwise, I have never lost my basic trust and confidence in the Irish people, whether in the agricultural industry, fighting for that export drive that is vital to our economy, or in the industrial arm, trying to make a full contribution to development.  We have got to the stage &mdash;and I think the Minister understands what I am driving at&mdash;that people are fed up to the teeth with skimping in one branch when they feel, in many cases unjustifiably, that other people are being treated far more generously, far more leniently and, indeed, in some cases getting plush treatment, while the more limited income groups are getting it hard.</P>
    <P>With the increased effective incidence of taxation, even the most lowly paid worker is now feeling the far-stretched tentacles of the Revenue Commissioners.  The success of PAYE, the turnover tax and now the wholesale tax is eating into the real value of small incomes.  Take the tradesman and the factory worker.  Because of increased efficiency of tax collection, they are more and more feeling the squeeze on their pay packets.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to deny any man in any avocation a just and reasonable salary.  I am not one to be frightened by the payment of very large sums to our most senior and experienced civil servants, consultants, technicians and other specialists.  But it is impossible to create an atmosphere of understanding if increases, ranging from £700 to £800 a year can be announced when people on pittances of £8 or £12 a week are copperfastened by a different limit.  It may be unfair to make that analogy, but we have to have regard to what is in the mind of the ordinary person.  I have not entered into controversy and argument about the gratuities and pensions paid to people.  But the ordinary person I meet around the country is allowing that to escalate into <Col N="602" /> an unreal argument.  This is creating an atmosphere the Minister will have to break down before an atmosphere of peaceful co-operation and effective negotiation can develop.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the Minister with fripperies and nonsense.  I want to say something it is timely to say. The workers are basically our forward troops in the fight to improve our economy.  We cannot get the best out of them if we allow employers and shareholders to have a greater portion of the world's goods than that to which the workers are entitled.  I say, with all the conviction of a person who knows, that you cannot ask a man in the lower income group to accept restraint on the basis of national necessity&mdash;and this restraint must be reflected by stringency in the home&mdash; when he feels somebody else is getting more than a little more.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have to stop his colleagues preaching rubbish or else make it clear that, if the worker is prepared to accept restraint, the company director will have to accept it also.  The higher paid officials, while they are perfectly entitled to their increases, will have to forgo them until such time as we have got this economy moving again.  The more goodwill you can create in getting this accepted, the more hopeful we will be for the ultimate success of the Minister's Department.  It would be unfair to level criticism at what I call the new infant until it has got over the initial squalling stage.  We will come back in 12 months to assess, perhaps with a more critical eye, the efforts the Minister has made.</P>
    <P>Without going into the problems we see escalating at the moment in certain industries, the strikes that seem to be inevitable, I say to the Minister: your problem now is to set the standards, set the scale of restraint, making argument for it on the basis of its being necessary in order to put industry right. Do that on an overall basis and, first and foremost, give a genuine earnest from the Government themselves that they will not ask people not to do as they do but to do as they say.  Make us all do unto others as we would want <Col N="603" /> them to do in the present situation of trying to achieve industrial export efficiency to condition us for EEC.  Get management to accept a situation in which they will be expected to leave more &ldquo;in the kitty&rdquo; for the present. Get workers to understand that, if they have to accept a little less in order to bring about increased efficiency, they will not only be contributing to the nation's wellbeing, but ensuring for themselves that when this period of restraint is over, their skills will be recognised and ultimately recompensed to the extent they merit.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of philosophy I ask the Minister to bring to his Ministry. That is the type of effort which I feel will create the confidence he requires in all sections of the community. In that atmosphere, I feel he will be able to prove as effective in his own quiet way as he did&mdash;I will be one of the first to acknowledge it &mdash;during his period as Minister for Education.  With quiet, efficient, undemonstrative action, I believe the Minister may be able to create an atmosphere to ensure that not only will his job be done but well done.</P>

      <P>I shall try to be brief because I am aware the Minister is anxious to get in this evening.  I want to join with other speakers in wishing the Minister luck in this new Department. I sincerely hope he will be a success.  Famous people have said that personality counts and I am sure the Minister's personality will be an asset to him in this work.  I think it is generally appreciated throughout the country that he does possess that great quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I entered this House on the same occasion away back in 1951.  I do not know if he was luckier than I because he was elected to this House all down through the years and he has risen to his present high office.  I was out of this House for a number of years and, although I cannot say whether it was for better or for worse, one finds, when one gets away from the atmosphere of this building, that one learns quite a lot from dealing with <Col N="604" /> the public and in the rough and tumble of resuming one's normal occupation.  I found that the business I engaged in had changed considerably in the intervening period.  I had an opportunity of viewing at first hand the problems these changes brought about from the point of view of employers and from the point of view of the labour force engaged in some of these businesses.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made of the Government, of the Taoiseach and of Ministers.  Some Deputies seem to think that the Government are responsible for the whole trouble, for the mismanagement and unrest that have been evident for some years past.  I have been critical of the Government on various occasions and I hope to be critical of them again this evening in some respects, but I must say that many of the problems that arose were not of our own making. Those of us who have had experience know and appreciate that many of the problems were created as a result of conditions across the water, particularly in England.</P>
    <P>This country was embarking upon industrial development and was finding itself in violent conflict with countries that traditionally engaged in industry, countries that had many advantages over us in experience and skills and also in the very important matter of the availability of raw materials right beside them.  Therefore, we laboured under many disadvantages.  We had the difficulty of training personnel.  We had the problem of people leaving the land to go into industrial employment and we had the problem of trying to gain experience in the export field.  We had to get markets and to hold on to these markets when we got them.</P>
    <P>Having engaged in the export trade, I realise how difficult the problems can be, particularly when we appreciate that we were up against a big industrial country with long experience of this type of work.  I therefore feel, as other Deputies have said, that the problem facing the Minister is a major problem.  We shall have to try to enlist the goodwill of all concerned in order <Col N="605" /> to get out of the rut in which we have been for some time past.</P>
    <P>The economic situation generally&mdash; the problem of the balance of payments and the restriction of credit&mdash;has helped to create more problems than would normally apply.  The Minister should take a hard look at the position as it has prevailed over the years in some industries.  I have in mind one such industry in my town which has stood the test of time.  It was established there without any Government assistance. In fact, it was established in the days of British rule in this country when we had no trade unions or, if we had, I did not hear of them.  That industry aimed at producing a high quality article.  There were good relations at all times between management and workers and, for 80 or 90 years, that industry has operated without a strike or a hold-up.  They had their problems and their difficulties but they surmounted them because the management and workers pulled together. They were, as it were, one family&mdash; something like the type of goodwill for which Deputy Burke asked this evening.</P>
    <P>There are a number of long-established industries in this city and in rural areas.  I do not want to embark upon an advertising campaign by mentioning the names of some of these very old-established firms.  One is a biscuit manufacturing industry and another manufactures stout.  It is only in recent years that one of these companies experienced labour problems.</P>
    <P>It would seem that sometimes misunderstanding arises between management and labour because the working man thinks that his company is making an enormous profit.  When a man earning £15 or £18 a week hears that his company has made a profit of £100,000, then, if he is not accustomed to thinking in terms of money, it seems a tremendous profit to make in any one year.  Some companies may have to carry on for periods of two or three years without making any profit.  Now and again, one finds that the working man forgets that side of the picture but will draw the attention <Col N="606" /> of the whole country to the fact that the company has made a large profit. I know that because I deal with the ordinary public and meet members of the public regularly.  It appears in the paper that a company has made a profit and straight away the workers feel that, just because the company have had a good year, they have nothing to do except increase the workers' wages.  In some cases that is not fair to the company.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we know there are companies which have workers working for them for a mere pittance. Time was when bad employers could get labour.  The people did not have the backing of the trade unions; they were not members of trade unions and there was no one to fight for them. Some employers got rich on the backs of the poor working men.  Thank God, that day is passing.  As Deputy Dillon put it, in the course of his eloquent address, if workers have grumbles today, they are due in the main to two causes: the workers do not belong to a trade union or someone in the trade union movement is not looking after their interests.  I can hardly visualise the latter situation occurring today because trade unions generally are competing against one another to improve membership.</P>
    <P>I believe there is need for greater enlightenment.  The workers should be made aware of the employers' problems and management should be considerate of its workers.  That type of good relationship between management and labour is most desirable if we are to have further expansion and greater progress, particularly in the industrial sphere.  There seems to be some doubt with regard to our position in relation to joining the European Economic Community.  That doubt is creating an atmosphere of suspense and tension.  It would be to our advantage, in my opinion, if we could get into the Community on well defined grounds and with guaranteed prices.  All down through the years, we have been in the position of having the one traditional market and, when we had a surplus, the British were always prepared to take advantage of that situation to decrease prices.  I know that to my cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>These things are fundamentally tied up with workers and good labour relations.  Now and again firms engaged in export find themselves in the unhappy position of having to lay off workers.  A company may be carrying a very heavy overdraft on which they pay interest. Employers have problems as well as workers.  Deputy Burke referred to the case of the ruthless employers who tell a worker he is no longer wanted and he goes down the road to tell his wife and children there will be no pay packet; that is a dreadful situation.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in the by-elections in Cork and Kildare was responsible for misleading the people and creating the impression that increases could be granted to workers.  They were granted because the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Government thought they would win votes on the strength of these increases, and they did win votes.  I was not a Member of the House at that time and I had plenty of leisure time in which to read the daily papers.  I got the impression then that things were very much better than turned out to be the case later.  The Taoiseach went so far as to say that it was hoped the workers would get further increases. I do not accuse the present Minister of being guilty of making statements like that.  I did not read any statement made by him of that type but the leader of his Party, the Taoiseach, did make them and that created a state of unrest; it was as a result of these statements that we have experienced all these strikes and other problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I comment on the Minister's speech, I feel obliged to make a few points in relation to some of the things said by some of the speakers so far in this debate.  The first is a statement made by the last speaker, Deputy O'Hara.  Deputy O'Hara was at considerable pains to show how workers reacted to firms' profits and he also said that the workers have <Col N="608" /> alleged on some occasions that their employers are living on the backs of their workers.  There is no denying that latter statement.  Deputy O'Hara is obviously <i>au fait</i> with what is going on when he says this is a matter for the trade union movement.  I am sure Deputy O'Hara knows, as every Deputy should know&mdash;perhaps some Deputies do not want to know&mdash;that every worker is not a member of a trade union and it is not every employer who welcomes the entry of a trade union into his firm.  Those who like to see trade unions operating are in a minority, not a majority.  A considerable number of employers are anti-trade union and take every possible precaution to ensure that their workers do not join a trade union.  That attitude is very prevalent throughout the whole country.  I expected that the Minister, when making his opening statement, would advert to that situation and point out how archaic such an approach is, particularly if it is our ambition to make progress in regard to employer-worker relations.  I could mention a case in point.  I do not think it is necessary to exercise one's imagination to any extent in order to substantiate what I am saying.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Dillon, Deputy Dillon can express all the concern he likes and make as many forecasts as he likes as to what will happen to advocate that there should be a proper understanding between employers and trade unions.  He must take into consideration that he is talking about organised trade unions and organised employers.  He has not said a word about the employers who are not organised or who are organised in either of the two big employers' associations and who will not subscribe to trade union agreements.  These are the people who should be, and who deserve to be castigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon saw fit to admonish my colleague, Deputy Treacy, when he made a very pertinent inquiry as to where are the jobs for the trainees. He continued to castigate us and the trade union movement and suggested that this is a matter for the Irish Congress <Col N="609" /> of Trade Unions.  What nonsense! It is a clear indication of how much out of touch Deputy Dillon is when he makes such a statement.  Is he not aware of the existence of the Apprenticeship Act, an Act that has come about as a result of the operation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its constituent bodies?  Is he aware that one of the main reasons why the trade unions combined in the early days was the absence of jobs and opportunities?  Would it not be in order to direct his attention to the case of the other side?  Many employers in this House can answer him with regard to the number of opportunities they give to their employees to become managers and directors.</P>
    <P>It is not a case of the haves and have-nots.  Everybody knows that there are certain walks of life into which the working man is forbidden to enter.  For that reason, the working men had to combine.  There is no continuation nowadays of the practice which Deputy Dillon quoted when he said that &ldquo;you cannot be a member of a trade union if your father was not a member.&rdquo; That is the practice that obtains today on the employer's side.  No one can be a director or manager unless the post is handed down to him from his father.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggests some examination of human beings as to their suitability for employment.  This is the kind of treatment we would be getting if Deputy Dillon had his way, but, thank God, he is now confined to the back benches.  I cannot join with him either when he says that this Department is a gimmick.  I do not regard it as a gimmick.  We in the trade union movement, who know much more about the operation of industry than Deputy Dillon, have been clamouring for a Department of Labour for a long time.  It is a pity this Department did not come sooner.  In the early days of this State, we had a Minister for Labour and why that situation was ever departed from is beyond me.  If we bear in mind the continual agitation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, we will understand why this Department has come about.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech, he refers to <Col N="610" /> the progressive improvements in the social welfare code.  It is quite pertinent to ask him to define these comprehensive improvements.  If we look at that code at the moment, it could never be described as comprehensive.  It can only be described, when we take into consideration what is happening in other European countries, as a backward code, a code crying out for attention. Let us hope that in so far as this Department is concerned with aspects of the social welfare code, those aspects will be turned into something that can be described as progressive.</P>
    <P>In the second paragraph of his speech, the Minister says that in pointing out the limits imposed on those seeking improvements in pay and conditions, he does not suggest that workers and others should suspend efforts to secure improvements.  Who are these others?  I understand that the Minister is talking about working people and later he goes on to refer to the employers.  Perhaps we would hear from him when he is replying whom is he referring to when he mentions these others.</P>
    <P>In dealing with safety measures, health, and general welfare, the Minister gave a fair outline of what is in existence at the moment except that he neglected to indicate how badly serviced the Factories Act department is. Recently by means of a question I asked in this House, I elicited the information from the Minister that so far as factory inspectors are concerned, we have a staff of one chief inspector of factories, five senior industrial inspectors, 19 industrial inspectors, one information officer, one industrial psychologist and one industrial officer.  I should mention that of the factory inspectors, only three are females, while at the same time a considerable number of females are employed in the State.</P>
    <P>I also elicited from the Minister that in the matter of the employment of females as factory inspectors, it has been difficult to get them for this work and that he did not have sufficient response to the advertisements declaring these posts vacant.  He did say that there was the same minimum salary for males and females but he also said that <Col N="611" /> as far as the maximum salary was concerned, there was a difference.  This is a very serious situation, particularly in the Department of Labour where we have given lip service to the ideal of equal pay for equal work.  It is a poor inducement to employers to offer equal pay if this is to be the condition in State employments.</P>

      <P>The fact that 40,000 Dublin people marched last night in protest against the outrageous proposed rent increases speaks far more than anything any one of us can say here.  I should like to congratulate the people involved in the parade, the people who organised it, the people who acted as stewards and all the people, old and young, men and women, who participated in one of the greatest parades this city has ever seen, and we have seen a good many of them in our time for different causes.  Never, however, was there such a tremendous spontaneous demonstration by the people, a people who are not given to being demonstrative and who, when they come out in such numbers, are certainly making an uncontradictable protest against an outrageous proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sorry that some people in the <Col N="612" /> parade appeared to think that they were being left alone and that they had nobody to speak on their behalf, either in the City Council or Dáil Éireann.  However, they may have read the newspapers this morning and learned that they are not alone in this fight.  Unfortunately, while we can fight with them and protest with them, the decision lies with the Minister for Local Government, as representative of the Government, and if he withdraws his dictate to the city managers and the local authorities throughout the country, then this fierce imposition on the poor people need not take place.</P>
    <P>The justification for asking people today to pay not for their houses but for houses to be built in the future, to be occupied by people who will not be contributing as much towards the cost as people already in residence, is something that needs to be repudiated. I appeal to all Members of this House to consider this matter as above Party.  We must not adopt here what is a completely repugnant philosophy, that is, that people ought to pay for something which is to be enjoyed by future generations.  That is exactly what we are doing.  We are going to oblige people to pay rents which are three or four times beyond the true economic rent of the dwellings they hold in order to fill the coffers of the Government which are empty because the Government failed to build houses when money was cheap and because over the years they failed to maintain the proportion of subsidy for houses which existed when they came into power.  If the Government had maintained a proper subsidy for houses, there would have been more local authority houses and they would not have to fleece the tenants to produce a much higher income.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, that is the one and only purpose of the scheme, to produce more money, and the fallacious and dishonest arguments produced by the Minister that what he is doing is seeking to help the poorer people simply will not wash.  When all additions and substractions are made, there is going to be a colossal and immoral <Col N="613" /> increase in the amount of money exacted from people in local authority dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ryan&mdash;although I do not always agree with him&mdash;that it is most desirable to approach this matter on a non-political, non-Party basis.  Last night's demonstration was a clear indication that the people of Dublin, irrespective of their politics, are very concerned about the situation, and very rightly concerned. We should bear in mind the history of this matter and what appears to be the situation that arose from a circular letter sent to local authorities by the Minister on 26th September last.  These proposed increases in the Dublin area, and the introduction of an objectionable tenant purchase scheme, have produced the situation&mdash;whether this was intended or not remains to be seen&mdash; that there appears to be an attempt to divide workers from workers, to set corporation tenants paying flat rents or differential rents against SDA tenant purchasers.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, very wrong to bring this about because all of them are members of the working classes and there is no denying the fact that you will find brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of corporation tenants being obliged, because of the corporation's inability to provide houses, to set out to purchase their houses.  Such people are required to obtain very large deposits, apart from the loan.  The deposits have been shown to be £600 or £800 and I have often said that one might as well ask these people to obtain £6,000 or £8,000.  What they do is obtain a loan to pay the deposit and after that they have to get the loan to buy the house, after which they have to buy furniture on hire purchase, so that one can well imagine their commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most amazing thing about all this is that up to now no comprehensive statement has been issued to the press by Dublin Corporation to show what the rents will be.  Last weekend there was in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and <i>Evening Press</i> a suggestion that there was to be some relief for corporation tenants, whether paying a flat rent or <Col N="614" /> paying a differential rent.  The idea went abroad that the City Manager had had second thoughts about the matter and had decided to reduce the amounts he originally intended to fix. It has since transpired this was incorrect and that what the press published was something which they had got from the City Manager who said it had not been changed from what he had said.  One is safe in saying that the reason it was circulated to the press last weekend was the impending march which took place last night.  Possibly it was done with a view to dissuading people from making a public protest, in the hope that they would be deluded into thinking they would get some relief whereas it has transpired they will not get relief.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this matter but one worrying feature of it is the amount of increases advocated in respect of corporation tenants and how frequently this happens.  There are numerous scales included in this document which is a pretty lengthy one. Only members of the City Council got it and I should say, in fairness to them, that no decision has been taken by them on this document because it was discussed only in the Housing Committee. The council proper have not made a decision on it but whether they decide or not, in the final analysis, the City Manager has the power to implement it.  The increases in some cases mean an extra 9/- a week and it is advocated that these should be over a five-year period, 9/- for every year. That is the type of increase proposed.</P>
    <P>A peculiar situation exists in this regard because of what many Ministers have said throughout the country, particularly the Minister for Transport and Power, who has a great <i>penchant</i> for talking down to workers and telling them to work for so much but work harder.  We had the Minister for Finance expressing similar views last week, that we should not look for increases, but at the same time workers are expected to remain quiet while their rents are increased.  A rent increase postulates the necessity for further increases in wages.  That cannot be denied and this agitation to increase rents is absolutely contradictory <Col N="615" /> of what other Ministers are preaching.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter to which it is necessary to advert in connection with corporation rented houses is this.  In my constituency houses were built in 1934, 1936 and 1938.  The maximum rent then was quite low but it is now advocated that the maximum rent for such houses should be 12/6d a room.  The reason given is that we must get an economic rent.  When these houses were being allocated, it was determined that the full economic rent then was £1 8s 8d which included rates, etc. It is now suggested that the same type of four-roomed house should be 50/-and tenants who have been 30 years paying rent, rates and maintenance charges are now asked to pay that amount.</P>
    <P>This requires serious reconsideration. The type of house to which I refer was built for about £400, £410 or £420. Some cost a little more but what it appears is now being advocated is that the tenant will be offered a house 30 years old and for which rent has been paid for over 30 years at the price of a house at present.  There seems to be no regard for what these people have been paying for so long. We know that schoolgoing children always require attention and what I find wrong with the existing differential rent scheme is that insufficient relief is given to the married man with the large family, none of whom is working. They are either going to school or too young to go.  Anything such a man has over and above the cost of keeping and clothing them will go on education.  In cases of this kind, relief should be given, but instead, such a married man, quite apart from the new scheme, is required to pay one-sixth of the increase in wages he gets. In the case of the last £1 increase which was not given freely or obtained by the Government but which was negotiated, those who were corporation tenants under a differential rent scheme were required to pay one-sixth of it in rent.  That does not happen to others and it is very wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> There was the case of a fire in a house in my constituency.  The family was burned out.  They had been on a flat rent but had to be moved when the house was burned down.  It is now being repaired.  They were moved to a house which had been given up by the former occupants who had enough to enable them to live elsewhere.  Their son, who shall be nameless, bought them a house.  He was a very famous person.  That house was on a flat rent but when the people moved in from the burned house, they were required to pay a differential rent.  This shows the mania that has developed in regard to differential rents.  We often talk about the bad old days and how badly the British behaved but at least under the Labourers Act there was provision for accommodation of tenants in a house or some sort of habitation at a reasonable charge and the rates were used to subsidise it.  I am not suggesting the rates should be used to subsidise corporation tenants.  I am satisfied that corporation tenants are paying rates and also that there is need for relieving the working class ratepayers and need for the Government to do something about well-heeled ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to what Deputy Ryan said about this not being a political matter.  It should not be, but it is a matter that has caused great concern. There were members of Fianna Fáil cumainn carrying banners in last night's parade, also members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and people who are not interested in any Party.  They marched because they are concerned about this matter.  We can talk about it as much as we like but we shall not satisfy the people concerned unless something positive is done for them in regard to this set of proposals.  Something must be done.  As Deputy Ryan said, it was a peaceful and very dignified demonstration.  There was no sitting on the ground.  The people behaved in a very orderly fashion and, I understand, intend to continue to act in that way but they are not prepared to accept this type of scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a very reputable organisation in this city which is non-political <Col N="617" /> and has within its ranks all shades of political thought.  One of the Fianna Fáil Deputies was a delegate to this body, the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  The Dublin Council of Trade Unions, which represents over 100,000 organised workers in this city, passed a resolution last night condemning this new scheme and calling on the Minister to do something about it.  It is very easy to say this should not be done and, at the same time, neglect to say what should be done.  However, if we keep this matter out of the political arena, if we have regard to the representations made by the body representing the marchers last night and have regard to the representations which I am sure the Minister will receive from the Dublin Council of Trade Unions, we can come to an amicable solution in this connection.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is alarm about the situation and that is not conducive to the solution of our housing problem. Our housing situation cannot be solved by introducing measures of the kind against which my colleagues and I are protesting.  As has been said on numerous occasions and indicated on some of the placards carried last night, this type of measure only points to the emigrant ship.  It means, in effect, that a considerable number of people will find that they cannot afford to pay what it is being suggested they should pay.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to instruct all the managers of local authorities to act in a more democratic fashion in this matter, to have, if necessary, a spate of consultations with members of the local authority and, indeed, all the appointed representatives of the people involved in this very serious situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that needs to be clearly understood in this discussion&mdash;and I am afraid it is becoming very much misunderstood&mdash;is the hard fact that in regard to Dublin and in regard to any protests or gestures as to people's unwillingness to operate the scheme that is being talked about, there is nothing officially before the Minister for Local Government. <Col N="618" /> It is being suggested that the circular letter which is being complained about as the instrument which initiated all this activity was issued by the Minister for Local Government for the sole purpose of increasing rents in order to increase income to the housing account of the various local authorities.  The circular complained about so bitterly now was issued about the end of last March and it is particularly noteworthy that the motion which we are now discussing was brought up the list from No. 29 on the Order Paper and &ldquo;coincidentally&rdquo; coincided with the protest march of last night, and that that motion condemning the circular of last March only arrived on the Order Paper some time in the month of October.</P>
      <P>One might well ask were the Deputies who are responsible for the motion aware of this circular's existence last March.  If they were aware of it, why wait until October to put in a motion condemning it?  Why the urgency to arrange to bring it up the list in order to have it discussed last night and tonight?  I merely put the questions.  I shall leave it to the House to judge for itself what the answers must be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to what has been said here in regard to the matter, I want the House to understand clearly that in relation to the circular and any pronouncements I have made&mdash;and I made quite a few long before this circular was ever issued dealing with rents&mdash;my view was and always will be, I hope, that the poor people will be enabled to be housed by our local authorities even if it means they are paying no rent whatsoever.  If in our operations we find that, in order to do this, we must ask for a bigger contribution from people who may now according to their means, be paying less than they are able to afford and less than their houses are worth in relation to the service they are getting from those houses, and if the ratepayers and taxpayers are paying their fair contribution, surely it is not unreasonable to ask them to pay that bit more?  I speak of those people who are getting good value for their money, getting good houses for their rent, and it is <Col N="619" /> not unreasonable to ask them to help the taxpayer and ratepayer to house people who are unhoused in this city and in every town throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In spite of the lowest rents that any of the local authorities have yet devised, we find that in some cases those rents are still too high for the poorest of our poor who are still condemned to live in bad housing conditions and who can never look forward to getting out of those conditions unless we are prepared, through the Government and the local authorities, to bring about the situation that rents will run from zero to the top, and that this should be operated at all stages according to the ability of the people to pay.  If there are instances under the Dublin Corporation housing scheme whereby people are being asked to pay increases in rent which they cannot afford, all I can say is that, if that is so, in any single instance or in any general group of instances, there is something fundamentally wrong with the differential rent scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not discussing, and I do not intend to discuss, the details of this new scheme which has not yet been processed by Dublin Corporation to the point where it would come to the Minister.  The House will appreciate that it is not for me at this stage to go into the details, on purely hypothetical grounds, of a scheme that is now being considered by the corporation but has not been processed and may be changed in many respects before it finally emerges.  The whole purpose of a house renting scheme should be to ensure that the people who occupy the houses are in a position to pay the rent without undue hardship.  Naturally this must take into consideration the means of those who live in the houses.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I want Deputies to be clear is that in this circular it is pointed out that what I have asked for is a rationalisation of rents.  I do not want anybody, no matter how glib he may be, to try to convert &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; into what is termed a demand to increase rents. <Col N="620" /> That is not being fair either to this House or to the tenants for whom certain people are allegedly talking. This is misleading and mischievous, to say the least of it.  In so far as it is unfair to me, I do not really mind that, but please remember that I have the interests of these people at heart and that I want to see a housing system in this country whereby we shall have houses for all our people and whereby the poorest of the poor will be housed and that a house will not be denied to them because the lowest rent in this or any other scheme is too high for them.  This has happened in this city.  It has happened in every other local authority in the country. We are moving away from that and the sooner we get away from it the better.</P>
    <P>Let us not be divided on this issue. Let us not get involved to the stage where our points of view become obscure.  I have told the House what I want.  If that is what the people who are speaking on the motion want, then the only question is: how do we best arrive at that point in regard to housing and the renting of our houses?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have indicated, not tonight or last night, but in the past, that they as a Party agree with the principle of differential renting. They claim not only to adhere to the principle but that they are initiators of the principle.  I do not want to make any claim as to who initiated it.  I agree with the principle; they agree with the principle.  Again, here is common ground.  If they agree, they and all those who agree with the principle of differential renting should stop criticising the Minister for Local Government and attributing motives to him that do not exist and never will. They should realise that this is a matter of the principle of differential renting being applied to our people in the best way that we as public representatives in this House and outside it can devise. It is not by throwing it across at me that I am doing this or pushing rents up or demanding that they should go up that we will arrive at a solution that will meet the principle of differential renting of which the Labour Party claim to be initiators and with which <Col N="621" /> principle I agree and would like to see applied.  We have to try from there to find a way.</P>
    <P>In regard to the discussions that will arise and the debates that will take place in Dublin Corporation and every local authority where this matter comes up, I would say to all concerned that these debates are necessary and that they should be pretty lengthy and should cover the whole field and no decision should be taken on either the scales or the application of differential renting without full, long, reasoned and mature consideration.</P>
    <P>It is worth doing, we believe, and it is worth doing properly.  What is needed most at the moment is an appreciation of its worth, an appreciation at the same time of the pitfalls that may lie in the way of those who try to apply a system of differential renting without proper and mature consideration.  So, I would say, from here tonight, to all local authorities, when dealing with this matter not to brush it aside or agree to its going through and I say to managers as well as elected representatives to consider the matter well; give everybody all the information for or against that anybody has in regard to their particular scheme.  They should not try to force the issue because, if they do, then mistakes will be made which will be attributed to the scheme in principle which would be unfair to the whole idea of differential renting.  I believe the principle is good, that it can be fairly applied, that it can bring about the situation which I and many others desire, that nobody will be denied a house because he is too poor to pay the rent.  This we can attain and it can be helped along by differential renting applied with reason and after mature consideration.</P>
    <P>So, again, as I say, do not let us jump to conclusions, whether at local level or here.  I can assure the House that in so far as my Department and the Minister for Local Government are concerned, we will not jump to conclusions either in regard to any scheme that comes to us, no matter from which local authority, big or small, in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> A number of other things have been said about this whole matter of housing, many of which were said only a few weeks ago and which I shall not reply to in detail now as we have already dealt with all these things at great length on the Estimate a short time ago.  It is being said in furtherance of this motion, for instance, that the State has been reducing its contribution to housing costs, that the level of assistance given to Dublin Corporation tenants has been progressively declining, that the Minister is not asking those in private houses to bear increased costs.</P>
    <P>Not one of these three statements made by different Deputies is correct. I do not want to bore the House with figures, but to be fair, let us look at the figures.  We find that the contributions to housing in 1950-51 were: State contributions, £259,890; rates contributions, £350,807.  By 1960-61, the figure of £259,890 had gone to £672,702 and the £350,807 had gone to £623,572.  By 1965-66, the State contribution of £259,890 had gone to £989,000 and the rates contribution had risen in the same period from £350,807 to £919,000.  The total of State contribution and contribution from the rates of £610,697 in 1950-51 had risen to £1,908,000 in 1965-66.</P>
    <P>Against those figures, no one can contend that there has been a progressive reduction in the amount being given by the State or that there has been a reduction in the contribution from the rates in these recent years. Far from it: the reverse is quite clearly evident.  That is why I say these statements are not correct.</P>
    <P>Persons in private houses have been weighed on the other side of the scale and it is being said that the Minister is not asking those in private houses to bear increased costs, the inference being that we are slapping on the increased costs on those in public authority or local authority houses and that the people in private houses are getting away with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons in private housing, unfortunately, have been bearing increased costs over these years. For instance, the housing rate in Dublin was 5/0.5d in 1963-64; 5/4d in 1964-65; 6/5¾d in 1965-66 and 7/6¾d in 1966-67; in other words, a 50 per cent increase on that head by the private persons, who are the ratepayers, in three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with mortgage repayments, the Minister will recall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I recall this also: Deputy Ryan&mdash;again no fault to him for this&mdash;used the old gambit that is used by anyone with a poor argument, namely, to use figures to his own advantage and to forget the cause in which he is using them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that as I recall&mdash;and if my recollection is not accurate, the Deputy will correct me&mdash;when the Deputy mentioned this matter of mortgage repayments not increasing, the Deputy was comparing a person in a rented house which was built in, we will say, 1938, as against the person who began to pay for a house he had built and got a loan for in 1938, and was making the case that the rent of the house from 1938 onwards may be increased, whereas the mortgage repayment for a house built at the same time for a private person need not and will not have risen in the interim.  The Deputy seems to forget that all houses purchased <Col N="624" /> by people were not new houses in the first instance.  The house bought in 1938, although built in 1914, probably cost more in 1938 than it cost to build it in 1914.  Likewise the house built in 1938 and sold to somebody again in 1957&mdash;that would be a bad year to take, the year of the slump; say, in 1960 or 1961&mdash;that house in 20 or 30 years is probably worth three or four times what it cost to build.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Ryan wants to follow another line of argument, he must be logical and come to the conclusion that property, even though it appreciates in value, no matter for what reason, should not be allowed to realise that value because of the fact that people in rented houses have to pay increases whereas these other people are getting away with it or even making money if they sell.  There is no point in trying to use an argument to bolster up a case that a motion by the Labour Party is in fact the bandwagon on which he and his Party now wish to jump.  However, they missed the bus by not having a bandwagon of their own.</P>

The tactic is that, if they can waste my time in this way, what I have to say is curtailed.  As the Ceann Comhairle reminded us, he cannot do as the referee in a football match can do when the ball is deliberately kicked out.  He cannot stop his watch and allow extra time at the end.  If matters were otherwise, this tactic would not succeed.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation have a job to do.  I expect that when it comes to submitting schemes to the Department, the corporation will not only have a full understanding of what the effects of the proposed scheme will be but they will take good care to make everybody else, particularly the tenants of the corporation housing estates, aware of what is being done, why it is being done, how it is being done and in what way it will affect particular cases.  I am sure the corporation will see to it that full information will be made available in the months ahead to enable the situation to be clearly understood before the final scheme is sent to the Minister.</P>
      <P>There has been an outcry here from Fine Gael that these increases in rents, proposed to take place as a result of a scheme which is not yet a reality either in the corporation or the Department, will blow the cost of living sky high.  I have here an interesting little statistic that can be applied in the future.  A general increase of 20 per cent in all rents, private and local authority, would increase the cost of living by less than one per cent. I am giving that statistic for what it is worth.</P>

      <P>Do you think I have really gone over it all?  I know these gentlemen do not want to hear me. I am sorry because I have a lot to give, but we will have to leave that for some other time.  I know Deputy Dillon likes to hear me talk and he will get an opportunity in the not too distant future.  My basic instinct about this matter of housing and rents is no <Col N="628" /> different from that of everybody else in this House.  The question is how can we reach a common way of achieving this.  I think if we accept that we are moving to the same point and the same end and have the same thing in mind, then we can take it reasonably and I believe that we can do it without any rows and without any further protest marches.  This, I believe, is possible.  I appeal to the Labour Party and to other Deputies to realise that my wish is their wish, that it is a common end and that the only thing is to find the means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has already been very well made for this motion condemning the action of the Minister in urging and advising city and county managers to revise, and in fact to increase, rents because that is what it means and that is the outcome of it. The Minister has used all the ability at his disposal here this evening to exonerate himself and the Government from any responsibility whatsoever for the proposed increases in these rents. He says now that it was something that started entirely with these managers and with the local authorities and, in fact, that he is not responsible at all or that the Government are not in any way responsible.  He goes back and talks about the fact that the circular that has been mentioned was issued last March and that now we are getting the protest in October.  I think it should be said that the circular of last March dealt principally and almost entirely with new lettings and not with existing rents.  The interpretation the managers have given to this, of course, is that all rents must be revised. I think they have probably been helped in that interpretation by the use of the telephone and various other means that exist to exhort managers to do the will of the Government and the will of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no doubt in anybody's mind that the idea behind the whole scheme was to get more money from the people themselves so that the contribution from the Government for housing would be so much less.  It has always been recognised that the whole reason for subsidising local authority rents was an acknowledgment of the <Col N="629" /> fact that the wages and incomes of the families were insufficient to permit them to pay the full economic rent and, in some cases, anything like the economic rent.</P>
    <P>Are we saying now that conditions have improved to the extent that it is no difficulty whatsoever to these families to pay 8/- or 9/- more a week and to pay it not only this year but for the next five years?  The Minister has given us statistics this evening and told us that a 20 per cent increase in rent would increase the cost of living by only a little more than one per cent. I think the way to count this is as follows.  Let us take the scheme that has been put up by the city and county manager, this scheme which says the increase they are proposing is an increase of 8/- per week on a four-roomed house and 9/- per week on a five-roomed house&mdash;and that is to take place over a period of five years, which can be an increase of over £2 in the case of individual houses.  If the Minister says that this is not a burden and that he cannot see it as a burden, I think the onus is on him to indicate that the wages of these families have increased so that in fact they have suddenly got an additional 8/- or 9/-a week and this increase in rent will not be felt by them and will not eventuate in less food or worse clothing or fewer of the various essentials of life for these people.</P>
    <P>It is completely wrong to go back to the old houses and to propose an increase up to £1 a week over five years on houses that were built at a very low price, on houses that were built and in respect of which no opportunity was given to the tenants to purchase. Over the years, we have been urging purchase schemes here.  All the time, we failed to get the Minister to agree that a purchase scheme should be available to the people in the urban areas, just as the scheme was available always to the people in rural Ireland. None of us could see that any difference existed or could understand why the people in urban areas should be deprived of that advantage.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves for what price the existing houses, in respect of which it is now proposed to ask for an <Col N="630" /> additional £1 per week over the next few years, could have been purchased if there had been a subsidised scheme available to the tenants, similar to the scheme available in rural Ireland.  They would now have their houses for very little, as they would be entitled to, because the houses cost very little to build.  If there is to be any substantial increase, it certainly should apply only to new rentals.  These increases can be justified only if it can be proven and shown that the incomes of the families have so improved as to enable them to bear an increase of 8/- or 9/- per week without an added burden on the family and without the health of the family being affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has commented on the fact that the State contribution to housing has increased over the years but the percentage of the cost of housing has remained the same.  We are still at the stage where we can get a maximum two-thirds subsidy on £1,650.  That is a figure that has not changed.  It is not the cost of building that affects the tenant but rather is it what it costs him to live in that house.  Either he is or he is not able to bear it.  All the time, the cost of living is increasing. Everything the family has to buy has so increased in price that he is not able to bear this added burden.  Take the case of families that have been pushed out from the centre of the city, from their place of employment, to Ballyfermot and other quite distant schemes.  They have to pay the cost of added bus fares and transport of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed completely to indicate that there is any justification whatsoever for the increase outlined in this proposal.  It is true to say that the cost of repairs has increased over the years.  I think the answer to that is that if a proper subsidised purchase scheme were available to these people, they would now be taking care of their own repairs and would have an opportunity of building up a capital asset, and I think we would all agree that they should be entitled to do this. All the money they have handed out over the years for housing accommodation has left them no better off, in the sense that at the end of many years, <Col N="631" /> they are no more entitled to their house than they were on the first day they went into it.  This is a deplorable situation.  People cannot be expected to take the same interest in their houses or to regard them as homes in the real sense of the word, if they have no hope of ever owning them, if that should be their wish.</P>
    <P>The Minister has used all his ability to talk around the whole matter, to indicate that everybody is jumping on the bandwagon and that, of course, the Government are not responsible at all, that what they are trying to do is reduce rents on the many unfortunate people who are not in a position to pay the rents they are already paying. That is the Minister's main anxiety: he is not anxious to reduce the burden on the Government of providing a subsidy on loan charges. That is not his real aim: it is to provide relief, not to increase the burden.  If the Minister sees it in that way, certainly the 20,000 tenants who marched last night see it in a very different light.  They see it in the light in which every realist sees it.  They know the effect of an additional 8/-or 9/- per week out of the money they have to spend.  If the tenants have to pay that increase, then there should be a similar increase in their wages at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Minister took the initiative in this last March.  He complains that the normal increase in rents did not take place as it should have taken place over the years.  But that was his responsibility. He knew that was the position.  Why did he not move earlier and say that he thought the costs of maintenance were increasing at such a rate that it was necessary, perhaps very gradually, at a rate of 1/- or 6d a week, to increase rents, but to increase them in such a way as not to have an additional burden fall too heavily and too suddenly on these people?  The Minister did not do that. He waited until the time of crisis arrived and then said that 8/- or 9/-a week more would have to be taken from these people.  I do not think he will get it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> He says in defence of himself that this scheme was not prepared by him and has not yet reached his table. He may not necessarily accept it. That may be so.  That may get him over the embarrassment he now feels as a result of his suggestion to the city and county managers that the time had come to revise rents and bring about this increase.  The Minister can say he did not intend it this way, or the other way, but the Minister knows only too well that he has only to make a suggestion to city and county managers, who are the most loyal of civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The hills of Donegal are too far removed from places like Ballyfermot for the inhabitants of those hills to appreciate the position of these people and the conditions in which they are living. Deputy Seán Dunne knows them.  I know them.  Deputy Ryan knows them. We are frequently confronted with them.  We know the hardship this increase will entail for these people.</P>

All that is due to the failure of the Government to provide sufficient houses over the years.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted figures going back to 1961 and 1962 to show the increasing amounts of money being provided for houses.  I think we have shown here over and over again, until everyone is tired of it, that these figures do not show the true picture because there were no houses being built at all for years after the Government came in in 1957.  Housing reached a deplorable level.  It had to recover from that position or there would have been a revolution.  That recovery must continue or there will be trouble.  If the increases proposed in this scheme submitted by the City Manager in Dublin are imposed, we shall have serious trouble and the Minister will have more than one march if he thinks he will get these rents paid by the tenants.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin is well aware that I did not accept the scheme in every detail, either the purchase scheme or the rent scheme.  The only people who do accept it are Fine Gael and Labour.  They accepted it hook, line and sinker.  I put a number of amendments before the Housing Committee of the corporation and I trust Labour and Fine Gael will support me in having these amendments accepted.  They are designed to bring relief to the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is in the name of eight Labour Deputies.  At the council meeting the other night we had a motion in the name of seven Fine Gael Deputies. I know what the situation is.  At the last meeting of the corporation, when <Col N="634" /> the City Manager's proposals were under discussion, we had two members of the Labour Party and two members of the Fine Gael Party present.  There is only one member of the Fine Gael Party here tonight.  He was not at the meeting of the corporation.  I can understand the mentality of Fine Gael and Labour because they are not conversant with the operations of Dublin Corporation.  I can understand them making the silly statements they have made here.  Dublin Corporation are well able to consider the City Manager's report, and they have considered hundreds of reports over the years.</P>

Labour feel we are incompetent.  Apparently Deputy Cluskey and other members of the Labour Party are incompetent to discuss this matter and the only people who are competent to discuss it are outside groups and organisations who would make representations to the Minister and the Minister should then arrive at a decision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that in relation to the revised rates and the new schemes which came into operation on 28th February, 1966, there was a certain alteration in the existing scheme at that time and the Labour Party and Fine Gael opposed it.  People with three children got a reduction of 8/6d a week.  A man with four children got a reduction of 18/9d a week and a man with five children who had been paying 24/6d a week had it reduced to 17/-.  I have heard it suggested that there is another authority which can help the depressed people, Dublin Health Authority, but it seems to me that the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party want to make paupers of the poorer people.  Under the scheme to which I have referred, people with up to £14 a week and with four children got reductions.  I am sure that the new scheme will give similar relief.</P>
      <P>I wonder when that relief is given will Fine Gael and the Labour Party be loud in saying that the relief is being given through a scheme sponsored by them.  I believe that the poorer people should get all the help possible but there are some people who will not face up to their responsibilities, people who want to jump on every bandwagon.  We had it here yesterday and we have it here again tonight.  We are people who always examine our conscience and we know that if the people find out that we introduced this scheme and if the rents are increased under it, the blame will fall on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we saw another section of unfortunate people in this city being dragged out of their homes and put into rat-infested areas to suit the members of the Labour Party.  On this occasion <Col N="636" /> they are trying to contaminate the minds of 40,000 tenants but they will not succeed.  I am sure these tenants will see that the Labour Party and Fine Gael are just the same now as they were in the past.  How many members of the Labour Party are prepared now to support a scheme that will bring relief to the lower income groups?  I know that there are honest men in Dublin Corporation who will attend the meetings and acquaint themselves with what is going on in order to bring about a reasonable and just situation with regard to the rents and the political paupers of Fine Gael and Labour will be left behind just as they were left behind before.</P>

      <P>I am now concluding on the motion.  That piece of McCarthyism we have just seen here we have seen here before and the people who indulged in it are not here any more.  Let that be a warning to the people who indulge in performances such as we have just listened to. That kind of performance is no solution to the problem of the 40,000 tenants of Dublin Corporation who marched through this city last night. What brought them to do that?  Does anybody think that they undertook that march lightly or because the Labour Party had contaminated their minds?  That is Deputy Dowling's expression: he said that we had contaminated the minds of the 40,000 tenants who took part in that march.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that huge procession, which was three times as big as the procession of farmers, we find that there were representatives of every conceivable shade of political opinion and people with no political convictions one way or another.  When you find such interest in this question of the increased rents, you do not find people marching like that unless they feel they have solid reason for doing so.  We are all politicians and we all know how difficult <Col N="637" /> it is to get people to come a few yards to a meeting.  When you see from 20,000 to 30,000 people at least in such a procession, and the Civic Guards have confirmed my estimate of that, then it is obvious that they feel very deeply about the matter.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion in order to have this matter discussed here and in order to express our views here in the highest councils of the land.  I know there are elements in this House who do not like that, who feel that matters of this kind should be shrouded over and covered up.  There are people here who do not believe in democracy except when they want to express their own views and on such occasions they believe that no other views should be expressed.  As long as we are here on these benches, we will express our views and the day will come when we will express them much more effectively because we will be expressing them from those benches over there.</P>
    <P>The Minister distributed some statistics, and while doing so, I could not help thinking of the classical definition of prevarication as lies, damn lies and statistics.  You can prove anything you like with figures to people who are not familiar with figures.  You can produce any kind of result you want from figures but you do not convince people with them. There is no use in talking figures in large and impressive amounts to the ordinary citizen.  They-are uninteresting to him and he distrusts anybody who shovels out that kind of material and he instinctively believes that in doing so somebody is trying to put something over on him.  I do not pay much attention to the Minister's claim that if all rents of private houses and corporation houses were increased by 20 per cent, the increase in the cost of living would only be one per cent. There is a mathematical genius, a second Einstein, in the Department of Local Government who can produce that computation.  He would be better engaged in giving his attention to relativity.  This matter is just too serious for words.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very specious defence of his position in relation to this matter of rents.  He claims that <Col N="638" /> his heart bleeds for the tenants but I must say I am not at all convinced that the Minister appreciates the Dublin problem in any of its aspects.  He may be familiar with the problem as it affects his own constituency but for a long time I have been convinced that the Custom House is oriented to a rural outlook which excludes any proper consideration of the Dublin city problem.  I have expressed this view before, and I am not going to expand on it now, but I have seen it here again tonight in the Minister's remarks. It was obvious that he was to some extent backing away from his responsibilities in regard to the present rent crisis, and it can be described by no other word, inasmuch as he was saying that there was nothing in his Department from the corporation, &ldquo;There is no proposal on my desk&rdquo; as it were, &ldquo;from Dublin Corporation in regard to a rents scheme and therefore I have not entered into the picture yet&rdquo;.  The fact is that he did circularise local authorities with the instruction, or the advice, or the proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the threat. &ldquo;Threat&rdquo; is the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the threat that if they did not rationalise the rent schemes, there might be a danger of the possibility of the housing subsidies being withdrawn and therefore local authorities would be put in a very dangerous position.  That was the threat he held out.  He tried to brush aside the meaning of the word &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo;. We all know what it means.  He asked us not to confuse its meaning.  I am going to define what it means.  It is the modern word used by the alleged technocrats to run things in what they call a businesslike way; in other words, to run things as far as possible in order to make a profit from them.  I am certain that is the mentality behind this. If the Minister could by his instructions to the city and county managers get them to make a profit out of the corporation tenants, he would not hesitate to do so.  He professes sympathy with the principle underlying the differential rents scheme but in fact he has lent his not inconsiderable aid to the manipulation of this scheme in <Col N="639" /> such a fashion that it has been corrupted and distorted from what it was conceived to be when it was first introduced.</P>
      <P>The differential scheme, as I tried to outline last night in my opening remarks, was first thought of in this country and first propounded here by one of the most advanced social thinkers we have ever seen.  Not alone was he an advanced thinker but he was a man of tremendous action who wrought great good in this country for the working people.  The simple idea underlying it&mdash;and I know because I discussed it with him before ever it was brought in&mdash;was that corporation rents should be of such a kind that if people were in distress, whether financial distress through unemployment, or distress through ill health, they should not have to pay as much as they would if an income were coming in.  What has happened is that the interests in the various local authorities and, indeed, in the Custom House, who are not concerned with the welfare of the working-class people, have so twisted the scheme and the ideas that you have one section of the workingclass made to subsidise the other section.  This, to my mind, is totally wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is running short but I want to take this opportunity to read this letter-which I received today from a tenant in a corporation house in the Drimnagh area.  He says:</P>
      <P>I am a tenant of the Dublin Corporation for 26 years.  When I first got my tenancy I paid 10/3d per week which was nearly a quarter of my wages then.  I have three children whom I tried to give a better chance than we had, namely education and living standard.  My eldest daughter is now married and buying her own house.  I still have one boy and girl with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The house I have is a four-room parlour type.  I have put between £500 to £600 into it over the years to make it suitable for my family. <Col N="640" /> I first changed the hot water system which in this type of house is a dead loss.  I then built a lean-to kitchen diningroom on, which allowed me to make an extra bedroom out of the parlour, and two years ago added a garage to the side of the house and all this without one penny subsidy from anyone.  As a matter of fact the trouble and expense I had to go to to get permission to do this was really frustrating.  I can understand why some people do nothing. I also had to pay the Dublin Corporation £15 to alter the sewer and £15 to dish the path for a run in.</P>
    <P>I am now 58 years of age in a non-pensionable job and only in the last few years have had a chance of living without money worries and I may say if my wife had not also worked and earned up to recent years I would still be struggling.</P>
    <P>That is a letter from a corporation tenant and I would suggest that is the average type you are dealing with when discussing these rents.</P>
    <P>I say that the Minister was guilty of the utmost irresponsibility in issuing the circular which he issued to the local authorities.  He was guilty of threatening the local authorities and of putting them into the position in which they now feel they must increase rents. He was guilty of creating civil commotion in this city on a scale which we have not seen in many years.  He was guilty of something which is most pernicious and dangerous, that is, of an action which will lead to inflation and further wage demands.  To my mind, it is indicative of the present trend of Government policy, that they do not seem to care.  They have got completely out of touch with the people and do not seem to know or care about what the future holds.  We are pushing this vote to the very limit to show that as far as we are concerned we are here and we will be the tribunes of the people of the city and of the country who will suffer as a result of this.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Labour.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking earlier, I was referring to equal pay for equal work and I made the point that in the Minister's Department, so far as factory inspectors were concerned, he had neglected to pursue the line of equal pay for equal work.  This House is entitled to hear from the Minister as to what his view is on this subject.  I think also the Minister should give an indication to the House as to what he thinks about juvenile employment and about the existing working conditions of unorganised workers in many places of employment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I also adverted to the situation as regards the inspection of factories by way of pointing out the insufficient number of factory inspectors.  This is something that requires a great deal of thought and concern when one takes into account information in this connection which the Minister gave.  I had occasion recently to ask him a question in connection with factory inspection. The information he gave was that in the Twenty-six Counties there were 11,570 factory premises on the official register of the factory inspectorate.  Of these there were 4,099 registered factories in the city and county borough of Dublin; in Cork city and county, there were 1,659 registered factory premises; and in Limerick city and county, 426.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> In 1964 the number of prosecutions, according to the information which the Minister gave, was 44; in 1965, 26; and in the nine months of 1966, 35.  These figures indicate clearly the need for more factory inspectors, particularly if we take into consideration the large number of factories operating even in Dublin city whose workers are not organised in any trade union and who are housed in premises which are almost on the verge of becoming dangerous buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to safety committees, and today in answering a question indicated that the responsibility for the setting up of safety committees under the Act was the responsibility of the worker.  This is an extraordinary situation, especially if one has regard to what I have just said, that is, the number of unorganised establishments operating throughout the Republic and also the attitude of mind of many employers towards organised trade unionism.  How can we have the setting up of safety committees if it is to be left purely to the initiative of the worker, when, in a great number of cases, he is afraid to make even a simple request about working conditions? He must be afraid or he would be in a trade union.  Their fear sometimes can be understood when we bear in mind the amount of pressure an employer can exert and the threats and what have you he can issue when he does not want his workers to be members of trade unions.  I have no reason to believe that the Minister is not sincere when he advocates that more safety committees should go into operation, but if he is going to achieve his desires in that regard, he will have to have another look at whose responsibility it is to set up such committees.</P>
    <P>In this matter of safety committees, it cannot be over-emphasised that the disseminating of information in connection with them must not be left to the whim of management or the initiative of the worker.  There should be some proper arrangement arrived at whereby all these safety committees would be listed and encouragement given to the personnel of these committees to meet regularly and perhaps <Col N="645" /> send in reports of their activities to some central authority such as the Department of Labour.  There is no denying that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has subscribed to the formation of safety committees and has always encouraged the formation of such committees.  If that is not known to some of the Deputies here, I can only say that they are not terribly interested in everything that goes on in the trade union movement but are interested in matters about which they consider the trade union movement is too belligerent.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more factory inspections, and there should be no possibility of a prior warning of an inspection being given to an employer. The importance of ensuring that the factory inspector should find ways and means of studying the various operations in the factory and of consulting with the workers cannot be overstressed.  Things should not be done so far as the workers are concerned in a surreptitious manner.  It should be borne in mind that some employers take the view that a worker who looks for his entitlement is too militant and belligerent.</P>
    <P>There is a great case for the employment of more female factory inspectors. The Minister has said that there are only three and I have already commented on that.  I will not say any more in that regard except that it does not require a great deal of thought to realise that three female factory inspectors cannot supply the needs of all the females working in the 26 Counties.  I do not agree with the Minister's contention this afternoon at Question Time that male factory inspectors meet the needs of female workers.  That is not true.  I was fortunate enough at one time to work in a factory in which there was a preponderance of female employees and I know that that is not correct. There are many matters that affect females in their employment that would be better dealt with by members of their own sex.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented upon what he said he will do about a systematic review of all relevant <Col N="646" /> Acts.  I am sure most working men and women would like to be made aware as to what their entitlements are in very simple language.  They would like to know their entitlements under the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, under the Conditions of Employment Act and under any other Act that applies to them.  In a great many cases in the city of Dublin, workers do not realise, and their employers do not appear to know or do not want to know, that they are entitled to a proper rest room, that they are entitled to have a place where they can hang wet clothes in the morning in the hope that they will be dry when it is time to go home.  These may appear to be simple matters but they are not generally realised.</P>
    <P>There are many other things that I could talk about in that connection. Perhaps the Minister could take an example from the late Deputy William Norton in this connection.  The late Deputy Norton produced a handbook in connection with the Factories Acts which was found to be of great value. I am glad to see that the Minister has a copy.  I suggest that there should be more of such productions.  The ordinary working-class people are not inclined to study closely Civil Service jargon but they would very much like to know their entitlements.  Even in the trade union movement workers look for their entitlement as trade union members and when they look for the rules of the union, in most cases they are looking for what they are entitled to as a worker in their place of employment but it is generally found that the rules of the union are comprised of the constitution of the union, the setup of the union, which is an entirely separate matter.  I am sure it will be realised that there is need for concise information being made available to working people.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with industrial relations and indicated his attitude towards this very serious and interesting problem.  I appreciate that he is consulting with and will continue to consult with both sides, namely, employers and the trade unions.  He should be extremely careful in the <Col N="647" /> manner in which he tackles this job.  He should not be too eager to bring in everything that is requested.  The Minister can take unto himself as many laws as he likes which may appear to be controlling the worker but there is one thing certain, that is, that no matter what type of control he may bring in through this House, he cannot make the worker go to work.  We must try to bring about a happy set of circumstances in so far as industrial relations are concerned.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister had to say about industrial relations. It struck me as rather strange that he should say what he thought was desirable and at the same time neglect to take the initiative in this matter. For instance, in State and most semi-State concerns, industrial relations are bad.  We know that most Government Departments were the last to grant the £1 a week increase to their workers and some of them have not yet done so.  At the same time, we have the Minister for Labour stressing the importance of industrial relations. It would be a good exercise if the Minister for Labour were to use his influence with the Cabinet, however it may be composed after tomorrow, to have a seminar to which all Cabinet Ministers would go, where somebody would talk to them about industrial relations and the importance of ensuring that there is no long-fingering in any of their Departments in the matter of wages and working conditions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister referred to industrial relations but I was surprised that in that part of his speech there was no mention at all of the Labour Court.  Why, I do not know. There was not a word about the Labour Court, no mention of the composition of the Labour Court or how the Minister feels about it, no mention of the conciliation officers of the Labour Court or how the Minister feels about them, whether he considers that there are sufficient conciliation officers or not.</P>
    <P>In this matter of industrial relations and the continuance of the Labour Court on an improved basis, what is <Col N="648" /> needed is more conciliation officers.  In reply to a question recently, the Minister gave me the composition of the staff of the Labour Court: one principal officer, two assistant principals, five higher executive officers, three executive officers, two clerical officers and eight clerk-typists clerical.  This is the extent of the conciliation machinery personnel available to the Labour Court.  I do not have to mention the number of unions there are and the vast number of employers.  Every day problems of some kind arise.  If the Labour Court is to be fully utilised, more facilities must be available there for both unions and employers.  Surely you are not going to allow the situation to prevail in which you will have long queues for a conciliation conference at the Labour Court?</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing if the Minister encouraged more conciliation in semi-State and State concerns.  For example, let us have positive conciliation in the ESB rather than the pretence of negotiation that goes on between the trade union representatives and the representatives of the Board. The representatives of the Board are well known for their failure to act in a proper way to bring about conciliation. They continually act as if they had made up their minds that it does not matter what case is made by the trade union representatives because the matter will wind up before the Tribunal, which is the final step.  This is the type of attitude the Minister will have to deal with.  It will not be dealt with by the changes advocated by the Minister for Transport and Power.  I entreat the Minister, for heaven's sake, to let the Minister for Transport and Power stay out of this.  The Minister for Transport and Power never did anything good in connection with the running of the ESB so far as the workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is also desirable that a proper scheme for recruiting staff to the Labour Court conciliation department should be set up.  I am not casting any reflection on any of the existing conciliation officers.  I think we are expecting too much of them if we take into consideration that most, if not all <Col N="649" /> of them, have had no previous practical training in industrial relations. This is terribly important.  We will only succeed if we take steps to ensure that every person who aspires to be a conciliation officer is afforded the opportunity of training himself or herself for the job, whether by participation in a course within the State or by training abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In case I may be misunderstood, let me reiterate what I said earlier.  We in the Labour Party welcome the setting up of the Department of Labour.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been agitating for this for a number of years.  I said I did not subscribe to what Deputy Dillon said, that this was only a gimmick. Anything we have to say from these benches in regard to the new Department are genuine suggestions with a view to helping the Department to succeed.  Why not? It will not be long, if and when the opportunity is presented to us, before we will be taking over the running of that Department. In the meantime, we would like it to run as well as possible.  We want to ensure that people who talk about labour and the Department of Labour &mdash;and I do not mean the Minister&mdash; know what they are talking about.</P>
      <P>In what I am going to say now about the Labour Court, I do not want to be regarded as being anti-Labour Court.  In my capacity as a trade union official, I have to appear before the court, and I hope my members will not suffer as a result of what I am going to say.  A number of the recommendations issued by the court have been extremely vague and have caused no end of concern, to say the least.  Recently one recommendation very nearly created a serious dispute in this country.  The Labour Court should be required to issue their recommendations in the simplest possible language which leaves no doubt as to what they mean.  If this is not done, other interpretations will be put on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one case I had before the court <Col N="650" /> recently, we won hands down even though I say it myself.  The Labour Court recommendation was very much in our favour.  However, when the Federated Union of Employers got their hands on it, they tried to interpret the recommendation in another way and started bandying about with words.  That is why I say that what is required is simple language we can all understand.</P>
    <P>I know that negotiations are going on&mdash;I have already said this&mdash;and that the Minister is consulting with both sides on matters affecting his Department. I certainly do not want to offer any viewpoint in connection with that particular matter.  However, in so far as what the Minister has had to say about manpower policy is concerned, I can only say that every thinking trade unionist is anxiously awaiting something positive.  I hope there will be no further delay about its production. The importance of helping the worker during the process of change cannot be overstressed &mdash; the importance of helping the worker who is changing from one job to another. This, of course also has to do with this matter of industrial training.  The Minister has indicated that a committee of both sides has been set up and this is welcome.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if we have any positive assurance of a change of attitude on the part of the employers on this important matter of industrial training, because, even within the past few days, we have had representatives of trade unions confronted with an attitude by employers which certainly does not indicate any degree of understanding. I think also it would be very useful indeed for the Minister to look into this matter of industrial training a little further and perhaps consult with the Minister for Education because there seems to me to be an equal change of attitude there in the matter of industrial training.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that there is a scarcity of teachers in many fields, the scarcity being due to the absence of money, as, indeed, the low salaries that have been offered if one is inclined to look for the best available.  I should <Col N="651" /> also like to hear from the Minister his attitude on how the worker should be treated on the occasion of mergers or take-overs.  There certainly does not appear to be for one moment the slightest indication of concern on the part of a considerable number of employers who employ trade unionists. Right up to now, if anything has been extracted from these people, it has been extracted after a lot of persuasion and serious negotiation.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the employment service.  This certainly is a new and good idea.  I am sure he will get the help and co-operation of every well-intentioned person on this important matter.  I was wondering if there is any possibility or prospect of the Minister's having something done about aptitude tests being instituted on a fairly large scale among juveniles, among schoolgoing children who are about to leave school and take up employment.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister talks about insurance statistics and research.  He made a point, towards the end, of the advisability of commissioning the undertaking of research work by outside agencies.  I just express my personal view about this.  I think we should know enough about our needs and what should be done, without having to go outside to get views on matters of this kind.  I think we have this idea of feeling inferior about tackling things.  We should put that idea away and have nothing to do with that inferior attitude.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the indication the Minister has given about relationship with international organisations, particularly the question of social policy.  This is a good thing and it would be a wonderful exercise.  Undoubtedly, it will show quite clearly and distinctly how far we are behind in the matter of the social code and that particular task cannot be delayed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with the relationship with the public.  I think this is done with a view to giving the reasons why the Department is to have a PRO.  He stressed the importance of issuing information.  I agree that it is terribly important that information <Col N="652" /> be given out and given out correctly. Quite recently, there was a strike in a very large factory in Dublin and negotiations were thought to have been completed.  It came across Telefís Éireann that the strike was settled but it was not settled: the strike was on. That is one simple indication of the necessity to have some responsible person issue information in connection with matters affecting the Minister's Department and particularly in relation to disputes.</P>
    <P>I know that some disputes have been played up, and played up unfairly, in the press.  Some disputes have been given slants by the press.  I know that while it may be done with a view to selling copy, nevertheless serious harm can be done by slanting news, particularly in a situation where a lightning strike is played up or, for that matter, a breakaway organisation is played up and the other side of the story is not given.  I should be more concerned about who would be responsible and how the information would be released. We must be extremely careful to ensure that it is not slanted because if it is slanted, it will do a lot of harm to industrial relations advocated by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to repeat my good wishes for the Minister and the future of this Department.  Any criticism I have made has been made sincerely and not with a view to knocking anything.  The Minister will find that any help or assistance that can be given by the Labour Party or by the trade union movement in matters of this kind will freely be available.  I urge him to be extremely careful about any legislation he finds it necessary to introduce as a result of the putting of his Department into proper gear.  I urge him to ensure that at all times there is consultation, certainly with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, before any legislation is introduced by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House, but, coming from a constituency in which many of the problems of interest to the Minister and his new Department exist, I feel I should make some short contribution <Col N="653" /> to this debate.  Deputies on both sides hope this new Department will achieve the aims and objectives which it has been set up to achieve.  Unfortunately, one aspect of the Minister's new functions has been highlighted more than all the others.  I refer to the matter of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department will, of course, have to deal with many other factors and many other matters, some of which are related to industrial relations and some of which are not.  The most important task the Minister has is creating a climate conducive to understanding and goodwill between employer and employee.  This can only be done, in my opinion, by a thorough study of all the economic, social, human and psychological factors in the relationship between management and labour.  There is a considerable amount of study to be done and a considerable amount of research to be undertaken by this new Department, and perhaps the most profitable initial exercise by the Department would be an examination into and a close study of those firms which have an unbroken record of good industrial relations.  Another line of study would be an investigation into those firms in which there are recurrent industrial disputes in an effort to diagnose the causes of the difficulties, to pinpoint those causes, and to try to find a solution for them.</P>
      <P>One particular example comes to mind.  We had a welcome announcement last week of the fact that the management of Aer Lingus had succeeded in concluding a very satisfactory agreement with eleven, or so, unions dealing with the different categories of workers in Aer Lingus.  I cannot help contrasting that state of affairs with the state of affairs in another State body, namely, Córas Iompair Éireann.  Why is it that this happy state of affairs cannot be achieved in that body?  What are the difficulties which prevent such an agreement being reached in Córas Iompair Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Córas Iompair Éireann, I endorse what Deputy Mullen said with regard to interference <Col N="654" /> by the Minister for Transport and Power in this particular sphere of industrial relations.  When introducing his Estimate here recently, he expatiated on industrial relations in CIE, the number of strikes, and so forth. He stated emphatically that these were not the fault of management, thereby imputing all blame to the workers. That type of statement by the Minister for Transport and Power will not make the task of the Minister for Labour any easier and I think, therefore, the Minister for Labour should ask his colleague to refrain from aggravating the situation.  The Minister and his Department will have to examine into this situation, try to diagnose the causes and see if a solution can be found for them.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Deputies who have said that one cannot legislate to improve relations or cannot secure harmonious industrial relations merely by legislating.  A proper climate of opinion must be created.  In regard to industrial relations generally, there is a considerable amount of uninformed or misinformed opinion on the part of the public.  Every time a strike takes place, people are very quick in their condemnation of the union or unions concerned and of the workers.  They never pause to ask themselves the obvious question as to why these men are out on strike.  It is my firm conviction that in the vast majority of cases, the decision to strike is taken only after all other avenues have been explored.  From my contact with trade union officials in my constituency, and as a result of my interest in this whole matter, and from what I have seen of the situation, we are, I believe, very fortunate in having a trade union movement with a very high sense of national responsibility.  That has been demonstrated on numerous occasions. We have, too, many examples of enlightened management, fully cognisant of human problems and human relations. Unfortunately, we have many examples also of management whose approach to these problems is archaic and needs shaking up.  The Minister and his Department will have to examine into all the causes of industrial <Col N="655" /> unrest.  Only by an objective, unbiased and scientific investigation will these causes be pinpointed and eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very brief in his references to a number of very important aspects of the future working of his Department.  In relation to the employment service, he stated that a number of short-term measures to secure improvements in certain selected areas are already in train and he hopes to have them in operation early next year. He also said he was undertaking a review of the organisation and structure of the service with a view to planning and implementing measures for its long-term development.  The Minister should have availed himself of this opportunity to go into greater detail about the plans he has for the development of the employment service.  The NIEC Report on Manpower Policy, at paragraph 26, and the Report of the interdepartmental committee for implementing manpower policy refer in detail to the various problems inherent in the development of the employment service, its modernisation and gearing up to cater for present and future needs.</P>
    <P>The NIEC Report on Manpower Policy refers in paragraph 26 to the five main changes that are required. It refers to the fact that the image of the employment services must be improved, that there must be advance notice of impending vacancies and pay-offs and that this service must play a more active role in the transfer to other occupations of agricultural workers.  It also states that the services should be capable of giving vocational guidance and that more information should be obtained about the relative coverage of the various organisations operating in the employment market. These are very big problems.  It is a very wide question, and I think that the Minister should give us some indication as to what actual steps he has already taken and what steps he proposes to take to improve the employment services.  I do not intend to go any more fully into that matter.</P>
    <P>In another paragraph, there is reference to manpower forecasting.  It <Col N="656" /> is pointed out in paragraph 55 of the report of the interdepartmental Committee on Administrative Arrangements for Implementing Manpower Policy that:</P>
    <P>The techniques of manpower forecasting are very much at the experimental stage and a good deal of original work will have to be done before such techniques are perfected. It must also be recognised that manpower forecasting is never likely to achieve full reliability, as accurate assessments of the effects of unforeseen factors are very impossible and there will always be unforeseeable developments.</P>
    <P>The report also states:</P>
    <P>Intelligent manpower planning can only proceed on the basis of the best forecast which can be made of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>In this question of manpower forecasting, as I understand it, there are three stages.  The first is a population forecast.  This is not a forecast of how many people will be in the country by 1970 or 1980, or at any other given time, but a detailed forecast of jobs, status and sex in the years ahead.  The second stage is to get a forecast which will give a picture of employment in terms of the numbers employed in the different sectors, industry and agriculture and so forth.  When you have a picture of the number of people in the different sectors in the years ahead, you then have to break down these figures to get the number of people equipped with particular skills and in particular occupations.</P>
    <P>So far, in this country we have only got the second stage.  We have not done any big demographic forecast.  I understand that there is a lack of trained personnel, that men skilled in these techniques are not available in this country.  I understand that there is a serious shortage of statisticians and that only one university in this country has any facilities for training them.  In fact, I was told quite recently that such facilities are not now available at all.  I also understand that people who have done post-graduate courses as statisticians have had to <Col N="657" /> emigrate through lack of suitable opportunities here and the inadequacy of remuneration in the Government service.  As far as I am aware, there are only six statisticians employed in the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>It is recommended in the interdepartmental report to which I have referred that first-class experts, fully qualified in the techniques of manpower forecasting, should be brought in here to train Irish personnel.  It will be extremely difficult to implement the manpower policy if we are not to have an adequate number of experts to carry out the various forecasts which are the foundation of a proper manpower policy.  The Minister stated in his opening speech that the difficulty in this matter lay in the recruiting of experts, that they are not readily available but that a solution to this problem is in sight.  I hope the Minister will give us some idea of the solutions he has come up with in regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>He points out that there is a colossal amount of information available from other countries on this question of manpower forecasting and that he intends to set up a research unit within his Department with the task of examining and studying the various works that have been done in this field and assessing the relevancy to Irish conditions of the various reports.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in the Minister's speech to which I should like to refer, that is, the matter of the legislation relating to the protection of the health and the welfare of employees at their place of employment.  This is a very important problem.  As the Minister pointed out, accidents do happen and no effort should be spared to ensure that managements will co-operate with the inspectors of the Minister's Department to ensure that every possible precaution is taken to safeguard the health of employees and to prevent accidents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of speakers who have taken part in this discussion is an indication of the interest taken in this House in the new <Col N="658" /> Department of Labour.  While a number of speakers were critical of the labour situation, the Minister will recognise that neither he nor his officials have been singled out as people who are not doing their job.  We are all prepared to give them the opportunity of doing the job they have been appointed to do.  Some people have criticised the setting up of a Department of Labour, but we in the Labour Party have always felt that a Department of Labour would help to solve some of the problems we have had since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I was rather amused by some of the comments I heard during the debate and I should like to refer to one or two.  It is as well to point out to those who talked about planning and the necessity for having a policy for the future so that we should be able to forecast our labour requirements in years to come, that the first thing we have to do is to try to find jobs for the 40,000 to 50,000 people who are unemployed.  We are able to shrug off the unemployment position, as we have been doing for years, by saying: &ldquo;Well, there is always that number unemployed here.&rdquo; There is no reason why there should be that number. When people compare the position here with that in Britain, it should be remembered that even though the number of unemployed in Britain has reached what to us would be alarming proportions, the number of jobs available there are still greater than the number of people looking for jobs. When we reach that position, we can afford to be critical of our neighbour and say that they are not doing their job properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here unfortunately is that the number of unemployed tends to grow at this time of year and for some reason it has grown this year at a faster rate than it did for a number of years.  If we take the figure of 40,000 odd, plus another 16,000 which the Department of Social Welfare wrapped up in figures because of the change in the manner of the compilation of figures earlier this year, we realise that there are between 50,000 and 60,000 on the unemployed <Col N="659" /> register, people who need jobs and have not got them.  Last night Deputy Dillon was talking about the people who go to the labour exchange to draw the dole.</P>
    <P>I like listening to Deputy Dillon because he is one of the last of the old-time orators and he can make a case for anything.  Even if I disagree with him, as I did on this occasion, he is still worth listening to.  I think it should be put on record, however, that everybody who goes to the labour exchange does not do so to sign on for the dole, which was a slang expression for those drawing unemployment assistance.  Most people go to the unemployment exchange to draw unemployment benefit to which they are entitled by virtue of the fact that they have worked and stamped unemployment cards for a number of years.  They are not ashamed to do so and they should not be ashamed, nor should those, who through no fault of their own have been unable to find work, be ashamed to sign on for the dole when unemployment benefit runs out.</P>
    <P>It is important to make that clear because the impression was being given that there was a group of people who wanted to do nothing else but draw the dole.  If Deputy Dillon had as close an association with working-class people as I have, he would realise that there is a very great distinction and even very many of those who have to draw the dole would much prefer to be working.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also gave his speech &mdash;I do not know whether it was speech No. 16 or No. 17&mdash;which we have heard so often, about the classless society in which we live.  I would be the last in the world to suggest that Deputy Dillon should grow up, because he has grown up a long time ago, but he should give up trying to create the impression&mdash;as should anybody else who does the same&mdash;that we live in a classless society because we do not.  We live in a society of &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;; those who have make sure that everybody knows they have and make everybody feel that those who have not got as much <Col N="660" /> wealth as they have are not as good as they are.  We have another group in between.  This is one of the things which really rile me.  We have the group who seem to think that even among those who have very little, there should be a distinction.</P>
    <P>I refer to the practice which has grown up over the years that in the Civil Service, local authority employment, and indeed in civilian employment generally, the person who is established is entitled, if he falls sick, to sick pay over a lengthy period and gets more holidays than the ordinary person.  The same applies to many other staff positions, as they are called.  There are then, others who work very hard and without whom the people to whom I have referred would not be in their jobs at all.  These people get the shortest holidays the law will allow and they have no sick pay scheme and no pension scheme.  They are supposed to be a kind of untouchable class who must be content with much lower wages and with much less generally than other people, who are in fact their fellow workers, are enjoying. We have, in fact, a three-tier society and when I hear people talking about a classless society existing here, it makes me see red.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we have still the greatest lot of snobs I ever met in any country, and I have travelled around a few.  We have, on the top, the people with wealth who believe that God intended them to have it and it does not matter if they made it themselves or if it was left to them by a father, a grandfather or somebody else.  It does not matter whether or not they have a university education or whether or not they can write their name, if they have money or property, they believe they are in a class of their own and that everybody underneath them is in a lower order. We have too, the middle group who are workers themselves and who probably do not mean it but who seem to think that they also are beings superior to the people at the bottom who are doing the spade work.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Labour sets out to improve the position and achieves <Col N="661" /> what Deputy Dillon seems to think is already here, a classless society, coming generations will thank him for it. It is something that has to be done. The Minister may say that private employers have to cut their cloth to their measure and that they would not be able to provide all the facilities for pension schemes, sick pay and everything else that the workers seem to think they are entitled to.  If that is true, and I agree that there are some firms that may not be doing so well and would have difficulty in doing these things, it cannot be said of the State.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said about a month ago in regard to lower paid employees, that is, that the State is the worst employer in the country.  I have no hesitation in repeating that.  The State is in the unique position that when a dispute occurs, whether the dispute is over wages or working conditions, or sick pay or a pension scheme, discussions may take place between the State's representative, the civil servants, and workers' representatives, who are trade union officials, and that ends it because there is no appeal from their decision.  Last week the Minister kindly received a deputation from my union and I put these points to him.  They cannot be repeated too often.  We find ourselves in the position that we are going to law with the devil and holding court in hell.  We go in to discuss matters with the officials and whether they are right or wrong, they make an offer and there is no appeal from that offer; if they do not make an offer, there is no appeal from their refusal to do so.</P>
    <P>It can be said that they can go on strike.  There are certain jobs in which they can but there are certain jobs under the State in which a strike just does not matter.  What does it matter if forestry workers, working up in the mountains, go on strike?  If they ceased to work it would not matter as nobody would care.  Nobody has worked there for hundreds of years before and so nobody will notice.  What hope have they of forcing their will on an employer?  The State are taking advantage of this.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the first <Col N="662" /> inter-Party Government, followed by an amendment of the last inter-Party Government, arrangements were made for certain things to be done regarding employees of local authorities in the granting of the right to those employees to take a dispute with their employer to the Labour Court through their trade union.  This has resulted in such employees improving immensely their conditions of employment and wages, but the State still reserves the right to say whether or not something can be done, and there is no appeal.  At every other step, from the manual worker up, there is a right of appeal to some type of tribunal but those on the bottom of the pile are nobody's concern.  They are not entitled to anything except what the State decides to give.  If the State decides to give nothing, that is their hard luck.</P>
    <P>A typical example of this is the case of the negotiations which took place in February, 1965, between the Department of Lands and the trade unions on the question of a pension scheme and sick pay scheme.  I am informed that a recommendation on at least one of those matters was sent to the Department of Finance in March of that year and ever since, when the matter is raised, all we can get is a reply from the Department that the matter is still under active consideration. I give them credit that recently they have had the good sense to leave out the &ldquo;active&rdquo; and say that the matter is &ldquo;under consideration&rdquo;.  No later than today at Question Time, the Minister for Lands said it was still under consideration.  If it were a private employer or a local authority, the matter would have been settled in three weeks by taking it to the Labour Court and getting a recommendation. Simply because the situation was such that the authorities felt these people could not take industrial action, the matter has been long-fingered.</P>
    <P>Another matter which the Minister may know about, and in which he must take some interest in future, is negotiation at local authority level because this year local authorities negotiated with the trade unions for wage increases and recommendations were made for an increase of £1 a week in <Col N="663" /> some cases with effect from 1st April and in many cases with effect from 1st May.  The Department of Local Government and the Department of Health decided to notify county managers that they would allow payment only from 1st June.  Can the Minister imagine what would happen if this occurred in private employment?  If it happened with CIE or Bord na Móna or Aer Lingus or anybody else, the Minister knows quite well what would happen.  There would be a strike overnight and after the row, some Minister would say that those fellows were careless about their jobs and did not consider the interests of the national economy but they would get their £1 a week.  Simply because it was the case of local authorities, the two Ministers concerned decided they would not get it.</P>
    <P>The matter is not finished yet but is going to the Labour Court, and I believe a recommendation will be made which will settle it eventually.  This shows that the State is miles behind everybody else as regards wages and conditions.  We get plenty of lectures; Ministers are preaching about the necessity for good labour relations, and yet we have situations such as I have instanced where the State itself is very much behind private employers.</P>
    <P>I think the Labour Court is doing a very good job at present in rather difficult conditions.  One of my colleagues speaking last night said something through a slip of the tongue at which I saw the Minister smile and I imagine it may be referred to in his reply.  He referred to the Labour Court supplying conciliation and arbitration. Of course the Labour Court does not supply arbitration except in exceptional circumstances.  Both sides can agree to its arbitration and in that case the Labour Court will arbitrate and the decision is accepted.  In most case they supply conciliation and make recommendations which can be accepted or rejected by either side. There are two courts consisting of three persons.  We believe that is not sufficient, particularly at times when wage rounds are being discussed.  We often find trade unions make applications <Col N="664" /> and are left for months on end.  It appears that the trigger-happy people, those who are prepared to go on strike very quickly, get precedence when the Labour Court is considering investigating disputes.  This can be avoided if there are sufficient personnel to deal with all cases at the one time.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a special tribute to the conciliation officers.  They do a wonderful job but there is one thing I dislike about it.  The people concerned may not be too happy about this comment.  I know that conciliation officers can be, and have proved to be excellent negotiators, people who can throw oil on troubled waters and produce a solution out of an almost impossible situation, a solution which is acceptable to both sides.  After a while they get promotion and in the ordinary way they pass out of the Labour Court and go back to the Civil Service and may finish up in high posts such as Secretaries of Departments.  I think a good negotiator who goes to the Labour Court and is a success should not be changed.</P>
    <P>We have had cases over the years of &ldquo;stumers&rdquo; making a lot of bad mistakes before eventually they pick up the right way to do things.  Labour relations are important enough to justify getting the very best people and keeping them, even if it means promoting them within that service and paying them at the rate they would get if promoted outside it, rather than moving them along and depending on others who do not understand the position as well.</P>
    <P>We have heard from all Parties about the necessity to reduce the number of trade unions.  This is something about which I claim to know quite a lot because, as general secretary of a trade union, I believe that those who are not intimately associated with trade unions tend to be like the hurlers on the ditch: they know all the problems and all the answers and yet they do not know exactly what makes it tick.  Although we have a multiplicity of trade unions, most of them have become specialists in their own field, and while it is true <Col N="665" /> that on occasion certain of them may cross the boundary of a group of workers negotiating in a trade dispute, at present we are civilised enough to realise that clashing with ourselves is not the answer to any problem.  I think even the employers have found to their cost that the trade unions now on every occasion will combine&mdash;I am talking about real trade unions&mdash;to fight an employer if a fight is on their hands.</P>
    <P>There has been comment on the grouping of unions.  These groups are in most cases doing pretty well, and while it might be very difficult to deal with 20 or 30 trade unions, if the groups act responsibly&mdash;and most of them do&mdash;the situation is very easy. There is an executive committee appointed to do the negotiating.  I would advise the Minister to examine the workings of one particular group, that is, the Bord na Móna group, who have been doing excellent work, who have practically wiped out strikes on the bogs, who have certainly wiped out unofficial strikes, who have carried out their negotiations most satisfactorily and who have a regulation that nobody can be sacked on the bog just by somebody going out and telling him, as was done before: &ldquo;You are finished; off you go.&rdquo; No matter what he does, he is suspended on pay until the matter is investigated.  That is the civilised way of doing it and has resulted in the building up of very good relations between the trade unions, the men who work on the bogs and their employers.</P>
    <P>That does not create any problem whatsoever, and if the Minister examines the workings of it, he will be very glad to find this solution is a lot easier than the solution of trying to persuade half a dozen trade unions who have an entirely different outlook on many things that they should all come together in one union and forget about their traditions.  One thing most of the trade unions in this country feel more than anything else is that they have got a tradition which they built themselves on which the people who went before them built and they are not prepared to relinquish it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the <Col N="666" /> necessity for redundancy pay for trade union officials.  The Minister is as well aware as I am that the big problem with many trade unions is that of getting good negotiators to take over from the old people who are moving on at retiral age.  He need have no worry about redundancy among trade union officials.  If there were to be a break up of unions, the greatest difficulty would be deciding who would get the skilled negotiators who would be on the loose as a result of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said the trade unions were the worst employers in the country.  I do not know how long he worked for a trade union.  I have worked for one for 20 years and I have more experience of trade union negotiations and administration than he has. I am perfectly satisfied the standard being set by the trade unions is one which the employers could very well follow.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to employment exchanges and what was to happen to them.  I understand they are remaining under the Department of Social Welfare, but would the Minister try to have some kind of list drawn up whereby people who go to an employment exchange will find that it is just that?  I am not aware of such a list except at one period of the year, that is, during the period when there is some kind of relief work going for those who have been unemployed for a long time.  The list is sent out from the employment exchange to the local authority or whoever is going to employ these people, and that is the only time a list of vacancies is ever drawn up at the exchange.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Minister is not aware of this, but at the present time there is a big build-up of unemployment in local authority work.  Again it is the old story: There is a shortage of money.  When there is a shortage of money, the county manager or the county engineer does not lose his job. It is the man who is getting £8 or £9 a week who is laid off, and a dozen of these have to be laid off to save somebody else's wages.</P>
    <P>In a number of counties not very far from Dublin, we have a situation <Col N="667" /> where whole areas are being closed down.  There are two or three men left just to keep the thing ticking over and the remainder of them are told there is no more employment for them.  When I was discussing this question with the Minister the other day, I said I could not understand why there should not be some co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare and the people responsible for employing these men, many of whom have big families and who would much prefer to be working for a full week.  These men are told there is no money available and they are paid £9 or £10 a week for a period of six months, on the condition that they do not do any work.  This does not make sense and the people affected by it do not think it makes sense.  There should be some attempt made to keep them in employment.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage this year, which has not been reached for many years, at which the permanent employees in local authorities&mdash;if you can call them permanent, men who have been employed there for a long number of years&mdash;are being laid off, and many of them will be unemployed at Christmas and possibly until next April or May.  There is no point in talking about improving labour relations or improving the conditions of workers as long as we find these people laid off when it comes to the winter, who have no guarantee of employment and who are just told they must go.</P>
    <P>In most local authorities, there is an arrangement whereby when people are being laid off, they are told a fortnight beforehand that the job is running out and, therefore, they get an opportunity of looking around, even if it is only to make arrangements at the employment exchange.  In the lower grades, that does not happen.  They are given their cards and told they are not wanted any longer.  Again, that is something which will have to be looked at if the Department of Labour is to achieve what it sets out to achieve.</P>
    <P>One other matter which is hardly the Minister's responsibility but in which he might possibly take an interest because it affects employment, is that every Christmas there is in <Col N="668" /> practically every town, in a few country areas and in the city, schemes known as the VEC, schemes which give employment over the Christmas period to people who have been a long time on the employment exchange, people who have not had work for a long time.  They get a few week's work before Christmas and at least they are able to buy a Christmas dinner.  It has become the practice over the years that these schemes are sanctioned later and later, and despite the fact that they are in the possession of the Board of Works, who are responsible for them, for many months, I am informed that notification has not yet gone out to the towns.  Therefore, as regards those people who hope to get a few weeks' work over the festive season, it looks as if this Christmas will come along and that they will have to live on what they get, as Deputy Dillon says, on the dole.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which the Minister may not be aware.  We hear talk of training and retraining. Following the introduction of the apprenticeship scheme some years ago, some of us were a little doubtful as to what the result would be for people whom we in the country tend to call &mdash;I do not know what they are called in the city&mdash;natural people, people who were not very good at book learning. Their fathers may have been carpenters or mechanics, or something like that, and the sons may have a natural aptitude for this work and could become craftsmen with very little training.  The effect of the apprenticeship scheme was to deprive these young boys of any chance of ever becoming craftsmen.</P>
    <P>On occasion, if there are no apprentices available, with their group certificate from the local technical school, they can be taken on; if not, they are completely out.  I know quite a number of these people and I am rather interested in the suggestion that the Department have envisaged a crash course which will turn out tradesmen in a very short time.  I do not know whether that has been cleared with the craft unions&mdash;I am not prepared to become involved in that at this stage&mdash; but I would be very interested to find <Col N="669" /> out what is intended or whether it will have any effect on this type of person.</P>
    <P>Within the past few years, in Navan town, a school of furniture was erected by the local vocational education committee. To run that school, apprentices were being brought out on what is known as block release from all over the town, quite a long journey.  It is under the Department of Education, but, because of the way the Minister himself or his Department would be affected by it, I should like to find out if he knows anything about this.  This year, Meath Vocational Education Committee were notified in March that their grants for the year would be £7,000 less than they were last year and in August of this year, they have been reduced by a further £3,000.  This has resulted, among other things, in having that school rendered inoperative and the system by which the apprentices were being taught the rudiments of their trade by experts is no longer in operation.</P>
    <P>The experts who were employed specially to teach them are now teaching ordinary woodwork in the halls and broken-down schools around the county.  They have gone out there because they were permanent employees of the Department and the unfortunates who were temporary and who were doing that type of work before had to be dismissed.  Perhaps the Minister might take an interest because I think the school cost £48,000 when it was built and I think he was Minister for Education at the time.  It is a bit thick to find this sort of thing happening while there is talk about an improvement in the facilities for training people, and so on.</P>

      <P>There was a reference by a Deputy tonight as to how strikes can be caused or encouraged by the slanting of news.  The Minister suggested that if he were the public relations officer for his Department, he would need to be very careful about this sort of thing.  I do not see any difficulty.  On a previous occasion in commenting on something, I said that I felt the press would usually give a fair-minded report on most things that happen here or elsewhere but occasionally have people who, in order to earn a few handy shillings, put in a story which is not quite the truth but is slanted in such a way as to appear as if it is a half-truth and eventually has caused to me and my union over the years a considerable amount of trouble.  The gentleman I was mainly referring to got a whole column in a Sunday newspaper afterwards, &ldquo;having a go&rdquo; at me.  He is welcome.  I hope he will get another few bob in &ldquo;having a go&rdquo; at me tonight.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to the Minister at the time he mentioned the legislation which he proposes to introduce&mdash;I would be glad if he would refer to it when replying&mdash;that he had given a guarantee to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that in one Bill there would be a section which would have the effect, to put it bluntly, of reversing the decision in what we call the Fitzpatrick judgment.  There was also, I understand, an arrangement by which both Bills were to be introduced together, but that was not so.  One was introduced in the House, and as I pointed out on the day it was introduced&mdash;I should have a copy of the Bill, if the Minister remembers it&mdash;there was in fact a clause in that Bill which prevented effectively, if accepted, any hope of a reversal by law in this House of the Fitzpatrick judgment.  I hope the Minister has not forgotten it.  He said at the time he was not aware that it was there or of the implications and that he would have it dealt with at the first opportunity.  I hope he has not forgotten about it.</P>

Whether he was aware of it or not, I hope the Minister does change the situation when it comes along because he probably has been told by Congress that they are dissatisfied about the whole thing, that somebody has attempted to make a fool of them in this case.</P>
      <P>Let me conclude as I started, by saying that I feel the Minister and his Department are providing something that has been required for many years and we wish them the very best of success.  I honestly believe that the way the Minister is going about this by having discussions with the various organisations will be a lot of help.  I was very interested to know if, in fact, he has some way of recording what is discussed because usually it is pretty difficult to keep in one's mind all the details passed across at such discussions. I was glad to know that within a very short time most of the suggestions which have been made by my organisation seemed to be travelling around via Agriculture, Lands, etc., all over the place, in great detail.</P>

O'Donnell who spoke before me, that is, that we have a habit in this House of Ministers, particularly the Minister for Transport and Power, saying that a strike was not the fault of the employers, particularly if the employer happens to be CIE.  I should like to remind the Minister that in very many cases the fault can be shared and in a lot of cases the fault is entirely with the management who have not got one clue about labour relations.</P>

    <P>The typical example of that is what happened in the case of the ESB strike.  It is the classical example which will be quoted inside and outside <Col N="672" /> this House for many years where a dispute was caused because something that was promised 12 months earlier, the question of investigation, was not carried out.  The group of employers in this case represented the public of this country.  I have a lot of sympathy with a private employer when he does something we consider tough, where it is his own money that is affected.  Here we had a group of employers representing the general public taking the decision that they would close down the whole ESB service and as can be proved, in some cases, ten minutes before the pickets went on, closed them down.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Dillon last night saying that the workers in this industry should not be allowed to kill people in hospitals and to cut off the current in the country.  I want to make it very clear that as far as the trade union movement is concerned, we are perfectly satisfied and will continue to claim, unless the Minister at the sworn inquiry can prove otherwise, that the fault for that ESB dispute lay solely with the Board of the ESB and that there is no share in that, that it was entirely with them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to make a success of his Department, he has to be careful about this sort of thing and has to make sure that employers, because they feel in a strong position, cannot blackmail workers to do something that they do not want to do.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused last night to hear Deputy Dillon say something which, indeed, he has said often before.  He stands absolutely, as did Deputy Donegan the other evening, for the right of free association of workers and the right of workers to take strike action and he believes all trade unionists are equal, only, like the old story, &ldquo;some are more equal than others&rdquo;.  After saying all that, he said he does not believe in the right of the ESB workers to take strike action.  I wonder how much further he would go if the situation arose and if the Government of the day brought a Bill into this House? Would we have the same reaction to <Col N="673" /> it by some of the Deputies as we had to the ESB Bill?  Would they say that everybody must have the right to strike except the one mentioned now, that, of course, they are not entitled to strike?</P>
    <P>We could list milk and bread, public transport and the public services, the ESB again, aircraft, shipping.  Where do we stop?  We are either right or wrong in saying that the workers of this country, as in any other free country, have the right to decide to withdraw their labour.  While it was said here last night that no Government could legislate to force people to work if they do not want to work, I want to make it clear that we believe in that.  We in the Labour Party believe that you cannot force people to work in any free democracy such as we have but when we say you cannot force them, we mean that you cannot force anybody, even the ESB workers, to go back to work if they feel they have a genuine grievance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew that, depending on what time I would be called on to reply, the speaker immediately before me would be dealing with some aspect of the work of my Department in regard to which I would have to answer.  Deputy James Tully brought us back to the ESB legislation.  I should like to point out for the hundredth time&mdash;I threatened at the time that I would keep contradicting those who said otherwise&mdash; that that legislation was not to take away the right to strike but to preserve the community's supply of electricity. It was only when a strike caused an interruption, or an imminent interruption, of electricity supplies, with the consequences we all learned of, that the Act would come into force.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also offered to the trade union movement&mdash;I think there have been discussions on it&mdash;to replace this legislation by an arrangement which would have the same effect.  I know it is not possible to have 100 per cent security against interruption <Col N="674" /> of supply, but this would be an agreed negotiated arrangement which would ensure a continuity of electricity supplies against interruption through dispute.  I would be very happy if we could so secure the community's electricity supplies and repeal the Act on the Statute Book; but I would have to be quite sure on behalf of the community that the alternative arrangement had the likelihood of being effective.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy said that in 12 months' time they would come back and examine what my Department had been doing.  I welcome that attitude.  The atmosphere now is quite different from the atmosphere that prevailed when the Taoiseach announced his intention of setting up the Department.  At that time we had a considerable degree of strife.  It was during the enactment of the particular legislation to which Deputy James Tully referred that the Taoiseach announced the setting up of the Department.  In a way I was sorry it was born at that time because it gave the impression to people that the sole purpose of the Department was to take part in industrial relations. But it is obvious now in this calmer atmosphere that the House has a wide understanding of the functions of the Department and where it fits in on the main canvas of our economic life.</P>
      <P>I am happy to record, too&mdash;this is something we may wish to look back on&mdash;that in this calm atmosphere nobody is shouting at me to hurry up with the legislation.  No one is calling on me to do something, whatever the &ldquo;something&rdquo; may be.  Nobody is saying the Government should step in. All Deputies have now realised what exactly goes on when employer and employees negotiate over wages.  It is a matter between the two of them. The State comes in only in certain circumstances and in certain ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the Department, I want to stress that it is widely based and not just designed to deal with industrial relations.  Deputies mentioned other Departments of Labour. Any literature I have read on other Departments of Labour says that you <Col N="675" /> cannot separate the functions of the Department of Labour from the functions of other Government Departments. Tonight we had mention of the Department of Education in regard to training and adaptation tests.  Of course, there is the link with the Department of Industry and Commerce. The supply of jobs is still largely in the hands of agencies of this Department, such as the IDA and An Foras Tionscal.  People setting up industries in countries outside their own are seeking trained, skilled labour.  We can attract them by having such skilled labour available here. This will be much more important in the eyes of industrialists than any of the grants or tax concessions we can give them.  The Minister and the Department of Labour can help in the provision of jobs&mdash;somebody asked where the jobs would come from&mdash;but the main function in promoting industrialisation remains with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The first purpose in mind when we set up the Department was to get everybody in the community concerned with management-employee relations to take a lot more interest in the problem.  Despite the setting up of the Department, the preparation of redundancy schemes, schemes of training and schemes for taking care of the worker in his place of employment, I do not intend that employers should withdraw from their responsibility, not only to implement the law my inspectors will see after, but to do much more in protecting workers in their place of employment from accident and disease.  No employer can withdraw from his responsibility to bring a sense of security to workers, who, in particular industries which may be threatened, may feel that their jobs might disappear.  While we in this House may legislate in respect of redundancy and training, we should insist that employers help their workers to face the future securely without having to worry about whether their jobs will disappear or not.</P>
    <P>The main purposes of the Department are, firstly, to protect the worker <Col N="676" /> in his place of employment against disease or injury; secondly, to help the worker feel secure against future changes by having provisions made for the economic and technical changes which must occur; and thirdly, the function to assist in regard to industrial relations.  There is, however, one other area of activity of the Department I want to stress, that is, to do what Deputy Tully talked about: to search out and find areas where there are problems, where people can help us to bring labour and management together, to find out why people think there are different classes.  Deputy Dillon last night denied that there were classes.  He was thinking in terms of the classes which existed in our neighbouring country.  We know what the other Deputies mean when they talk about classes.  There are people who have more than others.  At the same time, Deputy Tully will have to recognise that if he tries to satisfy the people, even within his own area of influence, that they should all be equal, he will find a great deal of trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot compare the extremes of society.  You have to face the fact that, even in groups which might be called lower paid by Deputy Tully, the relationships of one worker to another are disturbed with great difficulty and often with bad consequences. I think I was the first to say &mdash;I said it last Christmas before this Department was set up&mdash;that I did not believe legislation was the way to solve our industrial relations problem.  I did not say that legislation was not needed; I said that legislation was not enough. I find that the main speakers here are in agreement with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the advice from all Parties to be slow in this legislation.  I welcome the understanding in the House that, in this area of wages, there is a conflict going on in the economic arena.  We have to understand the function of the State and where the State comes into that conflict.  I have said often enough that I believe the function <Col N="677" /> of the State is to help to set up machinery which will give assistance to both sides to come to agreement if they cannot negotiate agreement among themselves.  To help to do that, we already have in existence the Labour Court which is in two main parts.  There is the Labour Court itself which investigates and makes recommendations which many people think are decisions in law but which are not decisions in law.  Deputy Ryan is quite wrong to say it is an arbitration board; it can act as an arbitration board but its more normal function is to make recommendations. Then there is the other part of the Labour Court, which is the conciliation service.  When Deputies were recounting the great successes of the Labour Court, I think they put together the successes of the conciliation court and of the Labour Court itself.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that, in recent times, the main bulk of the recommendations have been accepted: recently, the bulk of them have not been accepted.  The function of the Government is to try to improve this Court and this conciliation service. This is a matter of free collective bargaining.  I tried in my introductory speech on this Estimate to induce Deputies to think on this question of free collective bargaining because once you leave it to free collective bargaining, you are depending on both sides, employer and employee, to have regard to the interests of the country in general, the other members of the public.  The only way the Government can act while you have this free collective bargaining is by giving information.</P>
    <P>The second function of the Government is the giving of information to people engaged in the bargaining process, on the position in the economy, the prospects in the economy and the possible effects of badly-made bargains. If the people at the bargaining table ignore the Government&mdash;and they have a perfect right to do so&mdash;there is nothing we can do about it.  This is what Deputy Dillon spoke about when he was talking about freedom.  There is one aspect of freedom to which he <Col N="678" /> did not refer.  When Deputy Dillon referred to losing your freedom, he was obviously thinking in terms of dependency on another nation but you can also lose your freedom by the laws you make yourself and by the way you abuse liberty as it is.  If there is any risk to our freedom, it is from our own behaviour rather than from any risk of becoming dependent on another State.</P>
    <P>On the question of producing legislation, I have been engaged on this for some time as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When I took up that office, I found that all my predecessors over the years had found defects and were concerned about the defects in the law and at times were very concerned about undesirable trends in actual practice.  I discovered that every one of them had had discussions with two groups, the employers and the trade union movement, to see if desired improvements could be achieved and correctives applied.  In accordance with the thinking of this Government and of previous Governments, my predecessors left the initiatives to the trade union movement and to the employer interests, to the two groups involved in this free negotiation process.  In the first place, my immediate predecessor had indicated, at meetings with both groups, areas in which they could consider producing suggestions for improvement for him.  This has always been the case.  Different Governments and different Ministers have recognised that it is between the two groups to produce solutions because they are best aware of the problems.  The files I inherited show that no proposals were forthcoming, despite repeated specific invitations from the Ministers.  No proposals were put to me either and I invited them several times, also.</P>
    <P>Against that background of waiting for the people involved&mdash;the experts, somebody called them; I was told to listen to the experts&mdash;against the silence of the experts and knowing that improvements were needed and everybody knowing, I think, that improvements were needed, I drew up my own proposals and circulated them as a basis for discussion.  I think <Col N="679" /> most Deputies will realise that what I am interested in are the results, not in the type of legislation, not in what I produce; I am interested in the results we achieve, not in the means by which we achieve them.  I am prepared to listen to suggestions that will achieve these results and, if they achieve them more effectively than my proposals would, I shall be very happy indeed.</P>

Certainly, however, I see it is necessary to have this consultation.  I think the Deputy will allow that I have been very patient since the first day I invited suggestions from people along the lines indicated by my predecessor.  I do not intend to become impatient unnecessarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The only accusation against me is that I have been dragging my feet but it was not that but, rather, doing my best to find as wide an area of agreement as possible.</P>
      <P>I come now to the area of the new Department's activities in relation to the workers in their place of work.  I said when introducing this Estimate that I am having a review of the inspectorate to estimate if it is adequate to our needs.  Many of the questions raised by Deputies will be answered when I have information from this review.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may correct the record of today?  It is a matter of detail.  Deputy O'Leary asked me, in a supplementary question, for particulars as to the number of safety committees available.  He asked me if I had sent or had them sent to the trade unions, and I said they were published.  The information is not in the published report.  It is available to me.  I will see if this type of information will be of any assistance towards stimulating the setting-up of these committees.  Deputy Mullen is very insistent that the responsibility should be with management or with me in the setting up of the committees but the legislation leaves this initiative with the workers.  Perhaps I may quote from the Factories Act handbook at page 19, under the heading &ldquo;Safety Committees&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Where the persons employed in a factory have formed a safety committee for the purpose of promoting their better safety, health and welfare the following provisions apply:</P>
      <P>(a)  The occupier shall be entitled to be represented at each meeting of the Committee by at least one person nominated by him.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Committee shall assist in securing compliance with the provisions of the Act in the Factory.</P>
      <P>(c)  The occupier and Committee shall consider any representations made by the one to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> (d)  The Committee may appoint a safety delegate who may, on the instructions of the Committee, make representations to an Inspector.</P>
    <P>(e)  An Inspector may, at his discretion, have the safety delegate accompany him on all or part of his tour of the factory.</P>
    <P>(f)  The occupier shall note in the general register the establishment of the safety committee and the name of the safety delegate, if any.</P>
    <P>I tried to clarify for Deputies today that there are laws with which employers will have to comply and it is the job of my inspectorate to see that they comply with these laws.  I invited them to seek the advice of this inspectorate.  I also said, and I repeat, that if they are in breach of the law, they will be prosecuted.  On the other hand, no employer can do everything to protect the safety of his workers. The co-operation of almost every worker is necessary and that is why I would encourage the workers' representatives, the trade unions and the workers themselves to take the initiative in setting up safety committees. If they have any trouble in doing so, I will be glad to assist, in particular cases where I hear of the reason why they are having trouble doing so.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the number of female inspectors.  I think there is a misapprehension here: people felt there should be a lady inspector where there are mainly female workers.  But it is the place of work that is inspected and not the employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that; we were not suggesting anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the qualifications required are not always common to the opposite sex.  Much of the work of the inspectorate would be in areas which could not easily be done by a woman, so that the area of their activities would be quite limited.  But in the actual recruitment competitions advertised this year, there was no applicant from the gentle sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="682" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We contended it was not sufficient to say there was no applicant just waiting; we thought it should be the policy to look for female inspectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the way we differed today, because my information is that the male inspectorate can do the work, even in factories which are employing mainly women workers. I am prepared to have a look at it, because somebody&mdash;I think it was Deputy Mullen&mdash;said he worked in a factory where there were, predominantly, female workers and he felt there was a need for an inspector of the same sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to the security of a worker in this time of change.  The past ten years have brought a great deal of change and much change has been for the better. We can look forward to further changes in the future.  If we are afraid of it, it will submerge us, because there will be technological and social changes.  Employers should be busy now reassuring their workers and taking whatever steps are necessary to reassure their workers.  But we are preparing the State's part in this, in the industrial training legislation.  The House has already discussed the Second Stage of the Industrial Training Bill and many of the points raised by Deputies as problems would be dealt with by an industrial training body such as it is intended to set up under the Bill.  I intended from the beginning that, after the Second Stage, the different Parties would be consulted. This has been done: there have been meetings and there will be some amendments arising out of these meetings. It is hoped that we will be able to go ahead soon with the Committee Stage, having had useful consultations with the people representative of those who will be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The redundancy legislation has involved a great deal of consultation <Col N="683" /> and I would ask those who feel I am going too slowly to believe that I could have had it here long ago, were I to act on my own without consulting with the people concerned.  But I think Deputies now agree that we should have as wide consultations as possible with the people concerned.  This has been done, and legislation is being drafted as a matter of urgency.  It is complicated legislation which will take some time to draft but it will be in the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the question of other aspects of our work, the employment exchanges are to be part of my Department. There was an original decision that the work of this Department should be attached to the Department of Social Welfare, but, in the setting up of this Department, the employment exchanges were taken over.  It will be a function of the Department of Labour to make these exchanges operate as places where a man can go to be advised of where he can get work and an employer can go to seek a trained employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>On the question of career guidance, it is my intention that this will be provided by the Employment Service which came under the control of my Department on 3rd October of this year.  As a first step, I have decided to employ an industrial psychologist and he or she will be recruited through the Civil Service Commission in the near future.  The responsibility of the psychologist will be the development of guidance work in the Employment Service.  Again, the psychologist will have to work in close liaison with the guidance service for schools being operated by the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that point, somebody asked about aptitude tests as part of the new scheme of education&mdash;to have aptitude tests and courses over a period of three years for students going through <Col N="684" /> this post-primary three-year course, so that a student will be assessed by his teacher, by a psychologist from the Department of Education and by his own performance and achievements. Therefore, on finishing the comprehensive course at intermediate level, any student and his parents will have a real idea of where his aptitude lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to have enough psychologists.  My Department also has responsibility for providing information about careers for use by employment services and by education authorities who have an interest in advising children and school-leavers and their parents about the available employment opportunities.  We have been making a study of the work already done in this field in other countries, and we have got a fair amount of material from other countries through the post.  It will not be necessary for anyone to travel abroad to get the information that is available. We intend to have the fullest possible range of information available, and within a short space of time to provide pamphlets covering all the different <Col N="685" /> types of occupations in industry, commerce, agriculture, the professions, and so on.  It will be a formidable task and I have some doubt whether the resources at present available to us would make it possible to give a full and adequate service in this way, so I am considering an alternative way in which this work might be expedited.  I have not ruled out the possibility of enlisting the aid of the various professional and other organisations interested in this type of work.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of outside agencies and other organisations.  I should like to correct the impression which some Deputies have that outside agencies meant agencies outside the country.  It means agencies outside the Department of Labour but within the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones raised the question of doing away with the conciliation and arbitration schemes where they now exist and asked was this the proposal. Some of the proposals which we sent out were a means of starting discussions. Schemes of conciliation and arbitration can be changed only by negotiations between the parties.  It is intended that there will be negotiations between the parties who now have conciliation and arbitration schemes to try to find new methods of dealing with the problems of conciliation and arbitration.</P>

      <P>I have already announced several times that the conciliation service of the Labour Court will be strengthened, if necessary, and as necessary.  Many Deputies asked for this and it is one of the things which we decided early on should be done.  It is also intended to have an early warning system operated and I hope employers and trade unions who may see trouble in the offing will avail of this service and so prevent troubles from coming to the boil.</P>
      <P>In relation to the actual recommendations of the Court which I spoke of a while ago, of the last 91 recommendations, 59 were rejected.  I did not have that figure when I was saying Deputies were not quite accurate when they stated that the vast majority of the recommendations are accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I see what the Deputy means&mdash;claims made under the 1964 <Col N="687" /> National Agreement.  They were actual claims to be decided.</P>
      <P>I am going through my notes of the points raised by Deputies.  I have answered many of them, and many are overlapping.  Someone asked about An Cheard Comhairle, the Apprenticeship Board.  It will be merged with An Chomhairle Tréanála which will be an autonomous statutory body and will have the same relationship to the Department of Labour as An Cheard Comhairle, which is also an autonomous body, has to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The question of helping the trade unions to amalgamate was raised. Introducing this Estimate, I said:</P>
      <P>There may be limits to the extent to which the Government can effectively help the trade unions in this work at this time but I am certainly willing to sit down with the responsible representatives of the movement to work out how the Government could provide useful assistance to trade unions in overcoming the formidable problems, financial and otherwise, standing in the way of rationalisation and reorganisation.</P>
      <P>Deputies can be assured that if there is any help I can give towards the rationalisation of the trade unions, I will give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of equal pay for what has been called equal work was raised.  I answered this in the Dáil as reported in column 2055 on Question No. 37 on 24th May last.  I said that the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 100 provides expressly that this principle may be applied by means of national laws or regulations, legally established or recognised machinery for wage determination, collective agreements between employers and workers or a combination of these various means. The normal method employed in wage negotiations in Ireland is that of free collective bargaining.  Before taking a decision on the possibility of ratifying Convention No. 100, I said <Col N="688" /> that the Government should have regard to the trend in free, collective bargaining in the direction of equal pay and that, having regard to the general existing pay structures, it would not be appropriate for us to ratify the Convention at this time. That is still my attitude to that problem. Other countries have set out to achieve this but I do not know if they have made any marked progress.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat for Deputies what I said earlier on the main work in the Department at the moment and I shall do this by way of summary. Firstly there is legislation on industrial relations, and discussions on this matter are proceeding with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisations. Secondly, there is amending legislation on trade union law.  On this matter also, discussions are proceeding and the matters referred to by Deputy James Tully in this connection will be part of the discussions and the Dáil will later have an opportunity of dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is a review of the organisation and staffing of the conciliation services.  Fourthly, there is a review of the organisation and staffing of the factory inspectorate and fifthly, of the employment services in centres throughout the country.  This involves a review of organisation and staffing of these services.  Sixthly, there is a review of all legislation on the Statute Book going back for a long time. Seventhly, the Industrial Training Bill is being reviewed by a working party and I hope to have the Committee Stage in the House during this session. Eighthly, the Redundancy Payments and Resettlement Allowances Bill is being redrafted.  Ninthly, the manpower policy forecasting service is being organised.  I referred in my opening statement to the difficulties involved here and I hope to have the service set up in the new year.</P>
    <P>The tenth item is the question of the information officer.  He will be appointed shortly.  I do not know why Deputies should feel that such an official, even before he is appointed, would be used to slant anything.  We should have more faith in the integrity <Col N="689" /> of our fellow countrymen and not suspect them even before they are appointed.  The appointment in this case will be made through the Civil Service Commission.  The eleventh matter is the setting up of a research service to develop relations with international organisations, with particular reference to the EEC.  Finally, there will be special arrangements to facilitate the formulation of new approaches and new initiatives in the labour and manpower fields.  In this respect I should welcome any suggestion which will help the work of the Department and make it a success.  It is obvious from what Deputies have said that this is the desire of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks on this Estimate, I brought to the Minister's notice a number of problems in relation to the CIE workshops at Inchicore in order to give him an insight into the situation that exists there.  I indicated in my statement that I would welcome criticism and suggestion that might lead to harmony and I concluded on this note:</P>
      <P>The situation needs investigation. It has caused irritation and destroyed the happy situation which existed formerly at Inchicore.  It is not now a happy place to work and labour relations are bad.</P>
      <P>I noticed in the <i>Irish Times</i> of yesterday a statement by the Chairman of CIE, Mr. Hogan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>He said there were about 2.9 million people in Ireland and of these 22,000 are working for CIE.  He said we should subtract that number from the total population and we would get the number of people who think they can run CIE, &ldquo;including the characters in the Dáil who can't even run themselves.&rdquo; This type of insult to Deputies should not be tolerated and will not be tolerated, whether it comes from the Chairman of CIE or the chairman of any other board.  The Minister responsible will have to take the necessary action to ensure that diabolical statements of that kind are not issued by people who show themselves to be irresponsible.</P>

      <P>There are decent, honest men in this House who make honest contributions in order to assist. I pointed out many of the problems that exist at Inchicore and I am prepared to substantiate them in any way the Minister desires, by sworn statements, if necessary.  Then one finds one is insulted by the Chairman of CIE who speaks of &ldquo;characters in the Dáil who cannot run themselves&rdquo;. This is a very serious matter and one <Col N="691" /> that must be tackled.  If the Minister does not tackle it, I will tackle it in my own way.  I will get satisfaction. I will not stand for anyone making insulting remarks of this kind.  If we are to be shackled with some thing by the Chairman of CIE or any other chairman, every single statement made in this House should be examined to ensure that the statements made are accurate.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that every statement I made was completely accurate. I challenge the Chairman of CIE, the Minister or anyone else to come to CIE on any occasion and I will lead him to the men and to the corners and they can find out for themselves. We cannot stand for this type of nonsense.</P>

    <P>There are many factors I could mention in relation to the situation which exists in Inchicore but I should not like to bore the Minister.  However, I can undertake on any occasion to accompany him without any members <Col N="693" /> of the Board of CIE, into the holes and corners and meet the personnel so that he can get a true picture of the whole matter.  Possibly that man was misled by some of the stories he has been told in relation to the situation in Inchicore.  The situation there is not good; in fact, it is getting worse.

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall go on to some of the other points.  I probably will not complete my statement tonight and for that reason I want to go a little further into the Minister's report. I notice that at the end of the report the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discussions with CIE on rail fare trends on a general basis.  I have criticised the management for not considering at an earlier date family fares.  I have pressed for experiments in reduced fares in the off-peak season.  I have made known <Col N="694" /> any constructive criticism offered in the Dáil during debates.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know somebody is making suggestions to them.  Probably the Minister is the only person they will listen to.  He went into great detail in relation to the situation as it exists in the city at the moment regarding the difficulties of the public transport services and the amount of blockage that exists at the moment in the city which is caused by private cars.  I would like to say&mdash;I have said this on many occasions before&mdash;that the people who are responsible, in the main, for the congestion in Dublin are CIE themselves.  A person who wants to travel from Ballyfermot, Bluebell or any of the other outlying areas to destinations within a mile or two must travel into the centre of the city because CIE say so.  There are no perimeter routes and no routes from one of those areas to another.  Those people must go into the centre of the city first and get another bus to their destinations.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why, if CIE want to relieve the situation in the city at present, a bus could not go from Ballyfermot to Walkinstown to Bluebell and right through to Dun Laoghaire and so permit people who want to go to one of those places to get there without having to go into the centre of the city.  They could get to Dun Laoghaire or any of the other places on that route at a much cheaper rate.  This would avoid a great deal of the inconvenience we now find in the city centre which is irritating people living in the perimeter areas.  These are the people who pay the high bus fares.  They have to dig down into their pockets because they must go into the centre of the city.  If this is the way the city bus services are to be made to pay, there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>I have made numerous representations regarding this to CIE but they pay no attention to me.  Somebody will have to take it on to himself to do something.  We want a realistic bus service in Dublin.  We want a service which will serve the people, not CIE alone.  The people I represent are daily taken into the centre of the city, <Col N="695" /> when they do not want to go into O'Connell Street or College Green, in order to get to their destinations. Surveys have been carried out from time to time of the bus services in Dublin but I have never seen anything done to help the people in the perimeter areas.  There are concessions for the people in the central city area. The ladies going for cups of coffee travel at reduced rates while old age pensioners, unemployed persons and other people travelling to the labour exchange and to the post office are passed by empty buses.  They cannot pay the substantial fares from Ballyfermot and Kilmainham while there is a special concession fare for the privileged classes in the centre of the city.  There is a worker's ticket at a reduced rate to and from Dun Laoghaire. Why is a special privilege given to a certain section of the community? Those who should get a reduction are the working class people of this city, the backbone of the city.</P>
    <P>CIE should do something to alleviate traffic jamming in the city area.  Is there any reason why the Dun Laoghaire bus should go into the city centre? There is no reason why it should not stop at Merrion Square and thus relieve the congestion around Westland Row and other areas.  A city service should be devised to carry people to their destinations.  There is no reason why that could not be used some distance from O'Connell Bridge. One would think everyone wants to go to O'Connell Bridge.  This will have to be abolished.  We must examine the worker's problem and CIE can alleviate their distress in this regard.</P>
    <P>If CIE plays its part, I am sure the motorists can be induced to play their part too.  At the moment people are forced to go into the city centre, as it is much cheaper to use a car to go to one's employment in an area adjacent to where one lives than to travel by CIE.  It is very unfair that the workingclass people of this city, living on the outskirts, should be required to pay a double subsidy.  They pay more than an economic price travelling on the buses and they also have to pay <Col N="696" /> by way of taxation.  It is fair enough meeting the situation one way but let there be equity: let the burden fall on the shoulders of each and every person in the city to the same degree.</P>
    <P>I fear this is a serious situation. Dublin city bus services pay their way and make a profit.  There is no reason why those who avail of the services elsewhere should not shoulder some of the responsibility and take some of the burden from the backs of the citizens of Dublin, particularly in the workingclass areas.  Other people have big motor cars or can travel by bus to other areas but it is the working-classes who are paying through the nose.  CIE will have to bring forward a realistic scheme and I would impress upon the Minister the necessity for perimeter services in the city.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister has asked the Chairman of CIE to consider approaching Congress with a view to formulating a long-term agreement along the lines of the Aer Lingus agreement that will give a feeling of stability and confidence to the workers.  Before any agreement can be concluded, there must be contented workers.  An all-out effort should be made to obviate any dissension and unrest there may be.  Otherwise, you are paying a price for a time.  That is no long-term solution and we want a long-term solution in public transport.</P>
    <P>There is efficiency in many sectors of CIE but I am mainly concerned with the workers at Inchicore and with the position in the railway workshops. I have said enough about the fares and the bus services that are jamming up the centre city area but I would say that the existing situation should be examined so that any elements that are suitable and satisfactory will be maintained and improved upon and the unsatisfactory elements cast aside, before a large-scale change is embarked upon which completely disrupts personnel who have been in the railway services for 20 or 30 years.  It takes time to attune oneself to a new situation and I would impress upon the Minister that contentment is necessary before any long-term agreement can be entered into.  This can be brought about in a <Col N="697" /> short time with reasonable thinking and a proper approach to the existing problems.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister.  I have listened here over the years to abuse being hurled at his head and it is regrettable also that reference has been made in the course of the speeches of other Deputies to the former Chairman of CIE and to other aspects that are really outside the limits of the discussion.</P>

      <P>Many improvements have been brought about and, as I have said, there is efficiency in many <Col N="698" /> sectors of the service.  That efficiency was not brought about by the previous Chairman.  Much of the efficiency that exists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;other sectors&rdquo;.  It is quite obvious that the Deputy is not aware of the magnitude of the situation that exists in the various departments.  These interruptions are ineffective.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude on the question of the wage agreement with which I thoroughly agree and I congratulate the Minister on having taken the initiative in this regard.</P>
      <P>I would say in relation to Inchicore that this is a matter which should be carefully examined in order to ensure that harmony exists before there can be industrial peace on a long-term basis.  It cannot work out if the workers are not content.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
